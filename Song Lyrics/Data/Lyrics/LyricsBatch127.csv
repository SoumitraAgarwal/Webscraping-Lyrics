Frank Sinatra,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart",That Old Feeling
Frank Sinatra,"Way down among Brazilians
Coffee beans grow by the billions
So they've got to find those extra cups to fill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil

You can't get cherry soda 
'Cause they've got to fill that quota
And the way things are I'll bet they never will
They've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil

No tea or tomato juice
You'll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no

The politician's daughter
Was accused of drinking water
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil

You date a girl and find out later 
She smells just like a percolator
Her perfume was made right on the grill
Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil

And when their ham and eggs need savor
Coffee ketchup gives 'em flavor
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil

So your lead to the local color
Serving coffee with a cruller
Dunking doesn't take a lot of skill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil",The Coffee Song
Frank Sinatra,"I wish that we could live up in the sky
Where we could find a place away up high
Live among the stars, the sun, the moon
Just you and I

East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Near to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night

We'll live in a lovely way dear
Living our love and pale moonlight
Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way

Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
East of the sun and west of the moon",East of the Sun (West of the Moon)
Frank Sinatra,"I weave with brightly colored strings
To keep my mind off other things
So, ladies, let your fingers
dance
And keep your hands out of romance

Lovely witches
Let the stitches
Keep your fingers under
control
Cut the thread, but leave
The whole heart whole

Merry maids can sew and sleep
Wives can only
sew and weep
Falling in love with love
Is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love
Is
playing the fool

Caring too much is juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just
For children in school
I
fell in love with love one night
When the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes
Unable to see

I fell
in love with love
With love everlasting
But love fell out with me",Falling in Love With You
Frank Sinatra,"I got a gal who's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love her
Yes I love her

I'm gonna walk right up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
Ã¢??Cause I want her
I'm gonna ask her

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Way you're acting lately makes me doubt
Youse is still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

A woman is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of what you'll find 
She's gone and made a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true",Is You or Is You Ain't
Frank Sinatra,"If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee, what a thrill each time I kiss her
I've got a terrible case 
On Nancy with the laughin' face

She takes the winter and makes it summer
But summer could take some lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughin' face

Have you ever heard mission bells ringin'?
Well, she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks, you would think it was singin'
Just hear her say hello

I swear to goodness you can't resist her
Sorry for you, she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy with the laughin' face

Keep Betty Grable, Lamour, and Turner
She makes my heart a charcoal burner
It's heaven when I embrace 
My Nancy with the laughin' face",Nancy
Frank Sinatra,"No love, no nothin'.

I'm just about as solitary
As anyone could be
Of course my life is not so merry
But that's alright with me

No love, no nothin',
Until my baby comes home,
No sir! No nothin',
As long as baby must roam,
I promised him I'd wait for him
Till even Hades froze,
I'm lonesome, Heaven knows,
But what I said still goes,

No love, no nothin',
And that's a promise I'll keep,
No fun with no one,
I'm getting plenty of sleep
My heart's on strike
And though it's like an empty honeycomb,
No love, no sir! No nothin',
Till my baby comes home

My heart's on strike
And though it's like an empty honeycomb,
No love, no sir! No nothin',
Till my baby comes home

No Sir, I'm waiting
Till my baby comes home.","No Love, No Nothing"
Frank Sinatra,"The one I love belongs to somebody else
She means her tender songs for somebody else
And even when I have my arms around her

I know her thoughts are strong for somebody else
The hands I held belong to somebody else
I'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else

It's tough to be alone on the shelf
It's worse to fall in love by yourself
The one I love belongs to somebody else
The one I love belongs to somebody else",The One I Love Belongs to Somebody Else
Frank Sinatra,"Put your dreams away for another day
And I will take their place in your heart
Wishing on a star never got you far
And so it's time to make a new start

When your dreams at night
Fade before you
Then I'll have the right
To adore you

Let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling
And put all your dreams away

When your dreams at night
Fade before you
Then I'll have the right
To adore you

Let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling
And put all your dreams away",Put Your Dreams Away
Frank Sinatra,"You've seen him up and down the avenue
And now he's wearing the navy blue
She had a tear in the corner of her eye
As he said his last goodbye

Shoo, shoo, baby
Shoo, sh-sh, baby
Bye, bye, bye baby
Your papa's off to the seven seas

Do-on't cry baby
Do-on't sigh baby
Bye, bye, bye baby
When I come back we'll live a life of ease

Seems kinda tough now
To say goodbye this way
But papa's gotta be rough now
So that he can be sweet to you another day

Do-on't cry baby
Shoo, shoo, shoo baby

Frank Sinatra,"Why can't you behave? Oh why can't you behave?
After all the things you told me
And those promises that you gave
Oh, why can't you behave?

Why can't you be good and do just as you should?
Won't you turn that new leaf over
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

There's a farm I know near my old home town
Where we two can go and try settling down
There I'll care for you forever
Cause you're all in the world I crave

But baby, why can't you behave?
I said,""I'll care for you forever""
Cause you're all in the world I crave
But why, why can't you behave? Baby I'm all confused",Why Can't You Behave
Frank Sinatra,"Here's a dance you should know
When the lights are down low
Grab your baby, then go

Do the hucklebuck
Do the hucklebuck
If you don't know how to do it
Boy, you're out of luck
Push your partner out
Then you hunch your back
Start a little movement in your sacroilliac
Wiggle like a snake, waddle like a duck
That's the way you do it when you do the Hucklebuck

Ev'rybody's looking for a-somethin' new
It could be cars, it could be clothes
Or just a stylish shoe
But if you like your dancin'
Better take my tip
Get set, warn the band and let 'er rip

You go a little to the left
A little to the right
Get hold of your partner
Tell him, ""No need to fight""
Push your partner round
And then you hunch your back
Start your movement in your sacroilliac
Wiggle like a snake and then you waddle like a duck
And that's the way you gotta do it when you do the Hucklebuck

There you go
You got it now
It's the Hucklebuck!",The Huckle-Buck
Frank Sinatra,"Come out, come out wherever you are,
I know, I know you're not very far!
How I wish you'd hurry,

Hoping you'll appear,
Where are you, dear?

Frank Sinatra,"I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please:

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin"" Too ra lay

Time to say, ""Fair thee well!"";
Let the taps tell you all
That my heart dare not tell.

With your eyes in the stars of Old Glory,
Can I help but be faithful to you?
Till we meet on the day we're dreaming of,

I got a little story I think you oughtta know

We're drinking my friend
To the end of a brief episode
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

I know the routine
Put another nickel in that there machine
I'm feeling so bad
Won't you make the music easy and sad

I could tell you a lot
But you gotta to be true to your code
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

Frank Sinatra,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

The same old hoodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And, darling, I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine

Frank Sinatra,"You have loved lots of girls in the sweet long-ago
And each has meant heaven to you
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn
And have sworn to them all you'd be true
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune,
Then you've left her to hunt a new game.
Does it ever occur to you later my boy, that she's prob'ly doing the same?
If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue,
Just imagine the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed
But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear,
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.
I wonder who's kissing her now, I wonder who's teaching her how,
I wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies.
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine.
I wonder if she ever tells him of me, I wonder who's kissing her now.",I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now

And with each beam, the same old dream

Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

And did it my way",My Way [#][*]

Frank Sinatra,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you",Why Was I Born
Frank Sinatra,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, and maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless I'm in Love with You
Frank Sinatra,"I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses at the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em
I'm gonna smile and say ""I hope that you're much better""
And then I'll close the way I do

I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe that it came from you
I'm gonna smile and say ""I hope that you're much better""

That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare

And I've got no defense for it

What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what you're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Frank Sinatra,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Frank Sinatra,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part

No one ever said it would be so hard

Frank Sinatra,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide",White Christmas (W/Bing Crosby)

Stay with me, sway with me

Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how

When I awake I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view

When there it is, day in-day out?

And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out, I faced it all
And I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes it was my way",My Way [DVD]

And the song that I sing is of moonlight.
I stand and I wait
For the touch of your hand in the June night.
The roses are sighing a moonlight serenade.

The stars are aglow.
And tonight how their light sets me dreaming.
My love, do you know
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you, and I sing you a moonlight serenade.

In love's valley of dreams.
Just you and I, a summer sky,
A heavenly breeze, kissin' the trees.

Frank Sinatra,"The summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds they have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind

Frank Sinatra,"I got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.
I got no car,
Got no mule,
Got no misery
Folks with plenty of plenty
They got a lock on the door
Afraid somebody?s gonna rob them while
they're out making more
What for?
I got no lock on the door
that's no way to be
They can steal the rug
From the floor
that's OK with me
Cause the things that I prize
Like the stars in the sky

Are all free
Say I've got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.

Frank Sinatra,"It's very clear
Our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but ever and a day
The radio

And the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go
But oh my dear

Together we're going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble

They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay

I'll tell you no lie

How high is the sky? 
How many times in a day 
Do I think of you? 
How many roses are 
Sprinkled with dew? 

How far would I travel 
Just to be where you are?

I thought you cared about me, where are you
Where's my heart, where is the dream we started
I can't believe we're parted, where are you

When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending, where are you

Like lonely tears through misty eyes
Rain streaming down my face
Brings memories my heart cannot erase

Here alone in all my sorrows
Waiting for the clouds to hurry by
Praying that a new tomorrow
Will put the sun back in the sky

Rain wash away my tears
So when that sun appears
I'll see my love again

Here alone in all my sorrows

Frank Sinatra,"For it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
And the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And I haven't got time for the waiting game

And the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you

And the days dwindle down to a precious few

And these few precious days I'll spend with you

It's gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love

We're on the road to romance, that's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along the way

To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
Cause nice and easy does it every time",Nice N' Easy
Frank Sinatra,"Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting?

It spells the thrill of first-knighting

My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping,
Longer than always is a long long time, but far beyond forever you're gonna be mine.
I know I've never lived before and my heart is very sure,

Lingering sunset, stay a little longer with the lonely sea

Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

But, thanks for the memory
Of every touch a thrill, I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot, you loved me not and still
I miss you so much

Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu, away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching, too

I know it's a fallacy
That grown men never cry, baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die
And thank you so much",Thanks For the Memory
Frank Sinatra,"I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course, I do
But I get along without you very well

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store? should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring
But I should never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two","I Get Along Without You Very Well [Live At the Golden Nugget, Las Vegas"

Frank Sinatra,"A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of march that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer? 
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people

Still it's uncomfortably near

Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old Devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all of you people

Frank Sinatra,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

It's gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love

Frank Sinatra,"A foggy day
In London town
It had me low
And it had me down
I viewed the morning
With much alarm
The British Museum
Had lost its charm
How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles
It hadnÂ´t past
And suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere",A Foggy Day [Live]
Frank Sinatra,"Look at yourself, if you had a sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band
Look at yourself, do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand?
Since you took it right on the chin
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a-jumble
I sit around and sadly mumble
Fools rush in, so here I am
Very glad to be unhappy
I can't win, but here I am
More than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad
Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy
But oh, so glad",Glad to Be Unhappy [Live]
Frank Sinatra,"I've got you under my skin
I have got you, deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I'd tried so, not to give in
And I said to myself this affair it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well 
That I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night 
And repeats, repeats in my ear

Don't you know, you fool
You never can win 
Use your mentality 
Wake up to reality 
And each time I do just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin 
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice comes in the night

That comes with each new love affair
The love that you cherish, so often may perish
And leave you with castles in air

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise

What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things looking so right
Noticing the days hurryin' by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone

Gee, what a thrill each time I kiss her
I've got a terrible case

She takes the winter and makes it summer
But summer could take some lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughin' face

Have you ever heard mission bells ringin'?
Well, she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks, you would think it was singin'
Just hear her say hello

I swear to goodness you can't resist her
Sorry for you, she has no sister

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught

And not the words of one who kneels

Frank Sinatra,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Birthday Greetings for Frank Sinatra's 30th Birthday/Frank Sinatra intr

I'll mend your heart",Songs by Sinatra Show Opening: Night and Day/I'm an Old Cowhand/Tumblin
Frank Sinatra,"Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came, my time was runnin' low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go
Now you're here and now I know just where I'm goin'
No more doubt or fear, I found my way
For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely day

Now you are here and now I know just where I'm goin'
No more doubt or fear, 'cause I've found my way
'Cause love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely
Lonely life that lovely
You found my lonely life that lovely day",Just In Time [Alternate Version] [#][*][Version]
Frank Sinatra,"If I don't see her each day I miss her
Gee, what a thrill each time I kiss her
Believe me I've got a case
On Nancy with the laughin' face
She takes the winter and makes it summer
Summer could take some lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughin' face
Have you ever heard mission bells ringin'?
Well, she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singin'
Just hear her say ""hello""
I swear to goodness you can't resist her
Sorry for you, she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy with the laughin' face
Keep Betty Grable, Lamour, and Turner
She makes my heart a charcoal burner
No angel could replace
My Nancy with the laughin' face",Nancy (With the Laughing Face) [78rpm Version]
Frank Sinatra,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold","Strangers in the Night [Live at Altos de Chavón, Dominican Republic/198"
Frank Sinatra,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",Bows: (Love Is) The Tender Trap
Frank Sinatra,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes, it was my way",Bows: My Way
Frank Sinatra,"Start spreadin' the news, I'm leavin' today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I want to wake up, in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

These little town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps

Chicago, Chicago, I will show you around
I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you'll lose the blues
In Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down
On State Street that great street I just want to say
They do things they don't do on Broadway
They have a time, the time of their life

There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

And he'll toot his flute for you

Frank Sinatra,"Imagination is funny, it makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey just as I think of you
Imagination is crazy, you whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy what to do, what to do

Have you ever felt a gentle touch and then a kiss and then, and then
Find it's only your imagination again, oh well

Imagination is silly, you go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you 
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

"Frank Sinatra, Jr.","Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

When the night is as black
As the nights goin' to get
Well I'm still wild awake
Cause I still can't forget
I was a fool, to let you go
And after I've close the bar with the boys
Though I can't stand the drinks
And I can't stand the noise
When I know I'll be back
Cause their's no other choice
I know I was a fool, to let you go

I was a fool, to think that I could sleep a wink
In this big and deep bed by myself
And I was a fool to waste ,until it was to late
To tell you just how I felt

And after I've been with somebody new
And she knows what to say
Ah but not what to do
Then I know what I've lost
And I know it's so true
No I was a fool, to let you go

"Frank Sinatra, Jr.","You're browsing through 
A second hand bookstore
And you see him 
In non-fiction 
V through why
She looks up 
From World War Two
And then you catch 
His catching you 
Catching his eye
And you quickly turn away 
Your wishful stare
And take a sudden interest 
In your shoes
If you only had the courage 
But you don't she turns 
And leaves and you both lose

The people 
That you never get to love
It's not as if you even 
Have the chance
So many worth 
A second life
But rarely do you get 
A second glance
Until fate cuts 
In on your dance

And you'll see him on a train 
That you've just missed
At a bus stop 
Where your bus will never stop
Or in a passing Buick 
When you've been pulled over 
By a traffic cop
Or you'll share an elevator 
Just you two
And you'll rise 
In solemn silence 
To your floor
Like the fool 
You are you get off
And he leaves your life 
Behind a closing door

And you think about
The people 
That you never get to love
The poem you intended to begin
The saddest words 
That anyone has ever said
Are ""Lord what might have been""
But no one said you get to win

Still you're never gonna miss 
What you don't know
And you don't know 
Who you'll meet 
At half past three
It could be a total stranger 
Who looks something 
Just exactly much like me

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her

In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul

But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve

How sublime it was too

Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

In the cold, cold lift of day

The world is dark and heavy
And it leans on you, it leans on you

I always have my way
When I say move, you move
When I say jump, you jump

Jump, I said jump

I did the things I shouldn't have done
I'm between the devil and the deep blue sea

I swapped my heart for something else
Stuck between the devil and an overdose
I played hands tied with the Holy Ghost
Well I made some money on my way down
I dragged my friends into the ground

Because when I'm gone I'm never coming back.
I'm not being melodramatic, it's just I neither have your number or a key.
An evening spent pretending that we're just becoming friends,
Or this goes any further than going back;
I'm not being pessimistic, it's just you and I were never meant to be.

It isn't love, but every time I kind of wish it was.

I've picked up this silly habit in the last few years of going out
In the evening with my friends into the town,
Of packing a spare T-shirt in my bag in case I do not make it home.
It's pathetic and I know it, but the truth is there've been mornings
I've proved prudent taking toothpaste to the pub.
But that's precious little comfort against the knowledge of the person I've become.

Frank Turner,"We were only supposed to go out for the night,
But it's been a few hours now since it got light -
We're a mess, and the worst part is we couldn't care less.
There's water in the ash-tray and ash in the sink,
The carpet's mostly soaking, but there's nothing to drink -
We're a state, and we're starting to regret staying awake.

And I'll pay for my sins when I get paid,
I'll stop talking to girls when I get laid.
I should have gone home when I could, but I stayed.
But then I never was the clever one.

We were only supposed to go out for the night,
I did my best to go home but in the end I lost the fight with myself -
To be honest I was hoping I'd go home with someone else.
And right about now I should be starting my day,
But instead I am sat here downing the dregs of yesterday,
All the while trying to prop up both ends of my smile.

And I'll pay for my sins when I get paid,
I'll stop talking to girls when I get laid.
I should have gone home when I could, but I stayed.
But then I never was the clever one,
But always the one to not see that I'm done and
I need to go home and get to sleep,
Always the last to see the moment has passed and
I need to admit my defeat.
And I'm lonely - there, I said it.
I'm lonely, but it's hard to admit it
When everbody thinks that you're fine all the time and you're not.

So we were only supposed to go out for the night...
But who am I kidding? Try as I might I can't stop
Until I've squeezed out every last drop.

And I'll pay for my sins when I get paid
But I don't have a penny to my name.
I'll stop talking to girls when I get laid
But I haven't had a shower for days.
I should've gone home when I could but I stayed,
And so I stay up alone,
And set off on my own
To the station where I catch the first train.




",I Really Don't Care What You Did on Your Gap Year
Frank Turner,"From the heart of the Southern Downs, to the North-East London reservoirs,
From the start, the land scaped my sound, before I'd ever been to America.

And if I knew anybody who played pedal steel guitar,
I'd get them in my band and then my band would get real far,
But I was raised in middle England, and not in Nashville Tennessee,
And the only person in my band is me.

A simple scale on an old guitar, and a punk rock sense of honesty.
I cannot fail, I've got this far with no knowledge of mid-west geography.

And if I knew anywhere where I could drive in a straight line
For hours in the desert, I'd drive for hours at a time.
But I was raised in middle England, not in Nashville Tennessee,
And the only person in this car is me.

And yes I'm in four-four time, and yes I use cheap cheap rhymes,
But I try to make a sound my own.
I know I don't break new ground, many have travelled this sound,
But I try to make it sound like home.

Well I've been to Texas state, I didn't think it was that fucking great,
And Nebraska is just a bunch of songs,
Holloway and Hampshire where I belong.
And I don't know anybody who plays pedal steel guitar,
All the city roads are twisted and I do not own a car.
I was raised in middle England, not in Nashville Tennessee,
And the only thing I'm offering is me.

Frank Turner,"Whatever happened to childhood?
We're all scared of the kids in our neighboorhood;
They're not small, charming and harmless,
They're a violent bunch of bastard little shits.
And anyone who looks younger than me
Makes me check for my wallet, my phone and my keys,
And I'm tired of being tired out
Always being on the lookout for thieving gits.

We're all wondering how we ended up so scared;
We spent ten long years teaching our kids not to care
And that ""there's no such thing as society"" anyway,
And all the rich folks act surprised
When all sense of community dies,
But you just closed your eyes to the other sidev Of all the things that she did.
Thatcher fucked the kids.

And it seems a little bit rich to me,
The way the rich only ever talk of charity
In times like the seventies, the broken down economy
Meant even the upper tier was needing some help.
But as soon as things look brighter,
Yeah the grin gets wider and the grip gets tighter,
And for every teenage tracksuit mugger
There's a guy in a suit who wouldn't lift a finger for anybody else.

You've got a generation raised on the welfare state,
Enjoyed all its benefits and did just great,
But as soon as they were settled as the richest of the rich,
They kicked away the ladder, told the rest of us that life's a bitch.
And it's no surprise that all the fuck-ups
Didn't show up until the kids had grown up.
But when no one ever smiles or ever helps a stranger,
Is it any fucking wonder our society's in danger of collapse?

So all the kids are bastards,
But don't blame them, yeah, they learn by example.
Blame the folks who sold the future for the highest bid:
That's right, Thatcher fucked the kids.




",Thatcher Fucked the Kids
Frank Turner,"A free house, a sound-system and a fridge full of beer;
I've known how this story ends for a good few years.
The night lays out before my eyes, there's no new faces, no surprises.
This town is growing old with me, so I'm making a move.
Everybody round here's been out with everybody else,
Which makes talking to girls hazardous to my health.
They've been in this genepool so long they've got wrinkled toes;
I don't want all her exes to be people I know.
There's millions more fish in the sea, so I'm making a move.

I'm bored of this town, bored of this scene, bored of these people, yeah.
I'm an expert at pretending that everything is OK,
But I'm just a kid and it seems as if I've signed my life away.
I need to get out and see what the rest of the world is about.
This toen ain't big enough for the one of me, I'm making a move.

Every guy with long hair round here is a star,
Accorinding to his girlfriend and the way that he holds his guitar.
If anyone gets out they stick in the knife, I don't want to get stuck here for the rest of my life.
I'm sick of these fuckers, I'm moving on.
I still want to be buried here, just like I said, but I'd prefer it if you'd wait until I'm actually dead.
It's easy to get caught inside a town that seems to have a hive-mind,
But I'm packing up and moving on,
When I move out from my parents' house I'm gone, yeah fuck you guys I'm gone.

This town ain't big enough for the one of me,
So why don't you get from in front of me?
We're all going to move to london anyway, so I'll see you in town.

And all the promises you made, that were painful and untrue,
Of all the things you do they reflect worst on you.

For handling mid-life crises
Usually involves a motorbike and
Suspicious fashion decisions.
But you choose to stave off grey hairs by
Lamely hacking at the sides

Frank Turner,"Let's begin at the beginning:
We're lovers and we're losers,
We're heroes and we're pioneers,
And we're beggars and we're choosers.
We're skirting round the edges
Of the ideal demographic.
We're almost on the guestlist,
But we're always stuck in traffic.

We've watched our close associates
Up and play their parts;
They're chatting up the it girls,
And they're tearing up the charts,
While we were paying with coppers
To get our round in at the bar.
We're the see-Team, we're the almost famous
Old friends of the stars.

Justin is the last
Of the great romantic poets,
And he's the only one among us
Who is ever going to make it.
We planned a revolution
From a cheap Southampton bistro.
I don't remember details
But there were English boys with banjos.

Jay is our St George, and he's standing on a wooden chair,
And he sings songs and he slays dragons, and he's losing all his hair.
Adam is the resurrected spirit of Gram Parsons, In plaid instead of rhinestone and living in South London.
And no one's really clear about Tommy's job description,
But it's pretty clear he's vital to the whole damn operation.
Dave Danger smiles at strangers, Tre's the safest girl I know,
Zo and Harps will skamper up to victory in the city we call home.

We won't change our ways, we will proud remain when the glory fades.

I am sick and tired of people
Who are living on the be-list.
They're waiting to be famous
And they're wondering why they do this.

And I know I'm not the one who is habitually optimistic,
But I'm the one who's got the microphone here so just remember this:

Life is about love, last minutes and lost evenings,
About fire in our bellies and furtive little feelings,
And the aching amplitudes that set our needles all a-flickering,
And help us with remembering that the only thing that's left to do is live.

After all the loving and the losing,
For the heroes and the pioneers,
The only thing that's left to do
Is get another round in at the bar.",I Knew Prufrock Before He Got Famous

Somewhere in the City
Three days no sleeping, 
Not eating, not feeling good anymore

What to say in my defense, I was imperfect tense
Used to have such balance, but I don't know where it went
So won't you be my present sense

To come down off this murderous medication

And of washing the drink and the drugs from my blood

Frank Turner,"I was sipping on a Whiskey when I got the call
Yeah my friend Lex was lying in the hospital
She'd been pretty sick for about half a year
But it seems liked this time the end was drawing near
So dropped my plans and jumped the next London train
I found her laid up and in a lot of pain
Her eyes met mine and then I understood
That her weather forecast wasn't looking too good
So I sat and spun her stories for a little while
Tried to raise her mood and tried to raise a smile
But she silenced all my rambling with a shake of her head
Drew me close and listen this is what she said now

""You'll live to dance another day, 
It's just now you'll have to dance, 
For the two of us, so stop looking so damn depressed 
And sing with all your heart that the Queen is dead""

Yeah she told me she was sick of all the hospital food
And of doctors, distant relatives, draining her blood
She said ""I know I'm dying,
But I'm not finished just yet, 
I am dying for a drink and for a cigarette""
So we hatched a plan to book ourselves a cheap hotel
In the centre of the City and to raise some Hell
They waste to all the clubs 
And then when everyone else is long asleep
We know we're good and done

""You'll live to dance another day, 
It's just now you'll have to dance, 
For the two of us, 
So stop looking so damn depressed 
And sing with all your heart that the Queen is dead""
And South London's not the same anymore
The Queen is dead, 
And the last of the great has finally gone to bed

Well I was working on some words when Sarah called me up
She said that Lex had gone asleep and wasn't waking up
And even though I knew that there was nothing to be done
I felt bad for not being there and now, well, she was gone
So I tried to think what Lex would want me to do
At times like this when I was feeling blue
So I gathered up some friends to spread the sad sad news
And we headed to the City for a drink or two
And we sang

""We live to dance another day, 
It's just now we have to dance for one more of us, 
So stop looking so damn depressed, 
And sing with all our hearts, long live the Queen""",Long Live the Queen
Frank Turner,"Well a teacher of mine once told me
That life was just a list of disappoints and defeats
And you could only do your best,
And I said ""That's a fucking cop-out, 
you're just washed up and your tired, 
and when I get to your age I won't be such a coward""
But these day I sit at home, known to shout at my TV
And Punk Rock didn't live up to what I hoped that it could be
And all the things that I believed with all my heart when I was young
Are just coasters for beers and clean surfaces for drugs
And I packed all my pamphlets with my bibles at the back of the shelf

Well it was bad enough the feeling, and the first time it hit
When you realized your parents had let the world all go to shit
And that the values and ideals for which many had fought and died
Had been killed off in the committees and left to die by the wayside
But it was worse when we turned to the kids on the left
And got let down again by some poor excuse for protest
Yeah by idiot fucking hippies in 50 different factions
Who are locked inside some kind of 60's battle re-enactment
And I hung-up my banner in disgust and I head for the door

Oh but once we were young, and we were crass enough to care
But I guess you live and learn, we won't make that mistake again, no
Oh but surely just for one day, we could fight and we could win
And if only for a little while, we could insist on the impossible

Well we've been a good few hours drinking
So I'm going to say what everyone's thinking
If we're stuck on this ship and it's sinking
Then we might as well have a parade
Cos if it's still going to hurt in the morning
And a better plan's set to get forming
Then where's the harm spending an evening
In manning the old barricades, 
So come on old friends to the streets
Let's be 1905 but not 1917, 
Let's be heroes, let's be martyrs, let's be radical thinkers
Who never have to test drive the least of their dreams
Let's divide up the world into the damned and safe
And then ride to the valleys like the old life brigade
And straighten our backs and we won't be afraid
And they'll celebrate our deaths with a national parade

So come on let's be young, let's be crass enough to care
Let's refuse to live and learn, let's make all our mistakes again yes
And then darling, just for one day, we can fight and we can win
And if only for a little while, we could insist on the impossible
Leave the mourning the to the morning
Yeah pain can be killed
With aspirin tablets and vitamin pills
But memories of hope, and glorious defeat
Are a little bit harder to beat",Love Ire and Song
Frank Turner,"Rise in the morning at sunrise
Strangers around me sleep soundly at rest
Phones and computers become me
Signals stretch back to the lands that I've left
Oh in the quiet times
Count up the things that I love
Slip through the road lights
The trail of wandering back

Left you while you were sleeping
Left you the warmth in the bed, where I lay
You left me a love worth keeping
You left me a diary to count off the days
And so in the quiet times
I saver the things that I've lost
And slip through the road lights
And wonder how I came to this

I guess you never know
Lost until you have something to lose
Choice until you have something to choose
Choose

So give me my quiet times
To mourn for the things that I've lost
And find me on the road lights
Counting the miles and the cost
So I never knew
Lost cos I had nothing to lose
Choice cos I had nothing to choose
But all the things you do
The way that you close your door
The way that you guard your shore

Frank Turner,"Well I guess I should confess that I am starting to get old
All the latest music fads all passed me by and left me cold
All the kids are talking slang I won't pretend to understand
All my friends are getting married, mortagages and pension plans
And it's obvious my angry adolescent days are done
And I'm happy and I'm settled in the person I've become
But that doesn't mean I'm settled up and sitting out the game

And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I yeah I won't grow up

Oh maturity's a wrapped up package deal so it seems
And ditching teenage fantasy means ditching all your dreams
All your friends and peers and family solemnly tell you you will
Have to grow up be an adult yeah be bored and unfulfilled
Oh when no ones yet explained to me exactly what's so great
About slaving 50 years away on something that you hate
Look I'm meekly shuffling down the path of mediocrity
Well if that's your road then take it but it's not the road for me

And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up

And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up

Is photosynthesize
Then you deserve every hour of these sleepless nights
That you waste wondering when you're gonna die

Frank Turner,"Monday morning, comes a crawling in
From another weekend choked with cigarettes and sin
I've been busy, so much lately
That every time I get some time to spend
I end up drunk or sleeping in
And I miss you, you're busy too
We call each other up, when we're messed up
And say we'll meet in the New Year
But it's perfectly clear we'll do no such thing
Come the spring

When the evening casts it's shadows on the corners of my days
And I am old and I am settled in the place where I will stay
When my wandering meanderings have finally reached their end
Yeah whatever else maybe I will not forget my friends

Friday evening, barely even begins
Before my phone begins to ring with people asking where I am
And I can't suppress a smile, we talk a while
The chances are that I am far away and so I'm phased out of the plan
And that's how I miss out, on another night
The kind of night where nothing really happens
Yeah but everything goes down
And at the end I'm just a promise to pick up the phone
When I'm in town

When the evening casts it's shadows on the corners of my days
And I am old and I am settled in the place where I will stay
When my wandering meanderings have finally reached their end

Frank Turner,"The first girl that I fell for was a fair and faithful fighter
She smoldered with a will to save the world
I did my best to help her, yeah I stood shoulder to shoulder
On the front lines with my visionary girl

I wish that she had cared for me
But in the end her ideologies
Occupied the fortress of her heart
I wrote her 15 songs, but still we had to part

And if music was the food of love
Then I'd be a fat romantic slob
Well music, it's my substitute for love

The last girl that I loved she was a low and lusty liar
She set my heart on fire, but made me choke
Her beauty was a sight to see, but she didn't save it all for me
I found other fires by following the smoke

I wish that she had either cared for me or
Let me be
But she chased me from mind and from my home
I wrote her 16 songs, but I ended up alone

And if love is really all that we need
Then even all my singing is never gonna save me
Music it's my substitute for love

Well I've had many different girls inside my bed
But only one or two inside my head
These days I cuddle up to my guitar instead
But oh, what I would give, not to stumble but to really fall in love
And I could substitute my singing for the sound of someone sleeping next to me",Substitute
Frank Turner,"I come from the land of the Wessex downs
From the Hampshire hills near Winchester town
In the country where the soft South rivers flow down
To English channel I roam, this is where I call home
I sing for my supper and I'm pretty well fed
My cross is silent and I make my bed
Where I can find a crown and somewhere to lay my head
And the traveling day is done, 
And all my songs have been sung

But honey I was lonely on the road, 
I was all on my own
Hanging outside at the back of a death metal show
I saw you standing there with your hair down low
A kink in your step that made me want to know
If you would like to take me home
Who'd of thought that a French kiss 
From a Parisian girl could capture an English boy

She comes from the channels of a distant shore
From the land of revolution and of Agincourt
From the Kings blood stain on a tricolour
And the culture a little too high, 
For an English boy like me
She doesn't know the Island I grew up upon
The valleys and the hills that I've roamed along
And she doesn't like my clothes 
And she doesn't like my songs
But she's still my Mademoiselle 
And it goes to show you never can tell

Cos she was a quiet one
She was a shy one
She was the prettier at the show
She crept up so slowly
She crept up behind me
But still she pretended that she didn't know
But all that she thinks of me, and she kissed me
And she's yet to let me go though I'm far away
Across of sea I'm singing for the hope 
That she would ever remember me

So honey when you're lonely on the road, 
You're all on your own
Hanging outside at the back of the country show
Picture me there with hat down low
A smile upon my face to let you know
That I would like to take you home
That I would like to take you home, 
To the hills that I know
I would like to take you home, to the places I go
I would like to take you home

But I`ve never set foot inside a tent
Can`t build a fire to save my life

I`ve never slept out underneath the stars,
The closest that I came to that was one time my car
Broke down for an hour in the suburbs at night

I lied until I fit the bill god bless the great indoors

Frank Turner,"I woke up on a sofa in an unfamiliar house, surrounded by sleeping folks I didn't know.
On failing to find my friends, I decided it was clearly time to go.
So I made my way out of the door as quietly as I could - there was no one there I knew to say goodbye,
Squinting in the sadly sobering sunshine of the Sunday morning light.

I started the night with all my friends and I ended up alone.
I started out so happy now I'm hungover and down.
It was about then that I realized I was half-way through the best years of my life.

I scanned the local landmarks, trying to find out where I was, and maybe even find a bus back home,
Longing for a shower, and for clean sheets, and a charger for my phone.
Suddenly it hit me - I got paid this Friday last, and so I rifled through my pockets for some change.
But all I found was a packet of broken cigarettes and a sinking sense of shame.

I had to ask myself:
Is is really worth it? Is any of this worth it?
Well the whole thing's far from perfect,
But I've yet to figure out a better way to spend my time.

Too many suits and dirty looks made me rack my brains - the real damage started to sink in.
It'd been quite a heavy weekend and I could just about remember where I'd been.
Well I started the night with all my friends and I ended up alone,
I started out so happy now I'm hungover and down.
I stood on a street corner and I felt a little sick.
It was about then that I realized I was halfway through the first day of the week.




",The Real Damage
Frank Turner,"Honestly, relax my dear, it's clear that we are done
It doesn't take a scientist to figure out that one
It's obvious, the way you move, the way you hold your head
The way you hide your pretty eyes and shift across the bed

You say worse things happen at sea
I say worse things have happened to me

Honestly, I'll be fine, this isn't my first time
I've taken blows before and every time I have survived
You made it clear you didn't care, you never did pretend
And in the end, at least you never try to fuck my friends

You say worse things happen at sea
I said worse things have happened to me
Bitter eyes, the bedroom floor
And we're not gonna talk anymore

Well, honestly, it doesn't matter, I know better than
To cry over spilt milk, wasted effort, spoilt plans
We're adults here so shed no tears, I'm sure we can be friends
I'll nod and smile and watch you in the arms of other men

You say worse things happen at sea
I say worse things have happened to me
Bitter eyes, the bedroom floor
And we're not gonna talk anymore
We got nothing to talk for

Well, honestly, your honesty, it has emerged unscathed 
And I hope you're doin' fine
Well, me, I'm doin fucking great
And I wouldn't want to waste another second of your time
I know your face, I know my place
So you watch yours, I'll keep to mine

Invite them down to share

What might be
The last weekend of the summer
'Cause September getting colder, as it goes
And we haven't done enough
Of this simple kind of stuff,
This year we're clearly getting older
And it shows.

Well work weeks make us weary
School's a distant memory,
And it's easy to ask questions
Of ourselves.
Like where it is we're going?
And what we had to show 
From the sunny days we've
In the shelves.

With expectations of our ultimate direction
All the stations 
That we should have reached by now.
Where we haven't read the script,
And our tender wings are clipped.
And we're scared we might be
Letting someone down.

Listen to these heart-break songs
When nothings really wrong.
And then we smile
When we're asked
And say we're fine.
We're drifting through 
Our middle days,
And creeping,
Into middle age.
And setting in our ways

And now it's time

To decide
Now it's time 
To draw the line
In the sand

And I'm not a mirror for you when you were young.
But I still remain your faithful only son.

Lately I've been feeling kind of fragile,
Lately I've been feeling all worn out.

What would there be left to dream about.

Father, oh dear father, I'm not trying to reject,
The values that you held like winning cards up to your chest.
But I can't just do the things that you wish that you'd done,
Though I still remain your faithful only son.

You wouldn't miss me if I stayed,
You never see me if I go.

And it's not long since you and I could have been

Is that we can't remember how we got caught.

Muffled sighs and might-have-beens
Count your blessings, then breathe, 
And count to ten.

And though it doesn't often show,
We are scared because we know

And so the world has changed, 
Worse or better's hard to tell,
But my hope remains within the arms of Isabel.

So now our calloused hands once told
A story honest as it's old of sowing seeds
And setting sail.

But now our hands are soft and weak
And working seven days a week
At these salvation schemes that are bound to fail.

And so the world has changed, 
Worse or better's hard to tell,
But my hope remains within the arms of Isabel.

And I'll admit that I am scared
Of what I don't understand.
But darling, if you're there,
Gentle voice and soothing hands,
To quiet my despair,
To shore up all my plans,
Darling, if you're there

I could have played safe,
But in the end the journey's 
Brought joys that outweigh the pain.""

All the doubts that he would come home.

Too small for a crown.

I'm not playing to pass time, 
I'm playing for keeps.

We only just started and you're throwing the fight.
You'd rather burn out than fade away? 
Well why not both, I plan to stay.
So let's do this once and let's do it right.

I used to say that I didn't care,
That we wouldn't be doing this forever,

I'm going to end my days in a house with high windows

And on my seventieth birthday I'll see you right here, 
And together we'll watch the sun set.

There's no one in my coffin, 
There's nothing in my grave,
I'm tired of being damned, 
I'd rather be saved,

Because we never bought in,

Between the end of the club and the sun coming out.
Leave Kerouac at his desk, we have romance in our risks.

And here's what we believe,
Before we get bored, let's be inspired,
Let's ignore the applause and set the theater on fire,
Fight every war like the drunks in the choir,
Put our art where our mouths are: Poetry of the deed.
So enough with words and technical theses,
Let's grab life by the throat and live it to pieces.

We can choose, we can change,
And if we don't, we're just afraid of living life 
Like we're loved and in love and alive
To all the things we could be if we just believed 

That life is too short to be lived without poetry.
If you've got soul darling now come on and show it me.
But life is too long to just sing the one song,
So we'll burn like a beacon and then we'll be gone.",Poetry of the Deed
Frank Turner,"Richard Divine made up his mind 
To take the last few steps to the bathroom door 
From his bedroom floor and to lock himself in. 

Steady young hands, meticulous plans, 
Disposable razors and a blister-pack filled 
With strong sleeping pills, and a bath of hot water. 

He carefully wrote a funerary note 
On his best writing paper to set out the facts, 
And sealed it with wax, and left it in the kitchen. 

He left it out so his parents would know 
What there was waiting for them
Pale cold skin and blood seeping in to the landing carpet.

He said he's not for sale, said that he felt hounded, 
Crowded and surrounded by this life he didn't choose. 
But everybody plays this game on a daily basis. 
They're not heroes, they're survivors, 
And it's not Shakespearean if they lose. 

So do what you want, 
Do what the voices tell you, 
But don't ever say that we didn't warn you. 

He said he's not for sale, 
But he bought into his failure. 
He's telling tales that hammer nails right into open palms. 

A martyr in reverse, 
He's best at being worst, 
The rest of us are cursed 
But we keep calm and we carry on. 

So Richard, here it is
None of us are blameless, 
Huddled here like strangers, 
Shameless in our lists of all the changes we say we need. 

But I think that you knew that, 
You can't pretend it's news 
That when you cut yourself you'll bleed.",Richard Divine

Ever since my childhood I've been scared I've been afraid
Of being trapped by circumstance and staying in one place
So I always keep a small bag full of clothes carefully stored
Somewhere secret somewhere safe
And somewhere close to the door

Well I've traveled many countries I've washed my feet in many seas
I've drunk with drifters in Vienna and with punks in old dc

By burning up the miles and yeah by filling up my days

You wont find your precious answers now by staying in one place

Frank Turner,"Once an honest man could go from sunrise to its set 
Without encountering agents of his state or government 
But a sorry cloud of tyranny has fallen across the land 
Brought on by hollow men, who did not understand 
That for centuries our forefather have fought and often died 
To keep themselves unto themselves, to fight the rising tide 
And that if in the smallest battles we surrender to the state 
We enter in a darkness whence we never shall escape 

When they raise their hands up our lives to possess 
To know our souls, to drag us down, we'll resist. 

Watt Tyler led the people in 1381 
To meet the king at Smithfield and issue this demand: 
That Winchester's should be the only law across the land 
The law of old King Alfred's time, of free and honest men. 
Because the people then they understood what we have since forgot: 
That a government will only work for its own benefit 
And I'd rather stand up naked against the elements alone 
Than give the hollow men the right to enter in my home 

When they raise their hands up our lives to possess 
To know our souls, to drag us down, we'll resist. 

Stand up Sons of Liberty and fight for what you own 
Stand up Sons of Liberty and fight, fight for for your homes. 

So if ever a man should ask you for your business or your name 
Tell him to go and fuck himself, tell his friends to do the same. 
Because a man who'd trade his liberty for a safe and dreamless sleep 
Doesn't deserve the both of them, and neither shall he keep.",Sons of Liberty
Frank Turner,"Sunday nights are slow surrender.
It never lasts and we never learn.
We can still make this one to remember.
It's Sunday night and we've time to burn.
Tomorrow morning can wait its turn.

So charge your glasses 
And raise a toast to the memory gained,
To the sleep that we lost.
Another weekend run to ground,
Another passing coat of red painted across our town.

Work is shallow, cuts are deep, 
But who would waste two days respite?
You can't catch up on sleep.

So here we are, last chance saloon,
The ticking clock and a slow defeat, 
It'll all be over soon.

Once more friends unto the breach, bleary-eyed,
The stuff of dreams always slips out of reach.

Defiance dressed in crumpled clothes,
Protest played out with a headache, 
Starting late and going slow.
So though we know we have to be here,
We have tasted freer air, so we don't have to care.

All our days will fade away 
In hazy nights and clear mistakes.
So here's to us and needs that must.
Let's raise a toast for one last boast
Because it's Sunday night and we've time to burn.

We sing songs about our friends in E minor

Let's stop waiting around for someone to patronize us
Let's hammer out a sound that speaks of where we've been
Forget about the haircuts and stupid skinny jeans
The stampings and the irony of the media philistines

'Cause we write love songs in C and we do politics in G
We sing songs about our friends in E minor
So tear down the stars now and take up your guitars
And come on folks and try this at home

Because the only thing 
That punk-rock should never really mean
Is not sitting round 
And waiting for the lights to turn green
And not thinking that you're better 
'cause you're stood up on a stage
If you're oh, so fucking different 
Then who cares what you have to say?

'Cause there's no such thing as rockstars 
There's just people who play music
And some of them are just like us 
And some of them are dicks
So, quick turn off your stereo
Pick up that pen and paper
Yeah, you can do much better 
Than some skinny half-arsed English country singer

Hear ye, hear ye, and make miracles for minimum wage.
Hear ye, hear ye, these folk songs for the modern age,
Will hold us in their arms.

Right here, right now, Elvis brings his children home.
Right here, right now, you never have to feel alone.
Right here, right now, teenage kicks and gramophones.

Yeah, in Jerry Lee and in Johnny and all the greats.
And I still believe (I still believe) in the sound,
That has the power to raise a temple and tear it down.

And I still believe (I still believe) in the need,
For guitars and drums and desperate poetry.
And I still believe (I still believe) that everyone,
Can find a song for every time they've lost and every time they've won.

So just remember folks we not just saving lives, we're saving souls,
And we're having fun.

Someone takes a breath and takes the stage, then starts to play
In the back of a thousand bars and by the side of a thousand roads
Worn wood, rusted bronze and honest toil explode

They cast long shadows in the evening sun
But when the morning comes they've moved along

Hey hey Mr Dylan I have written you a song
About the river of new singers that still rolls along
So here's to Reagan, here's to Marwood, here's to Tim and Jonah too
Here's to the ones who have to take the stage and sing the truth

They cast long shadows in the evening sun
But when the morning comes they've moved along

Sing till you sweat for the spirit of the age
Sing life to lines that are dead on the page
Sing for your sorrow, your wisdom, your rage, sing out
Sing for the records you played till they broke
For the parts where you insisted that nobody spoke
Sing for the words that you know but they still make you choke

Rushing through the suburbs to the station to catch the train
Heading up to town to Dave's to get my glad rags on
Because lately I've been running down, little things catching up
Excuses stretched thin and it's hard not giving up
Tonight we're going to get it right, we're going to have us a good one

And the roll call is missing a name
Since you left things haven't been the same
But I don't blame you, there was nothing here to make you stay
But I remember the way that you'd light up a room when you walk in,
The way that you'd lead a crowd when you sing
Jamie, this one is for you.

Pre-club beers at Dan's before we hit the road
Nicely warmed up, pleasantly half-loaded
Ready for a night on fire, we're going to get out the big guns
And I run down the numbers, scan through the faces
Run through the plans, scout out the places
I'm electrified, surrounded, but still missing something or someone

I'm wide awake in the cityscape

You did your time out on the road
One day you stayed away for good
You found a home down by the shore
A place to hang your hat and more
You sent me postcards to tell me of
Slowing down and finding love
The thrill has gone from the city life
I'm not far behind

So you can strike my name from the roll call,
When night falls I'm leaving
There is nothing here to make me stay
When I get to the coast I will send back a postcard

Not long after the Northmen had come
A low and evil deed was done
In the dark of the New Forest

From the shores of Normandy King William came
To Albion fair, King Harold to slay
With greed in his heart and his scurrilous claim
He took the land for his own
He took the land for his own

Now John was a blacksmith, an honest old man
He raised up his children and worked with his hands
At his family's forge in the patch of land
In the dark of the New Forest
In the dark of the New Forest

King William rode out after his victory
To ravage the land in his hunger to thieve
For hunting grounds in the Wessex trees
He took the land for his own
He took the land for his own

But if you steal the land of an Englishman
Then you will know this curse
Your first born son's warm blood will run
Upon the English earth

Now King William's son was called Rufus the Red
He took up the crown when his father was dead
And he rode the hunting grounds in his stead
In the dark of the New Forest
In the dark of the New Forest

But John's curse it called out and Lord Terryl fired low
The arrow struck William with a sickening blow
And he fell from his horse to the ground below
And the land took him for it's own

Not waiting until we die until we restitute the meek,
No blaming all our failings on imaginary beasts,

Not spilling blood for those who have never spread a drop of love,
No finger pointing justified by phantoms up above,

Of pioneers and pirate ships and Bob Dylan
Of people wrapped up tight in the things that will kill them
Of being trapped in a lift plunging straight to the bottom
Of open seas and ways of life we've forgotten
I keep having dreams

Amy worked in a bar in Exeter
I went back to her house and I slept beside her
She woke up screaming in the middle of the night
Terrified of her own insides
Dreams of pirate ships and Patty Hearst
Breaking through a life over-rehearsed
She can't remember which came first
The house, the home, or the terrible thirst
She keeps having dreams

And on the worst days
When it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons
She's got her cowboy boots and car keys on the bed stand
So she can always run
She can get up, shower, and in half an hour she'll be gone

I keep having dreams of things I need to do
And waking up and not following through
But it feels like I haven't slept at all
When I wake to a silence and she's facing the wall
Posters of Dylan and of Hemingway
An antique compass for a sailor's escape
She says you just can't live this way
And I close my eyes and I never say
I'm still having dreams

And on the worst days
When it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons
I sleep with my passport
One eye on the back door
So I can always run
I can get up, shower, and in half an hour I'll be gone

And come morning
I am disappeared
Just an imprint on the bedsheets
I'm by the roadside with my thumb out
A car pulls up, and Bob's driving
So I climb in
We don't say a word
As we pull off into the sunrise
And these rivers of tarmac are like arteries across the country
We are blood cells alive in the bloodstream
The beating heart of the country
We are electric pulses

And throw them in

And then specks infinitesimal of my mortal remains

And I will creep through their capillaries to the marrow of their bones
And they will wake to bright new mornings and then wordlessly they'll know

And from there into the channel across the great Atlantic Ocean

Or one who condescends
Who'll wash his hands down in the mire among the misery of men
Or by ever turning circles hanging timeless in the sky
Like a dream catcher distracting from the fact you're gonna die

But I place one foot before the other
Confident because
I know that everything we are right now is everything that was
That Watt Tyler, Woody Guthrie, Dostoevsky and Davy Jones
Are all dissolved into the ether and have crept into my bones
And all the cells in all the lines upon the backs of both my hands
Were once carved into the details of two feet upon the sand

If I only ever skip out his choices will I ever choose better 
The sad truth is the grass it will always seem greener
So I left you alone in a restaurant in London in winter
You deserved better

Out of trash some might back in my ears
Sound comes clear and brings the awful truth that I can't stand what I've done to you
And it's written clear in my diary today should have been our anniversary
And I'm far way and I'm far apart
And you're back home with a broken heart
And loves is real and I can't escape
I'll only ever have myself to blame

These failures shift and save me in the night
Like a fever I can't break try as I might
Wake me darling I need you to take me home
But I know in the end redemption is mine and mine alone

So if each of us is made of a tally of mistakes and successes
Then the hour in that restaurant makes my score less than impressive
If each can be redeemed with the courage by which he confesses
So darling I miss you, your music and your musk and your kisses
I don't think I can do this",Redemption
Frank Turner,"Our history runs down our rivers
Down our rivers to the sea
Reminds us of the things that matter
Home and heart and history

And all our sins will be forgiven
Washed away to set us free
By the rivers that run through our homesteads
By myth and modal melody

I traced these rivers from the cities to the seas
To remind me of what I already know
I traced the shorelines through a thousand histories
To remind me an island is my home
An island is my home

I traveled far across this country
Northumberland to Southern Downs
I wandered up the rolling Humber
And down the Thames to London town

And countless lives were lived and lingered
In the cotswells and the fells
I left a tapestry called England
And life and those who lived it well

I traced these rivers from the cities to the seas
To remind me of what I already know
I traced the shorelines through a thousand histories
To remind me an island is my home
An island is my home

Round here the sky is a little closer
A little closer to the ground
It's hard for someone to get lost here
Harder still to get found

And though I've seen a thousand rivers
From the Mississippi to the Rhine
The only place that I'll lay my hat down
Is by an English riverside

I traced these rivers from the cities to the seas
To remind me of what I already know
I traced the shorelines through a thousand histories
To remind me an island is my home
An island is my home

So place your trust into the sea
It's kept us safe for centuries
It shaped our shores and steadily
Its care has brought us, come

And when I die, I hope to be buried out in English seas
So all that then remains of me
Will lap against these shores
Until England is no more",Rivers
Frank Turner,"Let me tell you all a little story of the things I've found,
Hanging out and drinking with my friends in the cathedral grounds,
And later dodging drunks as we dance along Jury Street,
As we wander up town to the railway our friends to meet,

There's something about coming back to your hometown again,
The place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends,
And though none of them still live here, I've got nowhere to go,
I'm a Wessex Boy and when I'm here I'm home

Let me tell you all a little story of the things I've lost,
Huddling for warmth on the top step of the Buttercross,
Sitting on the benches by the bridges at the riverside,
Of counting down the hours for the buses cause I missed my ride

There's something about coming back to your hometown again,
The place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends,
And though none of them still live here, I've got nowhere to go,
I'm a Wessex Boy, a Wessex boy and when I'm here I'm home

And one day I will hear this song anonymous and sweet,
Ringing out from a buskers guitar on the ancient city streets,
I'll stand along while and smile before I continue on the road,
And somebody else will sing the words and I'll feel like I'm home

There's something about hometowns you never can escape
The triumphs and the tragedies and those of little faith
The welling of nostalgia and feeling kind of strange,
Cause despite the little changes yeah this place still feels the same

There's something about coming back to your hometown again,
The place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends,

Frank Turner,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road
Frank Turner,"The single saddest thing that I ever heard you say
Was on the day I told you I had to go away
You said “Darling baby please, if you really mean to leave
Can't I just hold you for a little while longer?”

And the single hardest thing I ever had to do
Was take your arms from round me and walk away from you
And I know I shouldn't have kissed you as a I left
Darling I should have been stronger

Not with a bang but with a whimper
It wasn't hard, it was kind of simple
Three short steps from your bed to your door
Darling I can't look you in the eyes now and tell you I'm sure
If I love you anymore

You see, I did my very best, I've given you these years
Of love and understanding, telephone calls and tears
But now the little things you do that used to make me love you
Now just cramp my heart a little and let it slip

And we've met this sorry end from a picture perfect start
The romance and the running down to disconnected hearts
Of two people sad and free, who know they used to be
More than just a pair of sinking ships

Not with a bang but with a whimper
It wasn't hard, it was kind of simple
Three short steps from your bed to your door
Darling I can't look you in the eyes now and tell you I'm sure
If I love you anymore

I'm not drinking anymore, but I'm then I'm not drinking any less
I can't do this anymore, oh you know I did my best

Frank Turner,"As I walked out one morning fair,
I found myself drawn thoughtlessly
Back to the place we used to live,
And you still do, now without me.

Around the back, away from the road,
Behind the bins, beneath your window,
I found the hulk, the rusting bulk
Of a shattered old piano.
Someone had torn out some of the keys
With cruel care, not thoughtlessly,
In such a way that one could only play
Minor melodies.

So I sat down in my sadness, beneath your window,
And I played sad songs on the minor keys of a broken piano;
A sinner amongst saved men on the banks of the muddy Thames.

As I have wandered through this city,
Like a child lost in the London fog,
From Highgate Hill, down to the river,
Then washed downstream past the Isle of Dogs,

I've had time enough to think upon
The question of what kind of songs
That you would choose to listen to
Now that I am gone.
And as I drift beneath that bridge,
Just down the road from where you live,
I've often thought I might have caught
Your voice upon the wind.

But as I stroked those broken keys
You did not join in harmony.",Broken Piano
Frank Turner,"Parents don't be too kind to your kids,
Or how else will they grow up to be
Louche Parisian sinners or Nashville country singers,
Singing about the terrible things their parents did?
Lovers don't be sparing with the truth;
Break their hearts if that's what you must do.
Fill them with remorse, tinged with hope of course,
And let their baser instincts pull them through.

And though it seems a little strange to me,
People never really change, it seems.

And all across America,
Waitresses and boys who play guitar,
They fall in love and fall out, the boys have something to sing about,
The girls go drown their sorrows at the bars.
While in front rooms across the old country,
Sat spellbound in front of their TVs,
The younger brothers and sisters wonder at what they're missing,
And wonder how the air tastes when you're really free.

And though it seems a little strange to me,
People never really change, it seems.
We're all broken boys and girls, at heart,
Come together fall apart.

And in Battersea power station, the fisher king
Ponders on his ruin, among many other things.
He folds his broken hands,
Surveys his barren lands,
And prays for hope to whisper in the wind.

We were born without meaning, we will die without reason,
And the world will not shrug all that much at our passing.
Yes you can try and try and try,
But no one ever makes it out alive.

With your tattered flags unfurled:
Fix yourselves then fix the fisher king.
Won't you fix yourselves to fix the fisher king?",The Fisher King Blues
Frank Turner,"Because we're all so very twenty first century,
You're probably listening to me on some kind of portable stereo
Maybe you're sitting on the back of the bus,
Or it's running up your sleeve, and you're across from your boss,
Or you're sitting in your bedroom on your own with the lights down low
I'd like to teach you four simple words, so that next time you come to a show,
You could sing those words back at me like they're the only ones that you know:

I want to dance, I want to dance
I want lust and love and a smattering of romance
But I'm no good at dancing, yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm going to play it straight, I'm going to take my chance, I want to dance

Hi ho hi ho hi ho, we're heading out to the punk rock show
Colleagues and friends condescend with a smile,
But this is my culture man, this is my home
The dark huddled masses gather at the gate,
Yeah, the doors are at 7, and the show starts at 8
A few precious hours in a space of our own,
And when the band comes on, the only thing I really know:

I want to dance, I want to dance
I want lust and love and a smattering of romance
But I'm no good at dancing, and yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm going to play it straight, I'm going to take my chance, I want to dance

Yeah is anybody else sick of the music
That's churned out by lacklustre scenesters from Shoreditch?
Yeah it's all sex drugs and sins, like they're extras from Skins,
But it's OK because they don't really mean it
I want bands who had to work for their keep,
Drove a thousand miles and played a show on no sleep,
Sleeping on the floor in a stranger's place,
Hungry just to do it all again the next day

I want to dance, I want to dance
I want lust and love and a smattering of romance
But I'm no good at dancing, and yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm going to play it straight, I'm going to take my chance, I want to dance

So put your hands on your hips, bring your knees in tight
Yeah we do this shit together man, no fists, no fights
We're not trying to shape the world so people think like us,
We just want our own space to dance, no favors no fuss
On blood sweat and vinyl we have a built ourselves a house,
So if the roof is on fire then we're going to put it out
Forget about the bitching and remember that you're blessed,
Punk is for the kids who never fit in with the rest, alright
Somebody told me that music with guitars
Was going out of fashion, and I had to laugh
This shit wasn't fashionable when I fell in love,
If the hipsters move on why should I give a fuck?

I want to dance, I want to dance,
I want me some lust and love and a smattering of that old time romance
But I'm no good at dancing, yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm going to play it straight, I'm going to take my chance
Yeah, I want to dance, I want to dance
I want me and you both to join hands down at the front
So the next time I see you, remember these words so
We'll sing like the barricades are down, and we'll dance like no one's around,
Singing four simple words",Four Simple Words
Frank Turner,"I have searched for you
In the darkness of a dozen dingy dance halls
In countless queues in cafes in the suburbs
In the bed clothes of a thousand stranger's bedrooms

I have yearned for you
In the airless hubs of international airports
In the hollow hell of many hundred hotels
In the solitary stillness of the early hours
I still do

Sometimes the things you need are right back where you started from

So fuck you Hollywood
For teaching us that love was free and easy
For dressing all our daughters as princesses
For gulling us with tales of happy endings

And fuck you, Mötley Crüe
For charming us with access and with excess
For telling tales that leave out all the dark sides
For bringing out the lowest drive in everyone
Oh, fuck you

Sometimes the things you need are right back where you started from
Sometimes the things you need, they hang around a little while
Then they're good and gone

If I could just have a second try
I'd take the second call you made that night
Find myself an airport, find a credit card, find a flight, or something
And head back to the start

In the days when I was younger
Used to fix itself quick sharp
After every slip and stumble

Cuts and bruises that won't go away

And I used to think that I
Would never live past twenty five

Is a gift if you survive
But I've survived too long for my side of the deal

That used to take a lifetime

I remember well the day that I got my first tattoo
I was so scared before and after I was so proud when it was new
But these days I've gone and got me many more
And sometimes I get more when I get bored

Frank Turner,"I never had a brother, old friend you had three.
You always said that if you had another one it would be me.
When you come through the flames, not everything has survived;
Forget about family now, we've got our old flyers,
Lame tattoos,
The in-jokes and memories,
The misspent youth.
And yeah we ran out of miles,
I guess that's true,
But I know I'll see you when I see you.

I had a new guitar, you had a drumkit,
And I knew the chords to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"".
Long summer afternoons washed out in the haze
I'll come round to your place, your folks are away

So let's play
Till we're tired,
And then hey,
It's “Goodbye”,
But I know I'll see you when I see you.

We'll carry different loads,
We'll all get different blisters,

And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing

Amelie lied to me, this was supposed to be easy
I found the one damn person to help me fall asleep in the night
But sleeping gets tiring, and dark reminds me of dying
And as long as this feeble heart is still beating
You will find me rushing through every room, switching on all the lights

The problem with falling in love in late-night bars
Is that there's always more nights, there's always more bars
The problem with showing your lover your scars
Is that everybody's lover is covered in scars

So, give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up

Everything's gone fractious, and I felt faithless
At that moment just before the dawn when everything falls apart
But baby I didn't mean it, for things to get desperate
I let slip my guard, I let go of the rudder
Now we're drifting in the current away from one another

So give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up everything

Brave, and not just standing, but jumping in
Of making circles into squares, of laying down
The bare facts like a burden I can't bear
And I can almost find the words, but I can see the way you'd
Fold your hands, speak my name like a curse
Upon your pretty lips, the pressured white behind your fingertips

And when you see me for all that I am
I couldn't make mistakes to make a difference any more
I'd throw myself down on my knees, at your hands
And beg you for forgiveness for my fuck ups and my faults
And maybe you'd relent and return my hope for our forever

The world has turned a touch on its axis
And the only thing certain is
That everything changes

And they closed the Astoria
At the end of last summer
The place we earned our pedigrees
Scene of our victories

Somebody I don't really know just gave me something to help
Set me down and stop me always thinking about you

And you know your life is heading in a questionable
Direction when you're off in days with strangers
And you can't remember anything except way you sound
When you told me you didn't know what I should do

It's a long road out to recovery from here,
A long way back to the light
A long road out to recovery from here,
A long way to make it right

And so I wake up in the morning just like every other day
And just like every boring blues song I get swallowed by the pain,
And so I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away
But you're not lying there any longer and I know
That it's my fault so I been pounding on the floor
And I've been crawling up the walls and I've been divvying my darkness
And Serotonin boosters, cider and some kind of smelling salts

It's a long road out to recovery from here,

If anybody ever asks us well let's say that we met in jail
And that's the story that I'm sticking to like
A southern face that comforts but today I need to hear
Some truth if I'm ever getting through this
Yea you once sent me a letter that said if I was lost at sea
Close my eyes and catch a time idea and only think of me
Well darling now I'm sinking I'm as lost as
Lost can be and I'm hoping you can drag me
Off and down and out to my recovery

If you could just give me a sign and just a subtle little glimmer,
A suggestion that you'd have me if I could only make me better
Then I'd stand a little stronger as I walk a little taller all the time
'Cause I know that you are cynical but I think
I can convince you yea 'cause broken people
Can get better if they really want to
Or at least that's what I have to tell myself if I'm hoping to survive

It's a long road out to recovery from here,
A long way back to the light

Frank Turner,"God dammit Amy, we're not kids any more.
You can't just keep waltzing out of my life,
Leaving clothes on my bedroom floor,
Like nothing really matters, like pain doesn't hurt.
You should be more to me by now than just heartbreak in a short skirt.

You kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I made when I was a kid,
With a disassembled disposable razor I stole from my dad,
When I thought that suffering was something profound,
That weighed down on wise heads,
And not just something to be avoided,
Something normal people dread.

God dammit Amy, well of course I've changed.
With all the things I've done and the places I've been
I'd be a machine if I had stayed the same.
But you're still back where we started, you haven't changed at all.
You're still trying to live like a kid, like you can always have it all.

You know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I hid as best I could,
That I covered with ink, but in the right kind of light they still bleed through,
Showing that there are some things I just can't change no matter what I do:
The tell-tale signs of being used,
Of being trapped inside of you.

You're a beautiful butterfly
Burned with a branding iron
Onto my outsides into my insides
As a simple sign:
To show off your ownership.
Burned into my naked skin,
Onto my outsides into my insides.

It's not even love any more,
It's just a claim upon my soul.
It stains my skin, yeah it's on my breath,
And I'm ashamed to get undressed
In front of strangers in case they see
The tell tale signs that you have left all over me.

God dammit Amy.
You'll always remind me of scars on my arms that I know will never fade.
And it's not like it's something I think about each and every day -
I just occasionally catch myself scratching them, as if they'd ever go away.
But these tell tale signs are here to stay, and in the end you know that's OK.

And wait for rain to come.

When you've nowhere else to go.

But then I remember you,
And the way you shine like truth in all you do.
And if you remembered me,
You could save me from the way I tend to be.

Some days I wake up dazed my dear,
And don't know where I am.
I've been running now so long I'm scared
I've forgotten how to stand.
And I stand alone in airport bars
And gather thoughts to think:
That if all I had was one long road
It could drive a man to drink.

But then I remember you,
And the way you shine like truth in all you do.
And if you remembered me,
You could save me from the way I tend to be.

Because I've said I love you so many times that the words kinda die in my mouth.
And I meant it each time with each beautiful woman but somehow it never works out.
You stood apart in my calloused heart, and you taught me and here's what I learned:
That love is about the changes you make and not just three small words.

And then I catch myself
Catching your scent on someone else
In a crowded space
And it takes me somewhere I cannot quite place.

But then I remember you,
And the way you shine like truth in all you do.
And if you remembered me,
You could save me from the way I tend to be.

I got my pay check from the man
There's not so many jobs that I can get these days
With these marks all over my hands
But I'm gonna take that check
I'm gonna head across the track 
To the wrong side of this town

I'm gonna open the door
I'm gonna bask in the roar
Of that familiar buzzing needle sound

Because the ink in my skin
Where the needle went in
However many years ago
Has left marks on my arms

Everywhere that I go

Some people have one and 
Some have one that they're ashamed of 
Most people think that we're fools
Some people don't get it and 
Some people don't care
And some of us we have tattoos

Oh it's fading, yes it's fading 
Some of the things that I believed back then
Yes my skin has started sagging and 
The ink has started running
And I've got buddy tattoos with people
Who aren't friends
Oh I've even got black X's from when I was straight edge
So crack open a beer friends now
And let's make a pledge

If we had the luck to live our lives
A second time through we'd be sure to get the same tattoos

Frank Turner,"I’ma gonna build myself a time machine
On particle physics and the power steam
It runs on diesel oil and Donnie Darko daydreams
Packed a pair of socks and a hunting riffle
Change of underwear and some snacks to trifle
Scared of going back you know how I’m forgetful

To go back and to see the way things really used to be
Not the way we remember them at all

Packed up, sat in my DeLorean
Like some kind of amateur historian
I’ll visit the Renaissance and the Romans, the Victorians
Drinking in Deadwood in the 1880s
Rock and roll and drive thrus in the 1950s
Trying not to change things so the plot lines don’t get shitty

What if everything were to change completely
If you just saw a replay of the crucial scenes
From the passenger window of a time machine

In truth the real reason that I built this here machine
Was just to travel back a couple of years
To when we first met before the fights and tears
To a time when you and I first got together
Simple days and simple words like “forever”
Dripped off our tongues, come on you must remember

To go back and to see the way things really used to be
Before life quietly dismembers
All the best things about you and I before the doubts
Drowned out all of the mirth and mercy
Come on baby please you must remember

Please remember",Time Machine [*]
Frank Turner,"Sorting through my things the other day
I found an old film camera that I thought I'd thrown away
But there it was covered in dust
I checked it and the film inside still had a few pictures left
So I just snapped it off and then
I found a place on the high street that could still develop them
I dropped them off and clean forgot,
It wasn't until this morning that I picked the pictures up

And there before my eyes in vivid colour
Pictures of her stood smiling bold on the edge of a cliff by the sea
On the south coast somewhere,
Wind in her hair wrapped against the cold

There were many other pictures in the set,
Most of them were taken in the first months after we met
When we were lovers like happy drunks
Stumbling for each other with each step, each breath in our lungs
Pictures of nights from soho bars
A weekend in the country when she bought my sister's car,
Her naked, serene on a hotel bed
Smiling at the camera, her beauty like a word unsaid

And there before my eyes on the glossy paper
Quiet whispers of something I had lost or put aside for the longest time
The hope that I might find some kind of peace

Oh oh oh where did it go go go
I just don't know exactly where I kept it
There right there under the stairs oh please
Darling I swear swear swear that's where I left it
Secret little things that you keep locked away
In a small wooden box that you barely even mention to yourself
It's not exactly hope, nothing quite as simple as youth
Perhaps it's just a way of looking past the truth
We're all fading away
The truth I can see in the very last frame of that long lost roll of film
A picture of me, a young man holding a camera up to a mirror

And there before my eyes in that old reflection a declaration bold
We won't stay gold, all that's left of her and rest
Is a small locked box of undeveloped films and photographs",Undeveloped Film [*]

While her mother has a point, I might resent the implication.
That every boy who plays guitar plays women like Gene Simmons.

4599 broken hearts, and one more you can't get out of your head.

Oh, Chaim Witz, wherefore art though?
Does your mother know who you are now?

Not that I can point a finger, I've been a sinner just the same
Fallen hard in love in motels and by sunrise lost their name.
And I have crept out into cold air in the smallest hours to leave
And in the pockets of my jacket I've kept my last infidelities

A navy coin and a broken plastic compass that someone gave me.
That can't find north anymore. Just like me.

Sprung from cages out on highway nine,

And I can fuck up anything, anything.
It was a wonderful life when we were together,
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing.

Amelie lied to me, this was supposed to be easy.
I found the one damn person to help me fall asleep in the night.
But sleeping gets tiring, and dark reminds me of dying,
And as long as this feeble heart is still beating,
You will find me rushing through every room, switching on all the lights.

The problem with falling in love in late bars
Is that there's always more nights, there's always more bars.
The problem with showing your lover your scars
Is that everybody's lover is covered in scars.

At that moment just before the dawn when everything falls apart.
But baby I didn't mean it, for things to get desperate.
I let slip my guard, let go of the rudder,
Now we're drifting in the current away from one another.

Brave, and not just standing, but jumping in,
Of making circles into squares, of laying down
The bare facts like a burden I can't bear.
And I can almost find the words, but I can see the way you'd
Fold your hands, speak my name like a curse
Upon your pretty lips, the pressured white behind your fingertips.

And when you see me for all that I am
I couldn't make mistakes to make a difference any more.
I'd throw myself down on my knees, at your hands,
And beg you for forgiveness for my fuck ups and my faults.
And maybe you'd relent and return my hope for our forever,
Lift up your precious hands, and then bring yours and mine together,
So just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather.",Plain Sailing Weather [#]

The world was revealing a transmission so real that she understood everything
You're still alive, you're still alive

In the loft of a Hampshire family home
Came alive, came alive, came alive
And so the poor old amateur operator thus became the only person to hear
Christa's last desperate communique
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive

It came as some surprise to realise what he didn't catch everything
The world was revealing a transmission so real that he understood everything
You're still alive

The darkness up above
Led me on like unrequited love
While all the things I need
Were down here in the deep blue sea
The darkness up above
Led me on like unrequited love
While all the things I need
Were down here in the deep blue sea
The darkness up above
Led me on like unrequited love
While all the things I need
Were down here in the deep blue sea
All those years, all they are
The truth on my radio
So now I keep a global silence for my silent key
My silent key
My silent key
My silent key",Silent Key
Frank Turner,"So this song's for Josh

Why didn't you call?
My phone's always on
Why didn't you call?
Before you got gone

And I can't say for certain what I would have said
But now I am helplessly silent instead
There's a hole in my heart and in my head
Why didn't you call?

Why didn't you say something, on the last time we met?
Why didn't you say something? There's always hope left
And I can't say for certain what I would have done
But I can't do anything now that you're gone
And it kills me to think that for a second you felt alone

Now you can measure the mark of a man on the day that he died
In the mixture of memory and wreckage that he leaves behind
And I know you were carrying too much weight on the evening when you slipped away
But I loved you like a brother, man, and I never really had a chance to say

So at half past nine each evening, I'll think of my friend
And at half past nine, I'll remember you were better than your end
'Cause I too have stood up on that ledge,
But I know you'd have pulled me back down from the edge
And I let you down in your darkness, I wasn't there

So I'll remember you making a hole through the kids in the crowd
And I remember you lifting me up, each time I fell down
And I'll glance at the barrier when I'm watching the band
And I'll expect to see you there stood on the foot stand

But I guess I will see someone else
That's when I'll whisper to myself
Brother I miss you like hell

Thanks very much
That's for Josh Burdette
Let's hear it for Josh, come on",Song for Josh [Live]
Frank Turner,"We had a difficult winter
We had rough few months
When the storms came in off the coast
It felt like they broke everything on us at once

It's easy enough to talk about Blitz spirit
When you're not holding the roof up and knee deep in it
And the pictures and the papers got ruined by the rain
And we wondered if they'd ever get dry again

But I don't want spend the whole of my life indoors
Laying low, waiting on the next storm
I don't want spend the whole of my life inside
I wanna step out, and face the sunshine

We lost faith in the omens
We lost faith in the Gods
We just ended up clutching at the empty rituals
Like gamblers clutching long odds

And I don't care what the weatherman is saying
Because the last time that I saw him he was on his needs knees, he was praying
And the preachers and the scientists got soaked just the same
And we wondered if we'd ever get dry again

But I don't want spend the whole of my life indoors
Laying low, waiting on the next storm
I don't want spend the whole of my life inside
I wanna step out, and face the sunshine

So open the shutters, raise up the mast
Rejoice, rebuild, the storm has passed
Cast off the crutches, cut off the cast
Rejoice, rebuild, the storm has passed
Rejoice, rebuild, the storm has passed

I don't want spend the whole of my life indoors
Laying low, waiting on the next storm
I don't want spend the whole of my life inside
I wanna step out, and face the sunshine

I'm not gonna live the whole of my life indoors
I'm gonna step out, and face the next storm",The Next Storm [Original Demo]

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.

It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say

Must have been part of the game,

Footsteps that you hear down the hall

Ich geb' ein Fick drauf, was ihr Wichser denkt
Das ist heiße Ware, bin der Stoff an dem ihr Fixer hängt
Und dein Charakter, es ist nichts außer Fantasie
So wie Frank im echten Leben sein, das schaffst du nie
Du willst Flow, ich hab' Cashflow und Portemonnaie
Louis-V-Portemonnaie, trink Chardonnay
Genug gelabert, Taten haben Konsequenzen
Ihr seid Stricher, keine Rapper oder Kontrahenten
Zieh' deine Airmax aus, du bist ein Knecht am Block
Electro Ghetto Fler kommt mit Rap Electro Ghetto Shock
Du bist in Wahrheit nur ein scheiß Tourist
Ein scheiß Jurist, einfach, weil du scheiße bist
Südberlin, das Leben hat kein Ehrsystem
Ihr ganzen Bodyfreaks, es fällt mir schwer, euch ernst zu nehmen
Ihr wollt Gangster spielen, ihr fickt hier mit 'nem Gangster
Studentenrap-Massaker in der Mensa

Ich bin am Machen, ihr strichert nur auf Partys rum
Braune Gesinnung? Nur braun nach dem Solarium
Ich fick den Mittelstand mit meinem dicken Schwanz
Farid Bang, Anabolika macht pickelkrank

Frank White,"Du bist nicht bereit dafür, auf diesen Stress hast du kein Bock
Mach mal lieber deinen schönen 9 to 5-Job
Du bist kein echter Rapper nur weil du paar Reime hast
Für den Rapper-Lifestyle habt ihr Hurensöhne keine Kraft
Du kriegst kein Feature, ich hab kein Label mehr
Doch fahr' mit dem Range Rover, schau wie ich mein Geld vermehr
Ich hab gelernt, dass die meisten Menschen Träumer sind
Dieses Land will keine Stars, glaub mir dieses Deutschland spinnt
Deine Banger-Freunde, sie rennen zum Arbeitsamt
Alles was du rappst ist fake, erkenn' endlich die Wahrheit an
Das hier ist Leichtigkeit, jeder Tag ein Businessmove
Ja ich kann verstehen warum jeder von euch mich verflucht
Was weißt du davon, Kaugummis mit Hunnis zahlen
Erstmal deine Schwester ficken, dann vor deiner Mutti prahlen
In der Schule war ich niemals Klassenbester
Heut ist bei mir jeden Tag Silvester

Geh weiter zur Schule, gestalte deine Freizeit
Doch um Gottes Willen denk jetzt nicht dass ihr bereit seid
Rap nicht über Straße und versteck dich dann aus Feigheit
Später wirst du merken dass ihr Wichser nicht bereit seid

Yeah, jetzt hab ich krass Money, scheiß auf dein Fach-Abi
Ich hab Karat und ihr Karotten, ihr Bugs Bunnys
Ihr seid geliefert wenn ich nicht mehr auf Bewährung bin
Schau mich an, breit gebaut, Junge die Ernährung stimmt
Und ich steh grade, treff' meine Entscheidung
Gangster-Bizz die Lederjacke ist keine Verkleidung
Ich werf' es weg, ihr hebt es auf, den nächsten Trend
Meine nächsten Schuhe, nächste Hose, nächstes Hemd
Was für harte Jungs? Bei dir reicht 'ne Backpfeife
Wenn ich dich anschreie folgt danach 'ne Anzeige
Ist das der Dank dafür, dass sie nicht von Hartz leben?
Soviel Stress, keine Ruhe und Privatsphäre
Du nimmst das Geld von Papi, ich investier' mein Leben
Nie im Leben, wärt ihr breit soviel zu geben
Denn das Fazit: Du bist nicht bereit dafür
Doch ich komm klar mit dieser Scheiße hier

Deutscher Rap lässt sich in den Arsch ficken
Ich spritz' deiner Mutter auf die Schamlippen
Es ist Frank, was für Beef, dein Arsch, er wird jetzt aufgerissen
Stück Scheiße, deine Hurenmutter hat dich ausgeschissen
Angeklagt, 6 Monate Bewährungsfrist
Dein Vater denkt, dass das Sperma seine Ernährung ist
Du trainierst wie ein Opfer auf der Hantelbank
Zwischen deinen Beinen baumelt nur ein Transenschwanz
Ich bin Frank, involviert, wenn Stress abgeht
Deshalb bin ich auch der meisterwähnteste auf RapUpdate
Zu wenig Gangster, zu viele Justin Biebers
Silla bettelt jeden Tag für ein paar schwule Features
Deine Ökomutter, sie trinkt Hagebuttentee
Ich schau sie an und kann in ihren Augen die Nutte sehen
Alles Schwuchtel zehn Wochen Programm
Du Hundesohn bist gegen mich nur ein gebrochener Mann

Zieh' das Koks vom Spiegel, Junge, ich bin drauf

Diese Szene ist für mich ein riesen Hassobjekt
Weil jeder zweite jedem dritten hier das Arschloch leckt
Alles Pussys, red nicht über mich, du Kek
Wisch dir lieber mal aus deinem Face die Wichse weg
Ich mach Realtalk von Brutalität
Du machst Realtalk, erzähl, wie man als Hurensohn lebt, yeah
Ich bin Gangster mein Spiegelbild ist voller Koks
Ansagen auf Facebook, niedlich, wie ihr Opfer droht
Fotze, mach hier nicht auf intellektuell
Die ganze Szene, sie ist für mich metrosexuell
Arrogante Spasten, unloyale Ratten
Während Felix bei mir bläst, kriegt er Klatsche auf den Nacken
Der Tag wird kommen, du startest dein Coming-out
Man nennt dich Bang, weil sie dich bangen mit 'ner geballten Faust
Deutscher Rap ist eine schwule Plage
Bald gibt es Kugelhagel,  Maskulin

Zieh' das Koks vom Spiegel, Junge, ich bin drauf

Frank White,"Jeder Rapper in seiner Ecke? Jeder Rapper in seiner Ecke? Ey! 
Laufen die Kameras? Yeah, yeah! 
Okay, wir haben drei Runden, acht Bars, 
Schlagabtausch, Fler geht als erster rein, 
Frank kontert! Seid ihr ready? Jeder Rapper ist ready?
Okay, let's go!

Yeah! Willkommen zu einem weiteren Battle bei 
„Spit am Samstag!“ Wir haben den Herausforderer
direkt aus Schöneberg, Frank White
und den All-Time-Champion, Fler!

F-L-E-R!
Ich bin Fler, dieser Frank muss keine Welle schieben
Du bist wie deine Fans auf Aggro-Hip-Hop hängengeblieben
Hauptschüler, der mit Collegejacke einen auf Gangster schiebt
Ich vergrab dich hier in Westberlin, rest in peace!
Fick deinen Ghettorap, weil jeder Zweite Drogen tickt
Dein sogenannter bester Freund macht CCN jetzt ohne dich
Du kannst hundert Rapper dissen, doch du bist nicht krass
Komm, ich zeig dir, wie man Business macht!

Du bist ein Hurensohn, dein Label war verschwendete Zeit
Animus, Silla, Jihad, alles Penner am Mic
Fick dein Auto-Tune-Trap und dein Chris Macari
Du kannst auf Ami-Rapper machen, doch du bist nicht wie sie
Du bist ein ehrenloser Bastard, du bist nicht stabil
Du und Kollegah, ihr seid beide gleich, psychisch labil
Und das einzige Fazit ist, dass du Farid disst
Und gleichzeitig Nazi bist! Du Kek!

Macht Lärm für die erste Runde! 
Für beide Rapper in dieser ersten Runde! 
Shit! Runde zwei! Frank, bist du bereit? Fler geht rein! Let's go!

Beiß nie die Hand, die dich füttert, ich war euer Hartz IV
Du bist wie Silla, laut Vertrag gehört dein Arsch mir
Und wenn ich will, dann bist du morgen wieder Backup-Rapper
Sowie Hengzt, der kleine Möchtegern-Messerstecher
Die ganzen Newcomer nerven mich mit Businessfragen
Weil sie noch Windeln tragen, ich bin hier im Kindergarten, äh
Du willst battlen? Battle mal mein Rechtsanwalt
Deutscher Rap ist 'ne Geschlechtskrankheit

Change!

Halt dein Maul jetzt gibt's Kugeln durch die Windschutzscheibe
Du rennst weg, wenn ich komme und wie ein Pitbull beiße
Du bist kein VIP, Möchtergern-Prominent
Einmal in den USA und denkt, er wär ein neuer Mensch
Dich zu battlen ist für jeden Rapper kinderleicht
Ich hätte Farid längst getötet für den Klingelstreich, oh
Du stehst morgens auf und singst die Nationalhymne
Ich zerstöre deine Starwünsche

Oh mein Gott! Es geht heiß her! 
Ach du Scheiße, das ist Spit am Samstag! 
Seid ihr ready für das Finale? Letzte Runde: Flizzyyy Fler!

Game Over!
Du frisst Döner wie ein Penner, ich Entrecôte
Ich mach Geld du hebst jeden Tag nur Hanteln hoch, woohoo
Ich geh zu Stefan Raab, du chillst nur bei 16bars
Deutscher Rap ihr seid alle keine echten Stars
Ich fick Topmodels du bist ein Neandertaler
Du bist Schöneberger ich bin lieber Am'rikaner
Mir scheint die Sonne aus'm Arsch - Yachthafen
Ihr könnt mir alle mal mein Schwanz blasen

Letzter change!

Du kleine Schlampe, kommst vom shoppen aus dem Gucci-Laden
Wenn ich über'n Ku'damm fahre, gibt es nur ein Kugelhagel
Ich bin Frank White, du ein 31er
Guck dich an, du Millionär, du stehst jetzt alleine da
Fick dein Range Rover, was für Deutscher Bad Boy
Jedes Album and'rer Style, ich bleibe mir selbst treu
Und Bushido, er kann CCN mit Eko schreiben
Doch es wird niemals das Echte sein",Fler vs. Frank White

Du machst auf Verarsche, Junge ist nicht witzig

Wir sind Straße, keiner dieser Rapper da ist Straße
Ich werde diesen Studiorapper jagen wie ein Hase
Ich hab Hassgefühle, diese Hip-Hop-Scheiße macht mich müde
Keiner kommt klar mit mir, schieb's auf meine Attitüde

Ghetto-Rap am Mic, meine Fans sind wieder glücklich
Junge, sei mal leise, geh mal zum Friseur
Justin Bieber-Swag, diese Szene ist gestört
Ich mach' Geld mit Gewalt, Brutalität

Jeder macht auf Gee, Facebook erlaubt es
Hier wirst du gefickt, wenn du Famehure laut bist
Steige aus dem Range und krieg' Blicke von den Bitches

Denkt ihr, das war alles?
Und es geht weiter... 2015 ist mein Jahr, du Pussy, okay?
Ich hör die Leute reden „Fler, keiner kommt klar mit dir!“
Man, du Wichser, ja, genau das ist meine Aufgabe
Als Rapper, okay?
Weil diese Schwänze da draußen sind keine Rapper, okay?
Das sind nur Typen die Reime haben, okay?
Die können den ganzen Tag ihre Silben zählen
Aber wer von denen ist wie Frank, hä? Wer von denen ist wie Frank?
Ihr scheißt euch ein, keiner von euch hat seine eigene Meinung
Ihr hüpft von dem einen Schwanz auf den nächsten Schwanz, okay?
Wer bist du, hä? Du hat keine Stadt, du hast keine Gang. 
Du hast keine Geschichte, du Bastard! Ihr seit fake. 
Alles an euch ist fake!
Und alles was ich 2014 gerappt habe, werdet ihr 2015 rappen. 
Und eure hässlichen Fans werden es dann 2022 verstehen
Oh mein Gott, wie seht ihr alle aus, Alter? 
Und an alle meine Ex-Maskuliner, okay? Ein Wort für euch
irrelevant! Hä, wo seit ihr jetzt? Ihr kleinen Wichser! 
Ihr habt die Reste von meinem Teller gefressen! 
Ich schwöre dir alter, ich schwöre dir, glaubt ihr, 
glaubt ihr ihr werdet Gnade bekommen? Keine Gnade
Nicht aufregen Fler,
Ich werde dich suchen und ich werde dich finden. 
Und dann werd ich dich ficken, okay?

Diese Szene,  ist eine Nutte. 
Die Medien, alles Nutten! Diese deutschen Rapper,  die Übernutten,
Yeah!
Damals schon im Heim hieß es, 
„Fler keiner kommt klar mit dir"". 
Dann später, in der Oberstufe, „Fler keiner kommt klar mit dir“. 
In der Ausbildung „Keiner kommt klar mit dir“ 
Meine Mutter, mein Vater ""Fler keiner kommt klar mit dir"". 
Und jetzt kommt ihr, jetzt kommt ihr alter? 
Versteht ihr nicht das keiner was machen kann? Versteht ihr das nicht?
Junge 32 Jahre, Schöneberg, Kreuzberg, Tempelhof, Südberlin was los, hä? 
Und dann kommt ihr, mit euren Röhrenjeans, mit euren
hässlichen Frisuren, mit euren Bärten. 
Was soll das sein? Und das schlimme an euch ist
Ihr habt auch 'ne große Fresse. 
Warum hast du so 'ne große Fresse, hä?
Du hast doch noch nicht mal den Mut der zu sein, der du sein willst! 
Du brauchst doch Typen wie mich, hä? 
Typen wie mich auf den du mit dei'm scheiß Finger zeigen kannt 
und sagen kannst „Da ist der Proll. 
Da ist der Proll!"". 
Aber ich fick' deine Frau trotzdem besser als du
Ich schwör's dir Dicker
Ihr könnt nicht mal richtig laufen
ihr könnt euch noch nicht mal richtig anziehen
Wie wollt ihr eure Frauen richtig ficken? 
Oh shit alter. Und deutsche Rapper, 
die neuen deutschen Rapper
sind wie diese kleinen Schwänze bei McFit
Du bist nicht breit, du bist nicht krass
Du trägst nur dein Gold's Gym Tanktop,
Was soll dieses Tanktop? Wen willst du beeindrucken alter? 
Was soll'n diese 140 Kilo Bankdrücken
alter, die du nicht einmal schaffst?
Ok Fler, cool bleiben. 
Und wenn ihr mich das nächste Mal auf der Straße seht
okay, quatscht mich nicht an. Sagt nicht „Hi, Fler“. 
Weil ich hab mir eure Fresse gemerkt. 
Jede einzelne Kackvisage hab ich mir gemerkt. 
Und irgendwann kommt alles zurück. Glaub mir. 
Und wenn du die Bullen rufst, geb ich 'n Fick. 
Weil mein Anwalt ist der gottverdammte Teufel,
24 Stunden erreichbar, yeah
Was jetzt Junge? Keiner kommt klar mir mir, hä? 
Das hier ist das Outro! 
Sie nennen mich Frank. Iad Aslan, Maskulin",Outro

Redakteure wollen sich zu weit aus dem Fenster lehnen
Noch ein falsches Wort und du siehst vor dei'm Haus den Benzer stehen
Mein Führungszeugnis, es ist dick wie eine Stasi-Akte
Du rennst weg, wenn ich dich auf deiner Party klatsche
Dann ist die Party um, fick dein Gymnasium
Du hast zwar Abitur, doch ich fahr' im Ferrari rum
Ich streck' das Koka, verkauf' es in dei'm Drecksbezirk
Mir passt die Gucci-Lederjacke nicht mehr, Testo wirkt

Ich ficke jeden deutschen Rapper Realtalk

Yeah

Guck dich an, du bist ein lächerlicher Hundesohn
Dein gesamtes Geld für einen Monat ist mein Stundenlohn
Sieh mich jede Nacht am Block hier meine Runden drehen
Zehner, Zwannis, Hunderter, am Treppenhaus die Summe zählen
Keiner kommt klar mit mir, weil ihr nichts vom mei'm Leben wisst
Heut' ist Payback, scheiß auf die Bewährungsfrist
Rapper kriegen Paranoia
Wenn ich ein paar mal feuer', paar mal aus dem Wagen feuer'
Du gehst auf RapUpdate, du kleine Gossip-Bitch
Komm aus der Gosse, Bitch, ein echter Gangster stottert nicht
Fick das Finanzamt, Uli-Hoeneß-Gangsterstyle
Ich zieh' die Fotzen an, ihr zieht alle Schwänze ein

There was nothin' his box won't do

And held it to the light
So I snatched it, all away from him
And I showed him how to do it right

I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I looked like I was deep
I said some mumbo-jumbo, then
I told him he was going to sleep
I robbed his rings and pocketwatch
And everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future, then

I said the price of meat has just gone up
And your old lady has just gone down

To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello she gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
There will never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart
She fills my heart
With very special things
With angle songs
With wild imaginings
She fills my soul
With so much love that anywhere I go
I am never lonely
With her along
Who can be lonely?
I reach for here hand
It is always them

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answer now
But this much I can say
I know I will need her till the stars all burn away
And she will be there

Once that you've decided on a killing 
First you make a stone of your heart 
And if you find that your hands are still willing 
Then you can turn a murder into art 

There really isn't any need for bloodshed 
You just do it with a little more finesse 
If you can slip a tablet into someone's coffee 
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess 

It's murder by numbers  one  two  three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now if you have a taste for this experience 
And you're flushed with your very first success 
Then you must try a twosome or a threesome 
And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less 

Because murder is like anything you take to 
It's a habit-forming need for more and more 
You can bump off every member of your family 
And anybody else you find a bore 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now you can join the ranks of the illustrious 
In history's great dark hall of fame 
All our greatest killers were industrious 
At least the ones that we all know by name 

But you can reach the top of your profession 
If you become the leader of the land 
For murder is the sport of the elected 
And you don't need to lift a finger of your hand 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your A, be	, see, D, E

Hiya friends
I wanna welcome each and everyone of you
I wanna say to you tonight
I feel great
I mean, I feel great
Everywhere I go people are always comin' up to me
And they say mark, mark, mark

Mark are you kiddin'
Lemme tell you this friends:
I am not kiddin'
I mean, I am portly and I am maroon
Well, how many people here tonight can guess what I am?

Aaaah
I can't guess what you are

Well, then I'll give you some clues
And the first clue is
I am portly
Does that help?

Not much
No, I don't know who you are

Okay, I got one
Clue number two:
I am double knit

Does that help?

No, not much
Whaddya mean?

Well, then I've to give you one more clue
I know this is gonna give it away
And I hate like damn to tell you this
But clue number three:

Ich bin maroon!

Ahhhhhhhh you're a sofa!

Once upon a time
Way back a long time ago,
When the universe consisted of nothing more elaborate than
Mark volman ...

Thank you, frank

... trying to convince each and every member
Of this extremely hip audience here tonight,
That he was nothing more, nothing less
Than a fat maroon sofa,
Suspended in the midst of a great emptiness
A light shined down from heaven (* twinkling sounds *)

And there he was ladies and gentleman, the good lord
And he took, he took a look at the sofa,
And he said to himself
""quite an attractive sofa""
""this sofa could be commercial""

With a few more margaritas and the right company

However, I digress
""what this sofa needs"" said the big 'g'

""is a bit of flooring underneath of it""
And so in order to make this construction project possible,
He summoned the assistance of the celestial corp of engineers,
And, by means of a cute little song in the german language
(which is the way he talks whenever it's heavy business)
The good lord went something like this:
(take it away jim pons!)

Gib zu mir etwas fussbodenbelag
Unter diesen fetten fliessenden sofa

Everybody!

Gib zu mir etwas fussbodenbelag
Unter diesen fetten fliessenden sofa

And of course ladies and gentlemen that means:
""give unto me a bit of flooring under this fat floating sofa""
And sure enough boards of oak appeared throughout the emptiness
As far as vision permits,
Stretching all the way from belfast to bogner regis
And the lord put aside his huge cigar
And proceeded to deliver unto the charming maroonish sofa
The bulk of his message
With the assistance of a small electric clarinet
And it went something like this...

Take it away jim pons!

Gib zu mir etwas fussbodenbelag
Unter diesen fetten fliessenden sofa

Everybody!

Gib zu mir etwas fussbodenbelag
Unter diesen fetten fliessenden sofa

And of course ladies and gentlemen, that means:
Give unto me a bit of flooring under this fat floating sofa

And sure enough boards of oak appeared throughout the emptiness as far as vision permits, stretching all the way from belfast to bagner regious and the lord put aside his huge cigar and proceeded to deliver unto the charming maroonish sofa the bulk of his message with the assistance of a small electric clarinet and he went something like... this:

Sort of drifted along into S&M

Hate was a pall bearer

Now I'm sad and I'm blue

Frank:
My name is nando,
I'm a marine biologist.
All my friends,
They call me ""doh"".

Ike & mike:
Hi, doh!

Frank:
All my family,
From someplace in this area,
And they complain if I talk about this horrible pizza
During the show.

All:
Come out here, to californy,
Just to find me some pretty girls.
Ones I seen gets me so horny,
Ruby lips, 'n teeth like pearls.

Wanna love 'em all, wanna love 'em dearly.
Wanna a jellyfish, I'll even pay.
I'll buy 'em furs, I'll buy 'em pizza,
I know they like me, here's what I'll say:

(1971:)

Jimmy carl black:
I'm lonesome cowboy burt.
Speakin' atcha!
Won'tcha smell my fringe-why shirt?
Reekin' atcha!
My cowboy pants,
My cowboy dance,
My bold advance
On this here waitress...

Mark & howard:
He's lonesome cowboy burt. a-ha!
Don'tcha get his feelings hurt.

Jimmy:
Come on in this place
An' I'll buy you a taste.
You can sit on my face.
Where's my waitress?

Mark & howard:
Burtram, burtram redneck!
Burtram, burtram redneck!

Jimmy:
I'm an awful nice guy.
Worked all day in the sun.
I'm a roofer by trade,
Quite a bundle I've made,
I'm a unionized roofin' old son-of-a-gun.

Mark & howard:
He's a unionized roofin' old son of a gun!

(1988:)

Ike:
""darling, I crazy go nuts when I hear this,
You know what I'm sayin'? ""

Frank:
When I get off, I get plastered.
I swim till I fall on the jellyfish.
Then I find me some academic kind of illustrator,
I describe the little dangling utensils on this thing,
And tell him to draw it up
So it looks just like a brand new jellyfish.

Ike & mike:
(trying to follow along, they sing some gibberish)

Frank:
""take that! take that!""
I fuss an' I cuss and I keep on swimmin',
Till my snorkel puffs up an' turns red.
I drool on my shorts,
I do some water sports,
Then I take the jellyfish back to my house
And stick it in the bed! ""sorta...""

Ike & mike:
""whaddya do? ""
Stick it again in the bed!

Frank:
""that's right!

Ike & mike:
Stick it again in the bed!
Stick it again in the bed!
Stick it again in the bed!

So down, down, down, down...
Down will come Baby,

Right from the start.
I gave you my true love,
For I wasn't smart.
But you took advantage
And broke my heart.
An' down, down, down, down...
Down went my soul
An' you threw away my heart.

Don't make me cry for you.
Don't make me die for you.
I never thought it'd be like this.
But in the end you see,
You took the best of me.
So down with all...
Down came my heart.

Ha!
Oh!

There was a man
A little ole man
Who lived in Montreal
With a wife and a kid
And a car and a house
And a teenage daughter
With a see-thru blouse
Who loved to grunt and ball
And her name was Magdalena

Magdalena

The little ole man
Came home one night
To his house in Montreal.
He caught his daughter
In the blouse by the light
And he said to himself:
""She looks all right!""
And he reached for a tit
And grabbed it tight
And threw her up
Against the wall
(Blue cross!)

My daughter dear, do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near.
My daughter dear, do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near.
I work so hard, don't you understand
Making maple syrup for the pancakes of our land.
Do you have any idea?
What that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?
Do you have any idea?
What that can do to a man?

The little ole man
With the grubby little hand
Who lived in Montreal
Was drooling a bit
As he reached for her tit
And he said to himself:
""This is gonna be it!""
But the girl turned around
And said: ""Go eat shit!""
And ran on down the hall.
Right on, Magdalena!

Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena,
Daughter of the smog-filled winds of Los Angeles,
I'd like to take you in the closet and take off your little clothes until you are virtually stark raving nude,
Spread mayonaise
And kaopectate all over your body and take you down to Hollywood Boulevard and we can,
We can walk down the streets by the stars that say Jon Provost and Leo G. Carroll together, baby.
We can go dancing up at the Cinegrill
Can't you see it: Frank Pernell and us, until dark,
Don't you understand, my baby?
I didn't mean, I didn't need, I mean, it was so hard for me, I just...
I saw you standing under the Shell pest strip late last night,
In the light,
With your little nipples protruding through your little see-thru thingie, and I just said, ""My god,
My god, I gave my sperm to this thing!"" And now I just,
Oh, you got me so hard, I just,
I don't know what to do, Magdalena, don't you understand? So I grabbed you, but,
But don't hold it against me, I mean,
Your mom will never know, baby, and I wantcha to come back to me,
I mean, do you understand me? I want you to...
I'm down on my knees to ya, Magdalena! I wantcha ta walk back to me, baby,
I wantcha to turn around by the Sparkletts machine.
That's it! That's it! In the little chartreuse hallway with the little neon Jesus picture on the wall,
And I want you to step, baby,
I want you to walk back in your five inch spike heels that you got at Frederick's,
Same time you and your mommy got that crotchless underwear last year for Christmas,
And I want you to stroll back to me, baby
Walk back, baby, don'tcha understand me, baby?
I want you to walk back
I'm down on bended knees, baby
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I wanna take off your little training bra
Don't you understand me?
I'm gonna take off you little maroon hot pants
I'm gonna get down on my knees, baby, dont'cha understand what I'm saying to you?
Your mom will never know, she's playing bridge with the girls,
And you and I...
You and I go sucking som'thing, baby,
It's just you and I, don'tcha understand?
We can make love all night long,
Nobody will ever know,
Come on, Magdalena!
Please, little girl,
Walk back to your daddy,
What did I do that was so wrong?
My God, I was only following the sexual impulse like I heard on the Johnny Carson Show from a book or something I wrote,
I didn't know what I was doing
I got carried away
What can I say like, like...
Walk back, baby,
Come on,
Oh, please, you gotta walk back, baby, walk back,
Walk back to your daddy!
Come on, Magdalena, to your daddy, baby, you gotta walk back, baby, walk back,

WALK!
Walk to your daddy,
Come on down, stroll it around of me,

Frank Zappa,"The mystery man came over
And he said I'm outta sight
He said for a nominal service charge
I could reach nirvana tonight
If I was ready, willing and able
To pay him his regular fee
He would drop all the rest of his pressing affairs 
And devote his attention to me

But I said look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Now who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me

The mystery man got nervous and he fidget around a bit
He reached in the pocket of his mystery robe
And he whipped out a shaving kit
Now I thought it was a razor
And a can of foaming goo
But he told me right then when the top popped open
There was nothin' his box won't do
With the oil of aphrodite, and the dust of the grand wazoo
He said you might not believe this, little fella
But it'll cure your asthma too

And I said look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Now what kind of a guru are you, anyway? 
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me
(Don't waste your time)

I've got troubles of my own, I said
And you can't help me out
So, take your meditations and your preparations
And ram it up your snout
But I got the crystal ball, he said
And held it to the light
So I snatched it, all away from him
And I showed him how to do it right

I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I looked like I was deep
I said some mumbo-jumbo, then
I told him he was going to sleep
I robbed his rings and pocketwatch
And everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future, then
As long as he was hanging around
I said the price of meat has just gone up
And your old lady has just gone down

Look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Now is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho? 
Don't you know, you could make more money as a butcher? 
So, don't waste your time on me
Don't waste it, don't waste your time on me (om shanti, om shanti, om shanti, shanti)",Cosmik Debris [Basic Tracks – Take 3] [Take]

Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

They cursed and buried him
Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning Hell-unholy one
But now he's returned to prove them wrong

Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

And when he finds who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the moon",Bark at the Moon
Frankenstein Drag Queens from the Planet 13,"I crash my ship into the sea
Oh my God, where could I be

A bunch of fucking monkeys
Coming after me

Make it home by tomorrow
And I refuse to die on
This planet of horrors

Here on this planet of the apes
Get your paws off me

And not mention, my voice from me
But they don't realize until I say

My name Pedro
My name Cisco

You've got me, hook, line, and sinker
Just like a fish on a hook
You better pull the line in
Baby, I can't win

I've got it bad
And I feel so glad
Just look what one...
Just look what one...
Just look what one kiss can do

Better than one heart
Four lips are sweeter than two
Come close to me
Let's kiss and see
What togetherness, can do

Better than one dream
Four arms can make them come true
Let's pool our love
Follow the school
Love togetherness, right through

Everybody knows
Between us, we'll have
Twenty fingers, twenty toes

She thought it was best to just run away

And out here nobody's buyin' that anyway

Sharin' troubles, some pain, and a pack of cigarettes
She took his hand, and off they went
Cause she knew what he meant when he said

Baby we both got walls to break through,
But you ain't got wheels and I sure ain't got wings
Well baby I know that I can save you, if you can rescue me

His arms, her touch, their trustin' each other
They both got somethin' they can't live without
Some days they fight, but those nights 
They love harder and harder, still there ain't no doubt
The hurt gets healed, the tears all dry

Frankie Ballard,"I was headed north on Highway 5
On a starlit Sunday night
When a pick-up truck flew by me out of control
As I watched in my headlights,
He swerved left and then back right
Never hit the brakes as he left the road

I found him lying in the grass among steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
Through the blood and tears, he whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died

And he said, ""Don't tell mama I was drinking
Cause Lord knows that her soul would never rest
Now I can't leave this world with my mama thinking
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath""

I still think about that night
And how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay for our mistakes
Well the last thing on his mind
As he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break

And he said, ""Don't tell mama I was drinking
Cause Lord knows that her soul would never rest
Now I can't leave this world with my mama thinking
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath""

Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in,
Said, ""I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean.
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees.""

Burned me up and down, no way to cool it.

Hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud.
You gave me that look, you licked them lips.

Spend my weekends in a swing out on the wrap-around
Oh but these days, I'm on a mission
To get these wild oats out of my system

Yeah I might stay out all night
I gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right

I wanna sit out on the porch telling stories bout my glory days
When I'm pushing eighty
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Now I might have to kiss, no tellin' how many lips
Before I ever really figure out what love is
Go through some heartbreaks, wake up with headaches
Don't learn nothin' til you make a lot of mistakes

How will I know where to draw the line
If don't cross it a few hundred times

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

And we're dancing to the tango we loved when first we met
While the music plays, we recall the days
When our love was a tune that we couldn't soon forget

And maybe I'll say maybe

May be you'll think of me

Never roll a dollo 'cause my crew got my back

Till I cop back  react  leave 'em laying on they back 
Sometime I try to maintain and chill 
Stop my brain from thinking, restrain from grabbing my steal 
I'm stressed out, trying to live right on the wrong route 
Thinking of ways to get loot in large amounts 
So I chill on the block, nigga respect mines 
?A giver wit the nets? and the muthafucking tech nines 
So pack steel if you come through, front if you want to 
Before you do, so let me warn you

Shoot it up in black attire, hit you wit the rapid fire 
The stainless bisket will leave your brain smoking 
Your whole frame broken and clothes soaken, head blown the fuck open 
Try to step inside of fort and get caught 
Wit the trey pound shorter left on the sidewalks of New York 
The decompose, blood flows are holes in your clothes, eyes closed 
Body be frozed, posing for pictures with a rose 
Head to your toes, look like you got wetted with a hose

Shooked, using ice grilled looks for they protection

Damage your conscience, totally fuckin your sleep up

That make us income, of the victims 

Freaky deaky, blow your Platoon to Twins with Dangerous Minds

Bang the head like a car wreck collision

Frankie Eldorado,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Now ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes",Ain't That Peculiar
Frankie Ford,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Frankie Ford,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride

In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Wendy let me in I want to be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs round these velvet hips
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know out how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, wanna to know if love is real

The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I want to die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss

Oh, oh, oh
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl I don't know when we get to that place
That we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
But till then, baby we were born to run
Baby we were born to run
Tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Oh oh oh

Frankie Goes to Hollywood,"Do you know the way to San Jose?
I've been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

You can really breathe in San Jose?
They've got a lot of space
There'll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

There's got to be a better way-yeah
What is it good for? (war)

Man has a sense for the discovery of beauty
How rich is the world for one who makes you for us to show
Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, good god, now, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing
Say it again, war, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing, listen to me
War, it ain't nothing but a heart breaker
War, friend only to the undertaker, war

Would I be the only one
To with again if only I could take your pain away
And think of better, better things to say
The highest price I'd gladly pay
For you to live, just golden days, golden days, golden days
So celebrate the moment now, have all that you desire

[Chorus:]
We'll keep each other warm, together we'll weather the storm
The children are dying and nobody's crying
There's got to be something out there, someone who cares
Got to be something out there

Give me real life, the worry and the strife
I'll throw it out of the window, to the dogs below
So come with me I'll guide you through wardrobes of fantasy
And treasure chests of what could be
A world without anxiety
A legacy of golden days, golden days, golden days
Leave it all behind the blind leading the blind
Have all that you desire

Gotta be, gotta be someone out there

Let's break the rules scattering the jewels
Of joy amongst ourselves
The lonely, lonely of the shelves
Feel good about yourself, I'll drink to your health
Have all that you desire

[Chorus]

I'm looking for something, and I don't know what it is

This wasted land is gone now and
Swept away , swept away
Better not let the side down
Whirlwinds of time

We can build an ocean
Of hope despair to drown
Sail upon the waves a crashing
Devils to the ground
I'll follow you to fires of hell
And cast my soul in wishing wells
The colours of the sheddred sky
Hear the children sing

Kill the pain, we'll never be the same again
Once we have changed the nature of the game
Of the game
Breaks the chains we can rise up again
Once we've rearranged the nature of the game
Of the game

Don't you forget
What you give is what you get
Take love away there's nothing
Better not let the side down
So God on high has opened up the sky
Up the sky

We can build an ocean
Of hope despair to drown
Sail upon the waves a crashing

I'll follow you to fires of hell
And cast my soul in wishing wells

Kill the pain, we'll never be the same again
Once we have changed the nature of the game

Break the chain we can rise up again
Once we've rearranged the nature of the game

We're all walking through the fire
Walking on the nile
Let your spirit fly

This wasted land is gone now and
Swept away , swept away
Better not let the side down
Whirlwinds of time
Sing

We can build an ocean
Of hope despair to drown
Sail upon the waves a crashing
Devils to the ground
The legend of this dying land
The earth is acorched by devil's hand
This place we love can live again
We rise up and sing

Kill the pain, we'll never be the same again
Once we have changed the nature of the game

Break the chaing we can rise up again
Once we've rearranged the nature of the game

Frankie Goes to Hollywood,"Watching the wildlife
On my way home, the state of Rome
People gliding on the floor
Pleased with life not needing more
Sunset on the river
People go home in the rain
Familiar faces on the train
Running scared, and staying sane

If you live by the sword
Well that's your own reward
So don't walk with me
Watching the wildlife
The beast within you
Eats your heart out
Get free from hate and get in love

Boys in the backyard
The girls are hanging out the lines
Washing the day, wash your troubles away
It's game we have to play
Ghosts are chasing you round
Things that happen in the past
Don't make that mistake again
The sun beats down the streets of passion

If you live by the sword
Well that's your own reward
So don't talk with me
Watching the wildlife
The beast within you
Eats your heart out
Get free from hate and get in love

Your own worst enemy
Get free from hate and get in love

If you live by the sword
Watching the wildlife
Watching you
The beast within you too
Watching the wildlife

Get in love, get in love

Watching the wildlife
We all live in a dream in home
We watch TV and drive a car
We go outside, but not too far
Watching the wildlife
We walk the water like a sun
Living cuts you like a knife
Living here watching the Wildlife

Frankie Hi-NRG MC,"Sono intorno a noi, in mezzo a noi, in molti casi siamo noi
A far promesse senza mantenerle mai se non per calcolo
Il fine è solo l'utile, il mezzo ogni possibile
La posta in gioco è massima, l'imperativo è vincere
E non far partecipare nessun altro
Nella logica del gioco la sola regola è esser scaltro
Niente scrupoli o rispetto verso I propri simili
Perché gli ultimi saranno gli ultimi se I primi sono irraggiungibili

Sono tanti, arroganti coi più deboli,
zerbini coi potenti, sono replicanti,
Sono tutti identici, guardali,
stanno dietro a maschere e non li puoi distinguere.
Come lucertole s'arrampicano,
e se poi perdon la coda la ricomprano.
Fanno quel che vogliono si sappia in giro fanno
spendono, spandono e sono quel che hanno

Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio

e come le supposte abitano in blisters full-optional,
Con cani oltre I 120 decibel e nani manco fosse Disneyland,
Vivono col timore di poter sembrare poveri
Quel che hanno ostentano, tutto il resto invidiano, poi lo comprano,
In costante escalation col vicino costruiscono
Parton dal pratino e vanno fino in cielo,
han più parabole sul tetto che S.Marco nel Vangelo..

Sono quelli che di sabato lavano automobili
che alla sera sfrecciano tra l'asfalto e I pargoli,
Medi come I ceti cui appartengono,
terra-terra come I missili cui assomigliano.

Tiratissimi, s'infarinano, s'alcolizzano
e poi s'impastano su un albero
Nasi bianchi come Fruit of the Loom
che diventano più rossi d'un livello di Doom

Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio

Ognun per se, Dio per se, mani che si stringono tra I banchi delle chiese alla domenica
mani ipocrite, mani che fan cose che non si raccontano
Altrimenti le altre mani chissà cosa pensano, si scandalizzano
Mani che poi firman petizioni per lo sgombero,
Mani lisce come olio di ricino,
Mani che brandisco Manganelli, che Farciscono Gioielli,
che si alzano alle spalle dei Fratelli.
Quelli che la notte non si può girare più,
quelli che vanno a mignotte mentre I figli guardan La TV,
Che fanno I boss, che compra Class,
che son sofisticati da chiamare I NAS, incubi di Plastica
Che vorrebbero dar fuoco ad ogni zingara
Ma l'unica che accendono è quella che da loro l'elemosina ogni sera,
Quando mi nascondo sulla faccia oscura della loro luna nera

Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio",Quelli Che Benpensano
Frankie Hi-NRG MC,"Chicco ha una cicatrice sulla faccia
Sta con suo fratello che si fa chiamare Spillo
E sanno già sparare come dei cowboy

Chicco prova al sole di scaldarsi il cucchiaino
Spillo sta rubando un altro motorino
Il maresciallo guarda l'Italia dentro un bar

Vecchi materassi, copertoni, lavandini, cessi rotti
Cazzi disegnati sul palazzo del cornuto
Gli africani alla stazione, l'avvocato del barbiere
Ancora un altro film di Alberto Sordi alla televisione

Chicco è a casa con la faccia sulla radio
Che trasmette la rubrica dei consigli
E lui vorrebbe chiedere come si fa
A fare una rapina in una banca
E a scappare senza che si slaccino le scarpe
E andare dove non c'è mai nessuno che ti sputa contro
E ti vuol mettere nei guai

Tubi di cemento, scatoloni, pannolini
Sacchi d'immondizia messi come pali dai bambini
L'ambulanza della Croce Rossa, c'è qualcuno che sta male
Il prete prepara la chiesa per il funerale
Per il funerale, per il funerale, per il funerale

Spillo ha chiuso la felicità in un fazzoletto
Ma si è seccata in un secondo benedetto
""Pronto chi parla?""
""Sono Chicco, vieni qua, che questa volta è proprio quella buona
Basta un cacciavite per entrare in paradiso""
""Un cacciavite? Aspettami, che arrivo
Prendo il motorino e in un minuto sono lì""
""Ma ti rendi conto quanti sono questi soldi
E come è stato facile rubarli?
Finalmente ci possiamo comperare quello che ci pare
Spiegami perché non parli""

""Lascia stare, sta un po' zitto, non ho voglia di parlare
Manca poco, abbiam finito e andiamo via
Scappa, presto non fermarti, corri, cazzo, non voltarti
La sirena è quella della polizia""

Chicco e Spillo saltano come due gatti sulla sella
E schizzano tuttamanetta
""Figli di puttana! Non ci prenderete mai!""
""Guarda che casino, guarda dove vai a finire, ho anche freddo
E ho paura di morire: stai attento! Stai attento! Frena!",Chicco E Spillo
Frankie Hi-NRG MC,"Scrivia m la nostra storia usando biciclette
Inseguendo la memoria su strade molto strette
Su per le salite senza avere una borraccia,
Giù per le discese con il vento sulla faccia.

Perché la bicicletta non importa dove porti,
È tutto un equilibrio di periodi e di rapporti,
È tutta una questione di catene e di corone,
Di grasso che lubrifica la vita alla persone.

Come nella vita c'è una ruota che gira,
Una ruote che spinge e con quest'aria che tira
Se una ruota si fora la caduta è sicura
Una toppa ripara, una ferita si cura.

Non avere paura che sennò ti deconcentri,
Devi far coincidere i peso e i baricentri.
L'impegno di coppia per un singolo momento
Due le forze in gioco,un solo movimento

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Se è libero il pignone lo sceglie la corona,
Chi attraverso una catena condiziona
Il moto del sistema monarchia, meccanica
Che ha giurato fede eterna alle leggi della fisica
Statica, termodinamica, quasi democratica

Se quando si ferma si va a ruota libera,
O tirannica, con la fissa dello scatto,
Senza i freni che difendo dall'impatto

E' mansione del pignone fare la rivoluzione,
Portare il movimento in ogni direzione,
In costante acrobazia irradia l'energia
Dal centro fino alla periferia

E' solo una questione di rapporto tra ingranaggi
E tutto gira liscio fino a che non ti scoraggi,
Che l'unico motore qui sei tu con il fiatone
A spingere in salita per la vita il carrozzone

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Sai bene che la storia è ciclica, come la pazienza è biblica
E la peggior salita è una discesa ripida, repentina, tutta tornanti
Serpentina, peso in avanti, giù dalla China
Come una valanga controllata precipiti in picchiata,
Il paesaggio vola dentro a una zoomata
Guardi foce vai, vai dove vuoi
Occhi aperti e sai come stai
Fai come può
Il traguardo arriva quando meno te lo aspetti
È un parcheggio di bici appoggiate ai cavalletti,
Bici abbandonate là, senza controparte
Pronte a ripartire se qualcuno parte

Pronte per andare lontano, cambiando i rapporti andandoci piano
Pensa che una volta una bici fece piangere un uomo
Diventarono amici, lei gli chiese perdono

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta",Pedala [Live] [Live]

I know that we friends but I want much more
I wanna pull you close and whisper in your ear
I need you ma..just stay right here with me

But you always leave before I could open
Up my mouth to speak and I'm left by my self all alone
But I year for the day to complete my soul
And I don't know if it's you but you make me feel

Like the way I ain't felt since my teenage years
But it's more than a crush, more than a lush, cool
It be that I'm fallin' in, naa, it can't be, It can't be that
Only a fool can love someone who don't love them back

And that won't be me
No way, no how but I gotta
Tell you this right now that

Frankie J,"Yo, I wanna dedicate this song to everyone out there
Who's goin' through the same thing, just keepin it real, listen

Well, she was five foot, three, unique with them brown eyes
So beautiful that I had to make her my wife
I put my trust in her, I had a kid with her
I thought that I would be happy till the end with her

So you live an' learn, that's what you had told me
And now I'm feeling so miserable and lonely
I should've listened to your words
I should've listened to your words

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation, I be goin' through
From a friend to a friend, you would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I thought that she loved me
She wasn't good at all, I really, really thought she cared
She wasn't good at all, how could I have been such a fool
To never listen to your words, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I should've never, never, never stayed with her, yeah

I told you from the beginning about this girl
That she only come and play some games
And I know she didn't feel the same

Because I seen it in her eyes man
That she's only out for your money
Now usually I won't say a word
But I know about these type of girls

These type of girls they come and go
Remember when we told 'em about it
When I told you that she wasn't down
That she wasn't about it

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation you was goin' through
From a friend to a friend, I would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know you knew but I never listened to you, no
She wasn't good at all, you know she wasn't down with you
She wasn't good at all, I should've listened to your words

Yo, we must of had a different vision of love, tender kisses and hugs
Makin' me weak in my knees, that's how vicious it was
I'm from the gutter girl, you know it's vicious for thugs
Where unfamiliar faces look suspicious to us

I used to miss you so much, I put the pimp aside
Broke all my criminal ties, gave you the simple life
Call me the family man, gettin' my salary tight
But soon as you drop your guard, that's when reality bites

And leave a open wound, greed got your cover blown
But I be over you, I'm solitary born
I should of listened an' my boy and I would'd known
You do your thang, I ain't concerned, baby, girl I'm gone

She wasn't good at all, I knew she wasn't good enough
She wasn't good at all, I knew but I didn't care, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know I did this to myself
I know I did this to myself

She wasn't good at all, I tried to warn you 'bout this kinda of girl
She wasn't good at all, I just was so blind by her love
Or at least I thought it was love, yeah

Ooh, on and on
She wasn't good at all
She wasn't good at all, yeah, yeah
I said I'm glad she's out of my life

It's like I dread every time you go
I know that we friends but I want much more
I wanna pull you close and whisper in you ear
I need you ma just stay right here with me

But you always leave
Before I can open up my mouth to speak
Then I'm left by myself all alone
But I yearn for the day to complete my soul

And I don't know if it's you but you make me feel
Like the way I ain't felt since my teenage years
But this is more than a crush, more than a lust, could
It be that I'm fallin' in na, it can't be, it can't be that I

Only a fool can love someone who don't
Love them backhand that won't be me
No way, no how but I gotta
Tell you this right now that

Frankie J,"[Verse 1]
I know that you and I have been through many downs before oh yeah...
But that don't mean the chance 
Has gone away to leave each other more
We've struggled and we've fought
To keep us both between the lines oh yeah...

Through many years we've cried our tears
And always kept our pride aside...so you can't say that...

[Chorus]
We still...
Always argue all the time
Never make love when its right
We still...
Never say we love each other
Always up in one another
We still...
Fight for every little thing
Never ever stop to think that we still...Always loved each other

[Verse 2]
I know at times, you'd believe we would never change..oh yeah...
You said we'd never change...
That it was much to overcome
Much of an obstacle to take mmmm
But you were always one 
To always think the worst of things yeah...

Yeah...yeah..
So it was always me to take the stand
And take the initiative so you can't say that...

We still...fight for every little thing
Never ever stop to think that we still
Always loved each other

So as I'm jumping out the window of my room...

When you and your girl
Just can't pull through...damn..
What's a man to say..
When everything just ain't the same...

[Verse 2]
See I'm trying to find a way out of this misery
Cause only God knows this is not the way I be
I'm just too young to be stressin this ain't right for me
So she better act up
Or I'm gonna straight up and leave...
This is not the first time
That we go through this...
It's 'bout the second, third, fourth maybe even fifth
And I've been trying to work it out
Only with you babe...
So listen close 'cause not all men are the same...

Tu decidistes terminar con nuestro amor why con los suenos que teniamos los dos,
Como quisiera que esto fuera solo un sueno
Porque perderte o olvidarte no era mi intencion
Pero insististes why te fuistes, lejos de mi corazon

why ahora regresas para covencerme a comenzar de nuevo
Que te arrepiente que me quieres que no olvidas,
Que no aguantas el dolor pero ya...

Ya no es igual, ya no es igual, ya no es igual ya no...
Es demasiado tarde para enmendar tu error
Ya no es igual, ya no es igual si todo se acabo why se termino why se perdio,
Que el dano fue tan grave amor
Ya no es igual, ya no es igual dentro mi corazon

Surgian planes de un hogar solo para los dos con illusiones de volverse en realidad
Pero ahora eso se va tan lejos de mi,
Tuve que infrentarme a la verdad,
Despues de tanto tiempo que lo que me hiciste pasar...

Without the sky turnin' into clouds
Without the rain falling down

That you was lying here with me
I still hear you say, ooh yeah
I love the way you say, ooh yeah
But now it's just a memory
Now I'm knowing that it was my fault
By thinking I could brush it off
You always with me saying, ooh yeah

So when it's 5 A.M, I'm checkin' in 
When I check in
Baby I was thinking I was so slick
Knowing that I've done you wrong
But you never know what you've got
'Til what you've got is gone

Gotta try to make it through
Without you
And there's nothing I can do
Come on home baby

I remember coming home that night
Knowing something was right
I was saying, ooh yeah
I'm sure that all her things were packed
And it's just too late to get her back
Didn't even have to read the note
Just to know that your heart was broke
I was thinking, ooh yea
You had more than you can stand
I should have been a better man
Baby I was thinking I was so slick
Girl I was doing you so wrong
You never know what you've got
'Til what you've got is gone

Gotta try to make it through
Without you
And there's nothing I can do
Come on home baby

I'm so sorry for the things I've done
Should've put you number one
But I've been playing myself
'Cause I know that you're all I want
But if you give me one more chance
I'll break it down for you lady
No more playing around
Baby I want to be there for you
Gonna make it through

Frankie J,"Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, yeah
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if I took those words into
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hand and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

More than words is all you ever needed me to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me, yeah
'Cause I'd already know

Past relations they made me 
Into this man that I am 
Knowin now thats it wrong 
It's too late 'cause she's gone 

Gone, gone, gone 
Don't think shes ever comin' back 
It's killin' me 
That I her let her heart down completely 
I should have gave her all of me (she's gone) 
Gone, gone, gone 
She ain't even thinkin' about me, honestly 
Bein strong to carry on ain't easy 
Gotta face it, she's gone, gone 

This house is cold 
It's like doin' time in the pen 
Wondering were she is, and who she with, yeah 
But the hardest thing is there no one else to blame but me 
So I guess I'ma have to take it like a man 
But I dont know if I'll ever love again, yeah 

'Cause this feeling I'm feelin' inside 
Is like a hollow-point though my heart 
I know that it's kinda crazy 
But I feel like I'm falling apart 
Usually I'm so cool 
But I lost it when she walked away 
Lost without her 
And she's gone 

Gone, gone, gone 
Don't think shes ever comin' back 
It's killin' me (It's killin' me) 
That I her let her heart down completely (completely)

She ain't even thinkin' about me, honestly (honestly) 
Bein strong to carry on ain't easy (It ain't easy) 
Gotta face it, she's gone, gone

I can't go on another day 
And I can't even bare to mention 
The very sound of your name 
Without the sky turning to brown 
To keep the rain from falling down (falling down)

Frankie J,"He drops his suitcase by the door
She knows her daddy won't be back anymore
She drags her feet across the floor
Trying to hold back time, to keep him holding on
And she says...

Daddy, daddy, don't leave
I'll do anything to keep you right here with me
Can't you see how much I need you?
Daddy, daddy, don't leave
Mommy is saying things she don't mean
She don't know what she's talking about, somebody hear me out

Father, listen, tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father, save him, I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room, try hard in school
I'll be good, I promise you
Father, Father, I pray to you

Now she hasn't slept in weeks
She don't want to close her eyes 'cause she's scared that he'll leave
They've tried just about everything
But it's getting harder now for him to breathe
And she says

Daddy, daddy, don't leave
I'll do anything to keep you right here with me
Can't you see how much I need you?
Daddy, daddy, don't leave
The doctors are saying things they don't mean
They don't know what they're talking about, somebody hear me out

Father, listen, tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go

I'll clean my room, try hard in school
I'll be good, I promise you

Please don't let him go
I'm begging you so
Let him open his eyes, need a lil' more time
To tell him that I love him more than anything in the world

Frankie J,"Don't remember were we met (All I do know) 
Is that I said hi and she looked me up and down 
(And she said lets go) 
So we went to a spot, out the back, blazin' hot
Clothes come off, it was on, head board broke. Mine was blown. After the session she checked her messages on her cell. All of a sudden her face just froze and her eyes got big as hell. The message said hey baby, surprise surprise, girl I'm free. I'll be home around 3. But it was already 3:15.

Grab your shoes 
(Hurry up) 
Grab your clothes

Hit the street

Believe me he'll kill you 
Leave your number 
I'll call you 
Whatever you just need to 
Just leave 

She said he stood about seven foot nine 
Killed some cat for looking at her and got twenty five to life
And somehow he's out today,and this fool he's on his way
He'll snap your neck and not think twice 
Get your things and goodnight 
Now I ain't trippin, 'cause if there ain't no man I like, I feel 
So I am dragging around ever so slowly
Puttin on my gear, I grab my jeans, off the floor 
And I hear keys in the door
She changes the locks that bought me time
But still this dude is right outside. 
And she said... 

[Chorus:]

She said get under the bed, likes that's a good place to hide 
H kicked in the door, no hello.He just said who's car is that outside.
I looked at him, he looked at me 
I still had one leg out my jeans
Where do I go running through my head, I guess I should've listened when she said

First day at work, girl, I met you
You laid your pretty eyes on me
Right then, I knew it be somethin'
I didn't know what it could be

So I asked if you had a man
And you showed me the ring on your hand
The look on your face when I asked for your name
Your expression said it all to me, yeah

I can't deny, you stayed on my mind
Too bad I got a girl and you can't be mine
But damn, you're so fine
I think it's worth a try, so girl, let's just get down

I won't tell, if you won't tell
I'm tryin' to keep it on the low
Cause if he finds out and she finds out
You know it's gonna end for sure

I remember it was Thursday, yeah
It was the day before we got paid
And I can't front, I didn't know what to say

It was supposed to be business, that's what we both said
We had some drinks, ended up in a hotel bed
I really hope this doesn't get around
So keep it on the low and we can keep on gettin' down

There's no use denying,
I've heard you on the phone

I've even followed you to all the places were you've secertly have been alone

I even know about the times when you would say to me that you was overwhelmed with work,
You had to stay longer working overtime,
But you were always lying,
Baby I might be dumb but I'am not blind

At times I feel like I want to break down inside

I got to find a way out 'cause this is tearing me to pieces, I just want to make it right

Is this what you call love explain to me baby, Is this really what you want from me
(Is this what you want from me)

I'am losing my patience, just hear what I'am saying You don't want to break the family
(Don't break this family)

Is this what you call love
Then you got it all wrong
This isn't the way our lives should be
I just won't allow somebody to become between us

Is this what you call love
Is this what you call love

You come home late at night,
Pretending it's alright, acting like you're doing nothing wrong, As you lay down right
Beside me, inside I'am dying

You just don't understand the pain that you have put me through (just don't understand)

After all the thing I have ever done for you, sometimes I rather be alone
Than have a broken home
Whatever happened to forever, 'cause I still want to know, explain to me you change of heart

Never let none test, one flesh
Niggas there by step 'til death
And we can get back up and we can ball
If we should fall, if we should fall

Through that from a resurrection

Frankie J,"Listen 
I'm the kind of man 
Who really doesn't take the time to understand 
That what I did was wrong 
But girl you forced my hand 
And now girl look at me 
Got people saying 
I'm not that crazy 
OK I take it back 
Whatever it was I said 
Oh girl I take it back 
Where in the hell was I when you started to pack your bags? 
Why didn't you talk to me? 
What about my letters? 
Did you ever get 'em? 

Still smell your scent all in my bed 
I'm at the place where we first met 
And I'm sending you a ticket 
And if you still feel it 
Meet me there 
Cause when I look at me I'm like a puzzle 
Without the pieces I need 
Girl I'm in trouble 
I need you to come and save me 
Oh, I miss my baby 
I need you there 
Say you'll be there 
Ride a jet over seas 
Hotels are on the beach 
To be with you again is priceless 

Now I'm in the room 
Watching the clock every hour waiting to here from you 
I called the airline they said you'll be landing soon 
So I'm on my way 
I got a thousand things in my head I want to say girl 
I love you and I miss 
Would it be too much if I kiss you 
Baby let me paint this picture 
I ain't shit if I ain't with you 
No, no, oh no, oh no

Hotels are on the beach (but that don't mean a thing) 
To be with you again is priceless (if you're not here with me) 

I'm at the airport waiting on you 
Wishing you'd show up 
I hope you do 
If you still believe 
You're my missing piece 
The guard is telling me

Frankie J,"I was coming out my front door. 
When I looked to my left and seen 
The flyest chick I swear I'd ever seen before. 
She must be something special. 
I'd never seen nobody like her ever. 
Everything about this chick was (?) from head to toe. 
And then I noticed that she was smiling at ya boy. 
But before I holla, I gotta make sure that my game is proper. 

The clock is going tic-tac, tic-tac, tic. tac. 
Your about to miss a once in a lifetime shot. 
But I gotta get it straight. to make sure what I say. 
Let her know just what I'm feeling. 

[Chorus] 
What do you do when you finally see. 
The girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams. 
Say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (just look her in the eyes) 
Hey shorty, can I get a minute of your time? 
I know we never met before but I. 
Just say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (cause she only comes once in a lifetime) 

I'm getting ready to step to her, but I noticed her friends 
Was looking at me like they really didn't think I should. 
A lonely man has got to have it. 
He can't let nothing in the world. stop it. 
So excuse me Miss, but can I get your number. 
I think your sexy. can I call you up sometime? 
I get that, baby girl take mine. 
Anytime you wanna call, it's all right. 

The clock is going tic-tac, tic-tac, tic. tac. 
Your about to miss a once in a lifetime shot. 
But I gotta get it straight. to make sure what I say. 
Let her know just what I'm feeling. 

[Chorus] 

I can't believe I found the one right outside my front door. (outside my door) 
It seems like I have heard about this a thousand times before. (a thousand times before) 
So I knew I had to build the nerve, I knew I had to find the words. 
The right thing to say. I just couldn't let you walk away. 

[Chorus] 
What do you do when you finally see. 
The girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams. 
Say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (just look her in the eyes)

I know we never met before but I.

Frankie J,"I got a call late last night from a number I didn't know 
It was so strange I knew who it was from the moment she said hello 
And I paused for a minute 
I couldn't believe it 
I kept my cool so my girl just wouldn't see She said, ""I'm sorry but there's something you
Should know"" 
This is what she said to me, 

""I didn't let you go 
No I can't let you go"" 
She said, ""I'm having such a hard time"" 
Then I heard, ""I didn't let you go 
I just can't let you go"" 
And then she said, ""I think I'm loosing my mind 

""'Cause I still love you 
This I must confess 
I guess I still need you 
I feel I have to tell you this again 
Yes I still want you 
Oh these words I did not plan 
So if I've interrupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again"" 

So I told her my heart felt 
The same that it did before (as it did before) 
Its never changed 
My feelings never went away girl (no) 
My heart never closed the door (no, no it never closed the door) 
Then I stopped for a minute gotta think about my lady 
And what we have going on (what we have going on) 
She's about to have my baby 
Girl, you waited much to long 

I gotta let you go 
I'm hanging up the phone 
This conversation can't go on no more 
I gotta let you go 
'Cause if I don't let you go 
I fear that I met let you know 

'Cause I still love you 
This I must confess 
I guess I still need you 
I feel I have to tell you this again 
Yes I still want you 
Oh these words I did not plan 
So if I interrupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again 

Now I'm doing just fine with my girl 
Not about to let her go (can't let her go, let her go) 
Just because you find me once again it doesn't mean you're coming back home
(doesn't mean you're coming back home)
Now its been about 2 years or so (its been about 2 years) 
Since we went our separate ways (went our separate ways) 
You gotta face the fact we're over with and done 
'Cause I 

'Cause I still love you 
This I must confess, Baby 
I guess I still need you 
I feel I have to tell you this again, Baby 
Yes I still want you 
Oh these words I did not plan 
So if I interrupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again 

'Cause I still love you ('cause I still, I still love you Baby) 
Yes I still need you
(but I better not talk about it 'cause I rather move on with my life and do what I gotta do) 
Yes I still want you (I'm sorry Baby) 
You gotta move on 
So if I interrupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again 

I promise I won't call you ever again",Still

Me levanto perdido
Todo confundido
Sudando
Pensando porque te has ido
Oye Bimbo solo quiere amarte
Mi corazon quiero regalarte
Todo lo mejor de mi quiero darte
Por favor mami no te marches
Al contrario quiero demostrarte
Que despues de la tormenta
El sol vuelve a asomarse
Quiero que sepas
Que si hoy eh de marcharme
Por siempre eh de amarte

Cuando se cansa el invierno en mi interior

Estaba harto de esperar
Andar buscando respuestas

Me hare falta deveras un amigo

Tengo miedo, ayudame
Por favor, ven aqui

Por no haber sido mas sincero en confesarte

Dime quien, quien si solo tu habitas mi corazon 
Dime quien, quien me va a escuchar si tu te vas 
Dime por favor que no te alejaras de mi

De mentiroso why desgraciado why mucho mas 
Why hoy, yo te suplico que me creas 
Cuando te digo que jamas quise fallarte.

Ayo, listen to my story

I planned my getaway, 'cause my shorty she was trippin'
Just trying to get out to breathe a little different air
If you know what I mean, yeah

So as I'm jumping out the window of my room
I hear my homies calling out, they're on the move
Driving Escalades and Hummers with them blades
Hiding behind shades, ready on their way, yeah

So as we driving, we ended up on the strip
We see some hunnies and damn, I just began to flip
'Cause this shorty she be staring straight at me
This sexy fine lady, she be callin' me out now

What's a man to do?
When situations like these come to you, damn
What's a man to say?
When shorty's just drivin' you insane

What's a man to do?
When you and your girl just can't pull through, damn
What's a man to say?
When everything just ain't the same

See I been trying to find a way out of this misery
'Cause only God knows this is not the way I be
I'm just too young to be stressin' this ain't right for me
So she better act up or I'm gonna straight up and leave

This is not the first time that we go through this
It's 'bout the second, third, fourth maybe even fifth
And I've been trying to work it out only with you, babe
So listen close 'cause not all men are the same

So what's a man gotta do? So we work this
I've just about tried almost everything I can
So let me learn you something then you better learn right quick

Perdóname que lo perdimos
Perdóname que no hay ternura
Y cada noche es más oscura

Ni esperanza de dar un paso para atrás
No es tan fácil de olvidar
Y es que sé que no hay manera

Como si no te hubiera amado
Es imposible convencerme que ya no eres para mí

Y no te quiero ver con él
Y no me quieres ver con ella
Prefiero no volverte a ver
Que estar pasando noche en vela
Mejor no nos comuniquemos ni pretendamos seguir igual
Es un problema que no tiene solución
Más que un adiós

Yo sufro de un dolor constante
Por más que trato en reemplazarte
Sus besos no me llenan tanto
Y cada día me trago el llanto

Ni esperanza de dar un paso para atrás
No es tan fácil de olvidar
Y es que sé que no hay manera

Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Frankie Laine,"Granada, I'm falling under your spell,
And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell.
Of an age the world has long forgotten.
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today.

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada,
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wanderr along.
Entranced by the beauty before me,
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song.

And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada,
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada.
For soon it will welcome the stars while a thousand guitars,
Play a soft habanera.
Then moonlit Granada will live again the glory of yesterday,

I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me

Frankie Laine,"It was Montmartre 
It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

Frankie Laine,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence
Frankie Laine,"All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water, cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear, water

Keep a movin', Dan, don't cha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
He spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for me and you

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Water, water, water

Keep a movin', Dan, don't cha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
He spreads the burning sand with water

Frankie Laine,"Jealousy, night and day you torture me
I sometimes wonder
If this spell that I'm under
Can only be a melody
For I know no one but me has won your heart, but
When the music starts, my peace departs

From the moment they play that lovely strain
And we surrender to all its charm again
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy, mystery, pain

We dance to a tango of love
Your heart beats with mine as we sway
Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of
That soft word your cruel lips will never say

I fear that the music will end
And shatter the spell it may lend
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive
But it's only the tango you love

And drove my mother wild
I met a maiden in the woods
And she said child

Look deep into my green eyes 
And at my autumn hair 
When your a man you'll never see a girl
Quite as fair

Remember me oh remember me

Her eyes were green as grassy pools
Lookin right at me
Her hair was red and grown with leaves
Just like an autumn tree

She moved her tiny hands 
And she made a litle turn
She swayed in the wind
Just like a graceful fern

I swore as she vanished 
That when I was full grown
I'd have a girl just like her
To be my very own

And now I am a man
And I'd marry if I could
But I can't lose the memory
Of the girl in the wood 

Remember me oh remember me

Remember for the rest of your life

I wished a hundred times 
That she'd never looked at me 
With the first wild beauty
They only you'd can't see

From those early nursery rhymes . . . 
Through our adolescent times . . .

And how could we go wrong . . . 
With a special song . . . 
That would always . . . see us through?

Our lives without them might be . . . cold and bleak . . . Our favorite song is more than words can speak . . .

Our favorite songs were like a tapestry . . . 
Edged in melody . . . 
They would always be . . . part of you and . . part of me. 

There?s little more to add when . . . songs are sung . . . 
The words and music help . . . keep us young . . . 
And so we?re not afraid of . . . growing old . . . 
With memories . . . let?s hear them, please . . . 
Sweet memories in gold.

Frankie Laine,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Frankie Laine,"When skies are cloudy and grey, 
They're only grey for a day, 
So wrap your troubles in dreams, 
And dream your troubles away. 
Until that sunshine peeps through, 
There's only one thing to do, 
Just wrap your troubles in dreams, 
And dream your troubles away. 
Your castles may tumble, 
That's Fate after all, 
Life's really funny that way. 
No use to grumble, 
Just smile as they fall, 
Weren't you King for a day? 
Say! 
Just remember that sunshine 
Always follows the rain, 
So wrap your troubles in dreams, 
And dream your troubles away.

Take a little walk by the railroad track

Papa's gonna take it to the five and dime

Took the hide right off a goat

Where's your wife
Out to the kitchen, cooking beans and rice

Hey good looking what you got cooking
Hows about cooking something up for me
Hey sweet baby don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe

I got a brand new car and a ten dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
The juke box's jumping the dance is free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me

Hey good looking what you got cooking
Hows about cooking something up for me

I'm free and ready so we can go steady
Hows about saving all your time for me
No more looking, I know I've been cooking
Hows about keeping steady company

I'm gonna pull my date book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
Cause I'm writing your name down in every page.

We're now approaching Newport, Rhode I.
We've been, for years, In Variety,
But, Cholly Knickerbocker, now we're going to be

In High, High So-
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

I wanna play for my former pal-
He runs the local jazz festival.
His name is Dexter and he's good news,
But sumping kind of tells me that he's nursing the blues

In High, High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

He's got the blues 'cause his wife, alas,
Thought writing songs was beneath his class,
But writing songs he'd not stop, of course,
And so she flew to Vegas for a quickie divorce

In High, High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

To make him sadder, his former wife
begins tomorrow a brand-new life.
She started lately a new affair
And now the silly chick is gonna marry a square

In High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

But, Brother Dexter, just trust your Satch,
To stop that wedding and kill that match.
I'll toot my trumpet to start the fun,
And play in such a way that she'll come back to you, son,

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

It wouldn't bother me

If I never sing another song 
Or take another bow 
I would get by, but I'm not sure how 

Always posing, but you love it all 
Though you have to learn to act like you're above it all 
Everything I did the world applauded 
Once upon a star 

Framed citations, hung on every wall 
Got a scrapbook full of quotes, I can recall them all 
There were times I felt the world belonged to me 
And so you see 

If I never sing another song 
It wouldn't bother me

Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.

one who can't move.

opening doors,

the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,

Frankie Laine,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them

Because you come to me

Because you speak to me in accent sweet
I find the roses waking round my feet
And I am led through tears and joys to thee
Because you speak to me

Because God made thee mine I'll cherish thee
Through light and darkness, through all time to be
And pray His love may make our love divine
Because God made thee mine",Because

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.

But no one is waiting any more,

An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin

Frankie Laine,"There is a lonely train called the 3.10 to Yuma

You can see the ghosts of outlaws go ridin' by (Ridin' by)
In the sky (In the sky), way up high
The buzzards keep circlin' the train
While below the cattle are thirstin' for rain

It's also true they say on the 3.10 to Yuma

For fate travels ev'rywhere
Though you've got no reason to go there
And there ain't a soul that you know there
When the 3.10 to Yuma whistles its sad refrain
Take that train (Take that train)

He needs no gold
So they carried me to the hanging tree
To join my dreams and a memory
Yes they carried me to-o the hanging tree

And it happened just that way with me
They took the gold and they set me free
And I walked away from the hanging tree
I walked away from the hanging tree

Frankie Laine,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Frankie Laine,"There's a warm red ecstasy to love 
That makes you tremble with it's fire
And there's a pure white majesty to love
When you have both you have your hearts desire

Can love be as warm as the ruby 
Can love be as pure as the pearl
Just look in the heart of my love for you 
You'll find the ruby and the pearl 

My love will endure as the diamond
And shine with the shimmer of gold
It glows as a bright star above for you
A thing of beauty to behold 
 
Come close and cling to my kiss
Stay close and share the passion that there is
Yes love is as warm as the ruby
And love is as pure as the pearl
Just look in the heart of my love for you

You'll find the ruby and the pearl

Frankie Laine,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along
