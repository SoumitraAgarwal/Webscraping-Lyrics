INXS,"I never knew much
Enough was enough
The reasons were not always there
But the look in your eyes
Hides that surprise
I would never have counted on this

Well lately
You look around
You're wondering what your doing
Yeah lately
You look around
Your wondering what you seeing
What your doing

The taste of your freedom
Was sweeter than love
'Cause you never had a chance to live
Your blue sky calls
To seduce and bewitch
And give you the wings of your fate

Well lately
You look around
You're wondering what your doing
Yeah lately
You look around
Your wondering what you seeing
What your doing

I never knew much
Enough was enough
The reasons were not always there
But the look in your eyes
Hides that surprise
I would never have counted on this

INXS,"Shake make it forever
Curling from you lips
Faith and it's not over
Bring on that famous word

Love don't abuse it
And you'll never be sad again

I'm on my way
I'm on my way

Blood's getting hotter
Thinking about your hips
I feel all the hunger
The minute you turn away

I think it's getting better
But I can't wait another day

I'm on my way
I'm on my way

Make all your wishes
No sooner said than done
Here I come like I told you
Whether it's air, land or sea

She said this is the real thing
'Cause your never gonna find the door

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

INXS,"Yes it's dark sometimes
When the people are shoving
Pushing you into the ground
And you cry in the daylight
With the sun in your eyes
Even though you know your not alone

And it's all been felt before
You stare out through your window
And wonder if there's gonna be more

It brings you down
It's like a war
Who pays the price
If you want more

Quiet desperation of a million lives
Gonna make you change your ways
We got everything we wanted
But forgot how we got it
Just can't paint it golden anyway
And the strength of all you're giving
Is gonna make the changes
Tomorrow's gonna bring a new day

It brings you down
It's like a war
Who pays the price
If you want more

As the years go by
Will it show on your face
Or stay hidden behind some door
Yeah you made your resolutions
With the will of a priest
But your not so sure anymore

And the reasons why you're living
Keep changing
Every time you find a key you find more

[Repeats]
It brings you down
It's like a war
Who pays the price
If you want more",Who Pays the Price
INXS,"Judas kiss
Kiss of betrayal
I will not let it break me
Elation
You come my way come my way
Oh baby oh baby
I will not let it break me

Here you come
My heart breaking
I'm in love
For you and more

This young man
Got a long way to go
Got some thorns
Stuck in his side

Here you come
My heart breaking
I'm in love
For you and more

Judas kiss
Kiss of betrayal
I will not let it break me

Here you come
My heart breaking
I'm in love
For you and more

You come my way

Here you come
My heart breaking
I'm in love

I'm looking at what's on T.V.
Pain and suffering
And the struggle
To be free

It can't ever be denied and I
Never will ignore

I can take it all 

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear

All the fears
And the world seems to disappear

And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
All the things
That you do so well

As the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays

Street corner to corner
With neon ghosts in the city

To fade by itself

Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one

And I thought I was doing no wrong
And I thought I was doing no wrong

In the hour
Of your needs
Lips are trembling
'Cause your gonna be free
Realize what were doing here

Deep in the valley night begins to grow,

From out the shadows something takes my hand,
To lead me homeward through a foreign land,
The silence grown, the palest eyes,
I'm the only one.

How can I run and where to hide?
I close my eyes and hope tonight,
My healing flesh will be all right;
A baby cries, another ghost,
A different side to claim the most,
My blood gone black and down to dust,
So save my soul or let me die,
I'm still alive.

Across the fields of amber,
To the water, ocean far below.

The colour of the evening, never let go,

Don't be caught alone, no, it's only me,
With all the hopes and fears combined,
It's hard to care for living anymore,

Inspired by hunger, fired by lust,
I sold the children's faces, painted gold,
Something moving taking hold,


Is gathering but never growing old,

Believe me, you're not alone,
But with the winter in my bones,
Oh what else can I do now?
It's only me,
I wouldn't let you down again.

Oh and how they moved when I was

All come to practice their party pieces,
Pounding like metal from side to side,
To shoot, to save,
And risk that horizon,
No smoke can shield, it stays unhealed,
Safe in our stillness,
At last we see him rise from out the earth.

I set the silhouette that leaves me scarred,
Lost my condition from the perfect star,
I caught the fire, can't help but see,
There's none to carry on.

With no escape in mind, I'll be resigned,
Inside alone, I know for sure,

IQ,"Singing praises was never a feature
Encouraged in me or my kind.
Every time they remain with my hand to my mouth,
The crowded borders leave me colour-blind;
Pushing me for the death warmed up
And the flowers and fur to parade,
In the time that it takes for the ritual wake
They've broken all the promises they made.
I was driven away to distraction and
Couldn't see we were all laid to waste,
Never sleeping, I saw my abduction from
Solid areas fallen with grace.
I come drifting through the draughting
Dropping out of sight,
I'm not begging for love, I'm empty as I am.
I'm beginning to wonder is the ability too weak?
If this stark interior surrounds me, am I so unique?
Little blue souvenir to remind me of
Restless days when I should have said No,
And you know that I've nothing to share with you
For the chance of the love that we save:
I wanted to be magnificent
For the less-than-a-lifetime of mine,
I forget where I came in,
All I know there's no discipline now.",The Wake
IQ,"Anything we should know about your change? -- Before I was undiscovered
When I was invincible
Nobody could kill the silence
And probably no one will again

Alternatives all pursued

When others were split in two

And I don't remember now
Where I'm supposed to be

They might have agreed to listen
If I didn't lose control
But I was as lost as they were
As still as a heart grown cold

And I don't recall how I became
The one I used to be
I heard the strains of life begin
Within the frequency that night

I walked through the walls

Hold on tight, lives are gonna change
King of his kingdom is surely falling out of range
Stay a while in the present tense
All in good time, you'll find your innocence

Now, as a final fire
Climbs into the single spire
High above the wireless world it hovers

So, as the brightest child
Sinks into the safest arms
Tied against the bomb that hands above us

I could've stayed
If you were mine
If time remained
The reasons would've rhymed

But I don't remember now where I should be
Find me where you don't believe me
There's a warning in between the memories
Can you hear me through the whitest noise

They shield me from danger signs

A dream too many full of memories not my own
They're only shadows, they'll disappear
Their only destination: anywhere but here

There's nothing permanent below me and above
For every time it's all too much, it's not enough
We're unconnected, we're unafraid
We only miss each other from miles away

Tell me again, am I the same when I'm not there?
Gone in a second, impossible to bear

Stronger than friction until our worlds collide

Tell me again, am I the same when I'm not there?
One single moment and changed beyond repair
Hard to remember the way I lived outside
Stronger than friction, the balanced will until our worlds collide

No one ever thought about it
No one had the will to wonder why
Only you refused to die
Now there is no isolation

The raging heart defenses a turning tide

Seen upon the television screen
'Cross the boundaries of my head
Entertained by the dead
Stayed awake to make the morning

Take your time, I can wait

Is this thing going to kill me
And tear my soul apart
If not, it never will be
The one to break my heart open

You're really something good, what's got into you?
This is the consequence of what you've led us to

You take all my opinions, claim them as your own
I don't expect you'll ever let yourself be told
No easy way to say it, you've been bought and sold

Who'll defy me now
And chase the lightning all to soon
What kind of mercy will you gain
Under the shadow of the moon

The shadow of the moon above

And when you know what it's about
You'd stand upon a hollow heel
Those empty eyes look in, not out

And mail it right away

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Nem quero ver mais uns ignorantes,
Eu quero ver gente da minha terra,
Eu quero ver gente do meu sangue.

You were wearing converse
I'm not good at playing it cool
You said I was funny
I spent all my money
Then your friend get thrown in a pool
When we said goodbye
Know that I can't lie
I never thought I'd see you again
That was a mistake and
Now my heart is taken
It's too hard to comprehend

That I'm falling
Hoping that you feel this way too
Said I'm falling
Sitting here waiting for you

Expert of illusion
I just get to use it
Thought I had it all worked out
Love was just a stage name
Watch it as it became
Something I can't live without
Then to my surprise
You opened my eyes
I thought I was empty inside
Now every time you're near
Stormy skies become clear
Now there's nowhere left to hide

From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man
From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of home, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man
God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I can't comprehend
What all this war is for
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man

This I fear, you've left me here
With the mistakes made in my youth
But I'll be strong-though it seems wrong

I just go on wanting your love
There's nothing left for me to say
I've watched my dreams all fade away

I won't hold on to something gone
I'll bear the pain another day
Without a clue I've played the fool

I know this love is gonna stay

I know that we will always be this way

I know you were made for me
Nothing can ever change, it's meant to be
Just like the moon was made for a lonely night
You are my light
Forever in this light

I thought i knew love before
With you i've found there's so much more
More than the love we make
It's the feelings we two can explore
We're just a woman and a man
We'll make mistakes like we all can.
But through it all, you'll see
By your side i will be
Growing closer to you each passing day.

Dipinta di blu
Guarda un punto all’orizzonte
Mentre il sole va giù

I giorni che passano
E volano a sud

C’è una donna in mezzo al mare
Vestita di blu
La prende in braccio un pescatore
Bello come un gesù
E nel suo sguardo si arrende
L’amore purissimo
E senza un perché
Allora gli parla di sé

Dimmi dove si nasconde
La promessa dignità
Questo cielo non risponde
Io anche da qua
Vedo barche sassi e stelle
Case bianche anche lassù
Reti di farfalle in mezzo al blu

C’è un bambino sulla spiaggia
Lasciato dal blu
E una donna in riva al mare
Mentre il sole va giù
Che con la mano saluta
I sogni che passano
E lascia una scia
Che non va più via nell’alta marea

Dimmi dove si nasconde
La promessa libertà
Questi fiori fra le onde
Chiedono pietà
Non più guerre e religioni
Ma un’altra vita un sogno in più

Non ci sono problemi

So che tu mi vuoi diversa
Ma leggere il giornale
Non mi ha mai convinta

Per un pomeriggio insieme
Basta poco e non ti lascio mai

Non mi raccontare
Di cravatte e di camicie
Io ne farei tele
Da mettere in cornicie
Tutto quel che vuoi te lo darei
Ma resta un desiderio acceso
No ti prego non cambiarmi mai...

Non amo le cose da grandi
Non fanno per me
Son come le rose i diamanti
Inutili se
Deludono i mondi confusi e i sogni che ho
Niente cose da grandi
e' tutto quel che so

Non pensare male
Se io vivo di momenti
Rubi sui tuoi anni
Io ne ho appena venti
Mai uguali noi arrabbiarti non puoi
Troppe volte ad aspettarsi

A cercarti nella notte
Amo questa città. Mi manchi
Dolcissimo amore, la notte batte le ore
Ti cerco tra la gente, di questa città

E non sento più il freddo e il caldo
E non capisco più se è rosso o è giallo

Non so stare senza te,
Senza l'anima,oh anima,anima non see'è

Fino a quando ci abbracciamo e poi
Domani non venisse mai, ...ninna Ò...

Quando amarsi fa male,mio dolcissimo amore
Io disegnerò il tuo viso,io posso per te
Dolcissimo cuore che batte nella notte
Batti le ore
Voli sulle case
A un passo da me

I minuti senza te come goccie cadon giù
Senza anima,oh l' anima perchè
Anima sei tu

Un racconto che parla di te
Da quel giorno
Che il cielo era viola
Che eri seduta lì
Non sei più tornata
Sei stata di parola
Non ti sei fermata
Con il vento sei andata

Via da qui
Via da tutto quello che

Intanto molto lontano da qui
Io ti vedo, ora sorridi così
Hai lasciato
E ti chiedi chi hai amato
Non sei più tornata
Sei stata di parola
Non ti sei voltata
Con il vento sei andata

Via da qui
Via dalla notte infinita
Ed una mattina sei uscita
Non sei più tornata
Sei stata di parola
Non ti sei fermata

I swallow mine

Cast you stones to see me fall

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again

For words deep down inside can be seen by the night
The night has a thousand eyes
And it knows the truth apart from one that lies

The romance may have cooled in the past
My love for you will be everlasting and bright
As bright as a starlit sky
And the wondrous night that has a thousand eyes

I've lived my life walking through a dream
For I knew that I would find this moment supreme
A night of bliss and tender sighs

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Will it fade way out of sight

Irene Reid,"Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two

We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to

On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine

I turned me eyes up to the sky and I prayed ""Please help me, Lord,
You know I've sowed my wild oats and now the fun's all gone""

And I put them in my song:

""Infamous Angel come on home
To someone who loves you and knows you needed to roam
Grab your things, a ticket's waiting at the bus depot
For: Infamous Angel, Destination: Home""

I heard heaven's choir rejoicing as the tears broke from my eyes
And all at once it lifted the weight from my past life
I found a pen and I left a note on the dresser drawer
""Infamous Angel, she don't live here anymore""

I went flying down two flights of stairs 'til on the street I stood
And there I took that final look at my old neighborhood
Then I ran down the street proclaiming ""Angel gone for good""

Iris DeMent,"My life, it don't count for nothing
When I look at this world I feel so small
My life, it's only a season
A passing September that no one will recall

But I gave joy to my mother and I made my lover smile
And I can give comfort to my friends when they're hurting
And I can make it seem better for a while

My life, it's half the way traveled
And still I have not found my way out of this night
My life, it's tangled in wishes
And so many things that just never turned out right

But I gave joy to my mother and I made my lover smile
And I can give comfort to my friends when they're hurting
And I can make it seem better for a while",My Life
Iris DeMent,"I traveled high, I traveled low
And there was no place I didn't go
Looking for this kind of happy with you
I had a love, it wasn't right
And I spent so many lonely nights
Yearning for this kind of happy with you

Happy with you, happy with you
I love the things that you do
It took such a long time that I thought I'd never find
This kind of happy with you

Happy with you, happy with you
This kind of happy with you

And some day when I draw my final breath
I'm gonna know I had the best
'Cause I had this kind of happy with you",This Kind of Happy

O what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
I'm born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.

This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
It's praising my Savior all the day long.

Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Watching and waiting, looking above,

The ways, the by ways
He walks through the billows 
Of life's troubled sea
He walks through the cold dark night
The shadows of midnight

Just to guide you and me

God walks the dark hills
To guide my footsteps
He walks everywhere
By night and by day
He walks in the silence
On down the highway
God walks the dark hills
To show me the way

God walks in the storm
The rain and the sunshine
He walks on the billows
On through glimmering light
Helps us walk up the mountain so high
Cross our rivers through valleys
God walks the dark hills
'Cause He loves you and me.

I'm glad Jesus came, glory to His name. oh what a Friend is He

He so freely gave, His own life to save. From bonds of sin set free.


Chorus

And I've got that old time religion in my heart

And its way down inside

I've got that new kind of feeling in my heart

Real love abides

Nobody knows what it means to me

Nobody knows but my God and me

I've got that old time religion in my heart

And its way down inside


What a joy to know one who loves us so

He is so kind and true

Hea has changed my life from all son and strife

He'll do the same for you.

Irma Thomas,"It's so good listening to old records
And think about you
Yes it is
It's so nice

Riding slowly through the park slightly after dark and thinking of you
I know I was flirting with a hurting and now I'm certain
You did the right thing leaving me

But at least when you left you left so many sweet memories
Just like old man river I'll keep right on rolling
It ill never be the same without you

Night time finds me counting diamonds int he sky
And a turn on the stereo with the volume into a lonely low
It's so good listening to old records and thinking about you
It's so nice a fizzling soda on ice

And thinking about you
Memories of you seem to be my favorite pastime
Either I can't or I don't wan to get you off my mind

Could have told me
How could they have told me
What they didn't know

Baby no one
Could have warned me
That you would hurt me so bad
And I sit down and cry 
I sit down and cry
I sit down and cry my heart out 

Never believe
That lips as sweet as yours
Sweeter than honey from a bee
Who would ever believe 
Those same sweet lips lie just like you lie to me

That you would have sold me down the river so fast

So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

I need to get myself away from this place

The reason why
This dream of our survives
Through thick and thin
We're destined for each other
Knowing we can reach the other side
Far beyond the mountains of our pride

If I could hold you
I could let go of the pain

Will you turn my world or is this overrated?
Will you make me weak,

Will you change my mood,

Your the only sound.

Irma Thomas,"Morning rain, it keeps on falling
Like the tears that fall from my eyes, 
Oh as I sit, as I sit in my room
Staring out at the gloom,
Its the rain, its the same old blues

I cant help, I cant help but thinking
When the sun used to shine, shine in my back door
Yes now the sun has turned to rain
All my love is turned to pain
Yes its the pain, of the same old blues

Sunshine, sunshine is all you'll see now
But oh looks like, it all looks like clouds to me
But as I sit, as I sit in my room, 
Just staring out the window looking at the gloom
Oh its the rain, and its the same, same old blues
Its the rain, and its the same old blues

Yes, yes its the rain its the same, the same old blues",Same Old Blues
Irma Thomas,"Yesterday I saw the sun shinin'
And the leaves were fallin' down softly
My cold hands needed a warm, warm touch
And I was thinkin' about you

But here I am lookin' for signs of leaving
You hold my hand, but do you really need me?
I guess it's time for me to let you go
And I'll be thinkin' about you

I'll be thinkin' about you

When you sail across the ocean waters
And you reach the other side safely
Could you smile a little smile for me?

I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you",Thinking About You

What fruit it bares, 
That no one shares, and if my life
Is like the dust, that hides the glow of a rose
What good am I?
Heaven only knows

This bitter earth, it can be so cold
Today your young, too soon your old
But while the voice within me cries
I'm sure someone may answer my call 
This bitter earth, may not not so bitter after all

This bitter earth, can be so cold
Today your young, too soon, too soon your old
But while the voice within me cries
I'm sure someone will answer my call
And this bitter earth, may not be so bitter after all",This Bitter Earth

Sail on, sail on, river, sail on

Irma Thomas,"Sometimes, I wonder just what I am fighting for
I win some battles but I always lose the war
I keep right on stumblin' in this no man's land out there
But I know, yes, I know that there must be a better world somewhere

Flying high, some joker clips my wings
Just 'cause he gets his kicks and he's doing those kind of things
Keep on fallin' into space, either hangin' in mid-air
But I know, yes, I know that there must be a better world somewhere

Every woman I want only wants herself
Everybody I love, loves somebody else
Yeah, every woman got a license to break my heart
And every love affair is over, before it gets a chance to start

If it ain't here, maybe in the year after
Instead of tears, I'll learn all about laughter
Meanwhile, I'm stuck out here, Lord knows it just ain't fair
But I know, yes, I know that there must be a better world somewhere

Every woman I want only wants herself
Everybody I love, loves somebody else
Every woman I know got a license to break my heart
And every love affair is over before it gets a chance to start

If it ain't here, maybe in the year after
Instead of tears, I'll learn all about laughter
Meanwhile, I'm stuck out here, Lord knows it just ain't fair
But I know, yes, I know, hey, I know
That there must be a better world, there sure gotta be a better world
Lord, now there must be a better world somewhere

Striking a match for the keyhole
Dark as the evening laid
When he left you all alone

Turning to fade through the sawgrass
Tall as the only love
That you'll ever really know

Who left you so?

Watching the windows close?
I've not seen you lately
On the street by the beach

I've a picture of you
On our favorite day
By the seaside
There's a bird stealing bread
That I brought
Out from under my nose

Tell me, baby, tell me
Does his company make
Light of a rainy day?
How I've missed you lately
And the way we would speak
And all that we wouldn't say

Do his hands in your hair
Feel a lot like a thing
You believe in
Or a bit like a bird
Stealing bread out from under your nose?

Tell me, baby, tell me
Do you carry the words
Around like a key or change?
I've been thinking lately
Of a night on the stoop

Faded from the winter",Faded from the Winter
Iron & Wine,"Run like a race for family
When you hear like you're alone
The rusted gears of morning
To faceless busy phones
We gladly run in circles
But the shape we meant to make is gone

Love is a tired symphony
Tou hum when you're awake
Love is a crying baby
Mama warned you not to shake
Love is the best sensation 
Hiding in the lion's mane

So I'll clear the road, the gravel
And the thornbush in your path
That burns a scented oil
That I'll drip into your bath
The water's there to warm you
And the earth is warmer 
When you laugh

Love is a scene I render
When you catch me wide awake
Love's a dream you enter
Though I shake and shake and shake you
Love is the best endeavor
Waiting in the lion's mane

",Lion's Mane
Iron & Wine,"We found your name across the chapel door
Carved in cursive with a table fork
Muddy hymnals
And some boot marks where you'd been

The shaking preacher told the captain's man
The righteous suffer in a fallen land
And pulled the shade
To keep the crowd from peeking in

We found your children by the tavern door
With wooden buttons and an apple core
Playing house
And telling everyone you'd drowned

The begging choir told the captain's man
We all assume the worst the best we can
And for a round or two
They'd gladly track you down

We found you sleeping by your lover's stone
A ream of paper and a telephone
A broken bow
Across a long lost violin

Your lover's angel told the captain's man
It never ends the way we had it planned
And kissed her palm
And placed it on your dreaming head",Muddy Hymnal
Iron & Wine,"Lately she don't care
For a warmer breeze
Or shade around the base
Of the maple trees

I said, 'love is waiting
And better days'

Something good for me

To tussling in the waves

Now I see love
Looking for you in this other girl's eyes

Time & all you took
Only my freedom to fuck the whole world
Promising not to look
Promising light on the sidewalk girls

But now I see love
There in your car where I said those things
Now I see love
Tugging your skirt, singing please, please, please

Time & all you gave
There on your cross that I never saw

There on your side of my empty bed",Promising Light

Stow your sorrows stow your fear

And the horse died standing up

She will buckle to that sound
When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down

Just like the way you lost your guns
When they cut the clothesline loose
Jesus, a friend of the weaker ones
Said, 'I'm all they stole from you'
Freedom, a thistle that withered dry
Still a baby in your hands
Frozen, the ground refused to die
And the guitar rose again

When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down",Southern Anthem

You would wear them before I brewed the tea

Our last of days
And grace the game with a blindfold on
The cheaters came to play
And outside the soft-handed boys
Screaming cars and all their speed
Music, meth, a hero beggin change
His sword across his knees

and how he prays to find a man to blame
For every sleepless night he spends
And for every well that he warned me of
But wound up falling in
And then for the kids beneath the balcony
Who disregard the rain
To make sure the king won't grant
The dead man one more day

let's go out and see darling
What shines tonight
And temper your dream about the dying horse
With traffic, noise, and light
And somewhere the soft-handed boys,
Bleeding hearts, and worker bees
Give to the holy mother begging change
Christ across her knees

and oh how she prays to find a man to blame
For every loveless night she waits
And for every gun that she frowned upon
But still some fucker made
And then for the kid beneath the balcony
Behind the garbage can
Who waits for the king to come
And hold his sweating hand



",Beneath the Balcony
Iron & Wine,"Jesus the Mexican boy 
Born in a truck on the fourth of July 
Gave me a card with a lady naked on the back 
Barefoot at night on the road 
Fireworks blooming above in the sky 
I never knew I was given the best one from the deck 

He never wanted nothing I remember 
Maybe a broken bottle if I had two 
Hanging behind his holy even temper 
Hiding the more unholy things I do 

Jesus the Mexican boy 
Gave me a ride on the back of his bike 
Out to the fair though I welched on a $5 bet 
Drunk on Calliope songs 
We met a home-wrecking carnival girl 
He's never asked for a favor or the money yet 

Jesus the Mexican boy 
Born in a truck on the 4th of July 
I fell in love with his sister unrepentantly 
Fearing he wouldn't approve 
We made a lie that was feeble at best 
Boarded a train bound for Vegas and married secretly 

I never gave him nothing I remember 
Maybe a broken bottle if I had two 
Hanging behind his holy even temper 
Hiding the more unholy things I do 

Jesus the Mexican boy 
Wearing a long desert trip on his tie 
Lo and behold he was standing under the welcome sign 
Naked the Judas in me 
Fell by the tracks but he lifted me high 
Kissing my head like a brother and never asking why

Far too fast to pacify you 
Ain't no telling what he's up to 

In time, the night may soften 
Trust that I'm still hoping, darling 
Wooden coin, he called my daughter 
No good knowing what came after

Shaking hands with shaded strangers

Autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made
And she's chosen to believe in the hymns her mother sings
Sunday pulls its children from the piles of fallen leaves

There are sailing ships that pass all our bodies in the grass
Springtime calls her children until she let's them go at last
And she's chosen where to be, though she's lost her wedding ring
Somewhere near her misplaced jar of Bougainvillea seeds

There are things we can't recall, Blind as night that finds us all
Winter tucks her children in, her fragile china dolls
But my hands remember hers, rolling around the shaded ferns
Naked arms, her secrets still like songs I'd never learned

There are names across the sea, only now I do believe

But she'll mend his tattered clothes and they'll kiss as if they know

And the train track will take

""to the pond with the swans and the swimming""
Far from his room the familiar perfume
How it felt to her when she was naked
Lessons she learned when her memory slurs
As they marvel with love at the sunset
Walking away at the dark end of day
She will measure and break like a habit
Oh how the rain sounds as light as a lover's word
And now and again she's afraid when the sun returns

""take me again,"" she said, thinking of him
""I don't care for this careful behavior""

Keeps her up with her want for her savior

As she begs for her fish from the water

There's a kid outside the church kicking a can
When the cedar branches twist she turns her collar to the wind

They both call to me with words I never knew
There's a bug inside the thimble, there's a band-aid on her thumb
And a pony in the river turning blue

They say, ""Time may give you more than your poor bones could ever take""
My Rebbecca says she never wants a boy
To be barefoot on the driveway as they wave and ride away
Then to run inside and curse the open door

I once gave to my Rebbecca a belated promise ring
And she sold it to the waitress on a train
I may find her by the phone but with a fashion magazine
She may kiss me when her girlfriends leave again

I think I could never love another girl
To be free atop a tree stump and to look the other way
While she shines my mother's imitation pearls

And I dreamt of that sound, dreamt of that sound

I saw lovers in a window
Whisper, ""Warn me like time, warn me like time""

I saw blood and a bit of it was mine
I saw children in a river

Saw a boat full of believers

Saw a bird fall like a hammer from the sky
And a woman on a speed train
She was closing her eyes, closing her eyes

I saw flowers on a hillside
And a millionaire pissing on the lawn
Saw a prisoner take a pistol
And say, ""Join me in song, join me in song""

Saw a car crash in the country
Where the prayers are like weeds along the road
I saw strangers stealing kisses
Giving only their clothes, only their clothes

Saw a white dog chase its tail
And a pair of hearts carved into a stone
I saw kindness and an angel
Crying, ""Take me back home, take me back home""

Saw a highway, saw an ocean
I saw widows in the temple to the Lord
Naked dancers in the city

I saw loaded linen tables
And a motherless colt and it was gone
I saw hungry brothers waiting

Saw a wet road form a circle

'Cause the music never lasts too long
For the singers and the endless song

When we heard our words up in the mirror
We told our children how to hold their tongues
When we held our heads beneath the river
We told 'em all about the iron lung
Gonna tell 'em 'bout the sins of the father
Bout the junkie and the jubilee,
Gonna tell 'em 'bout the roots in the water
About the killing in the quiet night of trees

'Cause the music never lasts too long
For the singers and the endless song

All the morning kisses in the covers
They told our children what were their means.
Until you wrapped your arms around another
And told em love was worth a pile of beans.
Gonna tell em bout the call of the ocean
Bout the singers and the endless song
Gonna tell em bout the body and the motion
And how the music never lasts too long, too long.

'Cause the music never lasts too long
For the singers and the endless song

(Bout the low-lit alley and the wedding band)
(Bout the first-born sucker in the spider's web)

'Cause the music never lasts too long
For the singers and the endless song

(Bout the mind and the muscle and the weary mouth)
(And the heart and the hustle and the empty sky)

'Cause the music never lasts too long
For the singers and the endless song.

(Tangle of truth and the perfect team)
(Bout the pyramid of truth and each other mean)

'Cause the music never lasts too long
For the singers and the endless song.

(Bout the butterfly kiss and the call for blood)
(Bout the peak in the picture and the holy mud)

'Cause the music never lasts too long
For the singers and the endless song

(Bout the babies in the summer and the lonely road)
(Bout to stay through the window when I’m gong on)

Here come the church mice trying too hard

I had a knife in the back of my car

From counting the smart cars on 94

And you know why she's gone

Like smoke falls out her red mouth

Well she left you the holes
The tracks in the back yard, December snow
But those sad souvenirs
They end at the fence line, and they disappear

Why you'd follow her there?
Milwaukee's a deaf ear for winter prayers

With only hope in your pocket, and hell to pay

When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam.

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light.

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man.

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.

So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat.

So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice

If you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it she'll teach you more than you can know

Can't you see it only brings you sadness
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease

Some day when you're reaching the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show any more

22, the avenue that's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside the red light's burning bright tonight

Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay

Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it make men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

Beat her mistreat her do anything that you please
Bite her excite her make her get down on her knees
Abuse her misuse her she can take all that you've got
Caress her molest her she always does what you want

You're running away don't you know what you're doing
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good don't you know that you're hurting
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags and you're coming with me",22 Acacia Avenue

In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon

Became a legend 'mongst mortal men

King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men

And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

And you know that this moment in time is for real,
And you know when you feel Deja vu.

Feel like I've been here before,
Feel like I've been here before.

Ever had a conversation,
That you realize you've had before,
Isn't it strange?
Have you ever talked to someone,

With the wind,
And the rain that's beating down on your back.

And every breath you take,
Determination makes

Gotta win, gotta run till you drop,
Keep the pace,
Hold the race,

You're over halfway there but the miles
Just never seem to end
As if you're in a dream,
Not getting anywhere.
It seems so futile.

Run, on and on,
The loneliness of the long distance runner.

I've got to keep running the course,
I've got to keep running and win at all costs,
I've got to keep going, be strong,
Must be so determined and push myself on.

Run over stiles, across fields,
Turn to look at who's on your heels,
Way ahead of the field,
The line is getting nearer but do
You want the glory that goes,
You reach the final stretch,

You feel like throwing the race,

Out in the dark there burns a dream,

To find the world that you have seen.

Iron Maiden,"Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

I am he the born-less one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name

Moonchild hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild open the seventh seal

I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death

Moonchild hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild open the seventh seal
Moonchild you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild take my hand tonight

The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

One more dies one more lives
One baby cries one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you young man
But I'll see you damned in endless night

Fly in the face of your prophets I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young

Mystery madman a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an end game one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us
And look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw
In my old dreams were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

'Cause in my dreams 
It's always there 
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
Yeah

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or some kind of hell
Six six six the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
Six six six the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize me can't avoid their eyes?
Six six six the number of the Beast
Six six six the one for you and me

You could dance his pole in May

Through the hole in the wall

In fact, he doesn't care at all

He's defending what he fears
While the troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear

I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me

I can see what a knife's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see

My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs

Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?
Oh yeah, I've done it
Yeah

You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Oh look out, I'm coming for you",Killers

Iron Maiden,"""O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
But take away our pride.""
(G. K. Chesterton  English Hymnal)

Just a babe in the black abyss,
No reason for a place like this,
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A clever path for the fools who know
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.
The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.

She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in the black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.

The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.

Bind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain,
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring,
It is You
It is You",Revelations
Iron Maiden,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through  the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.

""Day after day, day after day,
we stuck nor breath nor motion
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.""

There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
BUt how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide.

See...onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two.

Death and she Life in Death,
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then, crew one by one
they drop down dead, two hundred men
She, she, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

""One after one by the star dogged moon,
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
(and I heard nor sigh nor groan)
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
they dropped down one by one.""

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

and by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in  falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
spirits go fromhe long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,
Penance of life will fall onto him.

And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.",Rime of the Ancient Mariner
Iron Maiden,"Now I'm here can you see me
'cause I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold tell me
You can feel me
Cause I'm here

Here I am, can you see me
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to only in my
Dreams before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'cause you can count your
Real true friends on one hand

Through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would
Die for you
Thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say

In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one
Right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall
Do you sometimes feel like you're
On the outside
Looking in?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power
If you want to
It's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does

Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what
Happens when we die
Wouldn't it?
There are some who are wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some that must
Have lived before
Don't you?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not an
Open and shut case

Extrasensory Perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on and travel through
Space and time?

You know I feel so elated
'cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in

You don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your ""friends""
Might say
We'll meet up again someplace
Some way
One day",The Apparition
Iron Maiden,"There's a madman in the corner of
Your eye
He likes to pry, into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street
With you and I
A world of shadows and of rain
He's seen what love is
He wants to pay you back with guilt

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

There's a prophet in the gutter
In the street
He say ""you're damned!""
And you believe him
He's got a vision but it shines out
Through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear
He's felt what love means
He wants to pay you back with pain

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned the key
He holds your chains of misery

It's only love that holds the key to
Our hearts
It's only love

Iron Maiden,"I'd sail across the ocean
I'd walk a hundred miles
If I could make it to the end
Oh just to see a smile

You see it in their faces
The sadness in their tears
The desperation and the anger
Madness and the fear

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here

Starvation and the hunger
The suffering and the pain
The agonies of all-out war
When will it come again?

The struggle for the power
A tyrant tries again
Just what the hell is going on?
When will it ever end?

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here

You see the full moon float
You watch the red sun rise
We take these things for granted
But somewhere someone's dying

Contaminated waters
Pollution and decay
Just waiting for disease to strike
Oh will we learn someday?

No food, no love, no seed

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
The words escape me when I try to speak
Tears flow, but why am I crying
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""
If there's a God then why has he let me go?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

My body tingles, I feel so strange,
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well,
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.",Heaven Can Wait

Dream on sister, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights

Dream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one

Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces high.

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again.

Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Is it me or is it shadows that are
Dancing on the walls
Is this a dream or is it now
Is this a vision or normality I see
Before my eyes

I wonder why I wonder how
That it seems the powers getting stronger
Every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying

Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right
In through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise

An old man stands on the hill,
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream,
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave.

Iron Maiden,"Infinite dreams I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams

Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
Incase the dream begins again
Someone chasing I cannot move
Standing rigid nightmare's statue
What a dream when will it end
And will I transcend?

Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends another fertile
Getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep

Even though its reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist? well me I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?

Help me, help me to find my true
Self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing
Myself even within my dreams

There's got to be
More to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again",Infinite Dreams

I pray my sleep will break 
Maybe this time I won't wake

Iron Maiden,"I don't care for this world anymore 
I just want to live my own fantasy 
Fate has brought us to these shores 
What was meant to be is now happening 

I've found that I like this living in danger 
Living on edge it makes feel as one 
Who cares now what's right or wrong, 
It's reality 
Killing so we survive 
Wherever we may roam 
Wherever we may hide 
We've got to get away 

I don't want existence to end 
We must prepare ourselves for the elements 
I just want to feel like we're strong 
We don't need a code of morality 

I like all the mixed emotion and anger 
It brings out the animal the power you can feel 
And feeling so high on this much adrenalin 
Excited but scary to believe what we've become

Something within us 
We are lord of flies

To be lord of the flies",Lord of the Flies
Iron Maiden,"Eleven saintly shrouded men 
Silhouettes stand against the sky 
One in front with a cross held high 
Come to wash my sins away 

Standing alone in the wind and rain 
Feeling the fear that is growing 
Sensing the change in the tide again 
Brought by the storm that is brewing 
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear 
Some of the doubt in the things you believe 
Now that your faith will be put to the test 
Nothing to do but await what is coming 

Why then is god still protecting me 
Even when I don't deserve it 
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength 
Some they would call it a penance 
Why am I meant to face this alone 
Asking the question time and again 
Praying to God won't keep me alive 
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise

They'll be saying their prayers 
when the moment comes 
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgment day 
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes 
They'll be coming to claim, 
take your soul away 

The sign of the cross 
The name of the rose
a fire in the sky

They'll be bringing us all immortality

Iron Maiden,"When you start to take a look within 
Do you feel at ease with what you see 
Do you think you can have peace of mind 
And have self-belief or be satisfied 

Do you think you even like yourself 
Or really think you could be someone else 
Is there something that you'd rather be 
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see 

All my life I've run away 
All my life I've tried to hide away 

Fell the paranoia creeping in 
Like a cancer eating at the skin 
Do you feel you've lost your self esteem 
And your self respect, what can you expect 

All my life, I've run astray 
Let my faith, slip away 
All my life, I've run astray 
Allowed my faith, to drift away 

Are you scared to look inside your mind 
Are you worried just at what you'll find 
Do you really want to face the truth 
Does it matter now, what have you got to loose

Do you really care what people think 
Are you strong enough to release the guilt",The Unbeliever

Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind

A menace to society, a social disease

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order

Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order

Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray

When every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier lies

And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives

Try to escape it

Iron Maiden,"I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark.

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear thas something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you.

Have you ever been alone at night
Throuh your heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind.

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Reflecting on my past life and it doesn''t have much time
Cos at 5 o''clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be there''s been some sort of an error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream

Somebody please tell me that I''m dreaming
It''s not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying
After all am I not afraid of dying
Don''t believe that there never is an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell ""God be with you""
If there''s a God then why has he let me die?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I''m not sorry
Catch my soul cos it''s willing to fly away

Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
Please don''t worry now that I have gone
I''ve gone beyond to see the truth

Maybe then you''ll begin to understand

I want to pass the point of no return

That you really do deserve more

And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

Iron Maiden,"Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace
Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane

There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

But words escape me when I try to speak

Tears fall but why am I crying
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, 'God be with you'
If there's a God then why has He let me go?

As I walk my life drifts before me
Though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Don't worry now I have gone
Gone beyond to seek the truth, yeah, yeah

But all I found was butchered remains of two girls lay side byside
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Run before the killers go free
There's some people coming down the street
At last there's someone heard my call
I can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all
But I must have got some blood on my hands
Because everybody's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away
And now I've got to get away from the ares of the law
All France is looking for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down south to Italy
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the Gendarme
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home
Well I made it to the front of the block
But I can't wipe the scene from my mind
And the Gendarmes are chasin' me
Well I just started running around
Well I'm moving throught the shadows tonight
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
Cause I know that I show the signs of...
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Runnin' from the ares of the law
It was the law on my trail
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
When it's you they're looking for
If I could go directly to hell
To get me out of troubles for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
And I've got to say I've done it before
Murders in the Rue Morgue
They've gone from me

I'm never going home",Murders in the Rue Morgue [Live][#]

",My Generation
Iron Maiden,"""Woe to you, oh Earth and sea, for the Devil sends the Beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the Beast 
For it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty six""

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw
In my old dreams were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

'Cause in my dreams 
It's always there 
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
Yeah

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or some kind of hell
Six six six the number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
Six six six the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize me can't avoid their eyes?
Six six six the number of the Beast
Six six six the one for you and me

I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take it's course",The Number of the Beast [Live][#]
Iron Maiden,"Ive been looking so long for you
Now you wont get away from my grasp.
Youve been living so long in hiding
In hiding behind that false mask.
And you know and I know that
You aint got long now to last.
Your looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your past.

Youre standing in the wings,
There you wait for the curtain to fall.
Knowing the terror and holding
You have on us all.
Yeah, I know that youre gonna
Scratch me, maim me and maul.
You know Im helpless from
Your mesmerising cat call.

Keep your distance, walk away,
Dont take his bait.
Dont you stray, dont fade away.
Watch your step, hes out to get you,
Come what may.
Dont you stray, from the narrow way.

Im running and hiding in my
Dreams youre always there.
Youre the phantom of the opera,
Youre the devil, youre just out to scare.
You damaged my mind
And my soul it just floats through the air.
Haunt me, you taunt me,
You torture me back at your lair.

And the jack knife barber drops her off at school

Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
Who watches through the railings as they play

Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along

A rich man's stealer but her favour's good and strong
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate, let the poor man get along

The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards human wall

And as the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

When a Russian gets me in his sights

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near

I have a phobia that someone's always there

And have you felt your neck skin crawl

Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?

You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

",Intro
Iron Maiden,"I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more 
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart 
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause 
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all 

And all the politicians and their hollow promises 
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it 
The working man pays everything for their mistakes 
And with his life too if there was to be a war 

[Chorus]
So we can only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only got one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it 
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream 

A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday 
The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday 
Assailants know just how much further they can go 
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low 

[Chorus]

You can't protect yourselves even in your own home 
For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes 
So now the criminal they launch right in our face 
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace 

Despondent public worries, where it will all end?
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend 
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst 
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just 

[Chorus]",Age of Innocence
Iron Maiden,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones 
About a thing that I saw 
One night wandering in the everglades 
I'd one drink but no more 

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight 
Gazing up at the stars 
Not aware of a presence so near to me 
Watching my every move 

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
As something rushed me from the trees 
Took me to an unholy place 
And that is where I fell from grace 

Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
To the dance of the dead 
Into the circle of fire I followed them 
Into the middle I was led 

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
But still I wanted to go 
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
As I walked onto the coals 

And I felt I was in a trance 
And my spirit was lifted from me 
And if only someone had the chance 
To witness what happened to me 

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
All had death in their eyes 
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them 
They had ascended from hell 

As I danced with the dead 
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me 
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead 

Until the time came to reunite us both 
My spirit came back down to me 
I didn't know if I was alive or dead 
As the others all joined in with me 

By luck then a skirmish started 
And took the attention away from me 
When they took their gaze from me 
Was the moment that I fled 

I ran like hell faster than the wind 
But behind I did not glance 
One thing that I did not dare 
Was to look just straight ahead 

When you know that your time has come around 
You know you'll be prepared for it 
Say your last goodbyes to everyone 
Drink and say a prayer for it 

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 

To this day I guess I'll never know 
Just why they let me go 
But I'll never go dancing no more 
'Til I dance with the dead",Dance of Death
Iron Maiden,"Everybody's waiting for something to happen 
Everybody's waiting for something to see 
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters 
Everyone's waiting for news on TV 

Winding lives at the end of the spiral 
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill 
Everyone's looking, but no one is listening 
Everybody wants to be in at the kill 

I wait for the signs, they tell me true 
I see the signs of the end of time 

Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing 
Everyone's looking for the reason why 
Everyone's hoping for life everafter 
Everyone's looking at death from the sky 

Everyone's nightmares are going to happen 
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes 
Everyone's praying but no one's believing 
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies 

I wait for the signs, they tell me true 
I see the signs of the end

So I watch and I wait 
And I pray for an awnser 
An end to the strife and the world's misery 
But the end never came 
And we're digging the graves 
And we're loading the guns for the kill 

Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand

Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?

Is the face in the sand

To the sunset in the west 
We have cheated death 
And he has cheated us 

But that was just a dream 
And this is what it means 
We are sleeping
And we'll dream for evermore 

And the fragment remains of our memories 
And the shadows remain with our hands 
Deep gray, came to mourn 
All the colors of the dawn 
Will this journeyman's day be his last?

Our winter times are like a silent shroud 
And the heartbeat of the day 
Drives the mist away 
And winter's not the only dream around

And the shadows you build with your hands 
If you turn to the light 
That is burning in the night 
Then the journeyman's day has begun

[Chorus]",Montsegur
Iron Maiden,"Bleeding you dry from the start 
The sum of my parts
To give it away 
New life in a day 
Some new Frankenstein 
Damned for all time 

Cursed by the angel who fell 
Who saves me from hell? 
And who is my god? 
And where is my soul? 
Too tired to jump too young to run 

[Bridge]
Never ending, forever searching 
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart 
Always seeking, always asking 
Questions right from the start 

[Chorus:]
Out beyond the new frontier 
Playing god without mercy, without fear 
Create a beast, made a man without a soul 
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man? 
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man? 

I want to end my life now
But I don't know how 
Recycled again a lifetime of pain 
The spawn of a man 
The devil has planned

There's no time to prepare 
Salvage a last horizon 
But no regrets from me 

Maybe I'll be back some other day 
To live again just who can say 
In what shape or form that I might be 
Just another chance for me 

A hurried time no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusion 
And wishing all my life away 
No-one can stop me now 

Time is up it couldn't last 
But there's more things I'd like to do 
I'm coming back to try again 
Someday maybe I'll wait till then 

No more lies

They're all sitting at my table 
Talking tall and drinking wine 
Their time is up just like me 
But they just don't know it yet 

So just a word of warning 
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from 
I've got my eye on you 

The clock is fast, the hour is near 
Eventful past is ever clear 
My life is set, the time is here 
I think I'm coming home 

No more lies

A hurried time, no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusions 
And wishing all your life away 
No-one can stop me now

I'm coming back to try again

I turned my face towards the barren sun 

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground 
They are sealed and are now washed away

You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away 
You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives 
They are sealed and now far away

Iron Maiden,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace

Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals

And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them
They had ascended from hell

As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead

Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me

By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled

I ran like hell faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead

When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead",Dance of Death [Orchestral Version]

Living on edge it makes feel as one 
Who cares now what's right or wrong, 
it's reality 
Killing so we survive 
Wherever we may roam 
Wherever we may hide 
We've got to get away 

I don't want existence to end 
We must prepare ourselves for the elements 
I just want to feel like we're strong 
We don't need a code of morality 

I like all the mixed emotion and anger 
It brings out the animal the power you can feel 
And feeling so high on this much adrenalin

Iron Maiden,"In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale

Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years

Laying low in a blood filled trench
Kill tim 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to god no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale

Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die on Paschendale

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Fell the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale",Paschendale
Iron Maiden,"Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me

Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

Can I play with madness - there's no vision there at all

Can I play with madness - he said you're blind too blind to see

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said don't lie don't say you don't know
I say you'll pay for your mischief
In this world or the next
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said do you want to know the truth son

Iron Maiden,"I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to fade
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark.

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you.

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Through your heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

And many parting blows

That you ought to know
Two minutes of your time
Then on you go

Tell tale of the men
All dressed in black
That most of them
Not coming back

Sent off to the war
To play little games
And on their return
Can't name no names

Has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes
Removed all the lies

And strange as it sounds
Death knows no bounds
How many get well
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing

To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools
And to think that we thought you the answer

I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed I can see it in you eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now

Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophesise
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept

Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the facade of faceless men
Not a thing that we could foresee
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome

Promises of peace
But all along you cover plan was to deceive
Can it put to rights now only time will tell

Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance, at least

Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy
You know, will leave

We seem destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life while there's hope
That man won't self destruct

Why can't we treat our fellow men
With more respect and a shake of their hands
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is
Becoming a way of life

We live in an uncertain world
Fear understanding and ignorance
Is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones

But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know
Fight fire with fire life is cheap

But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care
They benefit from death and pain and despair",The Legacy
Iron Maiden,"In the gloom the gathering storm abates
In the ships gimlet eyes await

To turn men from flesh and blood to steel
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach

Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me

We gather demons in the mirror every day
The bridge of darkness casts a
Shadow on us all
And all our sins to you we give this day

Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast
Free your soul and let it fly
Mine was caught I couldn't try
Time returns again to punish all of us

We are cast out by our bloody father's hand
We are strangers in this lonely promised land
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
In our nightmare world the only one we trust

[Chorus x2]",Lord of Light
Iron Maiden,"Hold a halo round the world
Golden is the day
Princes of the Universe,
Your burden is the way
So there is no better time,
Who will be born today
A gypsy child at the day break
A King for a day

[Chorus:]
Out of the Shadow and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Dusty dreams in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new your life's adrift
What purpose to it all?
Eyes are closed and death is calling
Reaching out its hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you

Out of the Shadow and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

The ailing kingdom doomed to fail
The bonds of sin and heart will break
The pilgrims course will take

Quelling the devils might
And ready for eternal fight
Aching limbs and fainting soul
Holy battles take their toll

Liberty and hope divine
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell

Spirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home

Onward journey begun

To courage find and gracious will
Deliver good from ill
Clean the water clean our guilt
With us do what you will

Then will my judge appear
Bear no false angel that I hear
For only then I will confess
To my eternal hell

Now give us our holy sign
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell

Spirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home

For the memories for the money

We sailed away like our fathers before

There is no one that will save you
Going down in flames
No surrender certain death you
Look it in the eye
On the shores tyranny you
Crashed a human wave
Paying for my freedom with your
Lonely unmarked graves

We don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
Never out of season

Blackened pride burns inside
Shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamor, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain

The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast

As the reasons for the carnage
Cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machines
And feed them with our babies

Of children torn in two
The jellied brains of those who remain
Put the finger right on you

As the madmen play on words
And make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions
To make a better kind of gun

Iron Maiden,"Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are
Dancing on the walls
Is this a dream or is it now
Is this a vision or normality I see
Before my eyes

I wonder why I wonder how
That it seems the powers getting stronger
Every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying

Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right
In through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise

Iron Maiden,"Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real, this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
It's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away

Heaven can wait, heaven can wait
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait til another day.

I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying
I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare

Heaven can wait, heaven can wait
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait til another day

Heaven can wait, heaven can wait
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait til another day

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided

My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Heaven can wait, heaven can wait til another day","Heaven Can Wait [From Somewhere in Time, 1986]"

Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell

Seven your desires

The accursed ones I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death

Moonchild hear the mandrake scream

Moonchild you'll be mine soon child

Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul

One baby cries one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give

To clothe you in the night

Iron Maiden,"White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes killed our creed
He took our game for his own need

We fought him hard we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?

Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills, run for your lives","Run to the Hills [From The Number of the Beast, 1982]"
Iron Maiden,"From the coast of gold, across the seven seas
I'm traveling on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone else

I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by, in the night
Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there and will be til my dying day

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say, it's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me want to cry, and throw my hands up to the sky

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years",Wasted Years [From Somewhere in Time]
Iron Maiden,"Stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky
Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes
I have dealt in mysteries and trickery of light to entertain
Looked into the abyss, called it by its name

I have plundered time itself, put the world inside it
I'm the mysteries, day and night, divide it
A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me
Know the secrets, you shall not deride us

My dreams of empire from my frozen queen will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this is my house
I am the master of the tides, I shame the mirror in my sight
What random music of the spheres across the years

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame
Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names
I curse you Edward Kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned
Know you speak with demons, you cannot command

Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded
Burning by the Mortlake shore, my house, my books inside it
You have taken up my wife and lain beside her
Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning

My dreams of empire from my frozen queen will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this was my house
I was the keeper of the books, I had the knowledge of the scrolls
But now through ignorance and fear, I cast a shadow through the years

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Restore the knowledge memory

Iron Maiden,"When I stand before you shining in the early morning sun
When I feel the engines roar and I think of what we've done
Oh the bittersweet reflection as we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the towns become the ghosts of time

Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion just a hundred winged souls
We will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away, our land of birth

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay

Curving on the edge of daylight 'til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night, dreaming 'til the sun is born again
Stretched the fingers of my hand, covered countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite, speck of dust and cosmic sand

Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
Through the dark Atlantic; over mariners stormy graves
We will ride this thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away, our land of birth

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay

Getting ready to begin again.
Wounded, lying, crying bodies moving, dying.
All around there is the smell of death and fire.
Hear, the planes are coming.
Hear the soldiers running.
Killing on a scale to comprehend.

Why are we here in this place, here to kill?
Please, God, forgive us for what we have done.

I always thought I was doing right.
As of now, I'm not feeling so sure.
I'm at a place of wear, I give no grace.
I'm a soldier of war.

I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come.
I cannot think of about the things that I have done.
It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe.
Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done.

You tell me what is certain but I'll tell you what is true.
You tell me what is honesty when all around is death and cruelty.
I'm making out, my mind is vile, I'm giving in to our desires.
Within the truth that lies within the only thing.

Mother of mercy, angel of death, desire.
Mother of mercy taking my last breath, the fire.
Mother of mercy, angel of pain.
Mother of mercy taking my last breath.

Some say you are a lost cause, some say you're a saint.
Just being here's tonight, just suffering and restraint.
Walked down a long dark road to ruin, panic not.
I'll die a lonely death of that I'm certain of.

Rivers flow with blood, there's nowhere left to hide.
It's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive.
Sick of all that killing and the weak of death.
Well, God, tell me what religion is to man.

I don't hold with bad religion, understand what's underneath it.
Now I've come to think of it, I just don't hold out, all you know it.
You say you are a holy man but what is it you do.
Of where I stand there's nothing, but a hollow man I see.

Mother of mercy, angel of pain.
Mother of mercy, drawing my last breath.

Desperation in my voice.
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice.

The loneliness is hard to bear,
I try to calm my fear.
Just hoping, any second now,
Some contact filters through.

Desperate calls
Signal back from Satellite
As my life flashes
Right in front of me.

Try again, must get through.
Hear me now
For I've very little time.
Not much time, hear my call.
Please get through, I am here.

I'm stranded in space,
I'm lost with a trace.
I haven't a chance of getting away.

Reliving my past.

To tell them one last goodbye.

The final frontier
The final frontier

To live one more time
I wouldn't be changing

Than some do in ten,

I have no regrets.

Iron Maiden,"Take my eyes, the things I've seen
In this world coming to an end.
My reflection fades, I'm weary
Of these earthly bones and skin.

You may pass through me and
Leave no trace, I have
No mortal face.
Solar winds are whispering,
You may hear me call.

We can shed our skins and swim
Into the darkened void beyond.
We will dance among the world
That orbit stars that aren't our sun.

All the oxygen that trapped us in
A carbon spider's web.
Solar winds are whispering, you
May hear the sirens of the dead.
Let the elders to their parley
Meant to satisfy our lust.
Leaving Damacles still hanging
Over all their promised trust.

Walk away from freedoms offered
By the jailors in their cage.
Step into the light, startripping
Over mortals in their rage.

Starblind with sun, the
Stars are one.
We are the light that brings
The end of night.

Stars are one.
We are with the Goddess
Of the sun tonight.

The preacher loses face
With Christ.
Religion's cruel device is gone.
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone.
The crucible of pain will forge the
Blanks of sin, begin again.
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose.

Virgins in the teeth of God are
Meat and drink to feed the damned.
You may pass through me and I
Will feel the life that you live less.
Step into my light, startripping,
We will rage against the night.

Walk away from comfort offered
By your citizens of death.

Starblind with sun, the
Stars are one.
We are the light that brings
The end of night.
Starblind with sun, the
Stars are one.
We are with the Goddess

Take my eyes for what I've seen.
I will give my sight to you.
You are free to choose whatever:
Life to live or life to lose.

Whatever God you know,
He knows you better than you
Believe.
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived.

Look into our face reflected in the
Moonglow in your eyes.
Remember you can choose
To look but not to see and
Waste your hours.

You believe you have the time
But I tell you your time is short.
I see your past and future, all the
Same, and it cannot be bought.

Iron Maiden,"When I stand and look about the port
And contemplate my life, will I ever see my countrymen again?

As the captain calls us on the deck, I take my things and walk
To the harbor side I glance back one last time
Fleeing our nation, our problems we leave behind
Ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide

We are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles and more free from thee
Inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us
We flee from what is not, what is will be

We flee the earth and face our harsh reality
Will death be low mist that hangs on the sea?
We run from the evil tongues, rash judgments, selfish men
Never to be seen on these shores again

As we sail into ocean size and lose sight of land
A face of contentment around in the air
We're off now to seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams

Riding the waves and the storm is upon us
The winds lash the sails but the ropes keep them tight
Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
None could imagine what there was to come

No, there's no one going back, no, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side, we pray to God that we won't die

As we ride the rough seas, as we soak from the ocean waves
I just hope for all our lives and pray that I survive
Four ships are lost in the stormy conditions
The spirits of the sunken crews, their phantoms follow us

Spirits, sails, they drive us on through the all consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon against these ever raging seas

Four leagues and ten and we hit storms again
We just can't get away from the eye of the storm
The birds out soar the raging storm but we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth that we now crave is many leagues from safe

Holding on for our dear lives and we're praying once again
Rotten luck or just jonahed? The talisman is in my hand

Limbs fatigued, trembling with cold, blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold, heaven's rain upon us falls
Twenty days without a meal and ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms, the scurvy rest did slaughter

Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman

We approach the other side of the ocean with the tide
In our favor just for once, welcome greeting, our new land
The elation in our hearts, the excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline of our golden promised land

Weary limbs fatigued away, I have no life left in me
No more strength and nothing left to give, must find the will to live
Never thought that we could make it, truly sight of shores divine
The sickness I am dying from, never wanted it to end this way

Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman
Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman

",The Talisman
Iron Maiden,"Have you heard what they said on the news today
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?

He sees them in the distance when the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror, see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow

They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?

As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
Wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

Have you seen what they said on the news today
Have you heard what they said about us all
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us
Have you heard, have you heard?

There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it, it will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?

He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know

They tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired; that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down
Upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face,
Saying Grace
Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind
Left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago
Will be gone

They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come

They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait

Can't believe all the lying,
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors unite, all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome

I can't believe all the lying,
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Iron Maiden,"As he travels on the
Beast of burden,
Moving up along the mountainside,
As he gazes looking down the
Valley,
No regrets but his pride.

As he journeys across
Mountain passes
Insignificance sweeps over him.
His reflection of the beauty
Round him.
Feeling empty inside.

He is running from his
Wildest thoughts.
He is running from his everything.
He is looking now to
Find something,
Hoping he could be saved.

He's searching for the answer now.
It's something that he's managed to
Avoid up 'til now.
Real conviction, that he craves.
He needs to find the answer
Sooner than later.

Pushed himself to the limits.
He had to strive for all the harder
Things in life,
But what the cost of giving now?
His life and his time are the only things
That he has.

Life is is not a rehearsal.
All he has is the one chance
To get it right.
Leaving really is the only
Way to know.

Maybe one day they'll forgive him
What he's done,
But now the pain of lying too
Early in the grave.

Destiny, no good to hide away.
Penance now will be his only way.
Understand, no good to run away.
Penance now will be his saving
Grace.

He tries to make his peace
With God.
All is forgivable but it's left
A little late.
Trying something that he's not.
Is it possible to change such a lot?

He's taken someone's life away.
There's not a day goes by.
He regrets what he's done.
He should have found another way
But the good book says:
An eye for an eye.

In reflecting on decisions
That were made.
On the judgments that will
Haunt him 'til his grave.
No one has the right to
Take another life
But in his mind he had no choice.
So be it.

Destiny, no good to hide away.
Penance now will be his only way.
Understand, no good to run away.
Penance now will be his saving
Grace.

Destiny, no good to hide away.
Penance now will be his only way.
Understand, no good to run away.
Penance now will be his saving
Grace.

Silhouettes stand against the sky 
One in front with a cross held high 
Come to wash my sins away 

Standing alone in the wind and rain

Sensing the change in the tide again 
Brought by the storm that is brewing 
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear 
Some of the doubt in the things you believe 
Now that your faith will be put to the test 
Nothing to do but await what is coming 

Why then is god still protecting me 
Even when I don't deserve it 
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength 
Some they would call it a penance 
Why am I meant to face this alone 
Asking the question time and again 
Praying to God won't keep me alive 
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise... 

They'll be saying their prayers 
When the moment comes 
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgment day 
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes 
They'll be coming to claim, 
Take your soul away

The name of the rose 
A fire in the sky

They'll be bringing us all immortality

Iron Maiden,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones 
About a thing that I saw 
One night wandering in the everglades 
I'd one drink but no more 

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight 
Gazing up at the stars 
Not aware of a presence so near to me 
Watching my every move 

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
As something rushed me from the trees 
Took me to an unholy place 
And that is where I fell from grace 

Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
To the dance of the dead 
Into the circle of fire I followed them 
Into the middle I was led 

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
But still I wanted to go 
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
As I walked onto the coals 

And I felt I was in a trance 
And my spirit was lifted from me 
And if only someone had the chance 
To witness what happened to me 

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
All had death in their eyes 
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them 
They had ascended from hell 

As I danced with the dead 
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me 
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead 

Until the time came to reunite us both 
My spirit came back down to me 
I didn't know if I was alive or dead 
As the others all joined in with me 

By luck then a skirmish started 
And took the attention away from me 
When they took their gaze from me 
Was the moment that I fled 

I ran like hell faster than the wind 
But behind I did not glance 
One thing that I did not dare 
Was to look just straight ahead 

When you know that your time has come around 
You know you'll be prepared for it 
Say your last goodbyes to everyone 
Drink and say a prayer for it 

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 

To this day I guess I'll never know 
Just why they let me go 
But I'll never go dancing no more

Westward the tide.
Sail by the talisman.

Of the ocean with the tide
In our favour just for once.
Welcome greeting, our new land.

The excitement in our veins

Of our golden promised land.

I have no life left in me.
No more strength and nothing
Left to give.
Must find the will to live.

Make it.

The sickness I am dying from.
Never wanted it to end this way.

Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?

He sees them in the distance where the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror, see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow?

They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?

As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

Have you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us
Have you heard, have you heard?

There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it, it will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?

He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know

They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face, saying grace
Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone

They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come

They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait

Can't believe all the lying,
All the screams are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the last bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome

I can't believe all the lying,
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the last bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes

I haven't this chance of getting away
Too close to the sun and surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes
I'm taking my life, reliving the past
There's nothing but wait til' my time comes
I've had a good life, I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time, my friends

I have no regrets anekatips

I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Do more in my life than some do in ten

I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family and tell them
that one last goodbye

There isn't much time, must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes, if only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find

I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
That one last goodbye

A flight to earth that is a given from his birth
To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to full fill man’s desire

The sky and earth and the fires too

The power of the kings of traders and the wars
Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
Is in the document a kingdom they will learn

They were praying to the gods of nature
And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown

Make their lives be a mystery no more
Records kept and the passing of laws
Sacred gods to the book of lies
When a civilization dies

Passing of old ways will come true soon

He brought back their lives from the void

To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come
To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion

Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
Related giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms
The millionth chance they laughed, to take down his majesty's craft
To India they say, magic carpet float away, an October fateful day

Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew
The morning sunrise, red before the blue
Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
His majesty's airship, the r101

She's the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies
For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
Drum rolled tight, a canvas skin, silvered in the sun
Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come

The fury yet to come

In the gathering gloom, a storm rising in the west
The coxswain stared into the
We must go now, we must take our chance with fate
We must go now, for the politicians he can't be late
The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,
But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch

She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
A fragile outer cover, her achilles would become

An achilles yet to come

Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
Loyal to the king, and an airship creed

The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
Release the cords that bind us to the ground
Said the coxswain, sir, she's heavy, she'll never make this flight
Said the captain, damn the cargo, we'll be on our way tonight
Groundsmen cheered in wonder, as she backed up from the mast
Baptising with her water, from the ballast fore and aft

Now she slips into our past

Feeling the wind as it blows you
Feeling the beams as they pass you along
Watching the channel below you
Lower and lower, into the night

Lights are passing below you
Northern France, asleep in their beds
Storm is raging around you
A million to one, that's what he said

Reaper standing beside you
Wind inside cuts to the bone
Panicked to make a decision
Experienced men, asleep in their graves

The cover is ripped and she's flooding
Rain is flooding into the hold
Bleeding to death and she's falling
Lifting gas is draining away

We're down lads, came a cry, bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past
Just ashes at the last

Here lie their dreams as they stand in the sun
On the ground where they built, and the engines they run
To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?
Oh the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on

Dreams live on
Dreams live on

The empire of the clouds may rest in peace

Where the wolves are preying

Where the sons are dying

And great unknown

Free the captives from the chains

Why we find it hard to die

So we live and breathe again

Can we even hope to deliver this

With a brother against brother

As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those who don’t know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time
And we see what’s ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows

Facade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for cameras all ok
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we’ll never know

We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own let us be left alone
Laid the tasks and paid the price, everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the great
After every win, what a stake we're in
It's paying better than the grave

Deep inside the blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage",The Rage

",The Arrival
Iron Savior,"Right out of nowhere you came
Ghostlike appeared in the sky
But all our welcomes were shot down in flames
Superior power - invincible arms
A faulty assessment, a fatal misjudgement
But why you won't percieve
You won't percieve
Obedience you claim devotion you ask
Oppression is all that you give
Preserving the law the law of the lost
Defining the way that we live

Ruling a throne - of ashes and dirt
We will arise like a Phoenix
Again and again - forever we'll be
Enslave us and chain us
But then you will see
In the end the spirit is free
We never did you no harm
In peace we have lived united and free
You have turned our world into debris
A heep of debris
It seems we're defenceless in anguish we suffer
The raider that came from the stars
But we won't surrender with fury we'll strike
'cause this is the war of the wars

Despaired and in pain - all seems so in vain
Fires in the sky
Defenceless we stand tonight we will die
Shadows of the end
The Kingdom will fall life it will finally descend
Percieve what you've done and repent
Careless we thought
All you do is to bark at the moon
But in the grip of fury
You have conjured
The dawning of doom
Is this our fate - wiped out by your hate

I am the Mindfeeder
Under my control
This is the Mindfeeder

Your spirit's chained in the deepest pit
He is the master - you're the puppet
And like a tool you'll be utilized
Be abused or sacrificed
He's telepathic, ruling your will

on his command you'll die and kill
You cannot run, you cannot hide
'cause he's inside of your mind

Under the reign of terror
You will be chained forever
Forevermore

Under my control
....
This is the Mindfeeder

And then the night is falling
....

Under my control
....
This is the Mindfeeder

Under my control

Iron Savior,"A pale moon is rising
In silverless grey
It shines on the world
Enlightining the decay
A dead eye that stares at the night
Tainting the skies in unholy light
The towers of strength
The heart of it all
Broke into debris
Atlantis will fall
And I wonder why
But the world will die in fire and ice
A million lifes
Murdered by treason and lies
Ooh take me away

far beyond the stars
Far beyond the skies
There must be a land
We're calling paradise
Far, far away
Far beyond the skies

we shall be questing out
The land we're calling paradise
It's calling you, it's calling me
Oh, let it shine
Until the end of all time

Damned to survive
Bearing the pain
To keep man alive
Preserving the remains
And I wonder why
But the world will die
Nothing will remain
I'm a bleeding heart
In the falling dark
I will never be the same
Ooh take me away

far beyond the stars
....
Until the end of all time

oh, let it shine
Until the end of all time

And by the ancient gods
I'm swearing my revenge
And from beyond the grave
We shall avenge
Your head will roll - you gonna bleed
For killing us - betraying us
Traitor beware
We gonna get you anywhere

far beyond the stars

Until the end of all time

take me far beyond the skies
Take me away
Take me far beyond the skies
Take me to Paradise

Until I had your love my world was cold
I did what most men do, and I messed it up
But when I got you back my world was whole

The playa thing I let it go
Thought our life was set in stone
But it wasn't and I'm here alone
Nothing is in front of me
I feel I can?t even breathe
Don't think that I can't handle this baby I'm so

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

Where do I go from here? I'm so lost
You know how hard it is?
Fighting my way through this
Shouldn't even be like this,
Shouldn't have to feel like this
No, no no

Can't even have company
Nobody can talk to me
I messed up, bound it up fought myself through
Looking through my gallery; drinking and smoking weed
I hate you for doing this to me girl I'm so

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

I'm so in agony look at state I'm in
Left here broken
You said you'd never leave
Look what you've done to me
Left me broken

Never thought I'd be this low down in my life
I swear I'm?

Degraded by love, for you il do anything

But I never stopped to think twice
And that's what you showed me

",So Nice
Ironik,"Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war, 
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear 
I guess he's better off than he was before, 
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here 
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend 
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day 
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again, 
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way... 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad 
Sometimes I wish life was never ending, 
And all good things, they say, never last 

Springtime was always my favorite time of year, 
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain 
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears 
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain 
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die 
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized 
No, staring at his picture I realized 
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad 
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending, 
And all good things, they say, never last 

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there 
I know that he has found another friend 
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow 
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad 
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending, 
But all good things, they say, never last 

All good things that say, never last 
And love, it isn't love until it's past",Sometimes It Snows in April
Ironik,"Brother and Sister together will make it through
(Ooh Yeah),
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
(Everybody's Free).

This ones for all the ones showin' love. 
Its appreciated, its Ironik.

Stay with me, (Life's crazy man) 
Don't fall asleep too soon. (People come and go.) 
The angel's can wait, for a moment. 
(But when the closest one goes its the hardest thing ever.) 
(They can wait for a moment, I promise.) 
Stay with me, (Please stay,) 
Don't fall asleep too soon. (Don't cry) 
The angels can wait, for a moment.

They can wait for a moment. 
Don't cry for me when I'm gone, 
No point in wasting tears. 
Our time will come one day 
And I'm just confronting my fears. 
Though it's not really a fear, 
It's more like a destiny. 
Sometimes I sit and wonder, 
Is this life really for me?
Cause I've seen, seen, heard, felt. 
I'm done, I hope your proud of where I've come, 
You've seen me grow and helped me through. 
And there is no repayin' you. 
I'm here and I feel like I'm delayin' you, betrayin' you. 
And when I'm gone I that someones savin' you.

Stay with me, don't fall asleep too soon. 
The angels can wait, for a moment. 
(They can wait for a moment.) 
Stay with me, don't fall asleep too soon. 
The angels can wait, for a moment. 

I wanna see your face everytime I come home. 
Cause I can't leave you like this in this cold world alone. 
But, in this life we're livin', 
Who knows when I'll be gone. 
I don't wanna leave you with what ifs , 
Now I'm in for long (To the world.) 
There's too much to proove, 
And sometimes I wonder what I really have to loose. 
And then I really see, it's not all about me. 
I wanna shield you from this harsh mad reality. 
Its real lyrics.

Stay with me, don't fall asleep too soon. 
The angels can wait, for a moment. 
(They can wait for a moment, I promise) 
It wasn't meant to end like this. 
(It wasn't meant to end like this) 
Not without you (No) No, Ooh.

And life get's risky sometimes, 
But you gotta take chances.
Life's a game, you gotta risk it.
Listen, life's so crazy but I've lived mine well. 
I hope you do the same thing, and I hope you don't fail.
If anybody trys to bring you down, just stay strong. 
Don't argue the fact that you're right and they're wrong. 
Listen to my lyrics, that's why I wrote this song. 
So you could be influenced, then just stand there strong. 
Everybody's human and everybody's equal, 
So don't listen to nobody cause everybody's people.

Stay with me, don't fall asleep too soon. 
The angels can wait, for a moment. 
Stay with me (Life's a game, and you need to play it correct. 
Do the right moves and don't get caught up in loads of mess. 
Be calm, don't be stressed, 
Be sure to pass your test. 
Stand your ground, 
And don't let others put you to the test.) 
Don't fall asleep too soon. 
The angels can wait, for a moment.

Stay with me, cause they can wait for a moment.",Stay with Me (Everybody's Free)
Ironik,"Look Tracy, how you doing? I ain't seen you for years
Are you married yet? Any kids? Tell me how it;s going
I cried so much when I heard you was going
And my eyes hurt a lot when I heard you was going
While you reading this grab a tissue and smile
And look at our pictures from school and just smile
You had the cutest smile
I won't lie, I pictured you walking down the aisle
We could have been so happy together
I wonder if your parents didn't want us together?
Beautiful, silly at times but real clever
I won't be surprised if I don't see you, ever
But that is the reason I wrote this letter
And if you write back I'd feel ten times better
I know good things come to an end
But sometimes its like the wrong things end.

Chorus: 
Oh Tracy, when I'm sad I think back
I get the sweetest memories running through my head, so write back
Oh baby when I see us together, our love will never leave
I wanna feel it forever so baby come with me
Lets run away ay ay ay ay ay [x4]


I didn't get a chance to tell you how I felt
Only my mum knew how I really felt
My heart was crushed and broke into two
I wish I could turn back time just for you
Its funny how I see all these girls and don't care
They know to do music for me, I don't care
Girls like you come rare, I mean it
And you don't even have to show it 'cause I believe it
I made a promise to you and didn't get to keep it
Best friends forever, remember, forever.
I need you forever, I'll keep you forever
But now it's never and I feel so down
My love's so strong, I need yours now
Without you I feel like I'm just down 
Could have travelled the world together up and down
I love you babe, so tell me how you feel right about now

Chorus: 
Oh Tracy, when I'm sad I think back
I get the sweetest memories running through my head, so write back
Oh baby when I see us together, our love will never leave
I wanna feel it forever so baby come with me
Lets run away ay ay ay ay ay [x4]


Oh Tracy, when I'm sad I think back
I get the sweetest memories running through my head, so write back
Oh baby when I see us together, our love will never leave
I wanna feel it forever so baby come with me.

Without you it's blurry, and I can't see why,
My friends say James are you feeling alright?
And I just think that I'm dreaming all night,
When I'm with you I feel I've been saved,
And I want to thank your Mum and Dad for what they made.
So I just want to say I'm going to keep you,
For life, 24/7 I hope to.

Hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too,
So hold me closer and don't let go,
I'm falling so please girl don't let go,

Hold me closer tiny dancer,
Count the headlights on the highway,
Lay me down in sheets of linen,
You've had a busy day today.

You're my perfect dream, we're the perfect team,
I'm the King, you're the Queen, you're the book that I read,
Without you it feels like there's no me,
And that's why its you that I just want to keep,
How many times have I told you that I love you?
So many times you know I want to hug you,
So come and show me what love means,
Coz I don't really know I just seen it in my dreams

I swear hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too,
So hold me closer and don't let go,
I'm falling so please girl don't let go,

Hold me closer tiny dancer,
Count the headlights on the highway,
Lay me down in sheets of linen,
You've had a busy day today.

It's crazy, I don't think you recognize how strong the feelings are,
So I dedicated this song to you.

Look I hope you recognize now what you really mean,
Without you I couldn't do this song I sing
And I hope you like it too, coz it's nothing but the truth
Your not number 1 but you will be soon

Believe hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too,
So hold me closer and don't let go,
I'm falling so please girl don't let go,

Hold me closer tiny dancer,
Count the headlights on the highway,
Lay me down in sheets of linen,
You've had a busy day today.

Irradio,"So what about the end? When you said to run. I don't like your words. Take what you know. And get it through your head. Listen to the eyes. I said run away. To fall in love again. Too much. What the people want. Has come. What the women fear. Between. Why the children sing. I've seen. Loud and clear. Along we ran. On again. Now that you heal. Take a look around. It complicates, it ends.

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Oh

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right, no no
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart, oh yeah

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny how

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try (though you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel (baby)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it's strange how fate can play a part

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try

Livin' in the ghetto, ooh, ooh

Livin' life up on the corner
Slangin' rocks and smokin' weed
From an eightball to a G
Worked my way to a ki
All I can try to do is hold on
Caught up in the struggle
Seems the only way to be
Never gone find no peace
Till the day they bury me
All I can try to do is be strong

And n****, you can find me
Hangin' up on the corner
Or layin' up in the cut
Tryin' to get my motherf***in' money right
My hammer right beside me
And I really don't give a f***
If somebody gotta die tonight
'Cause look...n****, my pocket full of stones
Is everything I own
And this is all I do, all I do
A n**** straight hustlin' everyday to get through, get through

Gotta be on the lookout for them stick-up boys
'Cause when they come
They be straight hemmin' n****s up
And it really all about takin' that money, man
If they catch me, they better kill me
Ain't comin' out like no punk
S***, can't let no n**** take nothin' from me, man
Cause look, yo...they steppin' in my zone
And infiltratin' my home
And what the f*** would you do?
If a n**** straight...took ya cake
And tried to break you, break you

I wish that I could let it go
How we in the struggle and hustlin' just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
I wish that we ain't have to be so canivin' just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
How my n****s in the pen doin' time just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
I wish that genocide wasn't survivin' just to make it out the ghetto

Everyday is just weed, rocks, and pistols, cops comin' to git you
When n****s that want to put you on shirts readin', ""We Miss You""
Everything I been through, nothin' but issues
Tired of goin' to funerals and pa**in' moms the tissue
Getcha prayer in ya life, it's hard to listen
When there ain't nothin' fair in ya life
It's God that's missin', that's what they be tellin' me
And I try to wait but He be takin' so long
I'll probably catch another felony, inhalin' weed
Keepin' me broke, though, I slangs my coke
I probably push less weight than the trees I smoke
And ain't no hope for tomorrow, hot, heavy wit sorrow
Cause my peers bring tears from findin' em full of hollows
I know you probably goin' through the same thing
The same pain, cause we caught up in the same game
And don't a damn thing change, n****, bump this song
'Cause you strong and you ain't alone, n****...just try to hold on",Hold On

That always had me comin' back again
Something about the way you move, it got me...
Hooked on you, no matter, what I do

It's feelin' kinda strange, but I love it
You gotta know that I would never leave
You did that thang to me, you is where I be

Stack up, every penny, money over these broads
Back up, against the wall in a riot or brawl
I pledge allegiance, the I-N-see is the clique
And till I die, I'm a ride with my niggas through thick
And thin, playin' him, we playin' to win
Steady ballin', soarin', long dickin' these broads, and..

She says she wants to spend the day with me
She tells me of the time she went to rescue all her friends
From the empty, corner pharmacy
I wonder how she feels

And as I lay, I heard the crumbling mountain tops
Inside my feeble wandering, restless disposition
Wondering if she's been here all along
Wandering in and out of the hallways of my mind

And so I lay beside her on the mattress in her kitchen
And we watched the sun come up
She took my hand beneath the blankets to her body
And she whispered softly, that she was glad that we had met

And leave me there until I get old
You and me, I could wish we're meant to be
Together until I get old

And we'll sail away into the sun some day
You and me on a holiday
Wait for me or tell me now time will pass
More peacefully

And if you go the world will fell sorry for me
At least on this we'll agree
And I'll hold my breath until you say when
You'll stay young will I old by then?

If I don't break perhaps we'll bend

Remember when we danced with your mother
She was so drunk in the living room
And then her profile, turned a certain way
Showed me how you would look thirty years from today

So come and talk to me in your language
With your glass eye and your wooden teeth
I think I know what's wrong I think I know what you're on
I think I know what they meant when they said you were gone

Are you still mine
I hope you feel better this time

From the back room

I don't really love you again, I was just being lonely by myself

And she's not shy, she's not shy, the girl is not shy, she's not shy
And I get shy, so shy, and she's not shy

Oh no, alright then let's go and she said oh no alright then let's go

There's a minister handy
And it sure would be dandy
If we'd let him make a fee

Here's the ring for your finger
Isn't it a humdinger?
Come along and let the wedding chimes
Bring happy times
For Mandy and me

There will be some jubilation for the happy pair
Yes, the best in all creation, joy is in the air
There'll be music at the station
For to speed them on their way
There will be some celebration on their wedding day

Oh, what a wonderful day

Now we'll hear the wedding bells, soon we'll hear the baby yells

Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

Get paid for what they do but no applause.
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

How many times has a certain feeling

Troubled you so that you ""hit the ceiling""?
How many hands have you held all alone?
How many lips have you pressed to your own?
I'd hate to think that you kissed too many

But I'd feel worse if you hadn't kissed any
Please tell me how many times

A certain thing has puzzled me greatly, just lately, my dear
Why does a fellow always get stupid when Cupid is near?
Although I was the smartest at college that knowledge, I fear
Could never bring

A Romeo
The only thing
He wants to know

How many sighs have you sighed in my ear?
How many lies have you whispered, my dear?
How many baby blue eyes have you gazed right into?
How many loving words have you spoken?

How many promises have you broken?
How many times have you left me alone

Told me had business and yet you come home
I know where you were because I saw you
And I got home just a minute before you
Oh, baby, how many times?",How Many Times? [From Four Jills In A Jeep]

Irving Berlin,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture [From On the Avenue]
Irving Berlin,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken
Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?
Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?
Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot
You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was

I looked around for somebody new
Since my romance, I've kissed one or two
But I'm afraid their kisses won't do

This year's crop just misses
What kisses used to be

And I am blue
What'll I do?

Irving Berlin,"It gets lonely in the White House when your cares begin
And the White House is a big place to be lonely in
When you're all alone there staring into space
And you wish the man you ran against could be there in your place
It gets lonely in the White House when you've been attacked
By the loyal opposition getting in the act
If you make the wrong decision, when the final chips are down
The White House is the loneliest place in town
It gets lonely in the White House when you're sitting there
And you have to do your thinking in a rocking chair
When some exercise would keep you feeling well
But a journey to the golf course and the country's gone to hell
When the budget isn't balanced and you're in the red
And you feel it would be better to be dead than red
When your speech is optimistic but the stocks keep tumblin' down
The White House is the loneliest place in town",It Gets Lonely in the White House
Irving Berlin,"Let's take an old fashioned walk, I'm just bursting with talk.
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk.
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled, may relax on an old fashioned walk.

I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart,
There's nothing like walking and having a ""heart to heart.""
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind.
She was wrapped up and sold, coming home from an old fashioned walk.",Let's Take an Old Fashioned Walk
Irving Berlin,"[Verse:]
Ten generations of Constantins
Lived very comf'table lives
They were contented to live in style
Supported by their wives
Daughters of men who were wealthy
Fitted them like a glove
They all married for money
I mean to marry for love

[Refrain:]
It's an old-fashioned idea, marrying for love
And that old-fashioned idea's what I'm thinking of
Where there's love, poets have said
Two can live as one
That's an old-fashioned idea
But it's being done
When I find the man that I'm crazy about
There's much that I could do without
But I couldn't do without love
Just an old-fashioned romance with a moon above
A romance, one that will end marrying for love
That's the kind of love
That I'm thinking of

To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?","How Deep Is the Ocean?, song"
Irving Berlin,"[Verse:]
Taking stock of what I have and what I haven't
What do I find?
The things I got will keep me satisfied
Checking up on what I have and what I haven't
What do I find?
A healthy balance on the credit side


[1st refrain:]
Got no diamond, got no pearl
Still I think I'm a lucky girl
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no mansion, got no yacht
Still I'm happy with what I've got
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no checkbooks, got no banks
Still I'd like to express my thanks
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening
I'm all right

[2nd refrain:]
Got no butler, got no maid
Still I think I've been overpaid
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
-I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no silver, got no gold
What I got can't be bought or sold
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
-I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no heirlooms for my kin
Made no will but when I cash in
I leave the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening they're all right

[3rd refrain:]
Got no mansion, got no yacht
Still I'm happy with what I've got
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no silver, got no gold
What I got can't be bought or sold
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no checkbooks, got no banks
Still I'd like to express my thanks
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening
I'm all right","I Got the Sun in the Morning, song (from ""Annie Get your Gun"")"
Irving Berlin,"I guess there's nothing to do
And nothing to say,
But simply go on my way
And call it a day.
I guess I'm ready to go
Right back on the shelf,
Because at last I've learned
Where you're concerned,
I've just been fooling myself.
I never had a chance,
I thought you cared for me,
But now I see I never had a chance.
I never had a chance.
Though you never told me so,
Somehow I know I never had a chance.
I knew we'd have to part,
For I could always reach your lips
But I could never reach your heart.
My dream about romance
Ended in a friendly chat.
But more than that,
I never had a chance.
I never had a chance,
I thought you cared for me,
But now I see I never had a chance.
I never had a chance.
Though you never told me so,
Somehow I know I never had a chance.
I knew we'd have to part,
For I could always reach your lips
But I could never reach your heart.
My dream about romance
Ended in a friendly chat.
But more than that,
I never had a chance.","I Never Had a Chance, song"
Irving Berlin,"[1st verse:]
Every time 
I see a puppy upon a summer's day
A puppy dog at play
My heart is filled with envy
That's because
My heart is yearning to pass the time away
Like that pup
'Cause I'm all fed up
And tho' it's wrong to be
I long to be

[chorus:]
Lazy
I want to be lazy
I want to be out in the sun
With no work to be done
Under that awning 
They call the sky
Stretching and yawning
And let the world go drifting by
I want to peep
Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep
'Til I sleep
Like a child would
With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm
Killing time
Being lazy

[2nd verse:]
Life is short
And getting shorter with each day that goes by
And how the time does fly
Before you know, it's over
That's why I'm
In such a hurry to pack my things and fly
To a spot
Where it's nice and hot
And hear the birdies sing
While I'm being","Lazy, song"
Irving Berlin,"[1st verse:]
The different lays of nowadays
All set my brain a whirl
They're not the kind of songs they sang
When mother was a girl
Your spoony rags and coony drags
All made my poor heart ache
Bring back the rhymes of olden times
And just for old times sake
[Refrain:]
Won't you play a simple melody
Like my mother sang to me
One with good old fashioned harmony
Play a simple melody
[2nd verse:]
In days of yore, before the war
When hearts now old were young
At home each night by firelight
Those dear old songs were sung
Sweet melodies, their memories
Around my heart still cling
That's why I long to hear a song
Like mother used to sing
[Rag Verse:]
I don't care for long haired musicians
With their classy melodies
They have lots of highbrow ambitions
But their music doesn't please
Give me something snappy and popular
The kind that darkies play
Lots of rhythm
And I go with 'em
That's why I say
[Rag Refrain:]
Musical Demon
Set your honey a-dreamin'
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag
To some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy
Of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because
I want to listen to rag
[The two refrains are sung in counterpoint]","Play a Simple Melody, song (from ""Watch Your Step"")"
Irving Berlin,"Say it isn't so,
Say it isn't so,
Everyone is saying
You don't love me,
Say it isn't so.

Everywhere i go,
Everyone i know,

Whispers that you're growing tired of me,
Say it isn't so.
People say that you,

Found somebody new,
And it won't be long
Before you leave me,
Say it isn't true,

Say that everything is still okay,
That's all i want to know,

And what they're saying,
Say it isn't so.","Say It Isn't So, song"
Irving Berlin,"The roses each one
Met with the sun
Sweetheart when I met you
The sunshine had fled
The roses were dead
Sweetheart when I lost you

I lost the sunshine and roses
I lost the heavens of blue
I lost the beautiful rainbow
I lost the morning dew
I lost the angel who gave me
Summer, the whole winter through
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness
When I lost you

The birds ceased their song
Right turned to wrong
Sweetheart when I lost you
A day turned to years
The world seemed in tears
Sweetheart when I lost you","When I Lost You, song"
Irving Berlin,"[1st verse:]
Johnny was bashful and shy
Nobody understood why 
Mary loved him
All the other girls passed him by
Everyone wanted to know
How she could pick such a beau
With a twinkle in her eye
She made this reply
[1st chorus:]
He's not so good in a crowd but when you get him alone
You'd be surprised
He isn't much at a dance but then when he takes you home
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
But don't judge a book by it's cover
He's got the face of an Angel
But there's a Devil in his eye
He's such a delicate thing but when he starts in to squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knee
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit that he's nothing at all
But in a morris chair
You'd be surprised
[2nd verse:]
Mary continued to praise
Johnny's remarkable ways
To the ladies
And you know advertising pays
Now Johnny's never alone
He has the busiest phone
Almost every other day
A new girl will say
[2nd chorus:]
He's not so good in the house but on a bench in the park
You'd be surprised
He isn't much in the light but when he gets in the dark 
You'd be surprised
I know he looks as slow as the Erie
But you don't know the half of it, dearie
He looks as cold as an Eskimo
But there's fire in his eyes
He doesn't say very much but when he starts in to speak
You'd be surprised
He's not so good at the start but at the end of the week
You'd be surprised
On a streetcar or in a train
You'd think he was born without any brain
But in a taxicab
You'd be surprised","You'd Be Surprised, song (from ""Ziegfeld Follies of 1919"")"
Irving Berlin,"I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand
One day, father started digging in a field, hoping to find some soil
He dug and he dug and, what do you think?
Oil, oil, oil
The money rolled in and I rolled out
With a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now, who am I?

I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em gel
And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostest on the ball

They would go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind
They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostest on the ball

I've a great big bar and good caviar
Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes round
If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you, all you need
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostest on the ball

Entertaining vodka drinkers
Is a job they give to me
Making nice guys out of stinkers
Seems to be my cup of tea
What they really need behind the iron wall
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

There's a book of regulations 
As to who sits next to who
But there might be complications
When the blue blood's not so blue
So the priestess with the leastest protocol
Is the hostess with the mostest on the ball

An ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves
He can come and let his hair down, ooh!
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
Of the priestess with the leastest
Nor the hostess with the mostest
With the mostest on the ball",The Hostess with the Mostess' on the Ball
Irving Berlin,"I'm honored, I'm flattered
This greeting really mattered
This welcome is grand but I'm really concerned
I like your attention
But this I have to mention
You're playing with fire and you're apt to get burned

There's a girl in Tennessee
Who's sorry she met up with me
Can't go back to Tennessee
I'm a bad, bad man

There's a girl in Omaha
But I ran faster than her pa
Can't go back to Omaha
I'm a bad, bad man

There's a girl in Wyoming
And they're combing Wyoming
To find the man in white
Who was out with her that night

There's a girl in Arkansas
The sheriff is her brother-in-law
Can't go back to Arkansas
I'm a bad, bad man

You're making too much fuss
For we don't give a tinker's cuss
We've been out, yes, each of us
With a bad, bad man

We've been chasing up and down
That other show has just left town
And the one who played the clown
Was a bad, bad man

You may love us and leave us
But the parting won't grieve us
We'll turn the other cheek
When the minstrels come next week

When the show folks come to call
A girl may slip but she won't fall
We'll give some but won't give all
To a bad, bad man

For years I have yearned to
Play towns I could return to
And ""this may be it"" from the way that you speak
I'm glad you're not frightened
The atmosphere has brightened
And now let's make plans for a wonderful week

Monday when my show is done
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun
You may find it lots of fun
With a bad, bad man

Tuesday there's no matinee
But I'll be in my tent all day
You can come around and play
With a bad, bad man

Send your mothers on Wednesday
Because Wednesday's old hens' day
But Thursday is sublime
I'll have lots of open time

Friday night will be the test
If Saturday you're still my guest
Sunday you can come and rest
With a bad, bad man

I'm enlightened but frightened
Tho' my interest you've heightened
It might turn out to be
That you're much too much for me

So I'll go back to my tent
And someday when you're old and bent
Think of hours you might have spent
With a bad, bad man","I'm a Bad, Bad Man"
Irving Berlin,"There's a change in fashion that shows
In those Lenox Avenue clothes
Mister Dude has disappeared with his flashy tie
You'll see in the Harlem Esquire
What the well-dressed man will desire
When he's struttin' down the street with his sweetie-pie

Sun tan, shade of green
Or an olive drab color scheme
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Dressed up in O.D.'s
With a tin hat for overseas
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Top hat, white tie and tails no more
They've been put away till after the war

Take a look at Brown Bomber Joe
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear",What The Well Dressed Man In Harlem Will Wear
Irving Berlin,"I was blue, just as blue as I could be
Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door
Skies were gray but they're not gray anymore

Blue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds
All day long

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days
All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now on

I should fret if the worst looks like the best
I should mind if they say it can't be true
I should smile, that's exactly what I do",Blue Skies
Irving Berlin,"We'll follow the old man wherever he wants to go
Long as he wants to go opposite to the foe

We'll stay with the old man wherever he wants to stay
Long as he stays away from the battle's fray

Because we love him, we love him
Especially when he keeps us on the ball

And we'll tell the kiddies we answered duty's call
With the grandest son of a soldier of them all",The Old Man
Irving Berlin,"Sisters, sisters
There were never such devoted sisters,
Never had to have a chaperone, no sir,
I'm there to keep my eye on her
Caring, sharing
Every little thing that we are wearing
When a certain gentleman arrived from Rome
She wore the dress, and I stayed home
All kinds of weather, we stick together
The same in the rain and sun
Two different faces, but in tight places
We think and we act as one
Those who've seen us
Know that not a thing could come between us
Many men have tried to split us up, but no one can
Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister
And lord help the sister, who comes between me and my man",Sisters
Irving Berlin,"Snow
It won't be long before we'll all be there with snow
Snow
I want to wash my hands, my face and hair with snow

Oh, to see a great big man entirely made of snow
Where it's snowing 
All winter through
That's where I want to be

That's what I'll do

Irving Berlin,"When the war was over, why, there were jobs galore
For the G.I. Josephs who were in the war
But for generals things were not so grand
And it's not so hard to understand

What can you do with a general
When he stops being a general?
Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?
Who's got a job for a general
When he stops being a general?
They all get a job but a general no one hires

They fill his chest with medals while he's across the foam
And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home
The next day someone hollers when he comes into view
""Here comes the general"" and they all say ""General who?""

They're delighted that he came
But they can't recall his name
Nobody thinks of assigning him
When they stop wining and dining him
It seems this country never has enjoyed
So many one and two and three and four star generals
