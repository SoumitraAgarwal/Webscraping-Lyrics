Mel Tormé,"Evenin' breezes sighin', moon is in the sky
Little man, it's time for bed
Daddy's little hero is tired and wants to cry
Now, come along and rest your weary head

Little man, you're cryin', I know why you're blue
Someone took your kiddy-car away
You better go to sleep now
Little man, you've had a busy day

Johnny won your marbles, tell you what we'll do
Dad'll get you new ones right away
Better go to sleep now
Little man, you've had a busy day

You've been playin' soldier, the battle has been won
The enemy is out of sight
Come along there soldier, put away your gun
The war is over for tonight

Time to stop your schemin', time your day was through
Can't you hear the bugle softly say
Time you should be dreamin'
Little man, you've had a busy day","Little Man, You've Had a Busy Day [Live]"
Mel Tormé,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever seen two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet then we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
We're in love

When I hear the lullaby of Birdland
Crazy swing in lullaby of Birdland
All it seems to do is just remind me
That I am also in love, I don't know what to do

When I hear the lullaby of Birdland
Crazy swing in lullaby of Birdland
All it seems to do is just remind me
Of the nights that I spent lovin' you

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, then we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
And I know I discovered just why
I am so much in love, so much in love, baby with you
Lullaby, oh bye bye",Lullaby of Birdland [Live]
Mel Tormé,"Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach
Or to Hollywood
But I'm taking a Greyhound
On the Hudson River Line
I'm in a New York state of mind 

I've seen all the movie stars
In their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens
But I know what I'm needing
And I don't want to waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind 

It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, The Daily News 

It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
Don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind 

It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, The Daily News 

It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
Don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind 

I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River Line
'Cause I'm in a New York state of mind",New York State of Mind [Live]
Mel Tormé,"When two lovers meet in Mayfair so the legends tell
Songbirds sing and winter turns to spring
Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the spell

I know such enchantment can be
Cause it happened one evening to me
That certain night, the night we met,
There was magic abroad in the air,
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square

I may be right, I may be wrong,
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turn'd and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
The moon that lingered over London town

Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love,
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars,
It was such a romantic affair,
And as we kissed and said goodnight,
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square",A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square [Live]
Mel Tormé,"You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armored knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I'd fly out of this world
If you said we were through,
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;
I'll spend the next eternity or two with you.",Out of This World [Live]
Mel Tormé,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
But you remained in my heart

So tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue [Live]
Mel Tormé,"They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied ""something here inside cannot be denied""
They said ""someday you'll find all who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say 
""when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes""

(smoke gets in your eyes, smoke gets in your eyes)

Smoke-gets-in-your-eyes",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes
Mel Tormé,"Twenty-four hours can go so fast,
You look around, the day has passed.
When you're in love,
Time is precious stuff;
Even a lifetime isn't enough.

Where has the time all gone to?
Haven't done half the things we want to.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time

This day was just a token,
Too many words are still unspoken.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.

Just when the fun is starting,
Comes the time for parting,
But let's be glad for what we've had
And what's to come.
There's so much more embracing
Still to be done, but time is racing.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.

Didn't get half my wishes,
Never have seen you dry the dishes.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.
Can't satisfy my craving,
Never have watched you while you're shaving.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.

Just when the fun's beginning,
Comes the final-inning

Haven't had time to wake up,
Seeing you there without your make-up.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.

Just when the fun is starting,
Comes the time for parting,
But let's be glad for what we've had
And what's to come.
There's so much more embracing
Still to be done, but time is racing.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.",Some Other Time [Live]
Mel Tormé,"Someday I'll Find You
Someday I'll find you, moonlight behind you  
True to the dream I am dreaming!  
As I draw near you, you'll smile a little smile,  
For a little while, we shall stand, hand in hand! 
      
I'll leave you never, love you forever,  
All our past sorrow redeeming,  
Make it all come true, make me love you too,  
Someday I'll find you again!  
      
Someday I'll find you, moonlight behind you  
True to the dream I am dreaming!

Mel Tormé,"A bunch of frightened rookies were listening filled with awe.
They listened while a sergeant was laying down the law.
They stood there at attention,
Their faces turning red.
The sergeant looked them over and this is what he said:

This is the army, Mister Jones.
No private rooms or telephones.
You had your breakfast in bed before
But you won't have it there any more.

This is the army, Mister Green.
We like the barracks nice and clean.
You had a housemaid to clean your floor
But she won't help you out anymore.

Do what the buglers command.
They're in the army and not in a band.

This is the army, Mister Brown.
You and your baby went to town.
She had you worried
But this is war and she won't worry you anymore.

This is the army, Mister Jones.
No private rooms or telephones.
You had your breakfast in bed before
But you won't have it there any more.","This Is the Army, Mister Jones [Live]"
Mel Tormé,"Someday, when I'm awfully low
And the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely
With your smile so warm, and your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that smile that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it, 'cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Just the way you look tonight",The Way You Look Tonight [Live]
Mel Tormé,"When sunny gets blue
Skies get grey and cloudy
And the rain begins to fall
Pitter patter, pitter patter

Love is gone
So what can I do
No sweet lover man comes to call
Oh when sunny gets blue

Oh when sunny gets blue
She breathes a sigh of sadness
Like the winds that sway the trees.
Winds that set the leaves a-sway

Like the violins that play
Strange and haunting melodies
Oh when sunny gets blue
Sunny gets blue
When sunny gets blue

People used to love to see her laugh
And see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair

She's lost her smile
Changed her style
Somehow she's not the same
The memories come back

And pretty dreams rise up
Where the other dreams fell through
Hurry new love, hurry here
Kiss away each lonely tear

Hold me near when
Sunny gets blue
Oh yes, when sunny gets blue
Sunny gets blue

When sunny gets blue
Sunny gets blue",When Sunny Gets Blue [Live]
Mel Tormé,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire
Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To [Live]
Mel Tormé,"Don't the moon look lonesome shining through the tree
Don't the moon look lonesome shining through the tree
Don't your arms look lonesome when your baby's packed to leave
Sent for you yesterday, here you come today, today,
Sent for you yesterday, here you come today
If you can't do better, might as well just stay away",Sent for You Yesterday and Here You Come Today
Mel Tormé,"You, you're driving me crazy! What did I do? What did I do?
My tears for you make everything hazy, clouding the skies of blue
How true, were the friends who were near me to cheer me
Believe, me they knew, but you
Were the kind who would hurt me, desert me
When I needed you
Yes you, you're driving me crazy! What did I do to you?",You're Driving Me Crazy (What Did I Do?)

And so to bed.

As I gaze at the cold river bed?
Why do I ask myself, ""shall I go back
When I seem to be going ahead?""

To black moonlight!
Where everything reflects your color
Darkness that is endless.
Nights that leave me friendless, blue!

Black moonlight!
You make the lights of Harlem duller
Just like me you're faded, jaded and degraded, too!
Why must you send,
Ebony moonbeams, depressing, distressing,
Like shadows of love that are gone?

Where will it end?
Will it spread on to the starlight, the sunlight
And darken each promise of dawn?

Where's the good life they said could be found?

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight

assisting at an unexpected borning

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two

To write another song just for me

Mel Tormé,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone",The Song Is Ended (But the Melody Lingers On)

Jack Frost nipping at your nose

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

I pray the Lord his soul to keep is my song.

I still dream in the morning for you.
What to do?
I still cry in the morning for you.",In the Hour

I had a little beetle
So that beetle was his name
And I called him Alexander
And he answered just the same
And I put him in a matchbox
And I kept him all the day
But nanny let my beetle out
Yes nanny let my beetle out
She went and let my beetle out
And beetle ran away
She said she didn't mean it
And I never said she did
She said she wanted matches
And she just took off the lid
She said I mustn't worry
And I really mustn't mind
That there's lots and lots of beetles
The she's certain we could find
She said I mustn't worry
But it's difficult to catch
An excited sort of beetle
You've mistaken for a match
If we looked in all the places
That a beetle might be near
And we made the kind of noises
That a beetle likes to hear
And I heard a kind of something
And I gave a sort of shout
It was a beetle house
And Alexander beetle coming out
It was Alexander beetle
I'm as certain as can be
And he had that kind of look as though
He thought it might be me
And he had that kind of look as though
He thought he ought to say
""I'm really very sorry that I tried to run away""
And nanny's very sorry too
Cause you know what she did
And she's writing Alexander
Very blackly on the lid
So nan and me are friends because
It's difficult to catch
An excited Alexander
You've misstaken for a match

Melanie,"I am not a poet, living is the poem 
I am not a singer, I am in the song 
And I've got a story that I cannot write down 
And I'm with you but I'll always be alone 
I may not be right, but I don't think I am wrong 
 
Every note's an answer, every word's a sign 
Every man's a dancer, following his own time 
I've found a tearful language that translates what I am 
And I cried out loud, but they didn't understand 
I cried so hard I may never try again 
I may never try, I may never try again 
 
Cleansing in the water, heal me in the light 
Mend you ageless daughter, I've been awake all night 
'Cause if your sands are shifting, I'll need to know what I forgot 
I don't want much, but I need an awful lot 
 
I've found a tearful language that translates what I am 
And I cried out loud, but you didn't understand 
I cried so hard I may never try again 
I may never try, I may never die again 
 
I may never cry again 
I may never try again 
I may never die again

Melanie,"I'm so tired that I can't sleep,
I already read the Bible inner deep
The preacher keeps me on my knees
To wander and to travel
And to sleep when I am able

Maybe I was an old path
Maybe I was a raincloud
Maybe I was a mountain inside of Russia
Maybe I was a good road
Maybe I was a secret
Maybe I was a river flowing in Russia.

But I'm so tired and I can't sleep,
I already read the Bible inner deep
A preacher keeps me on my knees
To wander and to travel
And to sleep when I am able.

Made to live on stouneground words 
Imagine that, you've done all that 
And I come back for more 
Imagine that, I lived on that 
And I will live for more 
 
I entered dancing and looked for my partner 
I thought the path could be a double road 
You played my heart like a drum beating warning 
Oh, I guess I'm gonna dance this one alone 
 
I'll go to the garden that follows the seasons 
Live in the field where the healing grass grows 
Go to the mountains where air's clear for breathing 
Clear is just another way to see 
I feel to know 
 
Cleanse in the ocean, bathe in the power 
Live with the sea and I rise for the tide 
Go to the place where the water will bring me 
I'm the rivers lover, but I'll be the oceans bride 
 
And they sand me down to the nerve

That I've loved and haven't known 
Weave me a summer night into a winter fire 
For I'm very far from warm 

And when it comes right down to it 
I'm happily alone 
'Cause I don't want someone to own 
And run the life I live, oh me 

To walk a night into a day that has no reason 
Walking past the house of someone else's season 
Gazing at the light on the rim of a tightly closed door 
Weave me inside before the winter and I wouldn't ask for more

Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

And this complex he imagined made life drearier and drearier
Till his analyst assured him that he really was inferior
As the id goes marching on.

And go running after women till you're just about to fall.
You may think you're having fun but you're not having fun at all

Have turned half the population into total nervous wrecks.
But your analyst will cure you, long as you can pay the checks
As the id goes marching on.

Is your body plagued by aches and pains that you can't understand
Compound fractures ingrown toenails, floating kidneys, trembling hands,
There's a secret to your trouble: you're in love with your old man

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain

Melanie C,"Where do they go and what do they do? 
They're walking on by. They're looking at you. 
Some people stop, some people stare. 
But would they help you and do they care? 

How did you fall? Did you fall at all? 
Are you happy when you are sleeping underneath the stars? 
When it's cold is it your hope that keeps you warm? 

A spare bit of change is all that I give. 
How is that gonna help when you've got nowhere to live? 
Some turn away so they don't see. 
I bet you'd look if that were me. 

How did you fall? Did you fall at all? 
Is it lonely where you are sleeping in between parked cars? 
When it thunders where do you hide from the storm? 

Could you ever forgive my self-pity? 
When you've got nothing and you're living on the streets of the city. 
I couldn't live without my phone. 
But you don't even have a home. 

How did we fall? Can we get up at all? 
Are we happy where we are on our lonely little star? 
When it's cold is it your hope that keeps you warm? 

Where do they go and what do they do?

Melanie C,"Come on. Ooh, yeah. 
Never be the same again. 

I call you up whenever things go wrong. 
You're always there. You are my shoulder to cry on. 
I can't believe it took me quite so long. 
To take the forbidden step. 
Is this something that I might regret? 

(Come on, come on) 
Nothing ventured nothing gained. 
(You are the one) 
A lonely heart that can't be tamed. 
(Come on, come on) 
I'm hoping that you feel the same. 
This is something that I can't forget. 

I thought that we would just be friends. 
Things will never be the same again. 
It's just the beginning it's not the end. 
Things will never be the same again. 
It's not a secret anymore. 
Now we've opened up the door. 
Starting tonight and from now on. 
We'll never, never be the same again. 
Never be the same again. 

Now I know that we were close before. 
I'm glad I realised I need you so much more. 
And I don't care what everyone will say. 
It's about you and me. 
And we'll never be the same again. 

I thought that we would just be friends (oh yeah). 
Things will never be the same again. (Never be the same again) 
It's just the beginning it's not the end. (We've only just begun) 
Things will never be the same again. 
It's not a secret anymore. 
Now we've opened up the door. (Opened up the door) 
Starting tonight and from now on. 
We'll never, never be the same again. 
Never be the same again. 

Nite and day. 
Black beach sand to red clay. 
The US to UK, NYC to LA. 
From sidewalks to highways. 
See it'll never be the same again. 
What I'm sayin' 
My mind frame never changed 'til you came rearranged. 

But sometimes it seems completely forbidden. 
To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden. 
Where there's no competition. 
And you render my condition. 
Though improbable it's not impossible. 
For a love that could be unstoppable. 

But wait. 
A fine line's between fate and destiny. 
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be? 
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me. 
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly. 

And as our energies mix and begin to multiply. 
Everyday situations, they start to simplify. 
So things will never be the same between you and I. 
We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified. 

I thought that we would just be friends. 
Things will never be the same again. 
It's just the beginning it's not the end. 
Things will never be the same again. 
It's not a secret anymore. 
Now we've opened up the door. 
Starting tonight and from now on. 
We'll never, never be the same again.

Never be the same again. 
It's not a secret anymore. 
We'll never be the same again. 
It's not a secret anymore. 
We'll never be the same again.

Melanie C,"They tried to catch a falling star. 
Thinking that she had gone too far. 
She did but kept it hidden well. 
Until she cracked and then she fell. 

If all the history is true. 
She's gonna end up just like you. 
You made it to the other side. 
But tell me who will be my guide. 

They build you up so they can tear you down. 
Trust the ocean you'll never drown. 
Who is next? Who's gonna steal your crown? 
You'll see. 

I have learnt my lesson well. 
The truth is out there I can tell. 
Don't look back and don't give in to their lies and goodbyes. 
Northern Star. 

Fulfil the longing in your heart. 
Then we will never be apart. 
And if they dare to question you. 
Just tell them that our love is true. 

They buy your dreams so they can sell your soul. 
Is it any wonder we've lost control? 
Feelings come, feelings go. 

I have learnt my lesson well. 
The truth is out there I can tell. 
Don't look back and don't succumb to their lies and goodbyes. 
Live your life without regret. 
Don't be someone who they forget. 
When you're lost reach out for me. 
And you'll see she's not far.

I lost it again

All I need is honesty

A circle in a sun

And a knock upon a hidden door

I made a choice
And now I´m running

When my life was not my own
I would throw it all away
Without sorrow
But it couldn´t change a thing
Wouldn´t change the way I feel
For today´s the price I pay for tomorrow

But I’ve got to move on, I’ve got to be strong
Now what else can I do

'Cause I’ve been wanting, waiting, hoping, praying
Oh, I feel like I’m suffocating
There’s nothing left to lose

If all that I have is the sweetest denial
If all I can give is the rest of my life
Then I’m over pretending that I can survive without you
Thought I was stronger than love but I guess that nobody’s immune

There’s a poison that runs through my veins
When I’m sleeping
And just like a secret that I try to keep
I buried too deep like the memories of you

But I’m still here wanting, waiting, hoping, praying
Oh, I feel like I’m suffocating
There’s nothing left to lose

If all that I have is the sweetest denial
If all I can give is the rest of my life
Then I’m over pretending that I can survive without you
Thought I was stronger than love but I guess that nobody’s immune

If all that I have is the sweetest denial

Melanie Doane,"How did I think it would be
Maybe like a tv show
Half hour episodes
to solve everything and make you
absolutely happy
Absolutely happy

Now I've made you cry
Never see it coming
Always takes me by surprise
that I don't make you
absolutely happy,
Sure gonna try to make you
absolutely happy

And why should I
I'm as mixed up as the next guy
And how could I
I'm just a woman 
who wants to be here by your side

Wipe those tears away
Ôcause they'll be here again
before we know it
Just have one thing to say
that I will never make you
absolutely happy,
I'm sure gonna try to make you
absolutely happy, 
But I know I'll never make you
absolutely happy,
Still I'll try to make you
absolutely happy",Absolutely Happy
Melanie Doane,"I've been sleeping
under the beanstalk
and I've been dreaming
of something big
I don't know how
but I could swear
I'm on my way somewhere

Awake the giant
awake, awake

Hey Goliath
oh you're no bigger
You're no bigger than me

I know I've got something
inside of me
Just like I know you've got
something inside of you
It might be hard
but if we dare
we're on our way somewhere

Awake the giant
awake, awake

Hey Goliath
oh you're no bigger
You're no bigger than me

Say the words you have swallowed
See the visions 
in you're mind's eye
Do what you feel in your heart
Awake the giant in you

I've been waiting
for a signal
for something to tell me
everything's all right
But now I see
it's up to me
No one else can fight this fight",Goliath
Melanie Doane,"Good gifts of love
Good gifts you hand me down
From your first touch
To my wedding gown

Do you even know 
What you've given me
Do you even see 
That you are wisdom
You are wisdom to me
My song, my soul
You gave so easily
I'll not forget 
These gifts to me

We say goodbye
But we are not alone
Here with me still
My heart, my home

Do you even know 
What you've given me
Do you even see

I'll not forget

Melanie Doane,"[Chorus]
Tell me once again how you cried
The day I went away
Tell me once again how you prayed
To keep me safe and sheltered
From the winds and the ways
Of a cruel world
From the sea and the sun
And the sands of time
That would keep falling through
Until I came back to you

Tell me once again how you cried
Were you crying 'cause you didn't know
What would become of us
Were you so uncertain of my intentions
Looking back I can say
I shed a few tears of my own
That's why I need you to tell me

Tell me how you knew even then
That we would have our day
Nothing from before, come between
To keep us among the lonely

Tell me once again how you cried
Were you crying 'cause you didn't know
What would become of us
Were you so uncertain of my intentions
Looking back I can say
I shed a few tears of my own
That's why I need you to tell me
Oh

Tell me once again
Tell me once again
Tell me once again how you cried",How You Cried
Melanie Doane,"So dear to me
Always keep me company
Who needs to go outside 
I will be your silent bride

I can't take my eyes off you

Nothing ever needs to be said
You send your message 
right into my head
You fill me up when I'm alone
So soothing is your monotone

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you

So maybe you're not as real 
as the others
But I choose you over all my past lovers
For they have come and they have gone 
but I can always turn you on

I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you",I Can't Take My Eyes off You
Melanie Doane,"Speak of love in a warm embrace
Speak of hope in a smiling face
Speak of peace in the stars up there
Speak of faith in a silent prayer

[Chorus]
But when I'm speaking to you
And you're speaking to me
Things get complicated
When you're speaking to me
And I'm speaking to you
Voices are isolated
Words just push the air around
Gotta find some common ground
In the space between us

Speak of fear that has no name
Speak of hate that seeks to blame
Speak of pain behind each wall
Speak of death that touches us all

But when I'm speaking to you
And you're speaking to me
There's so much frustration
When you're speaking to me
And I'm speaking to you
No communication
Words of fear and words of rage 
Break the bars of this cage 
In the space between us

[Chorus]",The Space Between Us
Melanie Doane,"Sweet morning
Takes you away
Sweet nothings
We try to say
Only music fills the space 
Only sadness on my face
Sweet Sorrow
Parting is such
Sweet sorrow
Sweet misery
I love your company
But one day
It's you I'll send away
Only music fill the space
Only sadness on my face
Sweet sorrow
Parting is such
Sweet sorrow
Parting is such 
Parting is such 
Parting is such",Sweet Sorrow
Melanie Doane,"Maybe it scares you
Maybe it makes you cry
Maybe it reminds you of all that you deny

[Chorus]
To see the good
You never would
Without the ugly
There is no beautiful
Without the ugly
There is no beautiful

Walk down the street
And I turn my blind eye
Don't want to meet
The parts of myself I might find

[Chorus]

So Venus tries
To sympathize
We make her look so good
As kind is to cruel
As bitter is to sweet
This life has a rule
That the two must somehow meet

[Chorus]",There Is No Beautiful
Melanie Doane,"I cry up to the man in the moon
He's the only one can help me now
I bought the line 
that as long as I tried
I could not leave empty handed
But I've done all I can do
and now I leave it up to you

I'm waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting, waiting for the tide
to take me 
To take me away

Goodnight moon
I should be talkin' to Neptune
He's the one who will teach me patience
For whoever rules the sea
is now the ruler over me

I'm waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting, waiting for the tide
to take me

So I have proved
some things can't be moved
And here I wait 
but my faith is weak,
and the water's creeping up to my chin
I am

waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting, waiting for the tide
to take me",Waiting for the Tide
Melanie Doane,"Once upon a time
I was just a little bone
I was just a little tiny rib
and the rib cage was my home
Somedays I'd wonder how it would feel
to be my own person
to eat my own meals

I never had to make a plan
just be a little piece of a bigger man

And Adam rocked my world
I was his biggest fan
No such thing as being a girl
He had the whole world in his hands

Now that was the life
No worries no pain
Just stay in my place
and grow a little more each day
I never had to make a plan
just be a little piece of a bigger man

And Adam rocked my world
I was his biggest fan
No such thing as being a girl
He had the whole world in his hands

Then I started to wonder
What's this spell I might be under
It's time to break away
It's time to feed this hunger


Never had to take a stand
just be a little piece of a bigger man",Adam's Rib

(Sad songs, are the best songs oh yeah)

(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)

I know there's love waiting on the of top a hill,
When I get there I hope it's not to late to reveal,
This broken heart of mine it seem it ran out of time

Loving you, loving me
It's not the way it's supposed to be
But you'll regret it!
You wanna bet it!
Setting this golden goose free!

My love, where did we go wrong?
I wonder who's in your arms?
Especially because you did me wrong.
You know sad songs are the best songs
You don't have to wonder how it's gonna end.
(Doo do doo doo)

Gave back my key
Because you seem to have so many.
Did you know this,
The wrong one was given to me

With the initials ""L.M.""
Is that who you are seeing and,
Loving her, leaving me?
It's not the way it's supposed to be!
But you'll regret it!
You'll be upset when the next man is loving me!

My love, where did we go wrong?
I wonder who's in your arms?
Especially because you did me wrong.
You know sad songs are the best songs
You don't have to wonder how it's gonna end.
(Doo do doo doo)

No one to cry on
I can begin at the end of this song
Still I remain strong keeping interest
'Till something is gone

What did I do Lord to deserve to be alone,
Thought I had a love to strong so long,
But you always gotta prove me wrong

You that sad songs you know are the best songs
And I don't have to wonder how it's gonna end

My love, where did we go wrong?
I wonder who's in your arms?
Especially because you did me wrong.
You know sad songs are the best songs
You don't have to wonder how it's gonna end.

Make him, laugh until he cries,
Hold him, stand by his side

Oh not again
One thing lead to another way
He said lets just be friends
Right then and there I said to him

Oh thanks so much for nothing
I hope you find that something
Or whoever she is you think you're looking for
Oh don't do me any favors
I guess I'll see you later
Matter fact pull over and let me out this door

Oh johnny took my heart
And left me right here on the sidewalk
on the corner is where he dropped me
I'm saying oh why did we have to part
So now I'm dialing on my cellphone
begging Johnny baby bring me back my heart

Bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart

Now I ask myself why?
Why did I let him go? now I'm
Walking alone, alone in this cold
Johnny the least you could've done
Was drive me home

Oh thanks so much for nothing
I hope you find that something
Or whoever she is you think you're looking for
Oh don't do me any favors
I guess I'll see you later
Matter fact don't bother knocking on my door

Bring me back my heart (my heart)
Bring me back my heart (my heart)

This is hard for me to do
See I'm not that chick who sits around
And waits all night for you
But you're worth it
Why you left me I don't know
But I'll walk these streets all night
Until I bring my baby home

Oh I need your loving
You got that special something
Who am I kidding
Please Johnny come back home

Just fill your head with why
Then you're caught living a lie again
Its sad that all he ever said
Was that he loved me to death
But that hes gone again and I was wrong again

'Cause you think its easier easy like that
Just when I wasn't finished
You were gone like that
Can't you hear me crying
'Cause I need you back
And I'm slowly dying
'Cause I need you bad
But your gone
And never coming back
Gone and not coming back
He's never coming back

Should've known the long kiss goodbye
Would bring sadness in my life
Wearing this disguise again
I wish that you would've said
Or lied to me instead
Like a bullet to my head
Like a fool I pretend
That its on again on again

'Cause you think its easier easy like that
Just when I wasn't finished
You were gone like that
Can't you hear me crying
'Cause I need you back
And I'm slowly dying
'Cause I need you bad
But your gone
And never coming back
Gone and not coming back
He's never coming back

Whoever said look on the brighter side
Has never been on mine
Whoever said that he'll get his
Never felt like this
Ain't no use in crying when you're done like that
'Cause baby baby you took something
That I cant buy back
And now you're gone and never coming back
Coming back
Oh he's not coming back",Gone and Never Coming Back

Melanie Fiona,"Where were you when I needed a friend?
Thought I could be strong
Never knew I’d be so wrong
A heart-breaker most of my life
Suddenly all changed
The moment you left me
And walked out my life

I tried to play cool
But instead I was playing myself
What you gotta know about me
Is that I'm dying in this lonely hell

And I don’t wanna be without you
'Cause I can hardly breathe without you
This is what it feels to be the one
Who’s standin’ left behind
How did I become the wrong side of a love song?

Baby, I’m a mess
Out of every piece and part of me
You were always the best
But instead I was leaving you here alone
But I didn’t mean it,
No, I didn’t mean it
Now I’m begging, baby, come home

And you got me singing why,
Why you wanna make me cry?
I’ll be thinking ’bout you
Got me dreaming ’bout you

Wanna know why?
Can you tell me, why?
Said that you’ll be there for me
Said you’ll care for me
So how you're gonna say goodbye

Second round was never found, it ricocheted
Nowhere to run, I was stunned in a daze
A victim of a love I can't escape

I remember when you said you loved me
Three little words that burned into my soul
Maybe you didn't mean those things you told me
Maybe you didn't really mean those words at all

I'll bite the bullet
I'll do it in the name of love
I guess I'll bite the bullet
Or stop playing with loaded guns
Stop playing with loaded guns

What do you want from me?
Baby what do you want from me?
You think you have the ability to love two women equally
Well I don't have the energy to fight for your exclusivity
Oh no no no no

'Cause I remember when you said you loved me
That's why it's so damn hard to let you go
How did you mean them things you told me?
Did you ever really love me at all?

I'll bite the bullet
I'll do it in the name of love
I guess I'll bite the bullet
Or stop playing with loaded guns
Stop playing with loaded guns

All this back and forth, what is it for?
The silent games, the tug of war
Wish I could break down your walls
Be the one you call, catch you when you fall
Brick by brick, I thought that we could build again
But now I know this is the end

I'll bite the bullet
I'll do it in the name of love
I guess I'll bite the bullet
I'm done playing with loaded guns
Done playing with loaded guns",Bite the Bullet

Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message comin' from my eyes says leave it alone

Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones says find a home

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more",Seven Nation Army

Then you gotta (gasp)

[Hook I]
Yo these niggaz can't breathe when I come through, hum too 
Some shoes, gotta be 20 man 
It's not even funny they can't BREATHE 
The choke holds too tight 
The left looks too right 
You know what? You right 
These bitches can't BREATHE 

(Hook II) 
Look look, they hearts racin'
They start chasin'
But I'm so fast when I blow past
That they can't BREATHE 
In the presence of the man 
Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man 
You betta BREATHE 

You niggaz can't share my air 
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear 
And I'm gettin better year by year 
Like they say Juan do 
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through 
And I pace myself 
I know these money hungry bitches want to taste my wealth 
But I keep em' on a diet 
Embrace they health 
Or either keep em' on a quiet 
And space myself 
And just take a deep breath 
I got em' grabbin' they chest 
'cause it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best 
And they in they worst 
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
And I ain't just layin a verse 
I'm sayin the facts 
I came back with some sicka stones 
That got these broke niggaz lookin at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone 
Every chick I bone 
Can't leave the dick alone 
So I know 
It's one of them everytime I flip my phone

[HOOK I]

[HOOK II]

I see em on the block when I passes 
Lookin like they need oxygen mask-es 
I make it hard to BREATHE 
But I keep the glocks in the stashes 
'cause the cops want to lock and harass us 
And make it hard to BREATHE 
They has to react 
Like havin' a asthma attack 
When they see the plasma in back 
You dudes are wheezin' behind me 
My flow is like a coupe, breezin at 90 
That's the reason they signed me 
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts 
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut 
How I address the haters and under estimaters 
And ride up on them like they escalators 
They shook up and hooked up to respirators 
On they last breath talking to investigators 
I'm a breath of fresh air 
And a fresh pair 
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue 
And then BREATHE 

[BRIDGE] 

[HOOK I]

[HOOK II]

When the crew walk in it 
Pop a few corks in it 
As quick as a tick in a New York minute 
Catch a breath, fore you catch a left 
Even worse, catch a Tef 
Only way you catch a F 
To the A-be	, its in the maybe 
Rollin with my baby 
Grippin on a toy that you won't find in +KayBee+ 
I rhyme slick on ya 
I'm a have to put the Heimlich on ya 
What you know bout lettin' dimes lick on ya?
While you inhale the weed 
And it won't stop till they inhale ya seed
And it don't stop I tell em' to breathe 
Like a doctor with a stethoscope 
I don't see no fuckin hope 
Unless these motherfuckers BREATHE 

Yeah, Brooklyn gotta
Uptown gotta
the Bronx gotta
Queens gotta
Staten Isle gotta
You niggas gotta
You bitches gotta
Everybody BREATHE 

One and then the two 
Two and then the three 
Three and then the four 
Then you gotta.. BREATHE
Then you gotta.. 
Then you gotta..

A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray

And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away
It's human kindness is overflowing

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Your breath is breathing in my soul
Still I am gasping, aching, asking
Where are you now

Cause I just wanna be with You
I just want this waiting to be over
I just want to be with You
And it helps to know the Day is getting closer

Every minute takes an hour
Every inch feels like a mile
Til I won't have to imagine
And I finally get to see You smile

My journey's here, but my heart is There
So I dream and wait, and keep the faith, while You prepare
Our destiny, til You come back for me
Oh, please make it soon!

Chorus
I wish it was love
I wish it was freedom
Many times I thought that it was meant to be
I gotta feel love
I gotta feel a reason
To wash away the fear

Verse 1
No more games to play
No more words to say
I'm sorry, there is nothing more to say
For my heart to heal
This is how I feel
So sorry, there is nothing more to say

Bridge
I see it now like the rain is falling
Falling from the clouds that hide the sun
It's over now, a new day is dawning
It's time we go our own way

Chorus

Verse 2
No more hearts to break
Promises to make
Me sorry, I've nothing more to give
Now the time is here
And I have no fear
I'm not sorry - for all I can forgive

",I Wish It Was Love
Melanie Thornton,"Music, wine and candlelight
You know how to please me
The way you walk - the way you talk
Something turns me on

You stopped my tears from falling
And showed me how to smile
When Iím close to you there's nothing else
That I would rather do

One on one - it's tender love
I'm yearning for your touch
Your sweet caress, your gentleness
Is what I'm dreaming of

Intoxicated - I'm addicted
My feet are losing ground
Intoxicated - I'm attracted
You turn me inside out
Intoxicated - I'm devoted
When you touch my soul
Intoxicated - now I know that
I'm burning for your love !
(I can never get enough - intoxicated)

When you kiss me I'm in heaven.
You make loving fun.
It ís pure delight - you do me right -
You know how to love me...

Shower me with your love
You know what I want
No, I can't get enough - take my heart...

Chorus:
It's alright, everything is gonna be alright
It's alright, everything is gonna be alright

Verse 1:
When I think about life
Something creeps in my mind
Saying, ""it's time for a change""
Pointin' fingers, no doubt
I'm just wasting my time
Looking for someone to blame
For all the hate and abuse
How can I face the truth
If I don't open my eyes
And let it get to me, and get to you
Let's come together and start a new

Bridge:
If we try, make a change
We'll survive and then we can say
It's gonna be alright

Chorus

Verse 2:
It's just a matter of time
Can't ignore all the signs
Gotta do what ever it takes
Teach the children at home
Before they're out on their own
And making the same mistakes
The time is tickin' away
We gotta start today
And try to make it right
So let it get to me and get to you
If we come together, how can we lose

If we fall on our knees
And pray, we've got to believe
It's gonna be alright

Now that we've found a way
And I can't believe it

Just believe

Waiting for someone like you
Searching for a paradise

Take away the falling rain
Now there is a brighter day
And I can't believe it

The night is gone but I still dream of you, so true

Did what I was told was best for me
Blindly I'd follow, trustingly
And never question why
Unaware of the power inside of me
It was a gift of love that was meant to be

It was my only dream

No tears to cry,
No sad goodbyes
I'm spreading my wings and I'm ready to fly
No tears to shed, 
Only happiness ahead
This millennium will be my time to be free

Through it all I have grown, no regrets
I can say I've learned my lesson well
The struggle and pain I won't forget
It's made a mark on me
But with all of the strength I possess
I've gotta go for the chance of a life so sweet
No doubt in my mind, I am blessed
I'm gonna live my dream

Oooh I wanted it so bad I could cry

Melba Montgomery,"My little boy came into the kitchen this evening
While I was fixing supper
And he handed me a piece of paper he'd been writing on
And after wiping my hands on my apron
I read it - and this is what it said

For mowing the yard - five dollars
And for making my own bed this week - one dollar
And for going to the store - fifty cents
An' playing with little brother, while you went shopping 
Twenty-five cents
Taking out the trash - one dollar
Getting a good report card - five dollars
And for raking the yard - two dollars
Total owed - fourteen seventy-five.

Well, I looked at I'm standing there expectantly
And a thousand memories flashed through my mind
So I picked up the pen, turning the paper over,
This is what I wrote:

For nine months I carried you
Growing inside me - no charge
For the nights I've sat up with you,
Doctored you, prayed for you - no charge
For the time and the tears.
And the cost through the years, there's no charge
When you add it all up.
The full cost of my love is no charge.

For the nights filled with dread
And the worries ahead - no charge
For advice and the knowledge
And the cost of your college - no charge
For the toys, food and clothes and for wiping your nose
There's NO CHARGE, son
When you add it all up,
The full cost of my love, is - charge.

Well, when he finished readin'
He had great big old tears in his eyes
And he looked up at me and he said,
""Mama, I sure do love you.""
Then he took the pen,
And in great big letters
He wrote: ""Paid in full.""

When you add it all up
The cost of real love is - no charge.",No Charge

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Debe tener un bonito final, 
Puede ser alegre o tan triste 
Que nos haga llorar, 
Como llora ese angel en la trena, 
Que está cumpliendo condena, 
Por aplaudir cuando baila el viento 
Debajo de tu falda, 
Los celos y los amores 
Del que ayer no muere y mata

Y dijo un rey que el dinero 
No da la felicidad, 
Y yo digo que es una sensación tan parecida, 
Que por mucho que lo intento, 
Haga sol o sople el viento,

Más loco que de atar
Dibujo corazones
Después de echar mi aliento
En los cristales de tu voz

Y vuelvo a respirar
Tu aire y mis pulmones
Se llenan de la vida que me quitas
Al andar en otras direcciones
De las que sigo yo

Que pronto me olvidaste

No entiendo lo que has visto
En aquel tipo del chaqué
Si cuando se lo quita sus principios
No hacen pie, no hacen pie
No hacen pie y yo estoy
Completamente loco

Loco, borracho, perdido
Tan enamorado de ti y de mis vicios
Tirado en alguna cuneta en la meta
De la soledad

Y ya no se, camino del revés
De cara a la pared
Están mis sentimientos castigados
Sin saber, que por mirar pa' atrás
Tú no vas a volver y sigo torturando
A mi cabeza por tu piel

Si estoy en carne viva
No me tires alcohol, cúrame con saliva

No entiendo lo que has visto
En aquel tipo del chaqué
Si cuando se lo quita sus principios
No hacen pie, no hacen pie
No hacen pie y yo estoy
Completamente loco

Loco, borracho, perdido
Tan enamorado de ti y de mis vicios
Tirado en alguna cuneta en la meta
De la soledad

Tan lejos del mar pero sin tu cariño
Se ha roto la cuerda
Que me ataba a la razón
Tan lejos del sol, tan lejos del niño
Del que solo quedó

Melendi,"No quiero volver a soñar despierto 
Ni a ver un oasis en el desierto 
De tu corazón 
Soy tan solo un peón para ti. 

Y a veces grito al cielo por tu pelo 
Me muero por dentro me mata el silencio 
De tu corazon 
Y a veces cae la noche y me desvelo 
Casi al mismo tiempo que pierdo yo el sueño 
Por amor 

Y por amarte tanto, muero yo 

No quiero volver a las ilusiones 
Son como espejismos que hacen que te vea 
Como quiero yo 
Y la realidad no es así. 

Por mucho que quiera cambiar no puedo 
Me has mentido tanto, has secado mi llanto 
No tienes perdón 

Cogiste el pie cuando te di la mano 
Rompiste mi vida, me abriste una herida 
Y me echaste alcohol 

Y por amarte tanto muero yo 
Y por amarte tanto muero yo 

Siempre te perdoné 
Porque antes era fácil 
Cuando quieres a alquien 
Lo perdonas sin más 
Pero ahora que mi amor 
Está tan deteriorado 
Ahora que los champanes 
Me saben a aguarrás 
No quiero verte cerca 
Del culo de mi vaso 
Lo más cerca de mi casa

No quiero verte cerca 
De mi nariz de payaso 
No seré más tu saco, tu felpudo, tu bufón

El caminar de tu dedo en mi espalda dibujando un corazón

Es verdad nunca me dio esperanzas
Pero tampoco me las quitó
Quizás fue la puta de la duda
La que me llevó al error

Como un paraíso desolado,sin costillas ni manzanas
Como el aprendiz de caballero más tonto de Camelot
Como se quedó Escarlata O'Hara
Viendo aquel viento que se llevó
Todo lo que ella más quería
Fue por eso que juró

Hoy no salgo de mi casa
Lo de fuera ya no me interesa
Ella no me besaría ni aunque lo predigan mil profetas
Siempre me decía con su melodía
Que algún día iba a llorar
Y ahora que estoy solo y loco entre cuatro paredes
Rodeado de posters llenos de bellas mujeres
Me voy dando cuenta poco a poco que solo me importas tú! 
Y que mis labios ya no son el cementerio
Donde los tuyos vienen a morir
Que me has cortado el aire y sin remedio
Me va ha costar poder sobrevivir
Que me has tirado al mar de pies atados 
Y sujetando los recuerdos con las manos! 

Como una colilla bien marcada
Por el rojo de tus labios
Como solamente Piter
Desde que tú te llevaste el Pan
Como un tonto haciendo tonterías
O eso es lo que dice mi mamá
Sentado en la parada de tu casa
Igualito que Forrest Gump

Y en el pasado me quede
Cuando te volvías loca

Por debajo de la ropa

Melendi,"Hoy no me salen las palabras, no sé
Será que hoy vengo a hablarte de amor

Lo que que está muy claro aquí 
Es que yo he venido a por ti
No me digas que no tienes nada para darme amor
Y no me cambies de tema
Que hoy la luna llena quema
Como este silencio tan incomodo

Hace tiempo que me fijo que besas tu crucifijo 
Si algo hay malo en las noticias
Y que te muerdes el labio inferior 
Cuando el galán se besa en la protagonista
Que le suspiras al cielo 
Como pidiendo un deseo 
Cuando empieza a atardecer
Y que te haces autofotos 
Colocando los morritos

Hace tiempo que sospecho 
Que acomodado en tu pecho yo alcanzaría la gloría 
Y que tienes un antojo en lo más bajo de la espalda
Donde pierdo la memoria
Que no te gusta ver sola las películas de miedo 
Cuando se pone a llover
Y que mueves tus caderas 
Cuando ponen en la radio Aventura o algo así
Hace tiempo que te observo
Un día más del que te quiero mujer

Quiero que seas mi musa
Mi compás, mi semifusa 
Mi armonía más pagana
Mi guión con argumento
Mi cuento pero sin hadas
Quiero ser un vagabundo

De la mano de su dama
Hasta que sobre la piel 
Para poder besarte el alma",Autofotos
Melendi,"Educadamente te daría un consejo
Que probablemente todavía no sabes
El demonio sabe mucho más por viejo
Que por ser el rey de todos nuestros males

Con la realidad te vas a dar de bruces
Si piensas que un euro es mejor que un detalle
Porque una ventana que da un patio luces
Puede brillar más que una que da a la calle

Y ahora vete en busca de aquella cartera que sostenga
tus tratamientos de belleza mientras tengas
Porque sabrás que eso no dura eternamente, amiga mía

Así que vete
En busca de cada delirio de grandeza
Y si la vida te endereza
Y tu caballo ganador se te despeña
Recuerda que tú rechazaste ser la flor para mi vida
Por ser solo un pétalo en la de ese tipo

Que pena me das niñita consentida
Con tu cheque falso al portamor vencido
Aunque pensándolo bien
¿Cual sería nuestro futuro?
Tú que prefieres un peso a un beso
Y yo no tengo ni un puto duro
Tú que solo comes hojas y yo solo carne roja
Yo vivo en un cuento chino y tu en una peli de Almodóvar
Tu que presumes de atea, mientras yo vivo de la marea
Un dios puso en mi garganta

Ya llegue a la conclusión

Más bien tarde que pronto
Tenía 16 y ese bigotillo tonto
Ella se me acerco
Menos mal porque si lo tengo que hacer yo
Quizás aún estaría, más virgen que maría
Pero a todos nos llega el momento
Donde no hay otra salida

Ella me dijo: ""Espero que eso sea el móvil""
Cuando empezaron a temblar mis pantalones
Y yo le dije: ""no cariño, eso es mi hombría
Que lleva 16 añitos escondida"" 
Camino a casa paramos en 100 portales 
Y pude desabrocharle tan solo un par de botones

Por eso cuando fui a mear 
No os podéis imaginar 
Que dolor dentro de cartera
Cuando llego un municipal diciéndome
""pero chaval, qué haces meándote en la acera""
Ella tardo 5 segundos en decirle al policía
""nisiquiera lo conozco""
Exactamente lo mismo que tarde yo 
En guardar mi china disimulando en su bolso

Mi primer beso fue 
Algo contradictorio
Es verdad, hubo placer
Y un dolor de mil demonios
Pues yo jamás pensé 
Que dolería tanto la primer vez
Que quedas más caliente
Que el tipo del tridente
Y por fin llego el duro momento 
De la triste despedida

Ella me dio un teléfono para llamarla 
Y resulto ser el de un restaurante chino
Y cuando llamé preguntando por Yolanda 
Y un chino me leyó las clases de arroz frito
Empezaron a salir rallos y centellas 
Encima de mi cabeza, como si en una viñeta
Viviera triste y desolado con el único consuelo 
De haberte tocado las narices
Cuando tu padre descubrió en tu bolso 
Un sospechoso olor llegado de bajos países
Al fin de semana siguiente
Cuando nos vimos de frente
No quiso ni saludarme
Cuando le dije picaresco
""Nena, yo soy tu refresco
Agítame antes de usarme""

Y así como empezó mi andadura en el amor
Lo peor es que pasa el tiempo y no he mejorado mucho
Sigo siendo aquel niño flacucho
Lo que sí es verdad, es que no he vuelto a besar 
Ni lo volveré a hacer jamás con los ojos cerrados

Y es que yo no quiero pasar por tu vida como las modas
No se asuste señorita nadie le a hablado de boda
Yo tan solo quiero ser las 4 patas de tu cama
Tu perro todas las noches tu tregua cada mañana
Quiero ser tu medicina, tus silencios y tus gritos
Tu ladrón, tu policía, tu jardín con enanitos
Quiero ser la escoba que en tu vida barra la tristeza
Quiero ser tu incertidumbre y sobretodo tu certeza

Y es que yo quiero ser el que nunca olvida tu cumpleaños
Quiero que seas mi rosa y mi espina aunque me hagas daño
Quiero ser tu carnaval, tus principios y tus finales
Quiero ser el mar donde puedas ahogar todos tus males
Quiero que seas mi tango de gardel, mis octavillas
Mi media luna de miel, mi blus, mi octava maravilla
El baile de mi salón, la cremallera y los botones
Quiero que lleves tu falda y también mis pantalones

Tu astronauta, el primer hombre que pise tu luna
Clavando una bandera de locura
Para pintar tu vida de color, de pasión,
De sabor, de emoción y ternura
Siempre que usted que yo ya no tengo cura
Sin tu amor",Tu Jardín Con Enanitos

Yo podría prometerte el mundo

Lo sabe desde el momento en que la ve

Melendi,"Yo estaba vestido de Habanero 
Tú dijiste adiós con la mirada 
Mientras que sonaba un tan Romeo 
En un balcón de la vieja Habana 

No hay nada más perro que el amor 
Porque muerde siempre antes que ladra 
Me latió tan fuerte el corazón 
Me dijiste ""ven"" desde la barra 

Y yo te dije ""niña te invito un mojito"" 
Tú me dejaste clarito que la cosa no iba así (oye la cosa no va así) 
Y fue entonces cuando le pedí a la virgen 
De la caridad del pobre que intercediera por mí (ay que intercediera por mi) 
De repente, tú cambiaste de semblante 
Me empezaste a ver galante, yo te dije ""eres mi atril"" 
Fuimos sólo dos extraños y han pasado ya diez años 

Mi amor propio se quedó en los huesos 
Que pinga contigo, me dijiste 
Dejó de sonar el tal Romeo 
Le llegó el turno a Silvio Rodríguez 
Y a lomos de un unicornio azul 
Te perdiste por el malecón 
Yo me hice la señal de la cruz 
Tú no me dejaste otra elección 

Y yo te dije ""niña te invito un mojito"" 
Tú me dejaste clarito que la cosa no iba así (oye la cosa no va así) 
Y fue entonces cuando le pedí a la virgen 
De la caridad del pobre que intercediera por mi (ay que intercediera por mi) 
De repente, tú cambiaste de semblante 
Me empezaste a ver galante, yo te dije ""eres mi atril"" 
Luego por fin bailamos, yo prometí no pisarte 
Tú eras cien libras de arte y me empezaste a acalorar (tú me empezaste a acalorar) 
Me volviste, mi amor loco de remate 
Tus labios de chocolate, me invitaron a pecar (ay me invitaron a pecar) 
Y me dijiste ""no todas somos iguales"" 
Y mis manos ilegales comenzaron a temblar 
Fuimos sólo dos extraños y han pasado ya 10 años

Desde que estamos juntos
Porque volví a buscarte 
Yo te pedí perdón, me hiciste arrodillarme 
Desde que estamos juntos
Mi cielo, el de tu boca 
Y a cinco bajo cero sigue estorbando la ropa 
Desde que estamos juntos
Me muero por tus pecas 
Me licencié en tus piernas y en tu piel tengo una beca 
Desde que estamos juntos
Me ando quitando el sombrero 
Que del melocotón ardiente como el ron, mi dulce flor de enero 
Desde que estamos juntos
Oye que Cuba es Cuba y lo demás boberias 
Aay con frecuencia cubana, Melendi llegó a la Habana 
Desde que estamos juntos
Ay por Dios, se formo tremendo lío 
Melendi con su saborio, ¿quien lo iba a decir? ¡Melendi! 
Desde que estamos juntos
Vente a la Habana a vivir, mi pana, ay Dios

To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star

But until then, baby, I'm the one who's crazy
'Cause that's the way you make me feel
I don't want no romance
I just want the chance to show you that I'm for real

I never said that I would be your everything
But you know that I love you, baby
And it's gonna be such a shame
When you can start living with it

Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice
Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice

Bright lights and big cities
Don't go to my baby's head
You know I love you, baby
But you choose this life instead

So just remember what cha momma told you
Before she sent you on your way
She told never ever be too clever
To not see your own mistakes

I'll be here waiting for you
When you come off your trip
And I guess I will always be the one
To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby

Can we solve this mystery?

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

All is black, like the crows, stiff my neck as it bows.
On my knees I will play among death and decay,
And it blackens the sun as the end has begun.

I never saw the mighty spirits
That gathered now to purity the world.
It is the time of the changing season,
The cleaning hands of water. Wind and fire - feel the fire.

Winter rides the wings of heaven
Sorrow marches through the land.
This is the beginning of the end.

And the flood rises higher, swallows cities alive.
Still the flames' hunger grows, taking over our homes.
In the eye of the storm, gods creation reborn.
666 in our hearts, it will tear us apart.

This is the age of the sunlight children
And from the ashes we'll build it up again.
The curtain of the night will fall down
And stronger, wiser than before we'll stand - take my hand.

Sorrow marches through the land.

Darkness covers lonely faces,
Merciful death takes their hand.

Of a spiritual presence that reaps

In the forest and dark, bowers of man's domain

Bodies bleed reincarnate
Demons scream abominate
Witches hang in levitate
The chant you speak controls your fate
Dead by dawn, they laugh and wait
Evil dead will take you now
Evil dead will take you down

Dijiste cosas que encendieron un sol
Que buena historia yo compré la ilusión
Y manejabas los detalles como una vocación, umm

No había duda que tal fue la impresión
De mi cordura tu ciclón arrasó
Estuve cerca de perder el control
Cuando de pronto mi otro yo me gritó

De que me sirve un viaje al cielo
Si no hay amor del verdadero
De que me sirve prender fuego
Si para ti sólo es un juego
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, oh
Ah Jah, ah Jah, ay

Que bien quedó tu juego de seducción
No sospeché porque tanta devoción
El brillo de tus ojos me hipnotizó
Y por poco caigo presa en tu trampa de amor, umm no, no

Fueron las copas el baile la pasión
Flotaba a un metro de la realidad hoy
Estuve cerca de perder el control
Cuando de pronto mi otro yo me gritó

De que me sirve un viaje al cielo
Si no hay amor del verdadero
De que me sirve prender fuego
Si para ti sólo es un juego

Y cuando caiga de esa nube
Se quebrarán todos mis sueños
Ya no me calmarán tus besos
Tú perteneces a otro lecho

To help in many places along the trails we blaze.
Light the light and do our share,
Reach out your hand and someone's there
And I believe, together, We Change the World
This third verse was sent to me by Donna 
I'm pretty sure it's not part of the original song

To our sisters around the world who are struggling just to live

Melinda Caroll,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all

It doesn't even matter",Put a Little Love in Your Heart/Lean on Me [Vocal Version]
Melinda Gaborno,"Never mind all the things you heard about me
You're never gonna understand it
Every time that I've given you the truth
It's never made a bit of difference

Disappointment takes you
Then the doubt, it breaks you
It's enough to make you cry

Always looking for a sign
Miracles won't change your mind
Tell me how much evidence you need
Turning truth into a lie
Hardened heart and blinded eye
All you need to do is just believe

Never mind what you think that you had seen
It all can change in just a moment
Here before you is all the proof you need
Why can't you ever just believe it?",Believe
Melinda Schneider,"Life's too short to sweat the small stuff 
After all it's all just small stuff
We've only got one life to live
Let's live it all night long It's a waste of time sitting crying
'Bout things you can't control 
No need to sweat it just forget it 
Come on baby come on

When it's all said and done
It's all about having fun
Don't waste time looking over your shoulder
Before you know it it's all over

Go to work go to bed 
Get up and start it all over again
Now there's a reason we're on this earth 
And I'm gonna get my money's worth

He wants to add to the family tree

He wants at least two or three

He?s been waiting impatiently

For me to add to the family tree

There?s lots of hugs and kissing everything is oh so sweet

But he says there?s something missing, the pitter patter of little feet

He?s positively clucky like a rooster in a chicken house

Dirty nappies on the line, coochie cooing all the time

Does he know what he?s talking about

He wants to add to the family tree

He wants at least two or three

He?s been waiting impatiently

For me to add to the family tree

He came home with a boot load of stuff to paint the spare room blue

Lego and some play dough and a Bob the builder tool box too

He?s oh so gung ho, guess it?s time for me to face the fact

I?ll be feet up on the couch with a Joey in my pouch

Getting ready for an broken back

He wants to add to the family tree

He wants at least two or three

He?s been waiting impatiently

For me to add to the family tree

Dirty nappies on the line, coochie cooing all the time

I guess doesn?t sound so bad if he?s cute and cuddly

And looks a little bit like me with more hair than his dad

But right now one?ll do me

To add to the family tree

Big bus covered in dust off to find a circus

They?ll make her jump through rings of fire

She?ll have to learn to walk that wire

Her father?s daughter here?s what he taught her

Dream big, don?t quit, keep focused on it

And never lose your hearts desire

The you I fell in love with is gone

Why does it take forever to be strong

And finally end a love that feels so wrong

What was I thinking

I gave you all the love I ever could

Hoping there may come a day you would

Give me back the love I gave as good

Was I thinking that my heart wouldn?t break

Now I think about it

I just wasn?t thinking straight

First I was falling

Ended up sinking

But I will live to love another day

And look back on what we had and say

When you?re feeling all alone

Just pick up the telephone

It?s a weird, wild, wide-open, wonderful world

And we?ll always think we?re different and we?ll always be the same

Thinks they?re the only one in the dark

But somewhere someone?s wishing on the same star

And in my minds eye there?s a mountain of mile high doubt

Tell me what?s wrong tell me what?s going on in your head

It?s a long lonely row to hoe this trying to get down to your soul

And yes I?m a mess from the tossing turning losing sleep from all the secrets that you keep

Life can be a hard gravel road

And the weight of the world is one heavy load

When you need a place to just lay low

And hear somebody say


Rest your weary mind

I promise you?ll be fine

I?ll rock you in these arms of mine

Come rest your weary mind


There?s a sadness coming through

That?s nothin? like the girl I knew

So if you need someone to just love you

I will softly say

It?s full on fightin? then kissin? all night even though I know I?m right and you?re wrong

Making love when we first wake up

That?s the icing on the cake but

Seeing me without my make- up

That?s truly truly


We?ve been down and up and down

Thought of throwing in the towel

And we?re far from perfect now but so what

?Cause it?s about the ride we take

And the memories we make

And the way the earth still quakes when we touch

Been stilled by what I saw

And through the years

I think I?ve pretty much seen it all


Seven seas and heavenly symphonies

Rows of red roses in bloom

I stood there amazed by the beauty and wonder

Took it all in and I said ?that was something? but

You are something else


Everything I seen

You?re still the fairest one

Baby everything

Pales in comparison


Mountain summits and desert sunsets

Fireflies that dance on the night

Weeping willows and perfect rainbows

I?ve seen the great Northern lights

You are something else


And something else

You?re something more

Something that?s never been before

Melissa Auf der Maur,"With her head in the clouds, 
She keeps her distance and keeps resisting 
They're so proud of what she's missing, 
She is so delighted 
Why must I find that falling down 
Brings my hopes high, oh so high 
Why must you cry when I fall down? 
It helps me with the truth inside 

The fear is tempting, 
It consumes them
The loving darkness they claim she's missing 
The job is hers to keep resisting 
The claiming unknown they're so proud of 
The job is hers to keep resisting
She is so delighted 
Why must I find that falling down 
Brings my hopes high, oh so high? 
Why must you cry when I fall down? 
The truth is mine; only mine 
Don't you know it's my foggy notion? 
So please don't cry when I fall down 
It helps me with the truth inside 

I hide, I hide
Joy to the foggy notions, in my room 
Got to get away, they'll be here soon

Cuts across the land,
Bloody ships asail,

Swallowed by the sand,
Thy kingdom comes no more,

Melissa Errico,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Melissa Errico,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep a song from fading too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things to say?

And since we know we're always changing
Why should it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear her name

I know the way you feel for her, it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in her eyes, I may not see forever, forever

If you can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it better
As it grows, with any luck, then I suppose
The music never ends

I know the way I feel for her, it's now or never

I turn the other cheek

Some other woman is making love to you

Melissa Etheridge,"I got a chrome-plated heart
I got wings on these fingers trying to tear it apart
I got angels crying from up above
And they got rust in their eyes
They got rust on their love
But I have learned to leave no stone unturned
And keep the wall against my back
And the love is real as the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night

I got a two dollar stare
Midas in my touch and Delilah in my hair
I got bad intentions on the soles of my shoes
With this red hot fever and these chromium blues
And I will feel another lovers wheel
And drive for miles and not look back
And the love is real as the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night

On my chrome-plated heart
Wings on these fingers trying to tear it apart
I got angels crying from up above
And they got rust in their eyes
They got rust on their love
And the only way I know where the train will go
Is when I'm sleeping on the tracks
And the love is real as the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night

As black as night",Chrome Plated Heart
Melissa Etheridge,"Just outside my window I hear the late September dogs
And I understand their warning I understand their song
Since you left I feel the change in the air
And night after night I'm searching for mercy everywhere
So I wake in the street and I call out your name
I shout to the sky please

Come on let it rain
Let it rain down on me
Let the rain touch my hands
Let the rain set me free
Let it rain down on me

Silence is the steel that pierces and cuts me to the bone
In dreams the hand that touches you is mine and mine alone
Cruel is the light is the morning shining down on me
Hours with the Devil to understand just what you need
So I wake in the street and I call out your name
Shout to the sky come on

Come on let it rain
Let it rain down on me
Let the rain fill my eyes
Let the rain set me free
Let it rain down on me

Just inside the distance I hear the late September dogs
And so I beg for sleep the child who walked before she crawled
Damn my soul that remembers and clutches to this pain

Melissa Etheridge,"Is it so hard to satisfy your senses?
You found out to love me you have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right you say you found someone to hold you
Does she like I do

Baby tell me does she love you like the way I love you
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you
Tell me does she miss you existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do
Tell me does she want you, infatuate and haunt you
Does she know just how to shock and electrify and rock you
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you
Like the way I do
Like the way I do

Can I survive all the implications
Even if I tried could you be less than an addiction
Don't you think I know there's so many others
Who would beg steal and lie, fight, kill and die
Just to hold you, hold you like I do

Baby tell me does she love you like the way I love you
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you
Tell me does she miss you existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do
Tell me does she want you, infatuate and haunt you
Does she know just how to shock and electrify and rock you
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you

Oh, nobody loves you, like the way I do
Nobody wants you, like the way I do
Nobody needs you, like the way I do
Nobody aches, nobody aches just to hold you

No, no, no

Tell me does she love you like the way I love you
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you
Tell me does she miss you, existing just to kiss you

Melissa Etheridge,"Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

You never had to wait for nothing in your life
I guess wanting me must have been a steel blue knife
And when night after night the scent of passion would linger
You had to have the jewels wrapped around your finger
Now you keep running down the road in your midnight state of mind
Curiosity kills if you can't read the signs

Go on and close your eyes, imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

Dancing with the wall made you bitter and sweet
There ain't much you can do when they just lay it at your feet
But you could tell by the song I wanted to be the one
Did you listen again when the damage was done
Now the paint's still wet in your do-it-by-number dream
Are you gonna tell me how it felt, will you tell me what it means

Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

Was it want with no desire?
Was it smoke with no fire?
Did I say it doesn't rip me apart?
I lied
I'm sorry dear my hands are tied

Melissa Etheridge,"I had a dream late last night
The water was running low
And my fields were on fire, burning my sky
My body was moving slow
And when I awoke I tasted the sweat of desire in my mouth
And I realized my heart had abducted my mind
And they were last seen headed south
Now I can't sleep I'm so wired
And I find myself screaming out

Don't you need don't you want
Can't you taste it when you're alone
Don't you cry don't you feel
Sometimes I wonder if you are real
Don't you bleed
Don't you need

There's no quenching the thirst there's no relief
For the hungry at heart
And as far as you're concerned I'm just a thief
Entertaining in the dark
But it's you that holds the cards
Now that the joker is wild

Don't you want to lay it down
And feel your skin against the ground
Don't you want to ride the storm
And then sleep inside the calm
Don't you want to get that high
Don't you want to be satisfied
Well if you don't want it from me
Don't you need

I had a dream late last night
The water was running low
And my fields were on fire burning my sky
How was I to know
That I burn every night in my dreams
And only morning can set me free

Across the room turn into lies and laughter
And asking for my name again

One quenchless night of shaking lust and fire

Pounding heart inside my chest I'm screaming

I dreamed like a child of wonder
With my back in the grass
My eyes to the sky to see
I believed in the stars
I knew they cast a spell that I was under

I was part of the earth
Every living thing was part of me

I can't feel it

There was nothing else like this
This unimagined bliss this ecstasy
Deep inside the night
I believed I saw the light ignite a fire
And it burned into the dark
It burned deep inside my heart
I thought it would burn eternally

Could be a homicide 
Wake me up when we hit 2001

It's barely alive with a story at five 
So turn your video on 
We live in these years dark age of fear 
Meet me in 2001

I've searching 
Searching for a reason 
To either fight or fly 
Either way patriot or treason 
It's gonna be one long hard ride 
Wake me up when we hit 2001",2001
Melissa Etheridge,"Sometimes I know that it's never enough 
Survival is fine but satisfaction is rough 
I try with an angel tonight 
Spread these wings and I'm on for the ride 
Cruise these streets where my innocence hides 
There's some things you can't deny 
What is it about this human condition 
I need some kind of promise 
Some kind of submission tonight

Ain't it heavy 
Ain't the night heavy
Heavy 
Ain't it heavy 
Ain't the night heavy

I'm feelin' kinda loose, I'm feelin' kinda mean 
I've been feeling kinda wild since I turned seventeen 
Or, is it madness 
Tell me where can a woman find any kind of peace 
When does the fury and the agony cease 
How long have I got to say please 
There's a hole in my jeans I only wanted to fade 
I've been ripping out seams 
Somebody else made tonight

Melissa Etheridge,"Sometimes I feel like an innocent one
To deserve this fate what I have I ever done
I know that I made all the rules
But time can even change the hopeless ways of fools
I love you tonight like I did yesterday
I won't think of tomorrow or the price I pay
I drink from the well my soul is dry
I never know why

All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it
I thought I had a piece of my soul left to sell
I guess it's just as well
'Cause the angels won't have it

Who's looking after this see-through heart
Someone up there isn't doing their part
Oh Cupid you foolish boy
You should take better aim with your brand new toy
I love you tonight like I did yesterday
I don't think of tomorrow or the price I pay
I drink from the well my soul is dry

'Cause the angels won't have it

So if I die before I wake
The innocent one whose heart could never break
Lift me up take me out of this bed
Watching the angels shake their heads
Don't feel sorry for me baby honey don't you cry
You can sell all of my clothes you will forget me by and by
I'll be riding that train I'll be singing that song
But I won't be gone for long
'Cause the angels won't have it

All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it

Melissa Etheridge,"Tonight I feel so weak
But all in love is fair
I turn the other cheek
And I feel the slap and the sting of the foul night air
And I know you're only human
And I haven't got talking room
But tonight while I'm making excuses
Some other woman is making love to you

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive
Can't you see my baby's got another lover
I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see it's out of control
Baby's got my heart and my baby's got my mind
But tonight the sweet devil, the sweet devil's got my soul

Will this aching pass
Will this night be through
Wanna hear the breaking glass
I only feel the steel of the red hot truth
And I'd do anything to get it out of my mind
I need some insanity that temporary kind
Tell me how will I ever be the same
When I know that that woman is whispering your name

And the madness of the pleasure and ecstasy

Sell your fear and leave me standing here

To come into your kitchen and play
Cool, cool just a crazy fool

I can see his fortress strong 
Surrounded by his army

In the cars as they go by 
Does he ever want to ask me why

And he's seen with all the women 
Who think that he's a god 
And he blesses whom he pleases 
Holding fast to the facade 
I want to reach out and believe him 
Through his miles and miles of pain 
But lately when I touch him

Dance without fear 
Dance without senses no message I hear

Dance till I'm numb 
Dance till I think I can overcome

Between the black and the white 
This child is so angry 
Alone here tonight 
Alarming desperation 
Leads me to believe 
With all my shields and protection 
It's only me I deceive

Dance without senses no message I hear 
Dance without sleeping 
Dance till I'm numb

The voice on the radio 
The kiss on the movie screen

Mothers hold on and they never go 
Lovers hold on and they never go 
Lovers they come and they never go

Now that the passion's died 
Still it comes so slow

This complicated heart 
And I hope to find 
Something I can prove is real 
I can feel is truth 
I can say is mine

Place your hand

Shards of past relations 
Splintering my skin

It can suffocate creation 
And refuse to let you in

Place your hand 
My body will decide 
Place your hand 
My anger will subside

And they speak to me like prophets in my dreams 
Speak to me like prophets in my dreams 
Shouting like prophets in my dreams

Too easy for the living

A decaf coffee in her hand

But today she'll pay the bills
She won't think about the thrills

And her hair is killer red

When she can barely keep her head
She don't owe nobody nothing
And she ain't on the street
But these drinks are getting heavy
And these lips are getting weak
She don't understand
Why she can't climb out of the sand
And break away

And she will live and die in this man's world

Now they give you hell

And you've heard it on the street

Deny all that you feel
And they will bring you home again

And as you pray in your darkness

But no one told you what you'd feel
The empty aching hours
Trying to conceal
The natural progression
Is the coming of your age
But they cover it with shame
And turn it into rage

And as you pray in your darkness
For wings to set you free
You are bound to your silent legacy

You are digging for the answers
Until your fingers bleed
To satisfy the hunger
To satiate the need
They feed you on the guilt
To keep you humble keep you low

A thousand years ago

For wings to set you free

Your passion your promise your end
Yes I am

Barring divine intervention
There is nothing between you and I
And if I carelessly forgot to mention
Your body your power can sanctify
Come feed your hunger your thirst
Lay it down the beast will die
You can question my heart once again

Am I your passion your promise your end
I say I am
Yes I am
Your passion your promise your end
Yes I am

I will stand firm in the tempest
I will ride destiny's trail
To believe when the truth comes up empty
To hold and respect without fail
Come and be one in the motion
A desire they cannot comprehend
Never to question again
For I am your passion your promise your end
Oh yes I am",Yes I Am
Melissa Etheridge,"I want to find me a car
With only one headlight
A straight six Ford
On a good luck night
I want to roll down the windows
And teach you to fly
I want to give you a thrill
The kind you can't buy

I want to lose all your demons and go
I want to tear off your chains 'cause I know

All the way to heaven is heaven
Caught between the spirit and the dust
All the way to heaven is heaven
Deep inside of us

I want to find me a bar
With a blue light on
Dollar shot specials
A bartender named Dawn
Painting the town
Selling the farm
You can pierce your nose
And I'll tattoo my arm

I want to lose all your demons and go
I want to tear off your chains 'cause I know

All the way to heaven is heaven
Caught between the spirit and the dust
All the way to heaven is heaven
Deep inside of us

I want to find me a carnival
Outside of town
A tilt-a-whirl set up
With a merry-go-round
Cotton candy fingers
And a snow cone mouth
I want to roll you in sawdust
Till they run us both out
All the way to heaven
All the way",All the Way to Heaven
Melissa Etheridge,"You woke me up at 3:00 a.m. 
To tell me about the fire 
You said that she was more than a friend 
You were consumed by your desire 

And so it goes 
This too shall pass away 
It cuts so strange 
The only thing that stays the same 
Is change 

Your love was here but now it's gone 
And your eyes no longer want me 
And now I can't hold back the dawn 
And the truth that seems to haunt me 

And so it goes 
This too shall pass away 
It cuts so strange 
The only thing that stays the same 
Is change 
The only thing
That stays the same 
Is change 

I'm not so sure where I have been 
I don't know just where I'm going 
Hard as I hold it in my hand 
I can stop the wind from blowing 

And so it goes 
This too shall pass away 
It cuts so strange 
Roll me away 
It cuts so strange 
The only thing that stays the same 
Is change",Change
Melissa Etheridge,"Take, take a look at the sky
Sometimes your heaven seems to far away
Take, take a look under here
Where deprivation turns into decay
I've stood under this rain, felt it seep into my brain
I've shut my eyes and crawled around this mud
I'm scared of growin' old, I shiver when I'm cold
Don't you think I bleed the same blood?

I, I could've been you, you could've been me
One small change that shapes your destiny
If you want the proof, cut me and you'll see
I could've been you, you could've been me

Wait, wait before you turn off
Maybe there's a chance we can relate
Wait, everybody turns on
Why deny a fact that's so innate?
It's not so easy anymore, the way you used to keep score
Not so black and white, the color of your sin
Take a walk inside my shoes, a path I didn't choose
Spend the night inside of my skin

I, I could've been you, you could've been me
One small change that shapes your destiny
If you want the proof, cut me and you'll see
I could've been you, you could've been me

Change is turning into fear, fear is melting into hate
With hate you justify your crime, a crime compassion can erase
Erase
Erase

Touch, touch what I feel
And know I believe everything I say
So go, go if you must
Remember one thing as you walk away:

I, I could've been you, you could've been me
One small change that shapes your destiny
If you want the proof, cut me and you'll see
I could've been you, you could've been me
",I Could Have Been You
Melissa Etheridge,"I'll buy you mangoes baby
Your favorite fruit
I'll shave everything baby

Don't make me fade because

I really like you baby
I want to see you baby
I really like you baby
I want to be you baby

I'll gladly make you
My first tattoo

Melissa Etheridge,"I know a place
Down past an old shack
On a road that goes to nowhere
Ain't nobody coming back
We can go there tonight
We can talk until dawn
Or maybe something else
I'll leave the radio on

There's no one to hear
You might as well scream
They never woke up
From the American dream
And they don't understand
What they don't see
And they look through you 
And they look past me
Oh, you and I dancing slow
And we got nowhere to go

Past the Wal-Mart and the prison
Down by the old V.A. 
Just my jeans and my t-shirt
And my blue Chevrolet
It's Saturday night
Feels like everything's wrong
I've got some strawberry wine
I want to get you alone

Down by the muddy water
Of the mighty Mo
In an old abandoned box car
Will I ever know
Dance with me forever
This moment is divine
I'm so close to heaven
This hell is not mine 
This hell is not mine",Nowhere to Go
Melissa Etheridge,"I wonder what you're doing
In the night out there
Is a sad summer breath tangled in your hair
Can you hear the lonely engines
Screaming through the town
There's no where to run
When the darkness comes down

Is there a song inside of you
That you tried to forget
Like your fake ID and your mom's cigarettes
Does it take you back
Is the vision intense
You and me in Shriner's Park
Trying to make some sense

You were just seventeen
But your laughter was mild
You liked my dreams you thought I was wild
Is there a rhythm in your step now
That reminds you of a dance
Do you push it all away
Cause you never took the chance

You'd sneak out your window
When I'd come for you
I'd be waiting in the street light on 8th Avenue
You'd slip into my car
We'd drive down past the fence
You and me in Shriner's Park
Trying to make some sense

Did you feel like you were crazy
When they sent you far away
Did no one have the answers
When you hung your head to pray
You could not let yourself dream
Never dare believe
You could ever be more
Than you were born to be

Do you lock up your house
Like you locked up your past
If I were to call
Could you free me at last
Could you slip into my car
Could we drive down past the fence
You and me in Shriner's Park
Trying to make some sense",Shriner's Park

Carry my sword

Tell them I'm all right

1:25 a.m. I thought that you were headed for the door
Then something touched my skin
I won't ask you to leave here any more

Was it the talk or the drink or the dance that led to this
Was I so naive presuming the innocence
Well it's 1:54 and it's such an unusual kiss

Over and over
Come on come on come on

When running water becomes too deep

Deep down inside 
I think we're all the same

And never shame 
I do believe that people are good 
They just want hope and respect 
And to be understood 

Sometimes it hard sometimes it's strange 
But the truth of the heart is people can change 

Yes there is danger and there are shadows 
And there is fear inside the dark 
It has powered countries and borne religion 
Fear can never rule the heart

There are some things in my life
I'll never understand
But they become the force
That makes me who I am

Don't you worry about the kids
The kids are all right
Mama's rollin' in the back yard
Filled with love and light
'cause you live and you learn
And you learn to hold on
And time will make it heal
And time will make it gone

Come with me now
Come with me now

It's time to fly",The Different
Melissa Etheridge,"What went right
What went wrong
Doesn't really matter much
When it's gone

Was it too hard to try
Was it too hard to lie
Did you just grow tired of hello and goodbye
Was it the naked truth that made you run
Where do I go now
That I'm down to one

Sooner or later
We all end up walking alone
I'm down to one

My heart is a traitor
It led me down this road
Now it's done
I'm down to one

I want to know where I failed
I want to know where I sinned
Cause I don't want to ever feel this way again
Was the wanting too deep
Did it block your sun
Where do I go now
That I'm down to one

I guess sooner or later
We all end up walking alone
I'm down to one

My heart is a traitor
It led me down this road
Now it's done
I'm down to one

What am I supposed to think
What am I gonna say
What did I ever know
About this love anyway

Down to one

My heart is a traitor
It led me down this road
And I'm down to one

I guess sooner or later

Called a new friend for the second time

For a moment there
This felt just like dying
But now I see that something inside
Is coming alive
Ain't it crazy

No use running from a revolution
I just surrender to this evolution

Heal me lift me
Take me to the other side
Amazing grace
Has touched my face
And the sweet sound doesn't lie

Ain't it crazy
For a moment there
I just gave up trying
But now I see
You can let the light in
You can begin again

I am a witness to my resurrection

Melissa Etheridge,"I have climbed the highest mountain
I have sailed across the sea
I have wrestled with my demons
And woke up with only me
I have been around the block
Three times maybe four
And I think I deserve just a little more

In front of total strangers won't you kiss me
Flowers for no reason but you miss me
Oh I want to be in love
You're standing on the doorstep in the rain
Cause you couldn't wait to see me once again
Oh I want to be in love

I have made some big mistakes
And I've paid a heavy price
I found a little peace between will and sacrifice
I have watched as all my dreams
Went walking out the door
And I think I deserve just a little more

I'm looking for a heart of gold
I'm looking for a hand to hold
A happy end
Strong and kind
Somewhere to rest my troubled mind

In front of total strangers won't you kiss me
Flowers for no reason but you miss me
Oh I want to be in love
On Tuesday light the candles bring me wine
Wednesday morning I won't get to work on time

Take my hand as they play our song again

Well it was definitely gone when I woke up today
I walked up to the mirror to see
It's only me

I got out of the kitchen I couldn't stand the heat
Back into my skin and out on the street
Lookin' for a little salvation
It's only me

Baby you can just pretend 
That maybe you can love again
But babe I know better
It's only me
And wherever you are tonight
The satisfaction you invite
Nobody knows better
It's only me

Well I went down to the revival
To give my soul a chance
And the DJ spoke to God
And the congregation danced
And I heard a sound and I turned around
It's only me

I found a little angel who had fallen from the sky
And I took that little angel and I taught her how to fly
When the night is done and the morning comes
It's only me

Baby you can just pretend 
That maybe you can love again
But babe I know better
It's only me

And all you'll ever taste
And all you'll ever bleed

You had broke all the rules
And you changed your mind

Didn't I love you right

Melissa Etheridge,"It's been so long since I've touched
So long since I wanted
Then you made me laugh
And my heart opened

I want you to find me charming and wise
I just want you to find me
Somewhere here inside
I barely know you
We've been sort of friends
So what if I called you and called you again
What would I tell you
Where would I begin

Please forgive me
If I don't know what to do
It's an old fire
This familiar desire
But my skin is painfully new

There's a light in my window
It shines all night long
In the morning my coffee
Is sweet but it's strong
I carefully reach out from behind these walls
I'll take a deep breath and give you a call
Hello how are you
Not much at all

Lost in this hole
That has ripped through my soul
I unlock this secret inside

As my mind and my body collide",Please Forgive Me

You gotta learn to crawl

I drove all night just to drive all day
But the walls of this prison still surround me
And I can't break away

I held you so close I thought my soul would break
But you were just a ghost

And I just dream of vanishing into the crowd
Longing for home again

I can't ask if I could walk through the world in your eyes

I looked like hell twisted up and tangled

For too long you've been tied up you've been strangled

And ten and ten again
I have seen too much to pretend
Then you wanted to come in
I have survived all of the lies
They made me wise
The locks and walls and the peace it buys
Still when I look into your eyes
It's a surprise when you say

It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
Just hold on tight
Let it all go away

Oh mercy mercy baby
What do you want from me

Well I plead mercy mercy baby
I do not know what this all means
It's been awhile since I been stylin'
In just my jacket and my jeans
It hurts to walk it hurts to talk
It hurts to think about it
Shout about it
Could I be sure without a doubt
That you could never live without me

I want to fall in you crawl in you
Surrender all in you now
Could I be sure in you pure in you
Finding the cure in you
Now I plead have mercy on me

Now I am kneeling at the alter
In the temple of your eyes
And I am asking for a miracle
I have been too long paralyzed
When you say get up and stand up
And climb the rope of hope
And open up again
Oh the peace you say is promised me

Skippin' and dodgin'
From a 44

10:03 on a Tuesday morning
In the fall of an American dream
A man is doing what he knows is right
On flight 93
He loved his mom and he loved his dad
He loved his home and he loved his man
But on that bloody Tuesday morning
He died an American

Now you cannot change this
You can't erase this
You can't pretend this is not the truth

Even though he could not marry
Or teach your children in our schools
Because who he wants to love
Is breaking your Gods' rules
He stood up on a Tuesday morning
In the terror he was brave
And he made his choice
And without a doubt
A hundred lives he must have saved

And the things you might take for granted
Your inalienable rights
Some might chose to deny him
Even though he gave his life
Can you live with yourself in the land of the free
And make him less of a hero than the other three
Well it might begin to change ya
In a field in Pennsylvania

Stand up America
Hear the bell now as it tolls
Wake up America
It's Tuesday morning
Come on let's roll",Tuesday Morning
Melissa Etheridge,"I was a slick Midwestern gal
On the long hard road into Southern Cal
Didn't find any crime 
In filling up all my time
I had the devil in my bones
And an angel on my mind
And I drank up all the movies
And I searched for happy endings
I turned love inside out 
Till I was perfectly pretending
Still I believed it could be true

When you find the one
There's no questioning the silence
All is said and done
When you find the one
When you find the one

You could say that I was crazy
I was that kind of girl
I had to open up a lot of oysters
Before I found myself a pearl 
I had to kiss a lot of frogs
To find my grass was green enough
Had to be face down in the gutter
To see what is and isn't love
Then I woke from all the dreaming
To your taste and to your laughter
I cried till I was dry
And now I live my ever after
I believed I always knew

When you find the one
There's no questioning the silence
All is said and done

To paint tonight
The wind is too strong
To hold onto

And call out your name

Will you still love me anyway
Will you still need me when you're victorious 
Will you still want me when I've nothing to say
Will you still love me anyway

I am in the big top
On the live wire
Under the gun 
Over the fire
I'd swing up so high
Like a swan I would dive
But someone took my net and then they buried me alive
And the crowd screams for more encore encore

What becomes a lie
When does it begin

And I tied it to the car
There's a wreath up on our door
Eight tiny reindeer in the yard

So I'm sending out my only wish

Hey mister send my baby home
This December I don't want to be all alone
Oh Christmas in America
I need you in my arms
Far away from harm
Mister send my baby home

I hear someone singing jingle bells
No wait that deck the halls
And the teenagers with candy canes
Ramble through the malls
The girls are down at Ruby's
Trying to find some Christmas cheer
There's not much to do but drink too much
When everyday's unclear
So here I am on Christmas eve
This silent holy night
And I reach up to the stars for you
And I pray that you're alright

What happened to the peace on earth
All that goodwill toward men
Oh come on all ye faithful
It's time to think again",Christmas in America [#]
Melissa Etheridge,"It's been years since they told her about it
The darkness her body possessed
And the scars are still there in the mirror
Everyday that she gets herself dressed
Though the pain is miles and miles behind her
And the fear is now a docile beast
If you ask her why she is still running
She'll tell you it makes her complete

I run for hope
I run to feel
I run for the truth, for all that is real
I run for your mother, your sister, your wife
I run for you and me my friend
I run for life

It's a blur since they told me about it
How the darkness had taken its toll
And they cut into my skin
And they cut into my body
But they will never get a piece of my soul
And now I'm still learning the lesson
To awake when I hear the call
And if you ask me why I am still running
I'll tell you I run for us all

I run for hope
I run to feel
I run for the truth, for all that is real
I run for your mother, your sister, your wife
I run for you and me my friend
I run for life

And someday if they tell you about it
If the darkness knocks on your door
Remember her
Remember me
We will be running as we have before
Running for answers
Running for more

I run for hope
I run to feel
I run for the truth, for all that is real

I can't speak yet you understand
Where I go now, I go alone
This path I walk, these days of stone

And the angels are calling

I must go away
Wait for me here, silently stay
And don't ask me why
Only believe this is not goodbye

All of my strength, all my desire
Still cannot melt this breath of fire
I go to meet some kind of test
Bury the truth that scars my chest

And the angels are calling and calling

I must go away
Wait for me here, silently stay
And don't ask me why
Only believe this is not goodbye

I gathered all my courage
I shaved off all my fear
With this banner on my shoulder
I hold your essence near

Did I hold you in my arms,
As you were taking your last breath?
Did shout to all the gods,
That I would love you beyond death?

Did we hide in the dark ages,
From a vengeful god above?
Were our names too unfamiliar,
To ever speak of love?
Did I cling to every moment with you,


In every parting glance?
An accidental touch,
Did we ever take the chance for more?
I know I've loved you before.

Have I wandered through the desert?
Have I looked to the north star?
Have I rode the days and nights on rails,
To get back where you are?

Did my son have to die?
Tell me where are there weapons?
Why did you have to lie?""

In the land of the free

To defend it and uphold
I will not fight your war for profit

Melissa Etheridge,"Windshields kissed with snow on this endless interstate
Over the fields we go laughing all the way
We sing love, love, love it's glorious

Friends and family near, no more judgments, no more fear
All is calm, all is bright, everyone will hold this light
And sing love, love, love it's glorious

Sleep in heavenly, in heavenly
Sleep in heavenly, in heavenly
Believe in heavenly, in heavenly peace

I have heard the angels sweetly singing o'er the plain
And I've heard the mountains echoing their sweet refrain
They sing love, love, love, love, love it's glorious

I wonder what that would look like
I wonder if heaven and nature would sing
Hallelujah

What if we all stopped believing the line
That happiness comes from a stork?
What if we looked at the damage we've done
And finally shouted no more?

Fa, la, la, la, la, it's Christmas time
Fa, la, la, la, la, it's Christmas time

What if we did create peace on Earth?
How would we feel 'bout ourselves?
If we know we were perfect and good and enough
For all we desire is well

What if we all started spreading the news
There's nothing to fear anymore?
We are connected, one family of light

Fa, la, la, la, la, it's Christmas time, oh yeah

I finally decide I might
By healing our pain, intending our love
In the world we create what we find
What if we all took the time to be still?

The seasons are the contrast
Heed a life and how it's done
It's time to let go of all our past
And let go of what's to come

Write down your excuses
And turn them into dust
And plant the seeds of change
Water it with trust

And light a light tonight, we light a light
We light a light tonight, we light a light
Now about this time is ending and everyone is here
We light a light, a light this year
'Tis the season of change

What do we have, what do we have not?
What do we need that isn't here?
This mindless, numb, consuming
Is driven by a subtle fear

It's time we stopped believing
That there will not be enough
I know they said it on the TV
So turn it off, break the chains
Step outside and feel the love

And light a light tonight, we light a light
We light a light tonight, we light a light
Now about this time is ending, everyone is here
We light a light, a light this year
'Tis the season of change

Ooh change, we shall change
We must change

Heaven is inside, it's all around not just above
Choose only love
Heaven is inside, it's all around not just above
Choose only love

Choose only love
Choose only love

Melissa Etheridge,"There is a time in late December
The sun stands still in winter
For three days and three long nights
Throughout time we've watched the sky
And waited for the sun to come and save us
Save us from the longest night

For years I have been doing things
And singing songs that don't make any sense
But if I scratch the surface just a little bit
The holiday paint is pretty thin

Look to the sky with hope and wonder
There's a star in the east to guide us home
We are closer now than we've ever been
To peace on earth and good will to men
As we celebrate the longest night
O night divine
O night divine
",O Night Divine
Melissa Etheridge,"As God is God, as light is light
Whose law is wrong? Whose might is right?
Here we are on the edge
The edge of change

I believe in peace, my only wish
I believe that we can co-exist
Let's go further now
Than we've ever gone before

And ring the bells, ring the bells of change
Ring the bells every boy and every girl
Ring the bells, ring the bells of peace
All over the world

We've all been called to wake from sleep
To feel our power to create the dream
To step out from the dark
Past our fathers' fear

Ring the bells, ring the bells of change
Ring the bells every boy and every girl
Ring the bells, ring the bells of peace
All over the world

Here we stand in unity
Making one choice to be free
Every truth blends into one
As we believe it shall be done

Here we stand as soldiers now
Turning our swords into plows
There is not a nobler clime
Achieving peace in our own time

I know peace begins with me
With all I feel and with all I see
And I know it's no easy task
Removing our own fearful mask

But I have seen us rise and fall
Stand on the moon, tear down the wall
And I know we can do it all
And do it well, so ring the bells

Ring the bells, ring the bells of change
Ring the bells every boy and every girl
Ring the bells, ring the bells of peace
All over the world, all over the world

Ring the bells, ring the bells of change
Ring the bells every boy and every girl
Ring the bells, ring the bells of peace
All over the world, all over the world

Ring the bells, ring the bells of peace
Ring the bells, ring the bells
Ring the bells, ring the bells

Melissa Etheridge,"When I woke up I was seventeen
You kissed my lips in a bad bad dream
Showed me things aren't what they appear to be
Called me angel and set me free

You gave me life in the cold cold dark
But you ran away in the morning's spark
Made me think that reality
Oh is not where I want to be

but I am what I am and
I am what I am afraid of
Oh what am I afraid of
I need a fearless love
Don't need to fear the end
Oh if you can't hold me now
You will never hold me again
I want to live my life
Pursuing all my happiness
I want a fearless love
I won't settle for anything less

I've walked my path had worlds collide
I lost my way and I fooled my pride
This lover's ache wouldn't feel so strange
If I could only change

But I am what I am 
I am what I am afraid of
So what am I afraid of
I need a fearless love
Don't need to fear the end
oh if you can't hold me now
You will never hold me again
I want to live my life
Pursuing all my happiness
I want a fearless love
I won't settle for anything less

Now I'm not here to lay the blame
I understand when you hold a flame
Heads will shake, heads will turn
And sometimes you just get burned

I want a fearless love
I need a fearless love

I want a fearless love
Don't need to fear the end
Oh if you can't hold me now
You will never hold me again
I want to live my life
Pursuing all my happiness

Melissa Etheridge,"If you ask me I will say I'm fine
All pink like birthday girls and valentines
And then the stillness of the night reminds
That I don't like to be alone
My thoughts are race cars running 'round my head
They burst into flames and they crash into my bed
Until I fall into a dream instead
Where all my lovers turn to stone

And all I want is company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
Cause everybody needs some company

These times I'm living in just make no sense
Sometimes my face gets pushed against the fence
I want to scream out in my self-defense
But I don't want to be alone

And all I want is company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
Cause everybody needs some company

What is truth and what is fear
Will I find it under here
I know they're selling me a lie
But I'm first in line to buy
First in line to try

I find some sanity on the written page
Where life is worth more than a living wage
They say the battle's over now it's time to change
And I won't ever be alone

And all I want is company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
Cause everybody needs some company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me

The angels I believed in
Were gonna carry me away
Did you think that I would simply
Give them my last breath
Well honey you've got me wrong
I'd never leave you for death

It's gonna take more than that to get rid of me
It's gonna take more than that to make me fade

Melissa Etheridge,"When my soul crashed into my body
Falling into consciousness
That's when my mind began this illusion
Of taking it step after step
I looked into mother's eyes
I said tell me what I should believe
She drew me a room with a light and said 
Just turn it off when you leave

Slow, slow, this river is slow
We're all out here on our own
Row, row, gently we row
One day we'll find our way home

Step after step
They drew me a town 
They drew me a fear and a need
They drew me a god and 
They drew me some money
Hiding the truth far from me

I asked the cool fire light 
Tell me, what I should believe
And they gave me a song 
And they gave me a dance
And said sleep now your pain will relieve

Slow, slow, this river is slow
And we're all out here on our own
Row, row, gently we row
And one day we'll find our way home

I've stumbled and crawled
I've begged to know why 
And I've been ashamed 
When I've chosen to lie
In all of this darkness 
I have searched for a light 
To come and find me
And when I found me 

I wrapped my arms round 
My own daughter as she fell into her place and time 
And as her mind creates her illusions 
I won't complicate her's with mine

She looked into her mother's eyes 
She said tell me what I should believe
And I drew her a door 
And I drew her a key 
And I said when you're ready you'll come and find me
And we'll walk out of here and tomorrow will be a new day

Slow, slow, this river is slow
And you are never out here on your own
Row, row, gently we row 

Oh 
And together we'll find our way
Slow, slow, this river is slow
Life is not what it seems
Row, row, gently we row

The truth is
It's only a dream",Gently We Row

From silence I became my history

Then just breathe in and let it out

Melissa Etheridge,"She's got her sweet children
She's got her home she's got some land
Her earthly possessions
She's got a ring upon her hand
She tried to be a good girl
She tried to make everything right
She tried to kill the voices
That haunt her each and every night

She looks up to heaven
And wonders why love is so cruel
She loves him, won't hurt him
Can't stop the wanting of you

She married in high school
Oldest was well upon her way
But that wild night, Chicago
It left a mark she can't erase
A phase you'll just get over
That's what her friends have always said
You dip your toes in water
She's in way over her head

She looks up to heaven
And wonders why love is so cruel
She loves him won't hurt him
Can't stop the wanting of you

Keeping her desire paralyzed
She catches in the corner of her eyes
Tank top, smooth skin, soft lips, tanned thighs
How the hell's this ache ever gonna die
And we make our choices
Doing what we think is good
We deny our own dreams
Cause we think we've been told we should
We think we've been told we should

She looks up to heaven
And wonders why love is so cruel
She loves him, won't hurt him
Can't stop the wanting of you
She looks up to heaven
And wonders why love is so cruel
She loves him, won't hurt him
Can't stop the wanting of you

Melissa Etheridge,"We're dreaming from the bottom of the well
We're curled up in the corner of our cell
Freedom's just a story that we tell
I say give me liberty or give me hell
I know life is just a song

Yet we all are one spirit deep inside
Finding out our past has been denied
Now we can tell our story, start to question why
Climbing out from under fear
We'll know what we're doing here

There's something I'm not talking about
The whispers have found me
Inside the shadows of my doubts

I get the feeling that everything I'm doing now
I'm doing wrong
And everybody's known all along
So take me away
Way back to that 4th street feeling now
When everything I had I could fit into my Chevrolet

Well I've been, I've been aching
To slip an eight track on again
Eyes closed and head back
The sweet smell of summer sin
I get the feeling that everything I'm doing now
I'm just doing wrong
And everybody's known all along

So take me away
Way back to that 4th Street feeling now
When everything I had could fit into my Chevrolet

It was perfect and strange
Living life with that 4th Street feeling now
Who am I to think I could just run away
I could just run away
Baby, I could just run away

But everybody's known all along
So take me away

Melissa Etheridge,"Why can’t you be real
You hide the way you feel
You can’t manufacture me
Cause I like it naturally
Why can’t you be true
Why can’t you be you
Stop all your suffering
And do your natural thing

Do you think you’re fooling anybody
Your mind is in some kind of control
Your soul isn’t inside your body
Your body is inside the soul

Why can’t you be cool
You’re acting like a fool
You sold your soul for fame, fame, fame,
Me I like the natural game

Do you think you’re fooling anybody
You are in some kind of control
I’ve seen you on the ledge pushed over the edge
Like it was some kind of goal

Melissa Etheridge,"The lies upon your lips
The anger in your hair
Nuclear fingertips

Say good-bye to the enemy
Go find another master
Say good-bye to the best of me and
Call it a disaster
Call it a disaster
Call it a catastrophe

You and your genocidal fear
Me and my dumb luck
Parasitical fascination
With hysteric insinuation
Honestly it scorches my soul

There's nothing here for you to see
Move on move on
I'm just another casualty

Have you been drowning in your favourite pain
Don’t go back to sleep stay awake here with me

Who are you fooling

That someday is over and dreams are all gone
Come on believe me

Just a hundred miles to go on half a tank of gasoline
Lucky charms and Tic-Tacs and mom's amphetamines

A hundred miles to go to Kansas City
February makes me kinda crazy
A hundred miles to go to Kansas City
Will you still be callin' me your baby

I met a man in a diner outside of Hays
He said marriage brought him there
It was divorce that made him stay
I drove straight through to Junction City
I thought I'd call you in Topeka
But I didn't want the pity

With the back end of a hammer
Drawn over my strings

I am a sacred heart

Some say I survived

But as I breathe I will not be a pawn, a piece in anyone’s game

I am a fallen angel
I am a sacred heart

I am invincible and I am divine
Yeah, I could be a beauty with a little bit of shine
Maybe the patron saint of rage with black market eyes
Well, I’ve looked into the face of fear
I know what I’m doing here
Watch me fly

A coward or a monster
A puppet or a slave
I make my own choice
And I will never, I will not, I will never behave

When did I begin the soldier’s journey
When did I begin the fight
Fighting to believe what they had told me
Fighting to believe the lie
That I had to serve somebody
I never had to serve somebody

Father forgive me what my mother don’t know
The scratch marks on my soul
From the shadow of a black crow

Comes a time in your life honey you’ve gotta choose
My belly’s on fire from the acid of the truth
All the untold lies of my misspent youth

It’s pretty when you’re young just a pity when you’re old, yeah
Am I running away or am I closer to home
The lines and the signs and the miles go by
No one ever bothered to even ask me why
So I am disappearing into this road

You can’t cry but you can joke about it

You can hide your little pills
As your life slowly explodes
You can believe nobody knows about it

Who’s losing their minds
Keeping it together
Is everyone’s favourite pastime

Everybody’s had some really, really bad
Some this has got to be the end
I would really like to try for you
Sit around and cry for you
Muster up some sympathy
Well that’s too much to ask of me

You try so hard to be discreet
With all your secrets in the sheets
As you solemnly refuse
The very spark that lights your fuse
Do you think that you’re the only one
Who can be unkind
Tearing at each others flesh
Is everyone’s favourite pastime

What is it in your mind that lights the fuse this time
What do you want so bad that you have never had

Could it be dangerous to light the flame and just
Feel the warmth again make it rise again

Like a preacher gonna lift you higher
I won’t let you burn

Oh I won’t let you burn

The feelings you repress the thoughts you don’t confess
They grow inside the dark make ashes of your heart
You recklessly adore the idols keeping score
But no-one ever wins they just start the game again
You chose the cross you bare and pick the chains you wear
Your heavens in your mind your hells a valentine
Come closer now express this longing so divine
On your knees be blessed let it possess you one more time

I am a sermoniser, an on the street evangeliser

I do not know how I ended up this way

So what is it exactly that you want from me
Oh yeah you want me to stay
Even though I am terrified
To let myself
End up this way

Of feeling nothing at all

Into a love

Take this chair out back and burn it

It only goes to show

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Melissa Manchester,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

We'd go to bed real early

And wake up holding hands

We'd light a fire in the morning and
Keep it burning strong
Outside it could be storming, but we
Never felt so warm
We'd curl up on the couch and trade the
World for our love song

Got no one else to go to
'Cause I keep thinking of you even
When I'm not alone
Now I'd love to hear you say I'm still
The one you can't say ""no"" to
And that's you'll take me back tonight

Melissa Manchester,"Grace and John are in their morning places
He looks at the paper: she looks straight ahead
Neither one is hungry, but they need to be fed.
Yesterday the kids came by to see them,
Celebrating 30 years of holding on,
Lift a loving cup, a cup of number one.

Chorus

?Look across the table John, look across the table to me?;
There?s still a young girl in the old girls face.
?Look across the table honey.?
So the day begins, through the eyes of Grace.

Late at night, when she can hear him sleeping,
Reaching in the darkness for a dream or two;
What she doesn?t know is that he?s dreaming too,
Something in the mirror will remind her;
Something ?bout the moonlight shining on the bed;
Women don?t get older, just a deeper shade of red.

Chorus

?Tell me what to do Johnny, tell me what to do with all this freedom!?
?Tell me what to do Honey, tell me what to do ?bout all my dreamin?!?
Just to catch his eye when she?s not looking, just to be surprised by such an old idea.
Just to see your life seen thought the eyes of Grace.

?Look across the table John, look across the table to me?;
There?s still a young girl in the old girls face.
More than just a memory.
So the day begins, through the eyes of Grace.

Melissa Manchester,"(Cello intro)

(Basonova intro)

Afternoons on the Rue de Flores
In the flat that I shared with Gertrude
We served tea and got drunk on conversations
With the lost generation she found.

Hemingway, Picasso and Matisse
Janet Flanders and Sylvia Beach.
We were searching for unknown destinations
We were desperate to reach.

We [said au revoir?], [lyrics in brackets are disputable ..]
We carved our dreams,
To invent the world, it seems,
As life unraveled at the seams,

But oh ....

When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
She loved so well.
All the smoke and opinions would fly!
Life was art, art was life, or else die ..
So we cared for each word and every color 
Like a bug on the web [to explain]


As the days blended into the nights,
How we savoured our city of lights -
And we knew it wouldn't last forever,
But my god what a ride!

When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
She loved so well.
She loved so well.

My Gertrude -
She was my shepherdess,
My Pyrenees.
With eagle eyes, a mountain range was she.
She sore loved me.
We sore loved. 

When Paris was a woman ...

(Guitar solo)

The escapades,
The rigolos.
The geniuses,
The gigolos.
The legacy we left ...
Who knows?

But oh ...

When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
She loved so well.
She loved so well.
We loved.

When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
She loved so well.

Because you don't remember where we were. 
You ask what movies that I've seen 
You want to know what's good 
But she's the one that gets to go 
When I should. 

I don't think so. 

Hey I've got something to say. 
I saw her wearing the black jacket I gave you on Christmas day. 
You said that you lost it. 
Hey, don't go running away. 
This is for every girl in love whose been bawling for a boy like you. 


I'm just the fool that you can kick around 
The loser who picks up when you are down. 
The girl in glasses who sits next to you 
Who always tells that you're great 
And fixes all your big mistakes. 
And when she goes and breaks your heart 
I get your call. You fall apart. 

I don't think so. 

Hey I've got something to say. 

Some day you'll realize I was the one 
By then it's gonna be too late 
You'll be sorry. 
Hey, don't give me that face 
This is for every girl alive whose heart's been broken by a boy like you. 
This is for every girl alive whose heart's been broken by a boy like you.

Un sourire aux lèvres
Petite fille ordinaire
Des peurs secrètes

Mes yeux qui brillaient
Quand tu étais là
Sentir cette chaleur
Au creux de tes bras

Tu vois j’avais tout
T’étais mon modèle
Et ma force pour tenir debout

Et moi j’étais prête
A affronter la vie
Et les soucis
Crois-moi

Et puis t’es parti
Et depuis j’ai appris à vivre sans toi
Et t’es parti
J’ai séché mes larmes et j’ai grandi sans toi
Et t’es parti
Sans te retourner, sans dire pourquoi 
Et t’es parti, t’es parti, t’es parti sans moi

Première cigarette
Première connerie
Depuis que tu as
Refait ta vie

J’n’étais qu’une fillette
Parmi tant d’autres
Moi aux oubliettes
Mais est-ce ma faute ?

J’ai fait du chemin
J’ai vu l’horizon
Et j’ai touché du doigt le pardon
J’étais sur le point
De faire de ma vie
Un joli refrain
Et puis…

Et puis t’es parti
Et depuis j’ai appris à vivre sans toi
Et puis t’es parti
J’ai séché mes larmes et j’ai grandi sans toi
Et puis t’es parti
Sans te retourner, sans dire pourquoi

I want to run with a reckless emotion

Even if I crash down and burn out
At least I'm gonna know what it's like
To feel alive

Hey yeah, hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sun on my face, lights of the city
Maybe in love, or just learning to be
On my two feet, I can only imagine
I'll say the words and believe it'll happen

Melissa O'Neil,"Selective memory conveniently drops by
When you're up in the club and some girls caught your eye
What you don't think I hear rumors?
My friends don't have eyes?

I know your minds like a computer 
But you turn it off sometimes
I wonder what you're doing to me 
What you're doing boy
I remember

Chorus: don't play dumb
Cause I know what you're thinking
Forget about it
Back it up
Cause you know that I 
Won't forgive you won't forget the
Damage done 
And I won't take you back
Forget about it

You remember science books 
The French you took last year
Every single sports statistic but you still don't get it dear
I wonder are you really with me?
Are you really boy?
Just remember

But it feels like you keep pushing me there

I'm not a doll, not packaged at all
What are you looking for?

What you get is what you see
All you're gonna get from me

I'm up close and personal
I do the weirdest things
I'm not too shy to sing
So, la la la la la la
Got my own things that give me style
No warranty, can you handle that?
Cause you know you can't take me back

And I'm gunna be myself

Do the brick walls keep you safe from hammer, is that why you won't get to know me?

And when you've got no where to turn
And you're all alone
When your walls a breaking yet there's no escaping 
And I, I'd fly through the night

Right here guarding you
Watching over you

Though I'm miles away
From the world I left behind
I will find a way back to you

And drove an English teacher half insane

Has learned all of my favourite tunes.

You've been screaming your feelings all night
Then you don't say one thing, one thing
You ain't all that
But I give you my heart, I'm down on my knees
And you just say nothing, nothing

It's a four letter word, and it's what I deserve

I found my treasure in a diamond in the thick dirt
It ain't ironic she's got thick curves
Always sayin' that she'll die for me, we've got to live first
She wants me to put a ring on it
That's why anytime she calls, let it ring a bit
But she'll be crying me a river, I can swim in it
I got a breast stroke, baby, if I want to live a bit
And it used to be a riddle when we used to be poor
Now we see sea shells on the sea shore
Said you saw me less when I was on the streets more
Now we on our road to riches, had to take a detour
From the tower block to the Eiffel tower with a view
Keep your standards like your heels, I'll be towering with you

I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, 
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl, 
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's

",Lovesick Blues
Melissa Swift-Sawyer,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo

Melissa Totten,"Tell him what you know thought you had me
But I let it go
And now I'm gonna take down the whole thing
Everything is going down with me
Thought you told him everything
Left out a little bit about yourself
And I found out from your best friend
I think its time that I filled him in
And now I'm gonna take down the whole thing
Everything is going down
With me


You know to much keep it to yourself
So much at stake but you don't give a damn
And now it's coming back on you
You keep on pushing baby can't you see
Always try but your never gonna get to me
I'll make sure this time

For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting

Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy what will it be

Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I wanna dance with someone else

Melissa Totten,"Como puede ser verdad
 
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

Melissa Totten,"Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set me free, oh lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging 'round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see, oh lonesome me

I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and people don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z, oh lonesome me

I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and people don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues

Yeah, lonesome me, aha

Melissa Totten,"You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

He calls his child Jesus 'cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town.

He makes a lot they say
Spend his days counting
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper
To a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times
Said God is dead and war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon.

Levon's sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day 
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing,
While Levon, Levon slowly dies.

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man

Le jour de gloire est terminé
Entre nous deux, la tyrannie
Sous l'étendard, sang est levé

Entendez vous dans nos campagne,
Mugir nos pauvres, de faim de froid?
Qu'ils viennent jusque dans vos bras,
Pleurer dans nos ville, nos sarcasmes

Aux armes aux armes 
Et cætera 

Que veut cette horde de militaires
De traîtres et de rois conjurés?
Pour qu'ils nous prennent, quand ils nous traitent
De cons, de braves, de pauvres français!

Quoi? Ces cohortes étrangères
Feraient la lois dans nos foyer?
Quoi? Nos flics, soldats, mercenaires,
Alors qu'on est tous étrangers !

Aux armes aux armes 
Et cætera

L'impôt se rie des malheureux
Nul devoir ne s'impose aux riches
Le droit du pauvre est un mots creux

Des preuves qui se ramassent à l'appel
L'égalité n'existe pas 
Pas de droits sans devoirs dit elles
Égaux à la naissance parfois...

Liberté lie bêtes et chérie
Ceux qu'on la tune, n'ont que l'odeur
Amour sacré de la patrie
Et la fraternité se meurt.					

Aux armes aux armes

Je ne m'en fais pas pour moi, mais les brebis m'inquiètent
Ici bas, elles se gavent de ferraille, de plastique,
D'arbres, de betteraves et d'amours synthétiques

Devant ce grand festin, la liberté regrette
Les brebis ont vomis, l'indigestion les guette
Qu'y a-t-il donc après? Plus rien
Les brebis sont tentées par les sentiers divins

Crapahuter là-haut pendant les transhumances
Dans l'auberge, il fait chaud, elles remplissaient leur panse
De sermons asservis sans une prière et au lit sans

Sans s'inquiéter du temps, sans redouter l'errance
Le pasteur rabâchant ses conseils de prudence
Mettez-vous ça dans la tête, les brebis ne sont pas faites

Pour apprécier le large, pour apprendre à voler
Gambader dans les marges, aimer la liberté
Tôt ou tard, tout penaud, on rejoint le troupeau

A chacun son chemin, la liberté se jette
Au delta, au-delà, où l'océan reflète
On dit que tout est grand à y perdre la tête
On y goûte un instant et dedans tout s'émiette

J'ai choisi mon chemin, ma liberté, ma quête
Je ne m'en fais pas pour moi, mais les brebis m'inquiètent
Ici bas, elles se gavent du premier fanatique,
Le vent, le sourcil grave, ou le doigt prophétique

Je ne m'en fais pas pour moi, mais les brebis m'inquiètent
On les a déjà vues foncer à l'aveuglette,
Quand elles ont peur de tout, droit dans la gueule du loup

Lalalalalalalala
Quand elles ont peur de tout, droit dans la gueule du loup
Quand elles ont peur de tout, droit dans la gueule du loup
Quand elles ont peur de tout, droit dans la gueule du loup",Les Brebis
Melissmell,"Quand la colère vous mord, que commence
La transhumance au bord, au bord
Elle s’amuse, elle dévore, bientôt tu ne seras
Plus qu’un tas de remords, si elle s’accroche à toi

Je sais de quoi je parle, je sais de quoi je parle

De figures de romans en chevauchées sans fin
On se bat pour ne pas qu’elle engloutisse en vain
Les grands sages ont bien dit, la faute est capitale
On ne la prend pour guide la colère comme étoile

Je sais de quoi je parle, je sais de quoi je parle
Quand elle prend le contrôle, inverse les rôles et fait trembler ma voix
Elle rend, la colère, la douceur amère, elle ronge sa proie
Oh combien de temps faudra-t-il avant qu’elle ouvre la voie ?

Qu’elle ouvre la voie…oh mon amour, pardonne moi

Dans les moindres recoins, dans les contrées immenses
Elle retrouve un fuyard à sa traînée d’essence
Rien ne sert de courir, adieu mon innocence
Il me faudra choisir, elle ou bien le silence
Je sais de quoi je parle, je sais de quoi je parle

La musique ne dit pas, elle le frappe et c'est tout
J'en suis sûre, c'est comme ça, la musique ne pense pas 
La musique est une onde, un pulseur dans le coup

Quand les filles dans la transe, je les sens sans tabous
Les tympans sans défense soumis au garde à vous

Devant moi le dancefloor comme une fleur s'est offert
J'en ai fait ma maison, j'en ai fait mon repère
J'avais juste quinze ans et du son dans la tête
Je pouvais être un roi sous ma boule à facettes

Mais elle restait dehors mon âme torturée

J'en suis sûre c'est comme ça, peu importe où tu vas
Elle au moins elle, elle te suivra partout

Un jour j'ai du partir à l'autre bout du monde
Il faut savoir s'enfuir quand le tonnerre vous gronde

Dans les eaux de la Rouge, où le Yémen en face
Là, j'ai connu des frères, là, j'ai perdu ma trace
J'oubliais mon amant, j'oubliais la musique
Mais sa douce voix la nuit venait jusqu'en Afrique

Là-bas sans conditions elle seule m'avait suivi
A réfléchir, la seule qui n'a jamais trahi

Après, j'ai pris la mer et je suis revenue
Droit dans la fourmilière de Paris la vendue
Là-bas, les hommes se mentent en courant très très vite
Elle tient quand même debout, tout est question de rythme

Mon ami, la musique, j'en ai vu les viscères
J'en ai serré des mains, j'en ai levé des verres

Mon ami, la musique, j'en ai vu les viscères
J'en ai serré des mains, j'en ai levé des verres

Aujourd'hui j'en suis là, sans savoir où je vais
On m'a menti cent fois et tout est compliqué
Et lui qui vient me dire il faut monter au front
La musique est une arme, les mots ses munitions

La musique était vierge ne va pas la salir
Laisse la la musique, laisse la qu'elle respire

La vie est un peu brève, et nos têtes brouillées
Quelques années à jouir, quelques autres à pleurer
Des années à chercher un peu de vérité

Il faudrait qu'on en vive avant que d'en crever
Un baiser de tes lèvres là sur mes yeux mouillés
Un regard plein de fièvre, un peu de ta fierté
Suffirait à donner dix ans de liberté

Ce matin le printemps est voilé par l'orage
Même dans la part du sombre la cupide est volage
Le jour prête à se fondre, elle reste en embuscade
Et fait passé son ombre pour la vertu du sage

Il faudrait qu'on la sème avant qu'elle est bouffée
L'enfance par la sève, la face dévoilée
Il faudrait qu'on la sème avant que de tomber
Sous les coups qu'est la scène, les assauts répétés

Dont le glas ne sonnera pas

Après l'avoir un peu salée
La vendront pour de l'eau bénite

Puis, puis ils viendront chialer

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Mellow Man Ace,"You better run and hide when you hear my growl
'Cause I'm a hip hop creature, and I'm on the prowl
While I'm talkin' I'm stalkin', and rappers are my prey
I creep at night and I sleep all day

I despise the sunrise, swoon the moonrise
Then like a beast I increase in size 
But your cries ain't nothin' to me, cause I don't pity you
And my mission is to cold get rid of you

Bitin MC's, I'm fightin' MC's
Bring em to their knees, plus: ""Drive on, please
Spare my life!"" but you're a sacrifice
I write the rhymes from the blood drippin' off my mic 
It ain't Jason, it ain't Poltergeist

Even though the rhymes are fly, it ain't Vincent Price
It's just the first part of the double feature
So you better run, boy, cause I'm the Hip Hop Creature

I make Jeckyll & Hyde seem like Hansel & Gretel
Tom & Jerry, or Albert and Costello
But yo, this ain't slapstick, it's like a horror flick
And I'm a gool, and I'm here to school

Mediocre rappers with a style that's scary
And eerie, which makes you leary
You not even want to look in my direction
And grab a cross, and think that's your protection

But yo, this ain't Dracula, that's too regular
I'm much more frightening, especially when lightning
Strikes, and it's 12 midnight
You're in for the scare of your life

'Cause it's a fright night-mare
There's no way you can run, cause I'll reach ya
And furthermore I fight you and I beat ya
And here's the second part of the feature
You better run, homebody, cause I'm the Hip Hop Creature

I'm the Hip Hop Creature, here to do my job
Scare the suckers, cause my monologue is McCobb
That's why MC's see me and try to get chummy
I rap so close around em and they end up like a mummy

Dummy, you gets nothin' from me
Except the creeps, so I suggest you keep 
A safe distance between you and I
Stay back, like Brooklyn: do or die

'Cause I'm 'bout to knock you out like Tyson on a roll
Hit you with a beat, I rhyme outta control
A non-stop attack landin' on your brain
You're lookin' kinda wobbly, do you know your name?

Now the match is over, I put you in your place
Forget Al Pacino, I'm the Rap Scarface

As a funky maneuver of reciting lyrics
Stayin' calm, but then droppin' my bombs

With my voltrons, protons and my atoms
Boom! An explosion, I'm speakin' very complicated
Where others have failed I have conquered and excelerated
Like Courtland in his court I command the fort

The teacher that's teachin', and I need no support
Now few people can talk, but more people can gawk
But I prefer that you be down with my block
Because my funky dope spanglish for sure gettin' dumb

Now everytime I see ya, you try to bite the formula
But I'm just ignorin' ya, and tellin' ya, it ain't for ya

There's no one that I fear, y'all, I make this very clear, y'all

I smack you with a lyric until you start to cheer, y'all
So listen to the funky chumpie that I brought to share, y'all
Not a ??? of character, but I'm still there after
Everyone's gone from the scene, cause I don't care if the...

I'm not a greedy brother, you want some?

Now get funky, that's why I gave it to ya
That's right, I definitely had to save it for ya
Yes, I want you to enjoy my methods of speak
No worries, be happy, mi tribe is elite

Yes, I'm equipped with the hype tip
Of speakin', yes, talkin' somethin' you can deal with
But it's somethin' 'bout the hip-hop, we just can't live without it
Give us a place to be, and then we'll absolutely house it

And you will find an exclamation after the word drama!
Then you will learn I'm on ya, and I will be upon ya

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

Not basketball but I'm saying my game could fool April

Meet chains with more rocks then rocks and sand in Iran
I saute the chef and if its I you want to test
It will be one big room full of triple 6 reppers
Always say that I'm lo key with my moves
'Cause I'm a ninja I don't like niggas to see what I do
And my focus was on saving grace
Till I got that late call that wolf killed ace
Heard he sprayed up the place
Well I'm the midnight marauder that makes twilight music
And fans think that I'm more awkward then Kristen Stewart
Couldn't do it without the losers that thought I wouldn't do it
No sympathy for the ones that never stuck to it
Attack em, rack em, wrap em in the back of a Buick

Extra magazines I'm in, to remind me of the places I've been
Returning to visit again, me and my fuckin' friends

Before I eat sushi, I'd rather get to know the fish first

I was born a star,like Ozzy's kids
They in my biz,I probably did
I am an economist
I walk the Earth and coexist,someone you didn't know exist
I'm back like I'm here returning
You're in your seat, you're squirming
In my sermon, turbulence from all the turning
I'm just learning as I advance to my next level
Life's is a stripper,I let it dance on my gas petal
Thrash metal,so special with the hash methyl
High mellow, to do a puntos into Gods ghetto
Dirt devil,cleaning lives,demeaning wives
Leaving child's drawerless for drugs
And drawer is, the love is flawless
What's a life beyond stress,who wants it?
Its kinda like mom's gifts
Everyday another struggle
Get your money, fuck the hustle
When you think I'll give up,you got one life to live up

[Chorus: x2]

Where is the love at?(at,at)
I said,Where is the love at?(at,at)
Where the love at?
Should I hate you til it gives kisses and hugs back?
I'm from traps,where niggas don't get out the game
Overrun laps,wear one rotissy? with hats
Ankle caught in cracks
Smile gats,and never facts
Clever acts,now spit a better rap

They say, nigga, try a little harder
But it did work
I tried, and did work
So makes it work
They told me to try a little harder
But it did work
So I makes it work
Now, my shit works
Now, my shit works",Snare

I need my cornbread
Not the substance of food
My cornbread
What matters the most to you?
My cornbread
My cornbread (x2)

I have a little boy
He's my happiness
My little joy
Keep his father fighting on
My little Roy
Finally, I have something to live for
Shits that's I can give for
Pain is love, and yo I'm feeling it
And I'm real sore
He's an exact replica of me
Distilled, pure
Okay, so waking up to a new born baby at a teen age
Getting over the fact that he was here to stay was a lean stage
Blood is thicker than liquor
Came together as a family, made decisions
This life here we're going to give him
A chance to be all he can imagine
Weather mowing a fucking lawn instead of dating a model and fashion
I'm teaching him to be on time in a timely fashion
Now a days I realize
I need to mind into my actions
Cause, What's a father? Who's a father? Where's a father?
Fuck a father if a father is behind bars and ?

I like going to the park
Playing ball in the ?
It gets me ready for that mental foreplay
It matters how you can give
It completes your day
Just get through those lunch hours, fried chicken sorbet
McDonald's parfait, drive thru, one way
Like displays on the menu
Up the price of the venue
You and your nephew, you niece is also in the car
Pretty barrettes in their hair-do
Don't drive too fast, be careful
Make sure the seat belts are on before you switch from park to drive
Because once the car starts, the reflex is the eye
Between you and I, and the being in the sky
I have a human oversight, no equated calculations
Practice sanitation
The bullshit and aggravations
And money ain't the motivation

Well I ate, well

Jetting from the police cause police they'se a bunch of creeps
I'm testing off the new burners in the park
We sleep during the day and creep when it's dark
I once had to cry when I seen Tyrone die
This black on black crime I cram to understand why
Baby girls having kids in their teens
Young fellows baggy jeans slinging crack to the crack fiends
That's the type of lifestyle that I lead
With my fams on the corner drinking beers and smoking weed

I'm ripping out my hairs and I can't get to my brain
I want the gold teeth and chains
I hustle with timberland boots and rainsuits when it rains.

Melodie Crittenden,"Virgil Spencer's got a nineteen inch Hitachi and many demons lingering.
Friday night he pulled a gun to change the channel,
something that he picked up from the king.
His wife remembers well the man she knew.
Seems the dreams she had have all turned black and blue,
She's wasted years. 
No time for tears
 
'cause there's another chance, and someday soon
shining like the Alabama moon.
She's looking for the promised land out beyond the lights of Birmingham.
 
It's three a.m. and Virgil's passed out on the sofa,
a fifth of Jim Beam on the floor.
She's packed a bag.  
She slips the keys out of his pocket.
She's careful not to slam the door. 
And as she drives, she rubs her rosary.
She's never been so all alone. She's never felt so free.
She got miles to go, blind faith and hope
 
'cause there's an other chance, and someday soon 
shining like the Alabama moon.
She's looking for the promised land out beyond the lights of Birmingham.
 
As the rain falls down upon the interstate,
any doubts she had are all but washed away.
One long look back at Birmingham
 
'cause there's another chance, and someday soon,
shining like the Alabama moon,
She's looking for the promised land out beyond the lights of Birmingham.

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Melody Breyer-Grell,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Teardrops down my face

Bound within a sigh

And flames combust
We flames would be hand in glove
And why should two loves not agree, no

Though both of your arms would offer a tender caress
It's such an exhaustible love
Fuelling my heart with only illusion at best

See your face up in the clouds
Hear your voice calling loud
My name on the wind, it's never gonna end
'Cause more than every now and then
I feel you everywhere

I should let you go
All my friends they call and tell me so
That I should try my very best
To lay your memory to rest
But what do they know'

She broke his heart, he spent his whole life trying to forget
We watched him drink away his pain a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And he finally blew away her memory
Life is short, this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees

We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, I love her till I die
And when they buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

For years and years, she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath

Clinging to his picture for dear life

I rode a dream so wild and free for all that dream was worth
True love is both a blessing and a curse
I guess my heart just settled back to earth

I remember what you said that night so long ago
My dream for you had ended and you let me know
So I bounced from sky to sky, tryin' to keep the dream alive
But everything I did just made it worse
I guess my heart just settled back to earth

The songs our love created, I still sing
And every night we'd make the rafters ring
And tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth
For all the hearts that settle back to earth

Might be people to stun with a single routine
And you don't, you don't dream at all

Am I thoughtful to miss you today?

Everyday falls behind me I know
Well, I hope that you

No wonder I am lonely

This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me"
Melvin Riley,"I know that this is new
The things we're gonna do baby
Always a quiet one
You never had your fun
Well I see something in you
You no longer can hide
You never let it go
Your love life moves to slow

[Chorus]
Tell me can you
Scream.....shout
Show you what my lovings all about
Tell me baby can you
Scream....shout
Why not get what you been feelin' bout
Does it feel good when you
Scream....shout
Don't it feel good when I do those things
To make you bring it out

What you were all about
He never brought it out (tell me whats wrong with him)
You held it in too long
You did your body wrong (that's no way to treat a lady)
How much more can you take
Before you masturbate (ain't nothing wrong with that)
And now you come with me
To set your body free

Tell me can you
Scream, shout
Show you what my lovings all about
Tell me baby can you

Melvin Seals,"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,
Tangled up in blue.",Tangled Up in Blue

ii She Gives Me Love
(Anderson Howe Wakeman Bruford Dowling)
She gives me love
When love had gone away
When the pressure came so fast
She give me love
Long distance runaround
And in between the pressure
I was summoned

How did we dance on the south side of the sky
We saw the flags flying on the moon
And through the gates of delirium so fast
Believing in the light was a beginning
Only to believe in you
Only to believe in you

When I was losing fast
I was awakened by the dream
She was the love for me
the first and last
And all that I remembered
Was the roundabout only to believe in you

The moon at night

Melvins,"I remember how I used to walk up and down the streets
Of the city of New Orleans, bound by drugs, bound by alcohol
Committing the different acts of sin, living beneath my privilege
Doing things that were contrary to God as well as the law
But after all the things that I did
And after all the sins that I committed
One day I heard about Jesus
I'm just like the woman that heard about Jesus
Coming through the city of Jericho, and she had a problem
But I had a problem with lying too and lying was sin
I was living in sin, living and doing things I wanted to do
Living and seeing what I wanted to see
But one day Jesus touched my life
And when Jesus came in, the liquor went out, the drugs went out
My old lady, the lord bleeds
I thank God my sins and judge every
And I have a right to the tree
Doesn't mean jack to me and everyone that knows Jesus and everyone that's been born again 
And everyone that's been washed in the blood
You heard the brother singing about the blood
It's stuff about the blood 
It's stuff about the blood of Jesus and wash away your sins
And wash your mind and wash your heart and wash your life, oh praise God
I thank God for that opportunity and I just want to let you know
That he loves us and the Bible backs it up
""That God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
That whoever should believe in him shall not perish but have an everlasting life.""

Oh, it's wonderful

Do you know anything about him?

Yeah, do I know anything about him?

Yeah

I was raised in his home town

Are you gonna be saying something to him or be talking to him?

Well, that's just gonna depend

Are you looking forward to seeing him?

Sure

Why don't you show us where he's coming in?

He's coming through this door here
There's two doors in this entrance
He's coming through this door here
And this is and it
Opens back like this and we have this one
The other door goes back like this

Shade's know any reason
Blame's are all I see
Her allergy's been forsaken maybe
Stir it all on at me

So it seems and so it's came away
Might be the voicings frighten
And so it's gotten me
The weaker of the fortune's mystery
Has finally pissed indeed
Indeed, made it for the eve

Shade's know any reason
Flames are all I see
Hala-tease been forsaken maybe
Stirin all on a lee
Now they're gonna burn me
Make all my flesh away'd
Real green turnin half ball shakin
Leave me, horror day.",At the Stake
Melvins,"Oh Die! They gone and left me for her 
On the way 
Each every time a think the wheel around (around around) 
And it's gone (around around)
I got a reason for heading home 
It's not serene 
It don't make sense to me 
I got the four eyes blooming under half of my bed 
Seems to jingle as the razor comes with color and claw 
I see it shine I see it stare 
Holding hearts in my hand 
Take the master morgue and make her have it sitting on side 
Let the glory boy of Mr. Henry have it alright. 
While it's in front of me 
Keeps me insane.
Disguised to take away the feeling the house survives 
But all on demand 
Disguise thrown over me 
Teenage hand 
Oh! Die 
You should have known you could have rested on me 
Each every time I kept the reel alive 
You took me for the drive 
To feel the fear and it's hard...",Goose Freight Train
Melvins,"How - How does it - How does it feel?
How - How does it - How does it feel?
How - How does it - How does it feel?
Do you - Do you feel inclined?
Tense
Just tense
I got friends
Do you know
Not so easy as mine, is it?
Been eyes
Go blind
How's your protocol?
In order to, uh,
Just beg, show the times
In the wrong state of mind
Whaddaya mean? My lungs are fine",Lividity
Melvins,"Lo-s o needs no medic 
Feels only queen 
We'll try for for the one for Anglais 
Just makes his deal 
'Cause I say, ""No! You're mine"" 
And I'll go on for I feel 
I got the cross confusing man, yeah! 
I got no more me, Uh! 
'Cause I say you're either ready 
He's got a voice 
A wretched voice indeed 
Prosthetic you, waiting to disrobe. 

True right, try to shock me 
Feeling like a seething head 
God looks right through me 
This is what you do to me 
I see you're a choking hot wheel 
Seeing opportunity 
Guys done wheel to shark me 
He's not me! 
We're stuck in cartwheels 
Feeling like a perfect nuclear
He's a real meat head 
Why?",Magic Pig Detective
Melvins,"As a measure of a soul 
Like a dumb run: bring your fear 
You and me, we got the same air going 
Breathing here 
You got sent the cold water you're in 
Like someone left to could half breathing 
Maybe me and the Queen could take another order 
Lock it away 

Oh little wish it away 
I got time to wish away 
Little wish it away 

Head look about for freedom 
Like a do-mo bring on feel 
I might take the T-mind looker 
Love and see 
High tongue hit the cold wide looker 
Aw Damien has the free minds mover 
Maybe me and the Queen could give a side order
Love it away, yeah! 

Oh little wish it away 
I got time to wish away
Little wish it away 
She don't hang",Queen
