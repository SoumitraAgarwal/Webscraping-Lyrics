Elliott,Is it worth the wait? As time and motions are gold and you're the fair land. Cause I believe what you are. I believe in you. Too long to wait. You close your eyes over us. And the sun rised everywhere. Cause I believe what you are. I believe in you.,Believe
Elliott Brood,"Gave you a minute
When you needed an hour
Just to push it aside
Instead of leaving it behind you

If any word that I said
Could have made you forget
I'd have given you them all
But it was all in your head

And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
And then we'd build it up again

And we're burning all the bridges now
Cause it was sink or swim and I went down, down, down

And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now

If I didn't hid it
Would you still say you needed me?
Guess I walked right into it
Guess I made it too easy

If any word that you said could have made me forget
Would I get up off the floor
Cause this is all in my head

And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
And then we'd build it up again

And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now

Can we forget about it?
Can we forget
Can we forget about it?
Can we forget

Burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges",The Bridge
Elliott Carter,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",Sandpiper
Elliott Murphy,"I remember when you were on the farm
Dreaming about Andy Warhol
Wo ho ho Getting felt up in the barn
Wondering if that's moral
But hey look at you now
You've got everything that a girl could want
You've got high heel slippers baby but that's all right

Hollywood
Hollywood

You shaped my life with Technicolor carving knife and
Now I don't know what to feel
All my emotions are wrapped up reel to reel

You know you turned me around stuck my face in the ground
When I sat down on Garbo's sofa
And I like some James Dean clown that you can make laugh
or frown - I just want to know when it's over

But hey look at me now you know just can't find nothing real
And the movies are all outside baby but that's all right

Hollywood
Hollywood
You gave me the best I got this
Soundtrack of violence and sex
and
Now I don't know who to be
Cause every time I look in the
mirror I see some movie star
You know it just doesn't look
like me

And us rebel's got too many causes
But that's all right
And I can't find a happy ending
But that's all right
And like Jimi said 'There just ain't no life nowhere""
But that's all right
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood",Hollywood
Elliott Murphy,"The mother of the outlaw thinks about the time he had the mumps
And she's really very sorry
And she hopes this has nothing to do
With the way she brought him up
And the outlaw he lies wounded as the doctor gives the police sergeant a
nod
And the last words he was saying
Something about I do believe in God

And who divides the oceans
When a generation's lost its place
And who sets the motion
Of the human race

And the sister of the prostitute
She's trying to find the right way to love
Cause when it gets down to make a living
These days it's pretty hard for a girl to get it up
And the romance on her street corner
He rides around in Eldorado fame
And lately she's been thinking
That what she's been seeing in the movies just ain't the same

And who divides the oceans
When a generation's lost its place
And who sets the motion
Of the human race

And the legless Vietnam survivor
He's trying to find a job or a wife
Cause he can't find peace with honor
As he gets conditioned to his wheelchair life
And the killers still run the country
And they count their money
With their bloodstained hands
And lately I've been thinking
Maybe it s time we really took a stand

And who divides the oceans
When a generation's lost its place
And who sets the motion
Of the human race",Lost Generation
Elliott Murphy,"The sun is setting in an orange glow
But it's raining in my car
Can't even think of where I want to go 
Cause I've already gone too far 
 
All I need is a little push to fall 
In love with you tonight
All I need is a little push
And I'm heading over the top

It's not a question of what I want to do 
It's a question of what's right 
Cause when I find myself alone with you 
On this quiet Sunday night 

The sun is setting in an orange glow
But it's raining in my car
Cause I just want to go too far
Can't even think of where I want to go 
Cause I just want to go too far",A Little Push
Elliott Smith,"She took the Oldsmobile out past condor avenue
And she locked the car and slipped past
Into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning
Voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other
I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
It'll make a whisper out of you 
She took the Oldsmobile out past condor avenue
The fairground's lit
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered 
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing that he could never do
And it'll make a whisper out of you
She took the Oldsmobile out past condor avenue
Cops were running around the scene
Looking for some kind of clue
They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
Unless a light bulb really loved him very much
I'm lying down
Blowing smoke from my cigarette 
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
You're in your Oldsmobile driving by the moon
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out, out on condor avenue
Trying to make a whisper out of you
What a shitty thing to say
Did you really mean it?
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
So now I'm leaving you alone
You can do whatever the hell you want to
Na, na, na, na, na, na.",Condor Ave.
Elliott Smith,"Two dollar color pictures from a photo booth
Dirty stepped on lying out on the floor of their room
Faces fell long in the half light
He looks all wrong but that's her alright

Look at him smiling full of teeth
Clenched tight
He knew the one time with the army captain
He got one that whole deal before it happened

Said its okay I knew exactly what you meant
When you said you were an accident
But when it's 3am he wonders where in the hell she went
And he'll drive all over town

Drive all over town
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over town
Until he tracks her down
He'll drive all over town",Drive All over Town
Elliott Smith,"Last Call
He was sick of it all
Asleep at home
Told you off and goodbye

Well you know one day it'll come to haunt you
That you didn't tell him quite the truth
You're a crisis
You're an icicle

You're a tongueless talker
You don't care what you say
You're a jaywalker and you just just walk away
And that's all you do

The clap of the fading out sound of your shoes
Made him wonder who he thought that he knew
Last call
He was sick of it all

The endless stream of reminders
Made him so sick of you sick of you sick of you
Sick of your sound
Sick of you coming around

Trying to crawl under my skin
When I already shed my best defense
It comes out all around that you won
And I think I'm all done

You can switch me off safely
While I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me
Yeah yeah you're still here but just check to make sure
All you aspired to do was endure

You can't ask for more ask for more
Knowing you'll never get that which you ask for
So you cast your shadow everywhere like the man in the moon
You start to drink you just want to continue

It'll all be yester year soon
You start to drink you just want to continue
It'll all be yester year soon
Church bells and now I'm awake and I guess it must be some kind of holiday

I can't seem to join in the celebration
But I'll go to the service
And I'll go to pray
And I'll sing the praises of my maker's name

Like I was as good as she made me
And I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me

I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me",Last Call
Elliott Smith,"At a party 
He was waiting
Looking kind of spooky and withdrawn
Like he could be underwater
The mighty mother with her hundred arms
Swept all aside
I hate to walk behind other people's ambition
I saw you waiting
Saint-like
With your warning
Leave alone
You don't belong here
He got nervous
Started whistling
Ever thought a ricochet
Did you notice?
Well I wondered
What's the worst thing I could say?

Froze up and sighed
You remind me of someone's daughter
I forgot her
I forgot her name, ashamed
Go home
And live with your pain
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
And when I go
Don't you follow
Leave alone
Leave alone, cos you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
Slip out quiet
Nobody's looking
Leave alone
You don't belong here",No Name #1
Elliott Smith,"Concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
Do you know who you're talking to?
No, and I don't care who
She whispered quiet terror news
He didn't give a hoot
Said do what you have to do
All she had to do was speak
Mouthpiece to cheek
Please say no more
I'm lying here on the ground
A strip of wet concrete
Her name was just a broken sound
A struffle step you hear when you're falling down

Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying

You better start watching what message that you send now
No more situations I only go in to be kicked out
He got knocked down leaning like he ran into a clothesline
And remembered a couple of words that hid a crime
You're just fine
You'll be just fine
But I'm on the other line

Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying",No Name #2
Elliott Smith,"We arrived too late
Our mouths were opening
I turned off the light
So come on night
You're a witness you
You've seen me interrupt
A good old fashioned fight

So come on night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion

Home to oblivion
Watched the dying day
Blushing in the sky
Everyone is uptight

So come on night
Everyone is gone

Home to oblivion
I know we're not
Illegitimate
In our hearing

Elliott Smith,"For a change she got out before he hurt her bad
Took her records and clothes
And pictures of her boy
It really made her sad

Packed it up and didn't look back
I'm okay lets just forget all about him
The car was cold and it smelled like old cigarettes and pine
In her bag I saw things she drew when she was mine

Like this one here
Her alone nobody near
What a shame lets just not talk about it
No it doesn't look like you

But you did wear cowboy boots
That's your fame
There's no question about it
Once we got back inside

With one ear to the ground
I was ready to hide
'Cause I don't know who's around
And you look scared

It's our secret do not tell okay?
Let's just not talk about it
Don't tell okay?
Let's just forget all about it",No Name #4
Elliott Smith,"He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell
He could be cool and cruel to you and me
Knew we'd put up with anything

I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames

I'm hallucinating
Hallucinating
I hear you cry your tears
Cheap wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall asleep

I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames

I want to hurt him

Elliott Smith,"Alphabet city is haunted
Constantina feels right at home
She probably won't say you're wrong
But you're already wrong

You're already wrong
And you threw up whatever she shot down
Said show me around this alphabet town
Said show me around

There's a name you keep repeating
You got nothing better to do
And you're with someone who'll hear you say it and just not mind
Her hand on your arm

Her hand on your arm
She put her hand on your arm
And told you her name you can't pronounce it
I'll show you around this alphabet town

I'll show you around this alphabet town

Elliott Smith,"I'm waiting for the train
The subway that only goes one way
The stupid thing that will come to pull us apart
And make everybody late

You spent everything you had
Wanted everything to stop that bad
And now I'm a crushed credit card registered to smith
Not the name that you call me with

You turned white like a saint
I'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold flake paint

Elliott Smith,"They're waking you up to close the bar
The street's wet you can tell by the sound of the cars
The bartender's singing clementine
While he's turning around the open sign

Dreadful sorry clementine
Though you're still her man
It seems a long time gone
Maybe the whole thing's wrong

What if she thinks so but just didn't say so?
You drank yourself into slo-mo
Made an angel in the snow

And I don't need your permission
To bury my love under this bare lightbulb

Rode down south to yr little world like a dream

If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go

All I ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see around here

And you traced her footsteps in reverse up to queens

Now on the bus
Nearly touching this dirty retreat
Falling out 6th and Powell a dead sweat in my teeth

Gonna walk walk walk
Four more blocks plus one in my break
Down downstairs to the man
He's gonna make it all ok

I can't beat myself
I can't beat myself

When I walk around here drunk every night
With an open container from 7-11

A name unsatisfiable baby
Grabbing onto whatever's around
For the soaring high or the crushing down

With hidden cracks that don't show
But that constantly just grow
I'm looking for the man that attacked me
While everybody was laughing at me

You beat it in me that part of you
But I'm gonna split us back in two

If you're gonna say shit now you'll do it out loud

It's 2:45 in the morning
And I'm putting myself on warning
For waking up in an unknown place
With a recollection you've half erased

Like some precious only son
Face down, bow to the champion

You walk down alameda looking at the cracks in the sidewalk

How you maintain all them in a constant state of suspense

For your own protection over their affection
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own because you can't finish what you start

Walk down alameda brushing off the nightmares you wish
Could plague me when I'm awake
And now you see your first mistake was thinking that you could relate

For one or two minutes she liked you
But the fix is in
You're all pretension

Having had enough of it all
Said you can do what you want to whenever you want to

And I'll make you okay and drive them away
The images stuck in your head

People you've been before that you
Don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up, baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught

Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
separate from the rest, where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot

People you've been before that you
Don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still",Between the Bars

Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks

You got yourself to tease and displease
Doors swinging wide
You walked in to hide

Looking at your feet
Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the coin-op tv
Frozen in fear every time we appear

I'm not surprised and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me

Completely wrong
Totally wrong

Jailer who sells personal hells
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees

In a crowded corner where anybody can listen in
But they don't read page to page or speak easy
Now they're gonna go say the words
In the wrong order again
They walk in a circle
Through all the sidewalks scenes they used to be apart of one time
Now everybody just stares and whispers
Driving around up and down division street
I used to like it here
It just burns me out to remember
Can't you ever treat anyone nice
I think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
They draw the curtain
Wait for a call
Pretty lucky if they get any kind of response at all
Can't you ever treat anyone nice
I think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
I'm gonna make the same mistake twice",Punch and Judy
Elliott Smith,"You asked me to come down and watch the parade
To march down the street like the Duracell bunny
But we get away from the cavalcade
Throwing out candy that looks like money
To people passing by 
They'd all seem to be going the other way

So won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?

Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
They'd traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar

Ridiculous marching band started playing
Got me singing along 
With some half-hearted victory song

So won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?

The trumpet has obviously been drinking
Cause he's fucking up even the simplest lines
You say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
It's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine

A happy day and then you pay
And feel like shit the morning after
But now I feel changed around and instead falling down
I'm standing up the morning after
Situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later
And I could be another fool or an exception to the rule
You tell me the morning after
Crooked spin can't come to rest
I'm damaged bad at best
She'll decide what she wants
I'll probably be the last to know

In the cathedral with the glass stained black
Singing sweet high notes that echo back

No one'll know where you are
It's just a brief smile crossing your face

When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child what makes you think you're tough
When all the people you think you're above
They all know what's the matter

You're such a pinball yeah you know it's true
There's always something you come back running to

Alcoholic and very bitter

Still prepared for an attack
They didn't know they'd been disabled

Felt a wave a rush of blood
You won't be happy 'til the bottle's broken
And you're out swimming in the flood
You kept back you kept unspoken

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Wish I could call you today, just to hear a voice

If I didn't know the difference living alone'd probably be ok
It wouldn't be lonely
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away

A lot of hours to occupy, it was easy when I didn't know you yet 
Things I have to forget
But I better be quiet now

Carrying on and getting upset

Maybe IÂ got a problem, but that's not what I wanted to say
I'd prefer to say nothing.
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away.

Had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in my place
While a dead enemy screams in my face

I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on, not over it yet

Elliott Smith,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",In the Lost and Found (Honky Bach)/The Roost
Elliott Smith,"The imitation picks you up like a habit 
Writing in the glow of the tv static 
Taking out the trash to the man 
Give the people something they understand 

Stick man flashing a fine-line smile
Junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a style
Rich man in a poor man's clothes 
The permanent installment of the daily dose 

And you tell off when you tell it like it is
Your world's no wider than your hatred of his
Checking into a small reality
Boring as a drug you take too regularly 

The apple needs to laugh; the broken crutch 
The first true love that folded at the slightest touch 
Brought down like an old hotel 
People digging through the rubble for things they can resell 

""Happy holidays,"" said sick savior 
The leading love I still favor 
I won't take your medicine 
I don't need a remedy 
To be everything I'm supposed to be 
I don't want nobody else 
I can do it by myself 
We're meant to be together 

Now I'm a policeman directing traffic 
Keeping everything moving, everything static

On your way to some everlasting

Who'll take you out in the open door

Good and evil matched perfect it's a great romance

Veins full of disappearing ink
Vomiting in the kitchen sink
Disconnecting from the missing link

Elliott Smith,"The big problem is the main attraction
Dominoes are falling in a chain reaction
The scraping subject ruled by fear told me
Whiskey works better than beer

The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final
And nobody gets a reprieve
And every wave is tidal - if you hang around
You're going to get wet

I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
All you can do now is watch the shells
The game looks easy that's why it sells
Frustrated fireworks inside your head

Are going to stand and deliver talk instead
The method acting that pays my bills
Keeps the fat man feeding in beverly hills
I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity

And I get my check from the trash treasury
'Cause I took my own insides out
It don't matter 'cause I had no sex life
All I want to do now is inject my ex wife

I've seen the movie and I know what happens
It's a Christmas time
And the needles on the tree

""Open your parachute and grab your gun
Falling down like an omen, a setting sun

Where no-one else gonna give me grief
Mess me around
Just make it over

Your opinion was the law of the land
A single thing that I couldn't always understand
I lived it out from hour to hour
The only thing that never really changed
You ran me all around
And dragged me down
At the end of the day
Don't keep me around

I've been thinking of the things that I missed
Situations that I passed up for this
One way love I took for ours

Dreaming music to calm down

And stay down and keep evil away

Changing your shape
Dissolved in some dream

As a new one appears
To take you along where you've never been
The moonlight tonight seems to belong to me
'Cause I never go to sleep
I keep it company

One hit wouldn't matter a bit I'll

That I take what's given me
Most cooperatively

I do what people say
And lie in bed all day

And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco and you nigga know so ey

Elliott Smith,"Dragged down into lowercase
Trying to get your cops to talk right
But they can't put the paper in your face
You're just trying to walk by

So now I got a new game baby
No one's gonna recognize it
Your broken English over their flat, tired remarks
Still trying to bring some dead beauty back to life

Isn't it pretty? yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead
I can do everything that your man does except for better
Got no interest now in undressing your kids with cheap angst love

You write your name in all of the places no one goes
Some can't be satisfied until everybody knows

Elliott Smith,"You're a first timer, blaming everybody else
For the hard time you give yourself

In the cold riddle where you find yourself not blocked
By a door you locked

But don't get backed into a corner

Come on back to me
My pride tomorrow

You feel hollow
And you know it's because you are

It's been many miles
Since I've seen your fallen smile
Close up and personal

Your arsenal of excuses
You never told her
When you walked out on the savannah shoulder
With your veins all full of beer

Thinking well at least now everything is clear
But oh man
What plan
Suicide

It's just not that much different from my own affair
Always cussing and crying
How about if you
Tell me something new

Tell me what will make you happy
Oh you
So deserve to be
There were protests and contests

Attitudes to cop
I want it all to stop
Three weeks ago you were all grace and charm
And now I know it was just a false alarm

Georgia Georgia
I can't understand your sickness
You have no forgiveness
No attention left to pay

And just forget it all

Yeah, well, how am I supposed to feel","Georgia, Georgia"
Elliott Smith,"Go on parade and fade
Hit the scene and slow
Spending all your time with some girl
You'll never get to know

Wound up tight
Dressed all in white
Some torn main sail
Blowing out to drift
Leave you even if

You live up in your head
Scared of every little noise
Someone's always breaking in accidentally
Using nothing but their voice

Shrill and small
Echo down the hall
Repeating pet names
See it in your eyes
You're only passing by

Go by, go by
Go by, go by

Someone's in the way
Of pretty words and inside slurs
All the things they have to say to perform
The work that they've rehearsed

It's a waste of time
I'd put it behind me once and for all
And let the hype decline
If the problem wasn't mine

Elliott Smith,"He waved hello silent like a mime
There's no changing my mind
I won't walk the stairs with you tonight

The clock moved a quarter of a turn
The time it took a cigarette to burn
She said you got a lot of things to learn
Going nowhere

Saw you move a certain way
Missed you a lot
Return to this abandoned place
Should a been forgot
Echoes drown the conversation out
Echoes that only seem to bring about
A silent expression
Things you may allow
Going nowhere

The steps made a pattern
I'd never seen
I felt like a kid of six or seventeen
I was off in some empty day dream
Going nowhere
It's dead and gone matter of fact
Maybe for the best
Said some things you can't take back

Got in you and ripped out the seams
That's what I'd say
That's what I'd say

He was a sucker for your double dose
Motherfucker turned white as a ghost
Don't you say hi
Don't you say hi

With a broken sink for a face
And a head that just takes up space
He's not half right
He's not half right

It's already half past

I was sticking up for my friend
When there's nothing much to defend

Elliott Smith,"Coma kid taught me how 
He'd come to follow you around
Wherever you go
Said I don't go where I'm supposed to go

'Til he kicked out into reverse
Said I don't go where I'm supposed to go

And I don't go really anywhere you know
I made up my mind and I don't mind saying so
I went to meet you at central square
And when I couldn't find you there

I went walking around the city some more
People watching with a cold blank stare
And I saw your face in everyone I swear
Seems I never get your kick quite right

I was walkin' slow to a dirty dive
I'm so sick and tired tryin' to change your mind

Another sick rock 'n' roller acting like a dick
Needing cash
Burning through the trash

And fills up behind my empty face
Full of things that I'm not to do

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know
And I'm looking over my shoulder
Booking away with nowhere to go

I run down to the corner lot
It's forty-five past two
I almost forgot to show
Got a date to make with Mr. So-and-So
After which
I won't care when you all start to bitch and moan 
About being alone

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know
And I'm looking over my shoulder
Booking away with nowhere to go

Well, can't you just leave me alone?
You've already thrown all the sticks and stones 
You had to send my way
Well, can't you just leave it at that?
And spare us both the bother 
Because I just bounce back anyway
I got nothing that I want to do more 
Than make another sonic ""fuck you"" to play
Whenever you make my life cliche
So to fit in some little box with the all the labeled shit
You would say to keep confusion away

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know
And I'm looking over my shoulder

Elliott Smith,"I'll fake it through the day
With some help from Johnny Walker Red
And the cold pain behind my eyes
It shoots back through my head
With two tickets torn in half
And a lot of nothing to do
But it's all right
'Cause some enchanted night I'll be with you

The tarot cards
And the lines in my hand
Tell me I'm wrong
But they're untrue

I got plans for both of us
That involve a trip out of town
To a place I've seen in a magazine
That you left lying around
I can't hold my liquor but
I keep a good attitude
'Cause it's all right
Some enchanted night I'll be with you

And though you'd rather see me gone
Than to see there come the day
I'll be waiting for you anyway

Next door the TV's flashing
Blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy from the 70s
With a lead no one recalls
He vanished into oblivion
It's easy to do
And I cry to see when you talked to me
The day you said we were through

But it's all right
Some enchanted night I'll be with you",Miss Misery [Early Version]

Bodies to haunt 
And its been here 
And disappeared
Its hanging around aloofly for awhile
Gradually gone
Its pleasing
And freezing

Keeping company with this disaster
You looked all over town
Got turned around
To walk back through the mud
The kind you had left behind you

Everybody is the same in this long no-win game 
Where every new blood gets time to 
Become resigned

Now I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
Why you never tried to tame your master

You just blow through the coals 
Blow through the coals
Blow through the coals 
Till everyone knows 
That your smile is just a ghost
The ghost of your smile was seen on a body in the park
Its old news 
You see that its no use

Waiting to light
Waiting till dark

Telling me how I can't cave in
That I'm a study in black
Need a pat on the back
I look up and smile
A picture of dissatisfaction
That he can only see as a junkie
Though I might be straight as an arrow
He's busy shaking hands with my monkey
Busy shaking hands with my monkey well I go in the car
Straight to the bar
Where my sweetie pours the beer
For the millions of fans ignoring the bands
He's in my ear
Wants me to live in denial
Says you've gotta settle for something
Though it might not be really living
Anything is better than nothing
Anything is better than nothing

No actor action man gonna move in to take my place
I'll be pumping out the product
Just a total waste.

Look at the lengths you'll go to hide
You're under the veil
Pretending to fail
Gotta whole lot of empty time left to go
Now you've gotta fill it with something
I know what you can do don't you know
Anything is better than nothing.

No actor action man gonna move in to take my place
I'll be pumping out the product
Just a total waste

Afraid to look up
This is how I spend my time

Stuck inside my imagination

The biggest loser on sixteenth street
The invisible man with the see-through mind

With a wound to the head
Calling out to pretty Mary K

Here's what you get for things that haven't happened yet

But a soldier's uniform waved you away

Who showed me how to kill my cares
But once that's done, man, there's nothing to do
Time's running backwards from me and you
There's a riot coming

My body's running but I don't see why it bothers

Sat down in jail with this friend of mine
Who'd never close both his eyes

To cover the thing he was scared of
While he watched with the other

Made out of night train
To keep your memory down
In quicksand from the main man

From sticking pins into miniature men

And its pretty unlikely that anyone else is cool with that

I'll take the chance, and roll the dice
I might miss out on the love of my life

As time moves on, consider me gone
Because I'm moving on

I know it sounds crazy, but I just can't do this (do this)
It feels like we're wasting time, so I'll get to it
When I look into your eyes, I can see right through you (through you)
And you don't feel the same way that I do
Oh

See, all I'm trying to do, girl, is, is give you my time, and (give you my time)
You know you better not move too slow 'cause I'm moving on, lady
I'll take the chance, and roll the dice

I'm telling you, you really missed out on a good thing for sure
As a matter of fact, I'm glad I didn't walk through that door
I'm a better man for it
Said, I can learn from it or ignore it
You know I've seen it all before
Now your best friend's at my door

I'm moving on
Ooo (as time moves on)
Said, I'm moving on (as time moves on)
Yeah

Elliott Yamin,"I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
And I made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life on stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly
But, darlin', can't you see
There's no one more important to me?
Baby, can't you see through me?
'Cause we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets
Of a true love, withholding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
You're a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember, remember when we were together
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you

I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
Said, I love you for my life
You're a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember, remember when we were together
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you

We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
And I was singing this song...

Oh yeah, yeah
Mmm
We're heading for a train wreck

I gotta be honest with you, baby
I knew it right from the start
Without knowing the cost to my soul
I paid for it with my heart
They say to be careful what you wish
What you want, and what you need
Second thoughts have got me thinking over
Maybe we're in too deep

And I'm so helpless
What's the point of building up just to tear it all down?
And I should care less
But you know I just can't
I can't help wanting you around

[Chorus]
Whatever we do
Better think it through
'Cause we're moving too fast
We are strangers
Heading for a train wreck
When it feels this good
Gotta hurt so bad
This just can't last
We are strangers
Heading for a train wreck

And we're getting to the point of no return
'Cause, baby, when I give my heart
There ain't no turning back
No, it ain't
And I will live through a lesser turn
So, I just can't sit around
Waiting for the love to burn

Elliott Yamin,"I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go?
You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone

Girl, you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they
Keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away
(When) everything stays the same?
I just can't do it, baby

What will it take to make you come back?
Girl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me?
You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby, why can't we just, just start over again
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance, I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie what you're keeping inside

If it's the last thing I do

Ooo
Oh

Sometimes I sit and I wonder
And I just can't seem to believe
What a blessing it's been to be loved
You're an angel sent to me

You're the star who lights up my sky
You're the one who made me see
That you don't need wings to fly
Your love has set me free

[Chorus:]
'Cause you are the one who makes me whole
In my heart and in my soul
Just like the sun, you showed me the light
I'm amazed, and you're the reason why

Before you, I was so blind
I didn't know which path to choose
You poured all of this love in my heart
And now there's no way that I can lose

And when I have no faith in myself
You're the one who makes me strong
I wouldn't have a story to tell
Or an ending to my song

Elliott Yamin,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard sleeping tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

So I got to get you off of my mind 
Don't try to cry to me, girl
I tried to tell you before
You made your bed and now you're gonna have to lie in it
I like the way that you move
But I've got to watch what I do
If I ain't careful, I might be the one who's playing the fool

[Chorus]
(Baby) You got a cold, cold heart
But a, a warm touch 
Always gets you what you wanted
I just can't get enough of this kind of dangerous love
I'll keep your number but I know
You got a cold, cold heart

(Cold heart, cold heart, cold heart)
Girl, you got a cold, cold heart
(Cold heart, cold heart, cold heart)
Girl, you got a cold, cold heart

You tell me that you wanna be my baby
Heaven help me 'cause I love to have you every night
But I would be crazy calling you my lady
When I see your love is shady
And I know I'd be the next one in line

[Chorus: x2]

Girl, it's a shame
Your love is a game
But I can see right through your disguise
Ooooh
You can never be mine, oh mine, oh mine, yeah
Ohohoh, all mine baby
You can never be mine
(Cold heart) Cold heart
(Cold heart) Cold, cold heart
(Cold heart)
Girl, you got a cold, cold heart

(Cold heart) oh yeah
(Cold heart, cold heart)
Girl, you're so cold in your heart
I know you got a cold, cold heart
Yes, you do",Cold Heart
Elliott Yamin,"Ohhh. Yeahhh
I don't mean to bother you, I see you with your girlfriends
Wanna know if you got any plans for the weekend
Can I pick you up around 7, you let me know when.
That's when she says she's got a man...
I don't see a ring on your fingers so what you sayin'
Why your girls look at you so crazy, c'mon, stop playin'
If it's not too much can I at least know what your name is
Girl why you tellin' me u can't

Don't be afraid to fall in love
Cause I don't believe in giving up
Please give me a chance to earn your trust
Cause I know I can be everything that you need
Don't be afraid to fall in love
And don't ever say that is just too much
Cause you never know I could be the one
Girl we're not all the same,
Babe don't be afraid to love

You say that every man is lookin' for just one thing
You say they love you but they really don't know what it means
How can you think that way when you know nothin' about me
I say you runnin' away
I'll buy you nice things that I cannot pronounce
And if you let me love you, babe I will turn you on
I'll stay committed and I promise I would be around
Your life will not be the same

Don't be afraid to fall in love
Cause I don't believe in giving up
Please give me a chance to earn your trust
Cause I know I can be everythin' that you need
Don't be afraid to fall in love
And don't ever say that is just too much
Cause you never know I could be the one
Girl we're not all the same, babe don't be afraid to love

If you try
It's not a waste of time
You will find
That love is what you need in your life
Just let it go
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Don't say no
Tell me what I need to do
To make you see that you don't have to be that way
Just don't be afraid!

Wooo
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
To fall in love!

Don't be afraid to fall in love
Cause I don't believe in giving up
Please give me a chance to earn your trust
Cause I know I can be everythin' that you need
Don't be afraid to fall in love
And don't ever say that is just too much
Cause u never know I could be the one
Girl we're not all the same, babe don't be afraid to love",Don't Be Afraid
Elliott Yamin,"I'm ecstatic, I feel the magic, It's everlasting
I think that you were meant to be alive on this very night
With me, I see, it clearly
The dream you hear about
And never truly think it's realistic till it blows your mind
I never thought I could understand
I was searching me
And now I finally see

I see that some people fight for love
They stick with it, just can't quit it
Some people hide from love, they run from it, cause they don't want it
When you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people die for love
And I believe it's true cause I'd do the same for you

You're the reason, the air I'm breathing, so don't go leaving,
Cause loving you is the only thing that ever really touched my soul
I'm protective, of my blessings
Glad I kept it, I never really thought about the future till I saw my life
Finding it's purpose, so very worth it
And now I know that love is really worth it

And that's why some people fight for love
They stick with it, just can't quit it
Some people hide from love, they run from it, cause they don't want it
When you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people die for love
And I believe it's true cause I'd do the same for you

It's hard to be, and good to keep
And once you're with it, it's hard to leave
You can't help but run wild with imagination
It'll change your life from wrong or right
And then you touch, touch the sky, and now I
Don't see how I made it through the night
But I see how there's some people who fight

Some people fight for love
They stick with it, just can't quit it
Some people hide from love, they run from it, cause they don't want it
When you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people die for love
And I believe it's true cause I'd do the same for you

Some people fight for love,
(I don't wanna do it no more)
Some people hide from love,
(It just feels so good)
But when you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up cause you know that,
Some people fight for love",Fight for Love

Baby,
Fell in love before he took your heart away.
And then he left you in the cold
And it's crazy, yeah
Cause now you tell yourself you'll never fall in love again.
I know it's hard to let it go

But you gotta stop, breathe
Maybe it's no coincidence
That's you're here with me
Girl you should have a change of heart (Listen)

Everybody knows when you find true love you might not find it again
So take it by the hand
And let love be
Everybody knows when you find true love you might not find it again
So take it by the hand
And let love be (yeah yeah)

I know sometimes you want to run away
Why don't you run into my arms?
And maybe
I can help you see, help you see things my way
I see you for the star that you are

But you gotta stop, breathe
Maybe it's no coincidence
That you're here with me

Might be in disguise
Sometimes it's easy to see
That's it's a beautiful thing

Sometimes the writing's on the wall
Or maybe those words are just too small
For you to see
So open your eyes
And let love be

Elliott Yamin,"Woke up this morning
Needed to talk
Picked up the phone and started to call
And that's when it hit me
That you were gone

So many questions
Things they've been said
So much confusion
Going around in my head
And so many reasons that just
Don't' make sense

[Chorus:]
I cry to carry on
But something's missing inside
I just want to know if you're above me
Show me some kind of sign

Do you still hear me
When I call your name
Do you with me when I loose my way
When it gets hard let me know what to do
Ohhh yeah

You always told me that you never go
I need you to show me that I'm not alone
Do you still hear me when I sing for you
Show me you do

How do I start to
Make sense of what's left
Still carry the memory of you
In my head
And I'm just not ready to let you
Go yet
Ohhh nooo

But I know you're proud of
The man that I am
I know you'd want me
To go on ahead
And I give it all just to see you again.

Do you still hear me
When I call your name
Do you with me when I loose my way
When it gets hard let me know what to do
Ohh yeah

You always told me that you never go
I need you to show me that I'm not alone
Do you still hear me when I sing for you

This silence is cold
We're stuck at a dead end
I'm startin' to wonder
Did I say something wrong?

I keep askin' the question
Will you turn around and come with me?
Or should I read the signs and leave and let you be?
Now I'm standin' at this roadblock
And there's no way around it
I've been waitin' for your mind to change
Cause I feel so one sided

I saw us break
I watched us fall
It made no sense to me at all
You say that you will
But then you don't
So I'm gonna take this step alone
In my heart of hearts
I always knew
This jump was way too far for you
You say that you will
But then you don't
So I'm gonna take this step
I'm gonna take this step alone, alone

So give me a reason
Why you're on the outside
When you should be in
When we'll get together
So maybe it's better
I walk alone but you'll always be near

Now there's no room for settlin'
I gotta do this, I need to
But this mirror I'm lookin' in
There's no reflection without you

Cause I saw us break
I watched us fall
It made no sense to me at all
You say that you will
But then you don't
So I'm gonna take this step alone
In my heart of hearts

This jump was way too far for you
You say that you will
But then you don't
So I'm gonna take this step
I'm gonna take this step alone

The sanctity I found deep in your arms
It was a false alarm and it burns yeah it hurts
I lie awake at night and think of what we could have been if it worked
Then we chose to go our separate ways instead of meeting each other halfway
And if I had to choose girl, I'd have you by my side

I saw us break
I watched us fall
It made no sense to me at all
You say that you will
But then you don't
So I'm gonna take this step alone
In my heart of hearts
I always knew
This jump was way too far for you

Playing like a drum inside my head
Baby will you make it stop

And I feel so separated from the truth
And everything she ever said
Could it all be for nothing

Ohh how could she say to me it's over
When we've just begun
I gotta find a way to tell her

Girl it's you it's been on my mind cause your been gone to long
Girl it's you I wish I could find to ask u what went wrong
Girl it's you and with u is where I know my heart belongs
Can't you see there's is only one for me
And girl that's you

Just is another chance is all I ask of you
Just to show you how I feel
Did I give you away too much

I kissed your lips I felt your hips
And what we did it felt so real
You couldn't say that it wasn't love

Needed to talk
Pick up the phone and started to call

So much confusion

To carry on but something's missing inside

When I call your name?
Will you be with me when I lose my way
When it gets hard let me know what to do
You always told me that you'd never go
I need u to show me that I'm not alone
Do you still hear me when I sing for you
Show me you do

How do I start to
Make sense what's left
Still carry a memory of you in my head
And I'm just not ready to let you go yet
Oo no

The way that I am
That you would want me to go on ahead
I give it all off see you again

And the resistance

Or is that just me

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

'Til birds refuse to sing,

That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You
Ellis Larkins,"In the spring when the feeling was chronic
And my caution was leaving you flat,
I should have made use of the tonic
Before you gave me that!
A mental deficient you'll grade me.
I've given you plenty of data.
You came, you saw and you slayed me,
And that-a is that-a!

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all.
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will,
You've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me!
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow.
So what's the use,
You've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors
And call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone, of course;
It can't be a sister or brother

But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Kailua
And left me alone for a filly,
So I-a picked you-a.

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

It's like he never expected to fight at all
Oh, the raven flew in for an all-out slaughter

Depending on the season and the convenience of the locality

Framed by the flares and the cruisers, Orange coats and one sore loser

Will it fall on forgetful ears?

With two kids and a bottle of booze
And she cracked them both like match heads 
Whenever they ventured too close to her fuse

She left the ballroom 
Mascara running 
From a fight 
She slaps the doorman's face 
In the lobby 
He'd only asked her,
""Are you all right?"" 

Charlie Jenkins 
Makes resolutions like 
""Do not drink,"" and 
""Do not fight""
His conscience needs absolution 
It keeps him up when it's late at night

Ellis Paul,"Change, change, change 
Change, change, change 
If I were your brother 
Could I spill your blood on me 
We, who share a mother 
Would we spite the sons 
She sees? 

Walls are crumbling 
Cities are burning 
The presidents on t.v 
Bombs are falling 
The fire is rain 
As walls close in on me 

Change, change, change 
Change, change, change 

If Fate brought out a leader 
Would you kill him for your cause 
Though he be your sole salvation 
Pull the trigger without pause 

Faith is crumbling 
Cities are burning 
The war's on cable t.v 
Hope is falling 
The fire is rain as 
Walls come down on me 

Change, change, change 
Change, change, change 

If there's one solution 
There could be one for every man 
Who cries for constitution 
Finds belief inside of ""can"" 

The clouds are lifting 
The houses, the homes 
The soaps are on t.v 
And me, asleep somewhere 
In this country 
Basking in the dream

Ellis Paul,"She can turn a room round on a dime 
Part a crowd like the Red Sea 
She's Moses 
And stranger's eyes 
All fall and rise 
On her length 
Like they're sizing up roses 
Delivery? she could deliver me 
She broke her own commandment 
Thou shall not steal from me 
My breath is gone 
That's burglary 
Never trust a prophet 
In a party dress 

I'm here waiting on a train 
There are things that I can't explain 
Like how I got tied to the tracks 
And why love goes down 
Like some robbery 

Deliver me 
Deliver me 

There's a punchline on the sidewalk 
But the joke seems kind of cruel 
It's the ones your friends aren't telling 
That makes you look the fool 

So you step out into traffic 
Cause it's safer on the street 
You react to perfect strangers 
As if the world's complete 

It's when you are anonymous 
You can pull the wool over all of us 
But when you lean 
Don't fall on us 
Broken more or less 

Have you ever been ashamed 
Have you ever been defeated 
Crying, calling out her name 
Like love can never be repeated 
The whole worlds bringing you down 
For a million different reasons 
It's just the end of one more season 
Where love came to run you down",Deliver Me
Ellis Paul,"You're my flesh and blood 
But we're not the same 
A common name 
And now 
A common distance 

I looked up to you 
In your plush armchair 
Respect or fear 
I couldn't see the difference 

Lay your wager down 
Who'll be king in Tinsel Town?
'Cause all the prophets and the gypsies 
On the strip in Venice Beach 

Have looked me in the eye 
And said, ""Your dreams still lie in reach""
And who am I to doubt them 
And who are you 
To write these speeches? 

Is it my poverty 
That brings a blush to you?
Or the honesty 
That speaks the mind 
That comes with it 

Were you once a man 
With younger eyes 
A hungry pride 
That would not feel 
Resistance? 

Lay your wager down 
They're crowning the king in Tinsel Town 
There are strangers, there are lovers 
Out on Fairfax in a line 

They look me in the eye 
And say ""Our thoughts are intertwined""
And who am I to doubt them?
And who are you to tear down 
These signs?",Lay Your Wager Down
Ellis Paul,"Cathy's hailing a cab like she's hailing a storm
Unto the streets of new york city
Once we're inside, it's a carnival ride
That brings a white knuckle kind of dizzy

She takes me up on her rooftop,
Framed by a backdrop of watertanks and chimneys
She's wrapped round a cigarette,
Lecturing etiquette, while I look in the windows
Beneath me

We took in Saturday and it was medicine
And when nighttime came the skyline just swallowed
The moon
Cathy lays the blame on thomas alva edison
And 60 million lightbulbs telling new york that
It's noon
Ah, midnight strikes too soon
Midnight strikes too soon

She says, ""in new york city, they throw their
Wishes into wells
'cause you can't see a star, unless one hit you when
It fell -- ""
""and if even you caught one,"" I say, ""who
Could you tell in this whole damn town who'd
Believe you? ""

She smiled like a cat would to a pigeon on the roof
She says, ""I look into windows for universal truths""
And we drank in the moment like whiskey hundred
Proof
""but if orion fell,"" she said, ""I'd tell you""

The view from her roof could make your head
Just spin
It was like holding up the world in a tablespoon
And we drank it down,m every light in town
Like the sweetest, kindest medicine
I made my wish on a satellite dish
But still midnight strikes too soon
Midnight strikes too soon

Cathy never seems to slow down
She's a hurricane working a skyscraper town
She laughs at me, says I'm suburban bound
But the truth is I live on a highway

I come to this city for the solace of her roof
Every window tells a story in cold hard truth
As the world spins beneath me, I ask it for proof
That I'm living my life in my own way
Or will time just have it's own say

Midnight strikes too soon
Midnight strikes too soon
Midnight strikes too soon
Midnight strikes too soon
",Midnight Strikes Too Soon
Ellis Paul,"Becky's playing a piece by Gershwin on her old piano 
She's been playing since her childhood, ""Too long to recall...""
But the chords that fall from her fingertips, are the same 
She played when she could barely sit still, back in '69,

When the keys made her hands look small 
And she built her dream around symphonies and concertos 
Around traveling the country, and playing the music halls 
Four kids later the dreams been reduced to ""what-if"" scenarios 

But hey, to never dream is to have never lived at all 
Never lived at all 

Dave's a corporate lawyer in the city of Chicago 
And for fifteen years, he's had his nose to the old grindstone 
Poured his money in the bank to feed the beast called portfolio 
Well, if time is money then success is a life alone 

You can look out at the skyline for some forgiveness 
When you invest in love, the same will be returned 
He has prided himself on a lifetime of spoken directness 
It took him forty years to hear the lesson learned 

Has he never lived at all?
Never lived at all...",Never Lived at All
Ellis Paul,"We were drunk fools in Paris, stumbling on the sidewalk 
That runs along the Seine, and on the Cathedral 
All the gargoyles watched us laughing,
""Two stupid Americans..."" 

We were at the mercy of this passionate waiter 
Who pulled the corks at the Osterasis Cafe 
He kept serving us wine we hadn't ordered 
Then he blamed us for the weather,

It was cold and rainy -
But we raised a glass up to him anyway 

We did Paris in a day,
What would Marie Antionette say?
We made a vow on the Champs Elysees 
That nothing would come between us 

The Mona Lisa, I said, ""She smiles just like she knows me""
You said, ""She's a woman with nothing to lose -
She gathers a crowd around her, then she 
Flirts with perfect strangers, but she'll 
Never take a lover in the Louvre -
She will never take a lover in the Louvre..."" 

We did Paris in a Day 
What would Quasimodo say?
Would he stand on top of Notre Dame 
And throw down tourists to us?

A thousand stairs up the Pompadou 
We were gasping at the view 
If we tried for Jim Morrison's gravesite too 
We'd probably have to find a tour bus 

And man, how do we find a tour bus 
Without finding another day 

We took the M across the Seine 
And headed for the Eiffel tower 
And there the street merchants 
Called us out by name 

""Cool shades here for the Americans""
They said in their finest hipster English 
And then they told us, ""Every Yankee looks the same""
I said, ""Is it the camera case, or our American grace?""

They said,
""You all just look the same..."" 

We lit a candle for a ghost in the Notre Dame Cathedral 
We got lost on the Left Bank looking for a place in which to stay 
When we told the waiter there what we had done, he said,
""Only an American would attempt Paris in a day...
Only an American would do Paris in a day..."" 

We did Paris in a day 
What would Marcel Marceau say?
We put up our feet at the Fountain Cafe 
And toasted the bond between us 

We drank sherry with an Englishman 
We caught up like long lost friends 
Under the Arc we watched the sunset end 
And laughed at the miles that had passed beneath us 

The miles that passed beneath us 
You said, ""That's kilometres, baby""
But I wouldn't let it come between us 

Nothing will come between us 
Nothing will come between us...",Paris in a Day
Ellis Paul,"I tried to frame my own self portrait 
Into a three-minute one-act play 
But I'm a carnival of voices 
It's hard to pin me down that way 
Without my subconscious saying 
""I'm not in love with you,
But I'd be willing to make a change.
It's these profound fits of sunshine 
That bring on subsequently rain."" 

""If I could make a suggestion""
I say, 'Oh, this should be nice'
""The middle ground is partly sunny,
Now take my good advice,
Nobody's out here throwing rice yet 
But me and the voices inside of your head 
All agree"" 

And I say, 'Since we're all here talking
You think I'm afraid of you?
Well, I'm afraid I think you're right
I've never been good at crowd control 
Your voices keep me up all night' 'Now, I'm no psychiatrist 
Though I'm known for Freudian slips

I'd like to remember to keep you voices 
Out of my head'",Self Portrait
Ellis Paul,"It's a snowy night, the cops shut down the freeway 
Big men in plows are out carving up the streets 
Below them, jammed on a subway, 
I'm with two hundred over-dressed strangers 
Brushing snow off coats and shoulders 
Kicking snow off dress shoe feet 
Chorus:
You live six miles down this trolley car's trail 
Up above the red line, where the street musicians wail 
Where Baby, we used to chase down coffee 
On the sidewalk take in tunes 
We'd drink in the waning hours 
Till we polished off the moon 
Who knew the moon would fail 
Above the trolley car trail 

""Park Street, next station""
Says a voice with an accent I've heard 
And I see shoppers on the platform 
Where green and red lines diverge 
I fight my way through the packages and the bows 
To a pay phone, the operator knows 
She says to me, ""Your nervousness shows""
I say, ""'Nervous' is too kind a word"" 

I think snowfall should be measured 
By how much it takes a city by surprise 
By how far back old timers go to remember 
The last time a blizzard stung their eyes 
Last time I rode a subway 
You had summer in your eyes 
You did 

Your phone rings, but it only brings your voice 
On a message machine, ""I'm not here, the tape is clear""
Me, I'm off the hook it seems 
""I called,"" I say, ""to say 'hello'
To coax you out where the snowmen grow 
But you're not home, and hey, I gotta go,
It was good to hear your voice.""",Trolley Car
Ellis Paul,"Tell the man who repairs the wings for angels
That one has fallen among the mortals on Bleeker Street
I lent a hand, she looked up at the steeples
As if to blame them for the pavement beneath her feet
She said, ""I never much liked flying, but the job requires trying 
The hard part's avoiding buildings and concrete""

[Chorus]
Spread the news, 'cause there's an angel in Manhattan
Call out the paparazzi and the television crews
Let the people choose 
Would a little Faith come to harm them?
Print the headlines up in the New York Daily News
It was just another day
Like any other, other day

A Tuesday afternoon
I hailed a cab, a crowd gathered as it pulled beside us
And somebody tore at her wings, but I helped her safely inside
""I'm much obliged,"" she said, but the driver he looked shaken

He said, ""You're fakin', lady, who's taking who for a ride""
But then we floated up over the traffic, she turned the radio to static,
And she sang to him in Billy Holiday's sweet voice 

[Chorus]
Spread the news, 'cause there's an angel in Manhattan
Call out the paparazzi and the the television crews
Hey if you choose 
Would a little Faith come to harm you?
Print the headlines up in the New York Daily News
It was just another day
What will the mayor say?
""Good afternoon""

We flew down the length of Fifth Avenue
She threw out miracles, it was a hysterical ride
And if the crowd on the sidewalk looked skeptical
She took the blue right out of their cynical eyes
""It's all in what you feel inside""

She shook the mayor's hand, and he declared
That he'd hold a press conference,
The fans and protesters blocked the stairs to city hall
""I'd like to thank you all,"" he said
And when she stepped before the cameras 
It felt like a trial, but she smiled as the questions were called,
""What do you say to detractors, who claim you're just some actor?""

She said, ""The question here, is 'Do I believe in you?'""
It was just another day
Like any other, other day

[Chorus]

Spread the news, I saw an an angel fly from Manhattan
In front of paparazzi, in front of television crews
And me I choose 
I know a little Faith wouldn't harm me
Despite what they print in the New York Daily News

It was just another day
Like any other, other day
Like any day",Angel in Manhattan
Ellis Paul,"Street corner, cityside lane
People cross borders
When green lights change
And isn't that strange

A face on someone
I almost said your name
Can you blame me?
But I was foiled again

[Chorus]
Bring me backwards
I can't fool time
I'm walking in circles
I've committed no crime
Bring on the witness
The truth is divine
You stand there bleeding
But the blood is mine

And you'd say,
""Pain is just a relative thing""
I'd say, ""Thank you, Mr. Einstein""

Sees a cab in the street
Lets out a point-blank whistle,
It stops with a screech
She picks up the last box,
That sits in the corner
She turns around to take
A mental photograph
She says to herself,
""I think a toast is in order,""
And she holds up
An invisible wine glass

""Here's to the fool I was
Here's to the bride I could never be
I've gotta know what's truth and what's fiction
I gotta feel like my love's got conviction

And I tell you if it's the last thing I do
I won't cry over you""

And gathering stones

Before he'd step down the aisle

Thinner than a whisker

The self-inflicted kind
You're like a nun on a mission
To help that boy unwind

It's too cold in San Francisco Bay""
You just turned and watched the buildings pass by
And said, ""I wouldn't have him any other way""

That you've turned to someone else's hand
So you're onto another is it the martyr or the mother
That's attracted to a straight jacket man

And forty acres in my head

An old upright piano

And a precocious blue-eyed kid

I'm alone on a highway
Only silos break the view
A field of sunflowers
A scarecrow paying dues

I will wash away the doubt

Set to hang my heart out on some two-thousand-mile phone line

You may notice in the subways, in the veins a smiling face
Banging on a hollow guitar near an open clean case
Pocket change, pocket change
Ill take that Visa card stranger
And buy my way to sunlight where the airs not cold

Street lights air think time for a ride
Hailing Taxi! Voice with a Caribbean inside
Pointing to it's miling wide
What questions do they hide?

Am I home?

Ellis Paul,"Bag lady stands on the corner dancin' away
Two children at her feet enjoying a sunny day
Here come a bus, driven by gus, hes humming away
Something to the tune of sittin' on the dock of the bay

Oh, I hear them all day

Ellis Paul,"Poet marches on in the naked kings parade
Nobody cares when he kicks up a stone
His heads hanging down from the weight of the charade
No answers in the dirt, just dead old weary bones

You run, run, run like a mad man on a potion
You come, come down like a bird

Poet sings aloft on a stump of stone
Heavy words, heavy songs, he heaves them out to the throng
But they float like clouds across the backs of these spoken
And he weeps like a child when they cheer an honest boys song

You run, run, run like a mad man on a potion
You come, come down like a bird

Poet, poet fool
You should be king
The obliging rings from your stool
The one great voice of the kingdom
But no, no, no one listens to

You come, come down like a bird",Poet Fool
Ellis Paul,"This old car has seen the ages since the second of the world wars
Bought by a Jersey family on the cutting edge of poor
A ragged wife and weary children stricken with the chore
Of a restless man of thirty-five who dreamed he lived for more

I'm hating my surroundings and my soul I'm sure is dead
I will die a hollow, bitter man with a gun against my head
I need some time to drive alone to feel the wind of the life Ive blown
I may be back, but don't expect that this car will find me home

After two thousand turns of the gauge, he hid his wedding band
And lost the keys in a musty room to lust and a womans hand
She stole off with her lover
He was a dressed-up blues-harp man
And they chased the road to Chicago for the blues
From any raging band

This old car has seen the ages since the second of the world wars
Its seen a man in his final stagesseen two lovers opening doors
But the doors jammed shut and struck up the band
When the blues man asked for more
The woman heard no harmony in the blues
Of old Chicago lore

I'm hating my surroundings and my soul I'm sure is dead
I will die a hollow, bitter man with a gun against my head
I need some time to drive alone to feel the wind of the life Ive blown
I may be back, but don't expect that this car will find me home

In a back field in a farmers lot, a boy-man finds the car
Bought for a song by his father, its been ten years off the tar
A motionless engine is a curse
To a boy with a ready heart
In a boxed-up town the dreams abound
But never get their start

I'm hating my surroundings and my soul I'm sure is dead
I will die a hollow, bitter man with a gun against my head

Ellis Paul,"Now summer had been no friend to him and fall was looming cold
There was a pocket of warm near a jewelry store sellin' things of gold
So he sat himself beneath the sign in the window it said Well made sold

Jim Weston was a local cop, only 24 years old
Got a call from the jewelry store, the same old message told
Must be a million times, wish hed had a dime for every stop at that shop of gold

But all is well, all is well
All except for the town crier
But hey, he'd never tell
You see he cries in his sleep
And lies when he speaks
All is well

So the old man says, Nice to see you, Jim
And Jim smiled cause the whole town knew his name
But he couldn't recall that of the man who was sittin' out in the rain
And his face was flushed with the blood of a heart of shame
You gotta get going old man, this ain't no place for you
The owners of the shop have complained
The old man pulls himself up and says, Well, that's just the same
Even a warm grate in a slab of concretes no place for a man with no name

Hey man, don't you know the price of gasoline?
You're better off in a Chevrolet
Oh but you wont drive that in a raquetball club

So you talk of the upholstery in the hot tub
You fight to remain humble in all them rising bubbles

What do you do when somebody's looking at you out a window in a car of four lanes?
Yeah the traffics going nowhere and your bodys getting hot

Are those the ones blocking out the ultraviolet rays?
GQ gave them incredible raves
I read it off the shelf, could not afford to pay

Ellis Paul,"I judged the distance
To where you ran your hand through your hair
You were startled for an instant , you said,
""take me home,"" and I paid the fare.


And you laughed the laugh of the innocent
As the cab cut a path in the street
As the world swept by with it's violence
I thought of the shelter we'd find in the sheets¡­
In the sheets

Chorus
I never asked you for nothing like changing your name
I believed we had something here, but nothing ever came
Were you thrown by the language, by words that we said
When I told you I loved you
Did it get in the way? get in the way?

You lit a candle,
Then you poured me a glass of port wine
I pulled the oven handle,
The air felt warm, the scent felt kind

And your kiss could heal like medicine
There ain't nothing that it can't overcome
But I could not lean on this evidence,
For fear you'd take the cure and run.
You would run...

Chorus

Cause love won't stop to
Think about the consequences
Turns a fool to stumbling
Over people's fences.

And the moon cut a frown over windy town
But you smiled as you pulled down the shade
And we turned a corner onto holy ground
And got lost in the love we made, that we made...

Chorus

Get in the way...

Ellis Paul,"I'll respond to you in letters
Sorry so slow, sorry so few
In a nutshell, I'm much better
So far the complaints I hear are few
So how have you been? Have you been to the races? Did you take my mother 
Is your sister in braces? I wish I could've been there to see you through
Hey, are all those things you told me once still true? 

Do you remember that time 
It was cold in the park 
You were running a race, I was there on a lark 
Who would've thought that New York could be such a small town

With the grace of an actress 
Falling like a thief from a roof. 
She's asking for proofâ??â??Are you staying?â?? 
Outside you hear mission bells. 

Welcome to Maria's beautiful mess, 
In a cluttered apartment on the West Side. 
She pulls the blinds while, 
You watch how her dress falls round her. 

And the world slows, a clock shows 
A wrinkle in the flow of time 
And she steps close, her eyes glow, 
Lips pop open like a bottle of wine 

And she'll love like it's thirst 
Like she's never been hurt, 
She's dancing just like nobody's watching. 
Is this love? Is this cursed? 
It feels like the first time falling 
Nobody's watching, Nobody's watching, 
Nobody's watching, watching 

She puts on some music, 
She asks you to choose it 
You sang her back a Gershwin line. 
Now Ella is singing holy, soulfully, 
Bringing up better times 

And beneath the tunes, 
She's smiling on an unmade bed 
She saysâ??â??What's in the middle that scares you? 

Does it dare you 
To take a moment and just slow down?â??

She don't even know the boy's last name
And whatever excuse she makes up
For what happened in the sheets
Lord knows, some things have got to change.

Cover Me
With rose petal kisses
Smother me
With wet perfume
Hover over me,
Like you're pulling at the ocean
Tugging at the sand
Oh, sweet Gravity's hands
Fill me like the light fills the moon.

Headlights in the driveway
Somebody's in a car, a door slams
Clip clop your man's come home
There's a tumble, there's a shakeup
A knife falls to the floor
God damn, that turns marrow to bone

There's a man inside the parlor
His heartbeat paints the floor
A voice on his shoulder is whisperin' his name
In the heart of a desperate hour
Love knocks down all doors
Knowing too well it's too late to lay blame.

Slips in the sheet like a ghost
Says to my ear hey mister,
You need to take this girl to the coast

I need to kick my feet up in the ocean
Feel the taste of salt sea spray
Baby let's live in the moment
Cause it feels like life is taking the moment away

Let's seize the day, seize the day, seize the day

In the kitchen in the morning
She poured coffee in my favorite cup
She's been dancing on the linoleum, bare foot
The squeaking nearly woke me up

She put Tom Jones on the stereo
Now that I could do without
Ah, but who needs perfection?
I like the tension when there's room for doubt

Seize the day, seize the day, seize the day
Seize the day, seize the day, seize the day

She brought some pens, a couple of notebooks
A postcard, a blanket, a bottle of Merlot
And the sky provided the sunset
Me, I brought the music of Nat King Cole.
And I'd come back as a sea-gull, I said,
If in the next life they'd give you the choice
I'd come back with you, we could go flying,

Ellis Paul,"The 20th Century is over, but what if it never began?
What if the entire 100 years was the work of a single man?
I mean in hindsight, dont it seem quite clear?
At least it does from where I sit here
How could we go from a horse-drawn cart
To Mars in 100 years?
He started out slowly, nineteen-ought-one-two-and-three
To pull us in quietly into the 20th Century

But before the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk
Lifted off that sandy ground
Hed invented Thomas Edison, modern medicine, electric sound

The 20th Century is over, but what if it never began?
What if the entire 100 years was the work of a single man?

We chased the War to End All Wars
With a party that roared and crashed
Took a second world war ten years later
Before we found ourselves jobs and gas

And Hitler! Good Lord, Hitler, what was he thinking there?
You put the Devil in a Chaplin moustache
Grease back his crop-top hair and millions will follow
How could we swallow how could we swallow that word for word?
That someone so evil could walk among the people
Who inhabit this planet Earth?

The 20th Century is over, but what if it never began?
What if the entire 100 years was the work of a single man?

The Sixties framed with sex, drugs and rock and roll
Assassinations, demonstrations, and shots from the grassy knoll
He chased away Vietnam with the calm
Of punk rock rage
You never knew what craziness was lying
In wait from page to page
Reganism Communism Reaganism Communism
And they tore down the Berlin Wall
But our optimism is still standing
Waiting for a call that never came
Much is very different, but too much is still the same

He shrank the computer down from a warehouse to a chip
And then he shrunk it down again and again and again and 
now its just a tiny blip
And now the blip is so wee, so small it cant be seen
By the naked eye at all
Cant be seen

But it glues us, all of us in our house
To the mouse
To the screen, to the screen
Just like him, in a room thats dim
Were all awaiting our final scene
Were awaiting our final scene

The 20th Century is over, but what if it never began?
What if the entire 100 years was the work of a single man?

Ellis Paul,"My name is Robert Wilson
I'm from Eau Claire, Wisconsin
I've been living out of a 
suitcase now for fourteen days
I walked the boulevard in Hollywood
I caught a Vegas show that was no good
Met a dancer there that starred in a broadway play
But it's a lonely world from this Greyhound
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days
Three thousand miles
I've been here fourteen days
Three thousand miles

Now twenty-one is as good a guess as any age that I'd confess to
Let's just say I'm old enough to get away
Back in school, I found the only written truth 
On bathroom stalls and telephone booths
I studied awhile, but college got in my way
I've learned much more from the back of this Greyhound
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days

Three thousand miles
I've come a long, long way
Three thousand miles

Have you seen? 
The world outside is turning 
And it's yours 
we were put here for the learning
People talk to themselves on Greyhounds
Even the driver strains to hear
They tell the same forgotten story 
Will it fall on forgetful ears? 

Down in Houston on comes this woman 
With two kids and a bottle of booze
And she cracked them both like match heads 
Whenever they ventured too close to her fuse
And I sat with a girl from Boston
Playing cards for cigarettes
I lost her name with the poker game
But her name I will never forget

You never forget the view from these windows

Till the end? 
I don't know, but 
I hitched a ride with Chris McCandless, 
I stepped in the wild with Chris McCandless, 
And I felt alive with Chris McCandless.

Ellis Paul,"Have you ever heard of The Magazines
They re a band out of New Orleans
They broke in Chicago
Shaking the walls of every kid in the suburbs

I lifted my thumb up to the old highway
Carved their names across the USA
Chasing a rock band
Chasing the ghost of the King in Graceland

Set me free
There's nothing but highway in front of me
Louisiana bayou, thunderstorms in Tennessee
Set me free
There's nothing behind me but history
Every town I greeted
Everything I needed to know
Was breaking through the radio

I hitched a ride down to Tupelo
With a caravan of gypsy souls
Dancin' in moon shine
Every song pulled me in like a life line

Set me free
There's nothing behind me but history
Every town I greeted
Everything I needed to know
Was breaking through the radio

Now I'm walking down a two lane road
With a dog named Trey and girl named Joe
Headed for Georgia
Ain't it good to be where everyone knows ya

Ellis Paul,"It was a summer night 
I took off in my old man's car 
I rolled the windows right on down 
I cranked up the radio 
And chased the meteors 
On a dirt road out of town 

Tonight 
There's a bonfire in Walker's field 
Tonight 
In the firelight our dreams revealed 
Tonight 
You can chase away your high school years 
Shadows dancing wildly at the scene 
But I never knew right then 
Just what it means 
To be eighteen 
To be eighteen 

The voice of Jimmy Aberdeen 
Still washes over me 
He had a laugh like a thunder cloud 
He was holding blue spray paint 
Jimmy was no saint 
But he could always draw a crowd 

That night 
We climbed the water tower in Walker's field 
That night 
Above the lights of town our fates were sealed 
That night 
Jimmy fell down through the darkness 

An ambulance brought silence to the scene 

And carried off the life 
And broken dreams 
Of Jimmy Aberdeen 

Now the years have passed 
The cabbie taps the glass 
We're outside 
My reunion hall 
He leaves me to the night 
I count the satellites 
I see the tower 
Looming tallâ?¦ 


Tonight 
I'm taking on my memory 
Tonight 
I climbed the water tower for all to see
Tonight 

I painted steel 
With cobalt blue 
Spelling out 
My graduation year 
Above the highway 
That took me out of here 

And I finally think 
I really know 
What it means 
To be eighteen 
Eighteen

In my bed at night
I'm dreaming that im flying
At the speed of light
In two seconds

I lean back and raise a
Toast to the stars tonight

Dreamin' at the speed of light

Somedays
Id just settle for
The speed of sound
Id step off this porch
And blow a kiss to this goddamn town
Id let off
One of them sonic booms
And break all the windows
In the living rooms
And blow off the hats
Of the boys
At the old fairgrounds

Laughin' at the speed of sound

Go
Why don't you go then?

Why don't you decide?

You plant each step like it was a seed
And make peace with what you cannot change

With a wake-up call singing to my soul

Ellis Paul,"My name is robert wilson,
I'm from eau claire, wisconsin.
I've been living out of a
Suitcase now for fourteen days...
I walked the boulevard in hollywood,
I caught a vegas show that was no good --
Met a dancer there that starred in a broadway play.
But it's a lonely world from this greyhound,
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days.

Three thousand miles,
I've been here fourteen days,
Three thousand miles...

Now twenty-one is as good a guess as any age that I'd confess to,
Let's just say I'm old enough to get away.
Back in school, I found the only written truth
On bathroom stalls and telephone booths.
I studied awhile, but college got in my way.
I've learned much more from the back of this greyhound,
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days.

Three thousand miles,
I've come a long, long way,
Three thousand miles...

Have you seen?
The world outside is turning --
And it's yours --
We were put here for the learning.
People talk to themselves on greyhounds,
Even the driver strains to hear
They tell the same forgotten story --
Will it fall on forgetful ears?

Down in houston on comes this woman
With two kids and a bottle of booze,
And she cracked them both like match heads
Whenever they ventured too close to her fuse.
And I sat with a girl from boston,
Playing cards for cigarettes.
I lost her name with the poker game,
But her name I will never forget --

You never forget the view from these windows,
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days...

Three thousand miles,
I've come a long, long way,
Three thousand miles...

Ellis Paul,"In a far and distant country
Lived a strange and a fearsome beast
They said he killed the farmers' cattle
And laid waste to the farmers' fields

So the King sent out his criers
And they roamed from town to town
Pledging a plot of land and his daughter's hand
To him who laid the Monster down

Now Abiola, the shepard's daughter
Hadn't heard of the King's decree
She never paid much heed to rumors
And she headed out into the fields
She headed out into the fields

When she came across the creature
She could not believe her eyes
Cause out of all the things she had ever seen
She'd never seen a monster cry
Seen a monster cry

The Monster said to the young girl
I never did those evil deeds
But the King has tried to blame me
And no one dares to not believe

He wants the pastures for his horses
He wants the orchards for his thieves
And if the farmers come to fear me
Then the King gets what he needs
Yea, the King gets what he needs

""We are going into town
And till then we'll cry
From the rooftops high
And we'll spread the truth around
Yea, we'll spread the truth around""

Well, the children all believed them
But the grownups took their time
To break their fear
Though it was clear
That the fearsome beast was kind
Oh, the fearsome beast as kind

Then the people stormed the castle
And they drove the old King out
And for her bravery, truth, and kindness
They gave Abi the crown

Your touch still burning on my skin
I'm falling in where I stop and you begin

Leaves they fall
A clock is turning on the wall
Colors change
Iron rusts
You can trust
That you'll never be the same
It's the day after everything changed

Behind the walls are cracks
And truths that will reveal us
Like water breaking stone
Buckets of rain have fallen
In the sheets between us
We lie together
We lie alone

So what is Beauty?
What is broken?
Has it faded now unspoken?
A crack in the window pane
Can break the world in two

Leaves they fall a clock is turning on the
Wall colors change

Iron rusts
You can trust
That you'll never be the same

After everything changed

Be the same, cause it's the day after everything changed",The Day After Everything Changed

You say you need something to live for
Out on this long winding road
If you need somewhere to go
I'll be the cab that you cry for
I wish you could wake up
At day break and see where you are
Watch the sun come shining
Your life's full of diamonds
Heaven can't be too far
It's wherever you are

It only prints the bad news
While ignoring the miracles

She picked up the one-way suitcase

His right hand left the steering wheel
For a half-empty bottle
Whiskey stings on the first sip

She can shake your faith like only a woman can
But the hurt
The ache

heart was locked
Like she was dancing inside of someone else's box
So she arched her back, fell to the floor
Cause that's what expressed the emotion more
Sometime you gotta draw outside of the lines
To color the dance that's inside your mind

You've gotta dance like Martha

All could play a part in her imagination
All the costumes and all the props
Were just another way to make the audience's heart stop

Expressed in the moves of these girls and boys

The sounds are flying off this thing!
A dog, a cat, a baby's laugh

Is because Edison had an incredible idea!

When reasons for staying are missing

Bouncing off walls of canyons in my mind

When you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack
Talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two
Still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
The books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing
On a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye
To one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away
And echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park
Where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on
For still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
That waits for us

Elly Wright,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Stars in the sky are all free and they shine for me,

The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone

Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me,
You bring a love so divine, all this is mine

There may be other springs as full and fare,

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Elmo Hope,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk

Elmo Hope,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

They bound me up in chains, 
And that's the last I knew.

And they observe each move I make: 
I wonder if they'll let me out alive 
I know there's no way to escape 
I know the feeling of dejection: 
To be imprisoned for no crime:

Eloy,"She grew like the blossming oak tree
A fountain of magic spells
Her mind was of sunshowered beauty
We once knew so well
Her roots understanding of earth seeking silently
Branches of arching embrace and serenety
Flowers revealing the secret of her own mystery
Her fruit offering endless desire for true love and harmony
We will always be together
Let the winds of heaven dance between us now
Your restless tides return forever
Every flower reflects your innocent brow
As the silence of the seasons
Will unfold our lifetime memory
Our beclouded search for reasons
Echoes call afar and so persistantly
Your feeling song we thought we knew
Still we'll carry on in unison with you
We will always be together
Let the winds of heaven dance between us now
Your restless tides return forever

Eloy,"Close your eyes, you'll feel paralyzed
Colour shapes and shades all mingle
Suddenly it feels so bizarre
Faintly still you hear your heartbeat
Is it just an illusion?
Or a mainline infusion?
Welcome dreamer!
Take shelter in this world of surreality
Gain wisdom from the astral world
Look inside the eye of the mind
And find deliverance at last
Free from anxiety now
Everything's clear in your mind
You found your sanctuary now
Leaving all sorrows behind
In your dreams you'll be closer to yourself
Find a direction to your life
Dreams of good and dreams of bad
All experience you've had
Is it just an illusion?
Or a mainline infusion?
Dreams recalled seem so true and real
Waking up your lit with feelings
Emanating this new found might
Days that once were grey are shining
Dormant emotions awake
Tasting sweet to your mind
You see your goal way ahead
Shining like a beacon in the dark
Forever is here and now
It's not a trick of the light
You hear a silence within
Peace and love reunite
In everlasting burning light
You feel your aura expanding
Bathing in virginal joy
Just like a flower in bloom
Still in embryonic state
(you) Crave for an identity
Free from anxiety now
Everything's clear in your mind
You found your sanctuary now
Leaving all sorrows behind
In your dreams you'll be closer to yourself
Find a direction to your life
Don't despair when you feel in the shade
Wait and your dreams will lend a hand

Eloy,"Sudden vibes awaken deep inside
Words and sounds that echo in the night
It's like an animal,
It's aboriginal
So unemotional
It's takin over all your senses
Don't be afraid you must obey
The tug of the call of the wild
Deep down you know how to enjoy
Feeling the call of the wild
Open the door of the cage
That's been holding you prisoner
And living a lie
And silence follows your cry
Pungent is the danger in the air
Vibrant notions reach from everywhere
It seems so natural
So very physical
A little virginal
At last you're tearing down all fences
Don't be afraid you must obey
The tug of the call of the wild
Deep down you know how to enjoy
Feeling the call of the wild
Don't hesitate no chance to escape
Follow the call of the wild
It's something that you can't deny
It's ruling all of your senses
Deep down you know how to enjoy
Feeling the call of the wild
Not that you're sharing
The cradle of wisdom
And daring to reach for the skies
A silence follows your cry
It's like an animal,
It's aboriginal
So unemotional
It's takin over all your senses
Don't be afraid you must obey

Eloy,"In this lonely room, where my father plays with science
On some hair-brained scheme,
He lives in a dream
But he can't do much for me know
But he can't do much for me know
I've spent all my life eating knowledge at school
Driven hard to pass exams like a fool
And now they're all behind me
Success has come to remind me
Where do I go from here?
Hey, what's this, I'm disappearing
Seeing strange things, hey what's happening?
I don't understand what it's meant to be
Is it something in my drink or is it me?
What are these things around me
I'm coming down, I'm coming down
And who's that smart chick over there?
But they're old fashioned clothes to wear!
",Journey into 1358 [*]
Eloy,"I'll tell you who I am and whence I came,
It's not going to be easy to explain
By body has returned, my mind is all at sea
Will you tell me who you are and where we're meant to be?
She answers in an gentle, lilting style,
Says little but speaks volumes with a smile
With a sparkle in her eye, she takes me by the hand
'Let us take a walk, I'll answer all I can.'
Jamie:
April, 1358...Paris...I don't understand any more... my name is
Jamie...and mine is a strange story... one which even I don't fully
Understand...my father is a scientist... and he has been
Experimenting with time-eroding drugs... I was sitting in his
Workroom..it was late at night...and I was thinking... you know,
About me and my future...I've just left school...and I don't know
What I want to do...I must have somehow have taken the drug... and
Landed up here.
Jeanne:
My name is Jeanne . . and let me tell you my story . . my father owns
Many acres around here ... which are farmed by peasants ... whom he
Rules with an iron hand .. the neighbouring landlord's even worse
... and I'm supposed to marry his son ... That's not my choice, you
Know, 'like father, like son'.
Jamie:
Well I see we've both got our problems ... perhaps we can help each
Other ... I've got something here... lots of my friends smoke it...
I don't suppose you know it... try it, it helps at times like these...
Jeanne:
Oh what a beautiful feeling... everything shimmering in the
Twilight... look at that sunset... I've never seen such colours
Before... it all seems suspended in eternity... I wish moments like
These would last forever... I'm not worried any more... what are you
Thinking?
Jamie:
I can't think at the moment... but I feel as if we've known each
Other for years... let's just enjoy it.
Somehow we must stay together, lifelong friend, my lifelong friend,
Love like ours will last forever, never end, and never end:
We'll somehow wipe away our fears,
And find a way bridge the years.
",Love Over Six Centuries
Eloy,"Madhouse, isolation
Madhouse, in desolation
A house of silence during the day,
Seems bewitching
How everyone stays away, no-one dare go near 
Madhouse, night-time nearing
Madhouse, lights appearing

They're turning night into day
Freak musicians
Smoke, drifting slowly away with the music
Maybe all the people on the outside looking in
Don't understand the life that's there inside is not all sin
Musicians make their music, smoke, make love, so if that's bad,
Who outside could claim that they've got happiness like that?",Madhouse
Eloy,"Your father told me I can stay,
But he mistrusts my unfamiliar ways:
He want's to use the things I've learnt
Six hundred years of knowledge sorely earned.
But if we can stay together,
I don't mind the things he tells me:
Of defending him in mutiny,
I don't care if you're there, I don't care
One the farms they've made a stand,
Against the hated iron hands, they're uniting
They're backed by everyone in town,
And I must ride to beat them down, how they're fighting:
But I understand their cause
To fight against the laws, they're right:
I promised to defend
Your father to the end and fight
The hatred's there in their eyes,
They'll break his might it's no surprise if they do it:
But I must take the other side
And somehow learn to stand and fight, and come through it:
Though there's little chance
That I beat bow and lance, I must:
Our love drives me on
For you're the only one I can trust.
",Mutiny
Eloy,"I remember well, long time ago
Once a rebellious child
With many questions, roaming in my mind
Craving for knowledge I tried to learn
The only wisdom I found
Were only contradictions all around

Now I'm facing reality
Only fake and mendacity
What's the reason why?
We are loosing control?
Rules and laws of society
Based on lies and dishonesty
Useless and in vain
Only a burning shame

Now I know the game I begin to grasp
All I've seen tore me apart
But there's no desperation in my heart
Deep inside I feel a rising rage
Ready to go my way
Without the fatal guidance of decay

Mighty lords of insanity
Attentive guards of prosperity
They are the ones caring for our lives
Rigid guards of morality
But without credibility
All along the line
Entangled in crime
Self-appointed heroes of our time

Surrounded by violence, apathy and disparity
We are all adrift seeking the way to our refuge and
deliverance
In a chaotic world

There's no time left for hesitation
Or to wallow in resignation
Do we see the warning signs?

Mindless fools of vanity
Only slaves of technology
Insanity prevails
Takes control of our life
Adulterating reality
Emanating stupidity
Values in decay
Visions fade away

Growing madness and confusion
It absorbs all power, kills illusion
We are led astray

We live in an age of insanity and confusion
Our existence is senseless without direction
Yet these times of many changes offer us also big
chances
To face the future escape our self-destruction by
returning to our true values

Mighty lords of insanity
Mindful guards of charity
They ignore the ones
Suffering lonely penury
Mindless fools of vanity
Only slaves of technology
Insanity prevails
Takes control of our life

Behind facades of sincerity
Growing reckless rapacity
Now is time to turn
To regain our liberty
Senseless war and perversity
Terminating our destiny
The message of our time
Is only violence and crime

Heed the voice of your inspiration
Trust the call of your imagination
We've been lead astray",Age of Insanity

Illuminates the night so clear
We share a dream, enchanted by
An overwhelming atmosphere

Side by side we're soaring high

We're riding through the summer night
On visionary wings of light
We're melting deep inside
To everlasting light

Deception of our fantasy?
Beyond the skies a sanctuary
A paradise in secrecy

Like sparkling diamonds in the sky

A symphony without compare

It's warming rays we feel inside

Transcending to a Symphony

Endless rain into a paper cup

Elton Britt,"You're as hard to hold as quicksilver
When you kiss and run away
I dream you're mine and then as quick as quicksilver
All my dreams are led astray

I keep chasing you till I'm facing you
And embracing you with all your charms
Then you slip through my fingers just like quicksilver
Right into someone else's arms

Seems like I am havin' trouble with you
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
Seems like you're fickle, fickle as can be
And your fickle ways have got me up a tree

You're as hard to hold as quicksilver
When you kiss and run away
I dream you're mine and then as quick as quicksilver
All my dreams are led astray

I keep chasing you till I'm facing you
And embracing you with all your charms
Then you slip through my fingers just like quicksilver
Right into someone else's arms

Then you slip through my fingers just like quicksilver
Right into someone else's arms",Quicksilver
Elton G. Miranda,"One single drop of rain
Your salty tear became blue ocean
One tiny grain of sand turning in your hand
A world in motion

You're out beyond the furthest Morning Star
Close enough to hold me in Your arms
Adonai, I lift up my heart and I cry
My Adonai

You are the Maker of each moment
Father of my hope and freedom
Oh, my Adonai
One timid faithful knock

Resounds up the Rock of Ages
One trembling heart and soul
Becomes a servant bold and courageous
You call across the mountains and the seas

I answer from the deepest part of me
From age to age you reign in Majesty
And today You're making miracles in me",Adonai
Elton John,"Levon wears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus 'cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town

Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spends his days counting
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper
To a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times
Said God is dead and the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

Levon's sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing,
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

He was born a pauper
To a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times
Said God is dead and the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan, woo
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan, woo
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon",Levon
Elton John,"Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double-barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues

Reality it seems, was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen?
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey) you know what I mean

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday they found you in the subway dead

And who could you call your friends down in Soho?
One or two middle-aged dykes in a Go-Go
And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey) oh don't you know?

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me

Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind

Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea

I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes

Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease

Elton John,"Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time i look away
I find a hiding place

If you knew me like you knew him
You would know just how i feel
Slipping through someone's fingers
Falling under someone's wheels

It's easier to walk away
Better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom
Walk away and don't look back

Never seen you looking back through
Smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to
Memories and fears

Just release me i can't take it
Can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation
Buried under someone's thumb

It's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look back

Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time i look away
I find a hiding place",Easier to Walk Away

Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough
Something tells me you're not satisfied

But you won't catch me carving up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me let's call it quits

Cause I don't want to go on with you like that

This vicious circle's getting out of hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze

After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards

And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found

I'm low as a paid assassin is
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up
You know I can't think straight no more
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of Robert Ford

Like a child when his toys have been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel

And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man

If I wasn't meant to hold you, what are these two arms for
If I can't protect you, what are these muscles for
If I can't enrich your life, I might as well be poor
If I couldn't see you naked, I might as well be blind
If I couldn't treat you right, wouldn't I be so unkind

And you were made for me
You were made for me
You weren't born to be alone
And you were made for me

You were made for me
You were made for me
Flesh and bone, it's etched in stone
That you were made for me

If I couldn't translate fantasy, imagine how I'd feel
If I couldn't hear your secret, my ears would both be sealed
And if I can't make love to you, this body has no use
If you believe I loved you, you wouldn't need no proof
And if I can't return to you, I wouldn't need my legs to run
And if I can't draw warmth from you, why do I need this sun",Made for Me

On this dirty little town
It stained your dress carved up my face
Put a wedge between our state of grace

Should never be released
We place our bets we take our pick
They wind up in the belly of the beast

And when you can't get what you want
You take anything you can
So I wear this suit of wolves at night
I slip it on how come it feels so right

I get a hungry man
When I can't get what I want
I take anything I can
I wear a suit of wolves

Just across from Friday
The weekend circus rolls
I cross my heart turn on the charm
I say my prayers between two hungry arms

There's some want rings and some just want
And those who'd like to see me dead",Suit of Wolves

I could drive to Mexico
On understanding women
Throw myself against the waves
And answer up to heaven

How come her heart's so stubborn
And what's so wrong with giving
Ask the big sky talking
About understanding women

And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door

What do you think you'll do then
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found

Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse

Not knowing darling who wears these shoes

If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love

Hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck

Was found later at four

Said she´d guessed the number

Is enraged by the sun
Caged he by the corpses
Brought forth by the dawn

Nylon knots to sway by prayer

Door on sockets yesterday

Elton John,"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside 
I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
I don't have much money but boy if I did 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live 
If I was a sculptor but then again no 
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show 
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 

My gift is my song 
And this one's for you 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 

How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross 
But the sun's been quite kind 
While I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that 
Keep it turned on 
So excuse me forgetting 

But these things I do 
You see I've forgotten 
If they're green or they're blue 
Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but 
Now that it's done 

I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world",Your Song [BBC Session] [#][*]
Elton John,"Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved

Well I walk while they talk about virtue
Just raised on my back legs and snarled
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
And tell dirty jokes as he died

But I'm damned when I really care there
For the cellar's the room in your lives
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
And close the cage doors on your life

Well I pray while you bathe in bad water
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy
Then break all the bones in my body
On the bars you can never destroy",The Cage
Elton John,"I was one as you were one
And we were two so much in love forever
I loved the white socks that you wore
But you don't wear white socks no more; now you're a woman
I joked about your turned-up nose
And criticized your school-girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you
For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely

No more to roam on the snow hills of Hinton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run

For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other
The songs still are sung
It was fun to be young
But please, don't be sad where 'ere you are

I am who I am
You are who you are
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman",First Episode at Hienton
Elton John,"Why's it never light on my lawn
Why does it rain 
And never say good-day to the new-born
On the big screen they showed us the sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal

I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools 
That were so warn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal

Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was re-born before all life could die
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I

Elton John,"No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore

And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends

Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die

Some men are better staying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose

And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in
Should I cry sanctuary

Buys the hoedown show salt and beans
Goes to church to pray for Lucifer
She milked the male population clean

So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoestrings on Louise

Come on down, come on down from the ladder
Henry, get your head, get your head out of them clouds
What she wants is to go kissing on a swineherd
You might as well kiss the boss man's cow

All those city women want to make us poor men
And this land's got the worse for the worrying
I got married at the early age of fourteen
And I've been worrying about the way you'll be loving them",No Shoe Strings on Louise

Well everybody wants her
But no one ever gets her
Well the freeway is the only way she knows

And all they say is you ain't half the man he used to be
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you
I'm not the guy, or so it seems to fill my old man's shoes

Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed

Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Elton John,"I pulled out my stage coach times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew

The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And hung my head in shame

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast

The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

And I, I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left
While a, a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune

So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

Well I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a, a true love like hers is a, a hard love to get
And I've, I've walked most all the way and I, I ain't heard her call
And I, I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all

You say it's very hard
To leave behind the life we knew

Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn

'Cause that's where they are boy, all of them
Don't seem likely I'll get friends like that again

To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring

Elton John,"I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day
Like a blind street musician I never see those who pay
It's dirty work in Birmingham
Better deal for a Sheffield man
If he can rivet then his kids can buy
Candy from the candy man

And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man with the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh you can hear him sing
Can I put you on, people can I put you on
Tell you that I love you people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on

And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne
And he don't care if it rains outside, there's coal dust on his mind
It's dirty work in Manchester
But the crew gets paid its gelt
Bang on the bell on Friday
You buys a little something for yourself

And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man in the trilby hat

Elton John,"I hope the day will be a lighter highway
For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travelers to go?

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there, then everything's all right

It seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly",Friends
Elton John,"Do you want to drive to ride mount on your pony
Loosen up my tie to help me breathe
Insisting that I pay my alimony

Come on do the roll, do the roll with me
I said honey, I said honey
I said honey, I said honey
Come on do the honey roll with me

Well I want to say that I'm your mister funky
Singing this song is taking up your time
I did the donkey now I'm your funky monkey

Elton John,"""I meant to do my work today
The brown bird sang in the apple tree
I know that's why ....
And a butterfly flittered across the field

And all the leaves were calling me
And the Buttercups nodded their smiling heads
Greeting the bees who came to call
And I asked the lizard the time of day.....""

And the wind went sighing over the land,
Tossing the grasses to and fro,
And a rainbow held out its shining handâ??

Elton John,"Cast a pebble on the water
Watch the ripples gently spreading
Tiny daughter of the Camargue
We were meant to be together
We were made for one another
In a time it takes to grow up
If only we were old enough
Then they might leave us both alone

So take my hand in your hand
Say it's great to be alive
No one's going to find us
No matter how they try
No one's going to find us
It's wonderful so wild beneath the sky

Sleeping in the open
See the shadows softly moving
Take a train towards the southlands
Our time was never better
We shall pass the sights of splendor
On the door of a new life
It had to happen soon I guess
Whether it is wrong or it is right

We learned to be so graceful
Watching wild horses running
And from those agile angels
We knew the tide was turning
For we watched as on the skyway
The herons circled slowly
While we mere mortals watched them fly
Our sleepless eyes grew heavy",Michelle's Song
Elton John,"For our world, the circle turns again
Throughout the year we've seen the seasons change
It's meant a lot to me to start anew
Oh the winter's cold but I'm so warm with you

Out there there's not a sound to be heard
And the seasons seem to sleep upon their words
As the waters freeze up with the summer's end

Oh it's funny how young lovers start as friends
Yes it's funny how young lovers start as friends",Seasons
Elton John,"If it came to pass that they should ask
What could I tell them
Would they criticize behind my back
Maybe I should let them
Oh if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

If they could face it
I could take it in their eyes
Oh I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it
Oh if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

But I know the way they want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man

The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine only when it starts to rain

And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs

For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon

I'm sorry I took your time
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
Just turn back a page
I'll waste away, I'll waste away
I'll waste away, I'll waste away
I'll waste away, I'll waste away",Goodbye
Elton John,"Boston at last, and the plane's touching down
Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn

Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage, where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town

Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock-and-roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn",Holiday Inn
Elton John,"As I awoke this evening with the smell of wood smoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted tepee
Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our warlord's dead
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns

Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine

And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears

I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die, along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run

Trampling down the prairie rose, leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me, I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead

Now there seems no reason why I should carry on
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns

And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole",Indian Sunset
Elton John,"Has anybody here seen Razor Face
I heard he's back looking for a place to lay down

In a world that you just can't see through
And it looks so cold
How does it feel to know you can't go home
How does it feel to know you can't go home

Come on Razor Face my old friend

Elton John,"We've moved on six miles from where we were yesterday
And yesterday is but a long, long ways away
So we'll camp out tonight beneath the bright starlight
And forget rotten peaches and the places we've stayed

I left from the dockland two years ago now
Made my way over on the S.S. Marie
And I've always had trouble wherever I've settled
Rotten peaches are all that I see

Rotten peaches rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun

Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one

There ain't no green grass in a U.S. state prison
There is no one to hold when you're sick for your wife
And each day out you'll pick, you'll pick rotten peaches
You'll pick rotten peaches for the rest of your life

Oh I've had me my fill of cocaine and pills
For I lie in the light of the Lord
And my home is ten thousand, ten thousand miles away
And I guess I won't see it no more

Rotten peaches rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one

Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs

Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

Somewhere on the hill
Chasing some poor criminal
And I guess they're out to kill

Oh there must be shackles on his feet
And mother in his eyes
Stumbling through the devil-dark
With the hound pack in full cry

Have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change
Don't you hear him any more

Praying Lord you got to help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend

Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam
While you lie on a cold damp ground
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
While the wardens hold you down

And you've never seen a friend in years
Oh it turns your heart to stone
You jump the walls and the dogs run free
And the grave's gonna be your home

Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change

And the hills I face are a long hard climb
I just sit cross legged with my old guitar
Ooh, it kind of makes me feel like a rock and roll star

Well, it makes me laugh Lord it makes me cry
And I think for once, let me just get high
Let me get electric put a silk suit on
Turn my old guitar into a tommy gun

And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
Every kid alive gonna know my name
An overnight phenomenon like there's never been
A motivated supersonic king of the scene

I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
I'm gonna be a teenage idol no matter how long it takes
You can't imagine what it means to me
I'm gonna grab myself a place in history
A teenage idol
That's what I'm gonna be

Well, life is short and the world is rough
And if you're gonna boogie, boy, you got to be tough
Nobody knows if I'm dead or alive
I just drink myself to sleep each night

And so I pray to the teenage god of rock
If I make it big let me stay on top
You got to cut me loose from this one-room dive
Put me on the ladder keep this boy alive

Locked in my cellar full of cheap red wine

Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the ways
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
That he can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind

Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind

Let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day

I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me from
This aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
That he can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind

Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very, so very far behind",Skyline Pigeon [Piano Version][*]
Elton John,"I was sitting in the classroom
Trying to look intelligent
In case the teacher looked at me
She was long and she was lean
She's a middle-aged dream
And that lady means the whole world to me

It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration
For my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane

Oh teacher I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher I need you

I have to write a letter
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention
On some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees

So I'm sitting in the classroom
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances
I've got Erroll Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggone thing

Oh teacher I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher I need you

With a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown

Well you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough

Think all of us boys here are homespun and green
But that's wrong my friend so get this through your head
We're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red

So it's ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die
Our American home was clean till you came
And kids still respected the president's name

And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug crazy songs
Goddamit you're all gonna die

How dare you sit there and drink all our beer
Oh it's made for us workers who sweat, spit and swear
The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you
With your communistic politics and them negro blues

Well I'm gonna quit talking and take action now
Run all of you fairies clean out of this town
Oh I'm dog tired of watching you mess up our lives
Spending the summertime naturally high

Elton John,"You wore a little cross of gold around your neck
I saw it as you flew between my reason
Like a raven in the night time when you left
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
You touched it and you wore it
And you kept it in your pillow all the same

My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird

The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
In the foreign field of death
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Instead you moved away",High-Flying Bird

In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel
Killed him in anger, a force he couldn't handle

I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over Danny Bailey

Without Danny Bailey we're gonna have to break up our stills
So mark his grave well 'cause Kentucky loved him
Born and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him, and he
Found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by

When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well, I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well, you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear

Rub her down, scrub her back

That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself

Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied

Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon
Oh this song's got no title just words and a tune

Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind

If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Hunting the horny back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies

It's enough to wake the dead

And dancing on my head

It's no good living in the sun

In that erotic way

Come on Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way

Come on Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way

Let the ladies and the gentlemen
Be as rude as they like
On the beaches, oh in the jungle
Where the people feel alright

So do it Jamaica yeah
Got plenty for you and me

Elton John,"Showboat coming up the river
See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees

My little boat - she rocks easy
I've been catching catfish in the creek all day
Oh, and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way

Dixie Lily, chugging like a grand old lady
Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun
Plowing through the water with your whistles blowing
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run

Papa says that I'm a dreamer
Says them 'squitas bit me one too many times
Oh, but I never get lonesome living on the river
Watching old Lily leave the world behind",Dixie Lily
Elton John,"I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can't find
Oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way feel
Don't discard me baby don't
Just because you think I mean you harm
Just because you think I mean you harm, oh
But these cuts I have, cuts I have
They need love
They need love, they need love to help them heal

Elton John,"As I lay dreaming in my bed
Across the great divide
I thought I heard the trawler boats
Returning on the tide
And in this vision of my home
The shingle beach did ring
I saw the lights along the pier
That made my senses sing

Oh oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn´t match the sweet sights
Of my Grimsby
Oh England you´re fair
But there´s none to compare with my Grimsby
Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbour
And in your wild sands from boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers

Take me back you rustic town
I miss your magic charm
Just to smell your candy floss
Or drink in the Skinners Arms
No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
Of your pies and peas
I want to ride your fairground
Take air along the quay",Grimsby
Elton John,"Tune in, wouldn't it be something
Rumours spreading into panic
I've seen movements in the clearing
Someone sent you something satanic

I have to leave you, radar's calling
Outside somebody landed
Crazy wavelengths leave you helpless
Oh don't forget me I'm so stranded

I wouldn't fool you but I've seen the saucers
So many times I'm almost in tune
Watching them flying in formation
Thinking how I could be so immune

I've seen them I've been there with them
I can tell you all you want to know
Something touched me and I was only sleeping
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go

Stars climbing into their planets
Systems won, controlled from birth
Empty living on this highway
Can you see me mother earth

It's so endless whirling onwards
Wonder what's cooking at home tonight
Maybe if I promise not to say a word
They can get me back before the morning light",I've Seen the Saucers
Elton John,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He's a pin ball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
S'got such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?'

He ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
'N' never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball.

I thought I was
The Bally table king.
But I just handed
My pin ball crown to him.

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best.
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf dumb and blind kind
Sure plays a mean pin ball!!!",Pinball Wizard [*]
Elton John,"I don't want to wake you
But I'd like to tell you that I love you
That the candlelight fell like a crescent 
Upon your feather pillow

For there's more ways than one
And the ways of the world are a blessing
For when Pinky's dreaming
She owes the world nothing
And her silence keeps us guessing

Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July
Quilted and timeless, seldom denied
The trial and the error of my master plan
Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands

You don't want to tell me
But somehow you've guessed that I know
Oh, when dawn came this morning
You discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul

And there's breakfast in bed on a tray

Elton John,"Say what you will but I'm a stinker
I come crawling up out of my hole
Dirt in my toes, dirt up my nose
I'm a perfect curse to pest control

Seeds and weeds and muddy meals
Crawling around the earth
Down in the ground where the sun don't pound
I hibernate in English turf

Better believe it, I'm a stinker
Burning vermin stink
Watch me get as high as a heat wave, honey
Tell me what you hound dogs think

Set in my styles with a beady eye
I got connections with the underground
Call me a common rodent boy
Sitting here safe and sound

Acting like the ace of spades

Elton John,"""An extremely quiet child"" they called you in your school report
""He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught""
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died

At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
""Oh, he's unconcerned with competition he never cares to win""
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son

""Now you'll never get to Heaven"" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
""Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed""
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said ""His brain's just snapped"" then someone called the police
You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground

Promising to hurt no one, providing they were still
A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
Oh your childhood cried out in your head ""they mean to do you harm""

""Don't ever ride on the devil's knee"" Mama said
Remember mama said
Ticking, ticking
""Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread""
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male Caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule

Oh they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
""Throw out your gun, walk out slow just keep your hands held high""
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law

""You've slept too long in silence"" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
""Crazy boy, you'll only wind up with strange notions in your head""

It's all worth it

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening

Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
I'm not sure `cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find

Elton John,"There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease streaked window of an all night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks file in from the street

'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am, then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose, is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead, if you haven't yet died

Elton John,"I'm going on the circuit, I'm doing all the clubs
And I really need a song boys to stir those workers up
And get their wives to sing it with me just like in the pubs
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney

Oh could you knock a line or two together for a friend
Sentimental tear inducing with a happy end
And we need a tune to open our season at Southend
Can you help us

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

I like the warm blue flame, the hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles and forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run from the tin pan alley twins

And there's a chance that one day you might write a standard lads
So churn them out quick and fast and we'll still pat your backs
`Cause we need what we can get to launch another dozen acts
Are you working

Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for Corn Flakes and classics

Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and ""Hey mom, do the papers say anything good
Are there chances in life for little dirt cowboys
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods""

The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima donna lord you really should have been there
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer
And I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor

And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye bye

I never realized the passing hours
Of evening showers
A slip noose hanging, in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it! listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank god my music's still alive

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear

You nearly had me roped and tied

Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your h.p. demands forever

Mmm he's blind and he's old
And there's a bottle that rolls down the road
Me I'm young and I'm so wild
And I still feel the need
Of your apron strings once in a while
For there's taxi cabs hooting
But I can't be foot-loose forever
My suitcase it's a cheap one
My darling she's a dear one
My head's feeling light as a feather

Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows

Part of me asked the young man for the time
With a cool vacant stare, of undue concern
He said nine
It's not so bad but I really do love the land
And rather all this than those diamante lovers
In Hyde Park holding hands
Blowing heat through my fingers
Trying to kill off this cold
Will the street kids remember
Can I still shoot a fast cue
Has this country kid still got his soul

Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows

Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows",Tell Me When the Whistle Blows
Elton John,"Snow, cement and ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters
Tracking down the hours

But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl
With the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel

Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no no no

Junk, angel, this closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription
For a brand new heart attack

But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl
With the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel

Watch them dig their graves

Maybe steak and eggs

Making up your bed
Lazy days, my razor blade
Could use a better edge

Of our new found craft
I know you and you know me
It's always half and half

And we were oh oh, so you know
Not the kind to dawdle
Will the things we wrote today
Sound as good tomorrow
We will still be writing
In approaching years
Stifling yawns on Sundays
As the weekends disappear

We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
To instigate the structure of another line or two
'Cause writing's lighting up
And I like life enough, to see it through

And you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare

Well she looked at me
And I could see
That before too long I fell in love with her
I couldn't dance with another
When I saw here standing there

Well my heart went boom
As I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight

Elton John,"Yeah, I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five
The headlines screamed that I was still alive
I couldn't understand it
I thought I died last night

Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance
Just to dig the local sounds

When along came a señorita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me my the arm

And he said, ""grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home.""

Staring at the same four walls

How I've struggled for my money
Sweated blood to get us by, yeah
Well I'm tired of it honey
Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while

All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife

I never seem to look at you
And see that somewhere underneath
A pair of tired eyes are crying out
Well you know I work hard all day long
Let me kiss you once with meaning
Just to kill this nagging doubt
Well you don't deny I do you proud
And you expect me to be tired
You say there's no future in our lives

Elton John,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

I think we'll be outnumbered

Why I'm a juvenile delinquent
In an East End gang

And if you think you've seen gasoline burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, tell yourself it's good to be, it's good to be alive

It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town

I've been bottled and been brained
Squealers can't be trusted
If we fight tonight
You can bet we'll all be busted

Honey when you knock on my door
I gave you my key

Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

Elton John,"I wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight
Whose head rests upon the bed
Could it be a close friend I knew so well
Who seems to be so close to you instead
Close to you instead

I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay

And if I shower around 3 a.m.
It's just to wash away
The trace of a love unwanted
Oh in the times I went astray
The times I went astray

So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen",Between Seventeen and Twenty
Elton John,"Crime in the streets
I read about it everyday in the papers

Hustled to get it
To get it together
Down on the jive talk
Down on the weather

But I know that you all want something

Elton John,"Sober in the morning light
Things look so much different
To how they looked last night
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed
Like flags of many nations flying high above her head

The cellophane still on the flowers
The telegram still in her hand
As whispers circulate all day
Their back-stage baby princess passed away

And you can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
And you can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings
Cause she'll soar like a hawk when she flies
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies

Promises of no more lies
Fell flat upon an empty stage
Before the audience arrived
A return in time to the cheaper seats
She never knew what lay beneath
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets

Let down before the final curtain
A shallow heart that left her cold
She left in rouge upon the mirror
A circled kiss to the faithful who'd miss her",Cage the Songbird
Elton John,"The last I heard of you
You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean
So imagine my surprise to see you very much alive
In the English rain again

And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it

Beyond a shadow of a doubt
You're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
Do you really change me, or am I going crazy

We'd kill out hunting danger
And we were alien to all outsiders
We had no desire to talk to strangers",Chameleon
Elton John,"On a bench, on the beach
Just before the sun had gone
I tried to reach you
Plain faced and falling fast
You looked so vacant like an empty shell
Whose life had passed upon the ocean

Before light shook the sky
Down by the docks I saw
The masts unfolding
Don't turn away, please understand
It's a life and a living
And a way to keep the wolves away
From hungry hands, from hungry hands

Crazy water
Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
Dangerous dreaming
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
Oh we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water

Tangled lives, lonely wives
Shoreline widows pray
For the souls of missing whalers

Where nothing lives between us
Just the breakers on the ocean

Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn, born uneven

Because they made him and they'll waste him
And I don't believe that I want to watch them

But his face has changed, he's not the same no more

He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized in the wallet size

To peanuts from the lion's share",Idol

What's he waiting for
If He can't hear the children
Then he must see the war
But it seems to me
That he leads his lambs
To the slaughter house
And not the promised land

Dying for causes
They don't understand
We've been taking their futures
Right out of their hands
They need the handouts
To hold back the tears

And it was just like Stagger Lee
Dolly Summers was a simple girl 
From a mid-west family
With a stucco home and her own Mustang
And a charge account at Sears
She had everything that a girl could want
To live happy for the rest of her years

But the thing that she wanted most of all
Was the thing that she had lost
To the arms of a downtown blackjack hustler
By the name of Candyfloss
They'd skipped town on a late-night train
Heading for the West
Dolly slipped behind the wheel of her Mustang
With a piece between her breast

She put a pistol in her shoulder holster
She took her car up from Santa Fe
Yesterday morning she was washing dishes
Now she's hunting down a runaway
Don't judge a man by a misdemeanor
You may be sorry when his light goes out
Don't put that pistol in your shoulder holster

Or a night of bad TV
They should have had a picture of Dolly's face
As she drove across country
With daggers drawn for her fallen man
And venom in her heart
It was nearly dawn when she caught them up
Making out in a picnic park

But the thing that shook her rigid
As she fumbled for her gun
Was the state of the man that she'd married once
And thought of as the only one
And as she looked back on the chances
That she'd passed up at home
Well, she quietly dumped her pistol in a ditch
And she headed home alone",Shoulder Holster

To go on living, to go on living, living life this way

And I don't know what the time is
Or what the next line is
Or how you're going to take the news

Passed like a season
Erasing a passion to sin
For no one knew better than the tealeaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Were just one step ahead of the wind

And the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me
Was a song that I'd heard in the past
For I had an audience somewhere inside you

Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name 

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you 
But I was just a kid

The toughest role you ever played

And pain was the price you paid

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life

Elton John,"Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours

So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks

He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more

Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours

Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper",Big Dipper

Elton John,"When it's springtime down in Georgia
It's winter time up in Maine
You can go from snow to sunshine
If you board a southbound train
You get used to taking orders
But it's sometimes kind of rough
I got everything that a man could need
But it still ain't quite enough

Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone

When it's nighttime down in Georgia
It's daytime in L.A.
Where they never seem to do much
But they sure got lots to say
The times are changing down in Georgia
Though not always for the best
Give me thirty five good acres lord
And let progress take the rest

Talking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before they're gone

I sometimes feel that life has passed me by
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands

Elton John,"This house that I live in has no reason
This house that I sleep in has no purpose
It has a bed and a few old chairs
Three flights up, two flights of stairs
But it has no reason

Then someone shot through the tire swing
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings
To a dying season

And I cry at night when the lights go out
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies
And when the lights go out it's thought to survive

This man holds a hand that shows a tremble
This man that I live in bears his faults
He has a heart and a well worn soul
Ten years a slave to rock and roll
But he has to tremble

For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn
And just like your love that's come and gone
It goes on breathing",I Cry at Night [*]
Elton John,"I got feet sticking out of my shoes
I got heat more than I can use
I got love, I got all I need
I got soles that are wearing thin

I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, long as I got your love

I got love, I do the best I can
I got bills piling up in the hall
I got paint peeling off the wall
I got you, I'm a happy man",I Don't Care
Elton John,"It ain't gonna be easy from now on
You've been messing around while I've been gone
But sometimes telling the truth can be unkind
Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind

It ain't gonna be easy I can tell
Just how empty I'm feeling you know damn well
I'm telling you it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out honey you're playing with my heart

It ain't gonna be easy that's for sure
Changing things back the way they were before
Once you've lifted the lid on such pain
It ain't easy to put it back again

It ain't gonna be easy to forget
You've been seeing a man that I ain't met
I'm telling you that it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out baby, you're playing with my heart

It ain't gonna be so easy this time around
Turning back the clock on what's gone down
Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand
You gotta play your cards or fold a losing hand

And it ain't gonna be easy that's no lie
But if you're willing to try it so am I
It ain't gonna be so easy from the start
You better look out darling, you're playing with my heart",It Ain't Gonna Be Easy
Elton John,"I've been blown away like a printed page
That reads, ""You're lovesick""
Headline news had me so abused
But I was lovesick

You never tried although I sacrificed
My weaknesses for you
I could have understood, I could have read your looks
I should have known better too

I've been holding out but it's time to shout
You know I'm lovesick
A helping hand for a dying man
Who says, ?He's lovesick?

I can't explain why, I'll never change
This sickness deep inside
I've been doctored down, I've had the nurse around
I've heard too many lies",Lovesick [*]
Elton John,"The fuse is set and checked once more
Then left beside a back street door
And in the cold grey light
Someone sees a shadow run through the night and out of sight
They hide inside a smoke filled room
To hear at last the blast of doom
And so the deed is done
They listen to the final countdown begun, three, two, one

Madness, it's a kind of madness
Tat turns good men bad
And we're helpless caught up in the madness
Of a world gone mad

The roar of fire rings out on high
And flames light up the black night sky
A child screams out in fear
A hopeless cry for help but no one is near enough to hear

As walls collapse and timbers flare
The smell of death hangs in the air
When help at last arrives
They try to fight the flame but nothing survives of all those lives

And it's madness, every time a victim dies
There is madness, burning in a blind man's eyes
And it's madness, hidden in the hate and pain
There is madness, burning in a wild man's brain
And it's madness, every time the bullets start
There is madness, burning in a poor man's heart

And it's madness, something that we can't control
There is madness, burning in a madman's soul
Madness",Madness
Elton John,"It's paradise here where the sun meets the sea
There's nothing to fear and so much to be
But soon I must go, say goodbye to it all
That homeland of mine is beginning to call

Goodbye doesn't mean this has to be the end
Fading dreams grow cold as ice
And I got a feeling we will meet again
When we return to paradise

The wind in our hair and the sun in our eyes
There's no need for tears and no time for lies
So reach out your hand and I'll reach out my heart
Remember me while we are apart

I'm heading homeward
Leaving sunshine and heading for rain
But we'll return to paradise again",Return to Paradise
Elton John,"I'm still in love with you oh shooting star
And when I start to wonder where you are
There you are, there you are, shooting star

You may have seen me at the early show
I sat and watched you from the second row
Oh you were mine long ago way back when
Even then we both knew you'd go far oh shooting star

And with the spotlight shining in your eyes
It's sometimes hard to find your way
But maybe some night you might
Think of me, shooting star

A high-wire act above the center ring
While the audience is wondering
If we'll make it back

Two people up on a wire
Overhead and under fire
While the audience inquire
If it's just a knack

Strangers, after all, we find we're strangers
After all this time
We've made the long and the lonely climb
And now we've reached the part
Where we find we're strangers
We were strangers from the start

Two people caught in the tide
On the edge of love and pride
And both afraid to approach the side
And fall again

I'm chasing the crown till he bites the apple
I was licking my lips till his Son come down
I'm chasing the crown, the crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown

To look up one another one more time
Tracking down the zip codes
Sealing down those envelopes
Lack of communication on the telephone line

But don't judge us by distance
Or the difference between us
Try to look at it with an open mind
For where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

Well we've both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon
Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway
Washing down the dirt roads
Hosing off our dirty clothes
Coming to terms with the times that we couldn't but we tried

Where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

Door to door they would whisper, will they ever get together
Their rooms are different temperatures I'm told
There's a change in their thinking
And their habits seem uneven
But together the two of them were mining gold",Two Rooms at the End of the World

I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had
A touch too much of white powder

I'm in love with a wild white lady
She's as sweet as the stories say
White powder white lady
You're one and the same
Come on down to my house won't you
And hit this boy again

Shock waves to a tired brain
Sends that hungry lady to my door again

Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn

Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road",Goodbye Yellow Brick Road
Elton John,"When the shrill winds are screaming
And the evening is still
Lady Samantha glides over the hill
In a long satin dress that she wears every day
Her home is the hillside, her bed is the grave

Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears

The tales that I told round the fire every night
Are out of proportion and none of them right
She is harmless and empty of anything bad
For she once had something that most of you have",Lady Samantha
Elton John,"Ever since I was a young boy, I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean.
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard, he's got such a supple wrist.
How do you think he does it? I don't know.
What makes him so good?

Well, he ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.
Don't see lights-a-flashin',
He plays by a sense of smell.
Always has a replay, 'n never tilts at all.
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now, I've always been the champ.
I know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand.

Pinball!  Let's play!
Pinball!  Let's play!
Pinball!  Let's play!
Pinball!  Let's play!

Even on my usual table, he can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers, I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard, he's got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard, his score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard, the world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!  He's scoring more!

I thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
To him!  To him!",Pinball Wizard
Elton John,"If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well don't you try to stop me
I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned

Well that's my Rock-and-roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well everybody wants her
But no one ever gets her
Well the freeway is the only way she knows

Well if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two wheel combination
And I swear it's going to be the death of me",Rock & Roll Madonna
Elton John,"Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
And senorita play guitar, play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through

You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on

Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through

And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on",Sixty Years On
Elton John,"Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the way
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind

Just let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day

I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun",Skyline Pigeon
Elton John,"I'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned

If the boys all behave themselves here
Well, there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh, the prices I charge here will see you alright

So, she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game, oh

Forget us we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said

So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game, oh",Sweet Painted Lady
Elton John,"I recall how it used to be
In my younger days
I built a wall all around my heart
To keep the pain away
I built it tall, and I built it wide
I left no room for doubt
Your love still found its way inside
And couldn't get back out

I'm breaking down the barriers
Making up my mind
I'm breaking down the barriers of time
I'm taking down the barriers
And loving what I find
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
Between your love and mine

I guess you know you were not the first
You may not be the last
But you have shown me a better way
And now I'm learning fast
You gotta go where the feeling flows
I take it while it's hot
You gotta give if you want to get
And I want all you got",Breaking Down Barriers
Elton John,"Staring all alone
And your grace and style
Cut me to the bone
With your razor blade smile
I watched you playing pool
It's all around the school that I love you

I love your gypsy hair
And dark brown eyes
Always unprepared
For your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you

If you only knew
What I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed
To say your name
It's hard to grin and bear
When you're standing there
My lips are dry
I catch your eye and look away

Sitting in my room
I've got it bad
Crying for the moon
They think I'm mad
They say it isn't real
But I know what I feel and I love you

But I would give my life
For a single night beside you",Elton's Song
Elton John,"I read about how you're slow with the truth
Like any old Aesop's Fable
But when you're turtle-esque, I'm a hare's breath
Into payment under the table
But some journalist got his mug shot kit
And his briefcase on his lap
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B.
And all that political crap

Cause I've seen your fascist faces
On the cover of the national papers
Staring out in black and white
From the tall gray walls on the other side
When I see your fascist faces
Then I know I've had enough
Trying to trace it or erase it
Is it foolproof or a bluff?

If the boy had been blessed, he'd have been arrested
On a charge of wearing red shoes
But if your pants are blue, you got nothing to lose
It'll make you a patriot through and through",Fascist Faces
Elton John,"Being wiry and thinking loudly
About the things sent to make you move
You can't help it, there's no one in the world
Knows you just, just the way you do
So we keep darting through the holes
As the hunter and the fox
Run the gauntlet's savage road

Winter's heavy and partly cloudy
And the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few
Bit if you're wiley, you will leave them lying
Snared up in the traps that they set for you
And it's an evergreen affair
As temptation taunts the fox
Into the hunter's waiting lair

And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
Cause I am the fox, like it or not
I'm always gonna be there running over the rock
Yes I am the fox, a fascinating cross
Of sharp as a whip and tough as an ox
Yes I am the fox

It may sound crazy but it's often lonely
And the restless heart should be captured once in a while
Then you can use them, and you often fool them
Into believing whatever you desire
So I'll keep moving through the night
The hunter and the hunted
On their designated flights",The Fox
Elton John,"I've got a good by-line, they all know my name
The queen of the sly line, I feed on your fame
But I got my heart in the right place; it's all in the game

If you're doing fine, boy, you got my vote
But step out of line, boy, and I'll go for your throat
'Cause I got my heart in the right place, so give me a quote

I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You'll open your heart like a friend
I'll make up some answers you won't recognize
The you I create with my pen
But my heart's in the right place now and again

My heart's in the right place, know what I mean?
My heart's in the right place, on page seventeen

I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You don't understand, but you will
I'll make up some answers, cut you down to size
Then I move in for the kill
But my heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place; it's part of the skill

Heart's in the right place
I'm gonna destroy you and your reputation
Don't count for nothing with me
'Cause I'm an old bitch, you see, and my heart's in the right place
Don't you agree?

Heart's in the right place, just wait and see
Heart's in the right place, don't you agree?",Heart in the Right Place
Elton John,"Just like a broken marriage, when two people just don't care
Like when the cupboard is empty or there's no food in the Frigidaire
I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

How come it gets so disturbing when two ships pass in the storm?
Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born?
I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

You don't deserve that treatment; I can't pretend I was that nice
I'm no E-ticket ride to Disneyland, I'm no cushy first class flight
I'm a day behind your restless wings
You - you'd rather have the wealth of kings
Me - I'd rather be on the heels of the wind",Heels of the Wind
Elton John,"Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum
Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
Our code of living meant little to others
The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs

But the red lights where the catfights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium

Just like a hustler when they look attractive
It's nothing more than a slap on the back
The price tag of being just a little bit different
The first rule to learn is to keep your own distance",Just Like Belgium
Elton John,"They must have loved each other once
But that was many years ago
And by the time I came along
Things were already going wrong
I felt the pain in their pretense
The side they tried hard not to show
But through the simple eyes of youth
It wasn't hard to see the truth

[Chorus]
And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears

[Chorus]

We used to love each other once
With all the passion we possessed
But people change as time goes by
Some feelings grow while others die
But if we learn from what we see
And face the truth while we still can
Then though the passion may be gone
Some kind of love can still live on

[Chorus]",Nobody Wins
Elton John,"All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force

All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise",All Quiet on the Western Front
Elton John,"I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
And if it's all the same maybe we should part
And I'm singing do do do
I'm singing do do do

You had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt
I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out

Oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly
Driving me insane
Oh oui baby

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise

Elton John,"I got home today
Took a look around
Trying to find that girl of mine
She could not be found

All her things were gone
She just left a note
It don't take no mastermind
To figure what she wrote

And she said
""Dear John, I'm moving on;
By this time I'm gonna be long gone.
Dear John, c'est la vie.
Dear John, so long;
You've seen the last of me.""

I don't want her back
I won't even try
This time ain't just au revoir
This time it's goodbye

We could not go on
Living like we were
I was just about to write
A Dear John note to her

By this time I'm gonna be long gone.
Dear John, c'est la vie.
Dear John, so long;
You've seen the last of me.""",Dear John

I am your robot, I am your robot
I am your robot, man

There was springtime in his heart
He couldn't wait to tell me
How he'd pulled our lives apart
And the letter from your lawyer
Lies unopened on the tray
I may get around to reading it later today

Walking round the lonely rooms
I see everything the same
But suddenly it matters
What was purchased in my name
Whether this or that was paid for
Belongs to me or you
Can the seven years together be divided by two

It says something for the legal boys
But nothing much for us
That all we had together
Is so quickly ended thus

And you and I have lost

Oh, I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
I've slapped a worried frown on that evil smile
I've been taken down by a spiteful child
I've turned the tables 'round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child

You'd better be ready to run now I've got you under the gun

Touched by love until it made us cry
How our hearts could fly without wings

Oh, won't somebody tell me
Tell me, where have all the good times gone?
Say that you remember
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs
Won't somebody tell me
Where have all the good times gone?

Crazy summers that would never end

While the flame still burns for you

Elton John,"I found a black beret on the street today
It was lying in the gutter all torn
There's a white flag flying on a tall building
But the kids just watch the storm

Their dirty faces pressed on the windows
Shattered glass before their eyes
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway
Where the sniper sleeps at night

No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven

There are many graves by a cold lake
As the beds were when your babies are born
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin
But the kids just watch the storm

Until he killed it with his claws
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing
Before they go to war",Cry to Heaven

He was my song

Not to return
When summer burned the earth again

Oh
Oh
Cultivate the freshest flower
This garden ever grew

She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather-man of words
But I could never shoot down

The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
Hmm, In the foreign field of death
""Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful?"" is all I heard you say
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Instead you moved away

My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather-man of words
But I could never shoot down

Elton John,"You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love your love protects my fears

And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold

Did you paint your smile on, well I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you

You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove",I Need You to Turn To
Elton John,"I can see by your eyes you must be lying
When you think I don't have a clue
Baby you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too

The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
Well their actions become so absurd

So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too

So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting

It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blue print for all of your 'b' films
Because I've seen that movie too

The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
All their actions become so absurd

So keep your auditions for somebody

It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes

And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our empty sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it

Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me

Elton John,"We still sit at separate tables
And we sleep at different times
And the warm wind in the palm trees
Hasn't helped to change our minds

It was the lure of the tropics
That I thought might heal the scars
Of a love burned out by silence
In a marriage minus heart

And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year

The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year

I dreamed of love in a better climate
And for what it's really worth
I put faith in the star we followed
To this Caribbean surf

But there's an icy fringe on everything
And I cannot find the lines

Why the frost in the summertime",Cold as Christmas (In the Middle of the Year)

Since Crystal came between us
The knots of friendship seem to be untied
And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie
She can swing us both forever

And if she leaves me handle her with care
Don't hurt little Crystal
And if she calls you long distance just be there

The world is your oyster, you're a pearl
But he's a jewel and my friend
I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl
Oh Crystal

You're stronger than me but I'm sure
That the fight would fall to no one

And it breaks my heart to see us go this far
We're just captives in our separate cells
And without her there's no peace behind these bars",Crystal
Elton John,"He said, I want to grow up
And look like Robert Mitchum
And I hope that when I'm gone
There'll be some say that I miss him

In the frame around his picture

And he's one more arrow flying through the air
One more arrow landing in a shady spot somewhere
Where the days and nights blend into one
And he can always feel the sun
Through the soft brown earth that holds him 
Forever always young

He could have been a boxer
But the fight game seemed so dirty
We argued once he knocked me down
And he cried when he thought he'd hurt me
Strictly from the old school
He was quiet about his pain
And if one in ten could be that brave
I would never hate again

But he was sitting in a den of thieves
Looking for the great awakening
Trying to find a way to leave
But that's when he got religion
And the light went on inside
He said somebody up there likes me
Now he's working for the holy guide

He got drunk but he don't remember
That he'd been drinking in a bar downtown
When he thought he heard a choir of angels
Singing in the Tiki Lounge
And that's when he got religion
From no salesman on TV
Just a tap on the shoulder in the parking lot
He still drinks but he does believe

Religion, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

Or hang out with the crowd
Sitting on the stoop like a little girl

You cook much better on a lower flame
You burn much better when the sun goes down

And heaven can wait
But you ought to be a saint
I got your very best intentions
Helping me along
And if I ever fail to mention
You were an overnight sensation
Well take it from me

I believe you were a new arrival
On the fast train passing through

To sweeten up the witch's brew

Instead of rolling over you remained the same
You took the whole world by surprise",Saint

I was always there in the thick of things
I always had the heart of every woman on a string
The danger zone shone from my eyes
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile

It's not the night reaching in and touching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be

It's not the light shining in and catching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
But time has come and cast a spell on me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be

And now I know what lonely means
I used to give so little and gain everything
The darkest part of every day
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away

Can't say I blame them all for being hurt
After all, I treated each and every one like dirt

Tell me where living starts

And lovers leap off burning buildings
Waking up on a sky high wire
Desperation leaves us clinging
On the edge of a house on fire

Lovers leap off burning buildings

Touched your lips but never mine

Lovers leap off burning buildings
No room for conversation

Fall in pieces from our faces

This ain't any old western honey
It's the twentieth century now
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy
And he's hurt her then I want to know how

Did he shoot her with his compromise
Like a heart attack he can paralyze
Or did he hang her in a noose
On the telephone line

Did he shoot her with a forty five
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes
Oh did he shoot that girl
That used to be mine

Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses

He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit
Armed with a couple of guns

Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon
Behind a counter she stares out the window
Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon

She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
She'd smoke like a gun if it meants she might wind up -

In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door

In neon, in neon...

Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
Cut into fashion that flashs above 'em in neon
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon

She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For a shot at the title, she'd slip into something
She'd smoulder like ashes if it meant she might wind up -

One, you're my friend; and two, it's hurting me

Well, it ain't my job to rain on your parade
But if the chips were down, you'd do the same for me

In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""

Give it all you've got `cause I'm all dug in
Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin
Winner takes all, let the best man win
And we call it an act of war

Well I'm a man of convenience I work a long hard day
After twelve long hours ain't I got the right to play
If living together is getting in the way
Then I call that an act of war

Well if that's your game then honey two can play
I'm going on the town tonight and have some fun my way
Ain't no way baby this girl's gonna stay
I call it, I call it an act of war

And it looks like time ain't been on our side
If we could turn the clock back
We might survive this act of war",Act of War
Elton John,"Well I'm keeping off the streets since you came to town
Since you claimed my heart from the lost and found
I have said goodbye to my fooling around
Now you and me babe we got candy by the pound
You and me babe we got candy by the pound

Well I never knew it could feel so good
Be the king of the hill in my neighbourhood
Rain on my roof what a sweet sound
Oh with you underneath it's like candy by the pound
With you underneath it's like candy by the pound

You can tell everybody that this girl of mine
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound

Oh no what's come over me
If I am dreaming then let me sleep
Oh wow I'm heaven bound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound

Now I'm ducking in the alley of common sense
Hiding from the claws of my old girl friend
She's screaming murder beating my door down
While I'm right behind it I'm eating candy by the pound
I'm right behind it eating I'm candy by the pound",Candy by the Pound
Elton John,"Well you come on like a comet, ideas in your head
Starving for affection, waiting to be fed

Crazy like a full moon, eyes open wide
Taking in everything you need to stay alive

Who leads who, who knows where
If you leave me now will I see you again

I'm telling you love bites
Like a satellite
Going round and round
It's something, something you can't fight
Oh in the daylight
And even in the dark night
I want you to surround me
Surround me like a satellite

Oh you move like a shadow of your own design
Do you want to trap me in between the lines

I don't walk on water if you think I can
If you want a miracle call up a Superman

Are we there
Is this love
Is this a space race
That we're both part of",Satellite

You can take it all
I'll put my money where my mouth is
Put your suitcase in the hall

Oh you robbed me blind
Of what little hope remained
You put a gun to my head
A bullet through my brain

You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains

You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains

Just as long as you're around
We live on borrowed time
I'll put my money where my mouth is

The dangers buried below
The secrets that you keep",Shoot Down the Moon
Elton John,"You say today was not so easy
Pressure tends to get the best of you
Well don't let them break your spirit
Keep the faith and you will come on through

And I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands

And slip into my soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
Never take it off
And baby if the seam's rough
And honey if the skin's soft
You and me we go together
Oh like a soul glove

Look at me don't you believe me
Cheating hangs a noose around your neck
To shave in someone else's mirror
Is one desire I haven't dreamed of yet

Chances are you'll never leave this town

That you're too young
How, how I've ached to hold you
But you're too young

If we don't buy what's right or wrong
Then we are sinners
We were never two to tag along

That you're too young
And how many jealous hands would love to hold you
Cause you're too young

Well you're too young to love me
And I'm too old for you
At least that's what they tell us
It's in their book of rules

Elton John,"It's a hot summer night in the blackboard jungle
Crime sits heavy on the city shoulder
Can't get no work, I can't get a job
I just sit and play my radio in the parking lot

Well they're breaking down doors in foreign countries
Everybody thinks somebody's hiding something
There's talk on the street and the nation is worried
But you can't talk back when you're dead, when you're dead and buried

And everybody's restless
Everybody's scared
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
Everybody's restless

Well we could be children from the way we're acting
We feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action
We just breed and we lose our nerve
And there's bombs going off in every corner of the world

I get the wake up call
Let that sucker jingle-jangle
Ring right off the wall

I'm too tired to work
Tied one on with a friend last night
And wound up losing my shirt

I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero

It's all just Greek to me

You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

So shut that door when the baby cries
Keep me well fed, give me warm bread
Lay my body on a feather bed

And spoil me, Angeline, get to work

Maybe someday, some way
Somewhere in the future there's more pay
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash
Peel me a grape and fetch my stash

And bite me, Angeline, let me use
You like a sex machine, Angeline

You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans

Well, I talk tough, I act rough
Lay still honey, I can't get enough
And keep your nose clean, let me be
On your knees when you speak to me

And trust me, Angeline and talk real dirty
And I'll make you scream, Angeline

Elton John,"It's so hard to say goodbye
When there's nothing left to give
When this house is just a hill of bones
Where you and I once lived

If we put it back together
By the skin of our teeth
You'd still pull it all apart
Bit by bit, piece by piece

And I'll go it alone, call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you

There's no passion alive
When you count your phony schemes
And the cars you drive to buy your friends
They don't ever come back clean

If the cards on the table
Always turn up spades
The cards that always cheat the hearts
The spades you play just dug my grave

And I'll go it alone, call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you

And I'll go it alone, call this house my home
I'm gonna build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you

Oh, I'll go it alone, call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
I'll build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you

I count the days that we're apart
I sleep alone when you're away
No sense in saying I wish you'd stay

It's all the same, you never change
You come and go just like the rain
I pray each day that you are gone
This time it won't be so long

Your gypsy heart will never find
Any arms as warm as mine
And gypsy, when we meet again
I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms
Oh, you gypsy heart

Your gypsy heart can always call
When your back's against the wall
And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start
You never left me on my own

Elton John,"You say that all you want are the simple things
Long walks on lonely beaches, guitars with nylon strings
But underneath you'd rather leap through a hoop of fire

You shy away from lips that want, that want to kiss you
Tongue-tied on formal evenings, wealth don't impress you
But if you ask me, you like the heat in a hoop of fire?

And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire?
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire

No late nights making love in secret places
You feel pressure all around you, mistrust in strangers faces
But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire

And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire?
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire

But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire

And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire?

Elton John,"Without you I no longer swim upstream
Where are you when I try to fill the spaces in between
The red letter days and all the pain
And while I remain shipwrecked everything has changed

And I fall apart
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart

Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me
I don't feel the need to cling to anyone I see
This fool's suffered gladly each and every day
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away

And I fall apart
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart

I've no care to count the stares that pity me
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see
For every rose you give her, I'll give you three
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me

Oh, I fall apart
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart

I fall apart, oh, I fall apart
This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart

Oh, I fall apart
Oh, I get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart

This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark

Elton John,"Do you pray to someone new
When you're locked up in the rock
Is the golden age dead and gone
Are the hands stuck on the clock
Can you talk to Buddy's bones
When you spin a forty five
The king ain't dead, he's just asleep
Somewhere in the after life

And look at them boys in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Play back to back, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day

We all need to smell the heat
You know that things go better with chrome
Is Memphis real or just a song
Three thousand miles from home

Like taxi cabs and spiders

Of Montmartre Street life
You signed the tablecloth

Elton John,"What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one no one can replace

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most of the day
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most of the day
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out, can you come out to play, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny

Well look at me, I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

Elton John,"Hey Nikita is it cold
In your little corner of the world
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know

Oh I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow

Oh Nikita you will never know, anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me
Do you ever see the letters that I write
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night

And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Oh Nikita you will never know, anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time

Oh no, Nikita you'll never know

Do we have to fight again
Tonight
I just want to go to sleep
Turn out the light

Nine times out of ten
I see the storm approaching
Long before the rain starts falling

Tonight
Does it have to be the old thing
Tonight
It's late, too late
To chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise
And place it in your hands
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
And I cannot find the time

Just let the curtains close in silence

Who'd love to see you smile

I see you take a bite
You can tell me you were home
But the camera never lies

You walk out in disguise
To pull the wool over my eyes
You play me for a fool
To believe your alibis

And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies

There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies

I recommend first prize
For acting so surprised
For acting like you love me
The camera never lies

I'll take my wounded pride
I'll take it on the chin

Say goodbye to latitudes and the confusion that surrounds you
Say goodbye to misery, say goodbye to the morning news
Say goodbye to prime time and the fools that choose to view
Say goodbye to Wendy, say goodbye to Rhonda
Say goodbye to the Beach Boys from the Palisades to Kona

Say goodbye to Glasnost, say goodbye to Malathion
Say goodbye to the clowns in congress and the belt around Orion
Say goodbye to the tabloids, say goodbye to diet soda
Say goodbye to new age music from the Capa to the Coda
Say goodbye to gridlock, goodbye to Dolly's chest
Goodbye to the ozone layer if there's any of it left

Don't it make you want to crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me, me

Goodbye to evangelists and geeks with power tools
Goodbye to statuettes, say goodbye to lists
Say goodbye to articles on who the senator kissed
Say goodbye to hair styles, goodbye to heaven's gate

And snake hips Joe is Mr. Cool
Out on the boulevard

Sailor boys find trouble in the alien state
It's one on one from Las Palmas to the Golden Gate

Elton John,"Outside I can hear the fireworks
Beyond the paper walls
Where the symbols painted black and white
Run together when the rain falls
And the wind chimes across Kyoto
Each time the earth moves
Was it the quake that shook me
Or was it something to do with you

And the hot wind heats the bamboo blinds
And your almond eyes always shine
Sitting cool behind your painted fan
All the secrets of the east
Conceal the beauty and the beast
For tender is the man in her Japanese hands

Flesh on silk looks different
Than on a cotton sheet back home
Where no one wears their hair like yours
Beneath those oriental combs
And with your thirsty fingers
Running up and down my spine
You forget the western woman
When you're sleeping on Kyoto time

And the sky explodes
and the moon grows cold
To the distant sound of drums
And the sky explodes
And the moon grows cold
As the dragons on the mainland
Wait to heat the sun",Japanese Hands
Elton John,"I used to think that New York City
Fell from grace with God
And innocence abroad
Waged a war for the underdog
When the snow falls
And Central Park looks like a Christmas card
I just looked beyond the bagman
And the madness that makes this city hard

I heard a basketball
Somewhere out beyond a chain link fence
Inner city prisoners
Argue for the right of self-defense
But there's a fast break
And every work of art wakes something in the soul
Just focus on the brush strokes
And the bouquets that the dancers hold

Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city that
That took away the kid in me","Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters, Pt. 2"
Elton John,"There's another one due in three month's time
She'll have to paint the spare room blue
She'll work a little overtime
And hope it all works out for Frank and her
If she can keep him home nights
Away from those factory girls

And the gas bills come and the money burns
And Frank just keeps complaining
How little they both earn
And mother drops by Mondays
Just to nag about the world
Then she stays to nag at Dallas
`Cause she hates those Texas girls

You'll get your dumb man
You'll see your whole life coming at you

Elton John,"I don't make the rules around here
A tear starts at the edge
It takes two hands to rip it
It takes a lot more than either one of us has said
But I come from indecision
A place you ain't never been
Living in the state of confusion
On a map that runs like the veins under your skin
We got Miss Communication kicking out the stool
We got mass determination making up the rules
But saving us is something that we can't do
And it's easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
And love is just another means
by which we hang ourselves
It takes two to execute
One to leave with innocence and one to leave with guilt
But I just see no reality
Just shades drawn on remorse
We've whipped this beast beyond the limit
Staggered out of breath along this course
It's easier to lose a rope around a fool
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
A ring of your indifference thrown anywhere you choose
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool",Rope Around a Fool
Elton John,"The mother of invention made it good for me
Tighter in the rear
Longer in the seam
Kicked out yards of leather
Wrapped around her waist
Trimmed it to perfection
And left a little space

Yeah they got competition now
All across the world
But there ain't been no looking back
Since God invented girls

Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls

Higher on the heel, paler than pure cream
Leaner on the sidewalk
Cutting through the steam
After claws and feathers
He took skin and bone
Shaped it like an hourglass
And made the angels moan

Oh here's a little heat boys
To straighten out them curls
Now there ain't been no angels round
Since God invented girls",Since God Invented Girls

Can't you see it, this is not my writing
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty

And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
All that once remained
Of a rugged individual
And laid across the airstrip

I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use

Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost

If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen

And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish

If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist

When manners make no difference
And my gifts all lay undone
I trade my accent in on chance
And fall back on a foreign tongue",A Word in Spanish

Like a sweet Sunday prayer
While the choir sang Son of Heaven

Getting married to a handsome man

And she walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

In the shadow of the holy
Oh I heard my tell-tale heart
Whisper words that never reached her
As her vows were made at last

Pronounced them man and wife
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Make a promise to be kept for life",I Never Knew Her Name

Don't go praying he'll come back

Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between

If it looks like rain, if it makes no sound
It's an echo of pain on common ground
Love's like a junkie, addiction's a fact
Passion's a monkey you can't keep off your back

But he takes love and he turns it cold
He's just an iceman honey, ain't got no heart of gold
But he sees you and he runs from you

And he'll hurt you
And he'll run from you

You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

Did you ever pray you could stay away
Company excluded
From the curse of the family circle

In a big round room on the edge of the moon
There's a shooting star
In a race for the final hurdle

You can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

No need to worry, no need to worry
No need to worry when you dance alone
You already made it, you already made it
When you're dancing in the end zone

You can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

You can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

You can go dancing
In the end zone
You can go dancing
In the end zone

You can go dancing
You can go dancing in the end zone
You can go dancing
You can go dancing in the end zone

You can go dancing
You can go dancing in the end zone

Elton John,"Suzie walks her dog but it don't solve
All the mysteries
Hanging with the guys, making with the guys
Playing hard to please

Back in '63, she was made for me
We were having fun
Wasn't long before I could not ignore
She's about hanging out

Campus queen dreams
Shattered years ago
And I'm the one who knows

It's the same country love song
Different words, a different melody
It's the same country love song

Mama said to me, ""John, you got to be
Honest to yourself
Keeping up the pace, losing in the race
Further on the shelf""

I want to write a country love song
Tell them nothing's wrong

So honey turn out the lights
and do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow

You can work on a charm
And tell the man in your arms
To do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow

Lying here in a way that I have always wanted
Close to you in a scene that I have always haunted
Time and time again we defended a right to cling to
Our love-shy goodbyes, for broken hearts could cry

You can do it, you can do it slow
You can do it slow, slow, slow
You can do it slow, slow
Do it nice and slow

You can turn on the heat
To keep a man on the streets
When you do it nice and slow
I like it when you do it nice and slow

You can work on a spell
And weave your magic so well
When you do it nice and slow
come on and do it nice and slow

You can do it, you can do it I know
You can do it nice and slow

I have cursed the stars above
That lead my heart to you
But as hard as I try
Still my love will not die
And the stars still shine on through
And the stars still shine on through

Oh my dear
Now this ship's too hard to steer
The tide has turned, turned on you
I have been through the lies
That I've seen in your eyes
But the truth still shines on through
But the truth it still shines, shines on through

So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill
Though we took our love so daringly
And gave it up uncaringly
There are feelings left not even we can kill

Oh my friend
So at last we reach the end

Your love captured my heart
You were always pleasing
Till you tore us apart
Said you needed both of us
How could you be so unkind
Then you traded love for lust
But sooner or later I'm gonna get you
Look out girl `cause I'm gonna fix you

I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up

Elton John,"They laid beneath the pine trees with their caps over their eyes
They were drunk with home and mama as they brushed away the flies
In an instant before the sunrise they had gunned the rebels down
As their flags were torn at half mast in the ruins of the town

There were white sails on the water for the crippled on the beach
There was a lack of ammunition so the cause was incomplete
When the bugle blew at breakfast and they knew their ships were in
Signs of grand assurance were carried on the wind

Take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks

They just chalked it down in history but they kept their uniforms
They put their medals on the sideboards and they went back to their farms
For it was just a mere reminder that they stood beside the best
That God had saved the chosen few and the devil took the rest

So take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks

On the planes above the rock face where the sculptured eagles swoop
There's a haunted yell for action among the specters of his troops
It was silent on the coastline as the crazy angels danced
With the sound of retreating footfall from his military camp

So take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks

Take it home
Take it low
Take responsibilities

Elton John,"Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet

As every little Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory

Well, this is my battleground, baby
This is my plaything

Outside of a wedding ring

Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do, is listen to the night talking

On the burden of insanity, we can't find the cause

And it's a strange breed of the devil, freeze at night to go walking in the park

Elton John,"Part time love is bringing me down
Cause I just can't get started with you my love
Did I hear you saying that I'm too hard hearted
Wipe those stars from your eyes
And you'll get quite a surprise
Because you'll see everybody's got a part time love

You've been seen running around
There's not much I don't hear of and still you try
Telling me all the things I must stay clear of
Don't tell me what to do
When you been doing it too

Falling, I'm falling can't get free
Baby if you keep on stalling
Oh how can I make you see
That you, me and everybody needs a part time love

Part time love
I seem to be pulling in the wrong direction
With you my love
Whatever I do you raise the same objection
I've got someone at home
But she's got a love of her own
Because you, me and everybody got a part time love

I'm waiting, I'm waiting all the time
And it's getting so frustrating

Elton John,"Well she looked a peach in the dress she made
When she was still her mama's little girl
And when she walked down the aisle everybody smiled
At her innocence and curls
And when the preacher said is there anyone here
Got a reason why they shouldn't wed
I should have stuck up my hand
I should have got up to stand
And this is what I should have said

I want to kiss the bride yeah
I want to kiss the bride yeah
Long before she met him
She was mine, mine, mine
Don't say I do

And let me kiss the bride yeah

I want to kiss the bride yeah

Underneath her veil I could see a tear
Trickling down her pretty face
And when she slipped on the ring I knew everything
Would never be the same again
But if the groom would have known he'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did
And what I planned to say
Yeah on her wedding day
Well I thought it but I kept it hid

Elton John,"Sitting here on Christmas Eve with a brandy in my hand
Oh I've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race

And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise
The bearded weirdy's just arrived

Ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise
The bearded wierdy's just arrived

On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head
My vision's blurred with color, and all he sees is red
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room",(Ho! Ho! Ho!) Who'd Be a Turkey at Christmas
Elton John,"The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through",All Across the Havens
Elton John,"T seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon

Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

There ain't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay

Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
On the bad side of the moon",Bad Side of the Moon
Elton John,"Your life stepped lightly out our hands
When no one's looking out you understand
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy snare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end

Every new version of the way of life
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night
But whose kid are you when they finally decide
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died

But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell
The difference for you between heaven and hell
To glorify something, your legends are found
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground

Years rolling by just like a dream
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone",Cold Highway
Elton John,"Why's it never light on my lawn
Why does it rain
And never say good-day to the new-born
On the big screen they showed us the sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal

I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools
That were so warn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal

Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was re-born before all life could die
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real

Well then go on
Go your own sweet way

Have you gone before
And how many times
Have I forgiven you once more

The time drags by
I wish you'd learn
Not to make me cry

Elton John,"I hear that some playboy has kidnapped your heart
With his plane and his plans for games after dark
Just a pain in his pocket, and the price of a room

For the taste of success can be bitter and sweet
It could be all right that I act like a child
But you'll be the loser when the jokers run wild

You're just playing the game, but the stakes are too high
What will you do when the chips start to fly
When the deck's stacked against you, and the living gets hard?
Oh, it's four walls of madness in this house of cards

I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack
Ever since a week ago, the day he passed away
I've been taking too much notice of the things they've had to say

And all they say is you ain't half the man he used to be
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you
I'm not the guy, or so it seems to fill my old man's shoes

Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes

You had a good night and you feel real loose
Heard they got you going round the goosecreek shed
Trying to fill your belly full of buckshot lead

Heard you coming and he got his gun

Elton John,"I looked up from my glass into the sky
There's no room in my comic book to hide
Calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
Down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away

So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain

Come in colours from above into my citadel
My eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made
And now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain",Just Like Strange Rain

I'll show yow where the man in me is when he doesn't hide
Well he's cruising in the fast lane, stuck behind the wheel
Jekyll and Hyde going on inside when I'm your automobile

Let me be your car for a while child
Shift me into gear and I'll be there
Fill me up with five star gasoline girl
I'll be your car, I'll take you anywhere

Let me be your car, come on and drive me
I'm a speedy little boy down deep inside
I got bucket seats and two speed window cleaners
Just let me be your car, oh come on and ride

I can't dance, I don't dig it, I can't see it at all
You say I'm just a specimen, and baby I can crawl

Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You better get your coat dear
It looks like rain, yeah

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after

Elton John,"I lived in a tenement six floors above
I lent you my records and I lent you my love
But you left me on the weekend without a by-your-leave
That's a dirty and a low-down trick
My folks all think you're mean

But I don't mind, that's kind of nifty
You always set those break-ups in the movies
And just like a light honey you put me out
Now I'm gonna do my best
To get you back in the nest you came from

You can erase me if you want to
Turn your back in other men
But whenever you're ready
Honey, we'll go steady again

It's nasty without you in my little room
I miss you like crazy, please come back soon
I was joking with those things I said
I couldn't have been thinking
If you don't come back I think I'll crack
Just like my old ceiling",Whenever You're Ready (We'll Go Steady Again)
Elton John,"Yesterday you came to lift me up
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard

Tomorrow leave the windows open
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm

`Cause I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin

I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son

Things we never said come together
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
That kind of understanding sets me free",The Last Song
Elton John,"The church bells ring out morning glory
When summer bends to the winter's rage
Emily walks through the cemetery
Passed a dog in an unmarked grave
The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging
Talks to her sisters in the ground
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning
I heard a prophesy all around

And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down

Emily prays to a faded hero
In a little frame clutched to her gown
Hears the voice of promise in his memory
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down
In a cage sits a gold canary
By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom
As a soul ascends aboard the evening
Canary sings to an empty room

And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down",Emily

That cold grey place
Don't want its shadow anymore

In the Northern Skies
There was a steel cloud
It used to follow me around
But I don't see it now
There's a farm in the rain
And a little farmhouse
There were a young man's eyes
Looking south

But I no longer need her

When am I ever gonna to learn

Looking for an exit
Sleeping on the concrete
You can't see it with your eyes
You can't find it with your feet
All I know is that we're lost baby
And we're living on dark Street

Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh

For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Oh, baby you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I

Elton John,"There's a hungry road I can only hope's
Gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit coming clean
In the eye of a lifelong fire
Tell Monday I'll be around next week
I'm running ahead of my days
In the shotgun chance that scattered us
I've seen the error of my ways

Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
Like sun gods spitting rain
Found a way home written on this map
Like red dye in my veins
In the hardest times that come around
The fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down
It's a darkness no one knows

And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
Standing in a station waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train",Runaway Train
Elton John,"There's a breakdown on the runway
And the timeless flights are gone
I'm a year ahead of myself these days
And I'm locomotive strong
My city spread like cannon fire
In a yellow nervous state
I can't cut the ties that bind me
To horoscopes and fate

And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're gonna get back to the simple life again


When we break out of this blindfold
I'm gonna take you from this place
Until we're free from this ball and chain
I'm still hard behind the eight
My city beats like hammered steel
On a shallow cruel rock
If we could walk proud after midnight
We'd never have to stop",Simple Life
Elton John,"No ceiling on hard living
Peace keepers keep on breathing
Can't deny eye for eye
It's open season
Dictate to my reason
She devils ruling Britain
Hey girl stick it in your purse
Call it treason

Band aids on dead doorways
No heroes in the Bat Cave
Don't give me Tears For Fears
Give me tears of rage
Fires burn with black smoke
Oil slicks put us on the ropes
Man it's hard to handle
When the bank's broke

Don't kow-tow, don't bow down
Loosen up, get the lead out
Backs up let them shout
Backs up sweat it out
When your back's up, sweat it out
Backs up, sweat it out

No ice on a greasy river

For your rice and corn",Sweat It Out
Elton John,"She may be lost
She may be out of bounds
All her tenderness and charms could be something
A man like me has never found
But in her woman's way
She's still a little girl
The things that she wants, the things that she needs
Oh well the choice is hers

'Cause you can't take a woman
When she doesn't want you
And you can't be a man
If you're blind to reason
Man might be strong
But true love is stronger
You gotta play it straight
When a woman doesn't want you

Her voice invites
Her eyes say more than words
But her needs and complications
Can tear away the memory of last night's girl
And if you're weak
Yeah we're all weak sometime
The best things can wait
The best times they come
Oh when strength is kind

And if you can't read her
Leave her alone
And if you don't know by now
She's not someone's prize
And you can't take her home",When a Woman Doesn't Want You
Elton John,"Tonight it's hot down here
I can almost smell the rain
And I can almost taste the fear
Behind your name
Fans turning on the ceiling
I feel sticky as a chili dog
White boys howling in the evening
On that hollow log

Tall tales down the river
Say we aim to bury the truth
But the right hand just delivered
The devil in a suit

And he talks big in Whitewash County
Talks sweet as sugar cane
Got a past that's filled with lightning
Got a future filled with rain

Bug buzzing in an empty glass
Fiddle scratching some lazy tune
We're just some place that history passed
New dust, new broom
And it's a high hot buttered moon
He's got a shiny new wax face
Swears the South's gonna rise again soon
All over the place

Rain down on Whitewash County
Smell the air coming up the line
Well you've changed your face so often
But you never change your mind",Whitewash County
Elton John,"Fat boys cry when ugly girls sing
About the way the world would be if they were thin
And ugly girls turn their heads when fat boys laugh
About the handsome kid next door who broke their heart
Who broke their heart
Broke their heart

And fat boys lie when ugly girls ask
About the size an apple pie looks through a magnifying glass
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl

Fat boys dance when ugly girls shout
That a waltz is not the dance for the boy who's stout
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep

Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

A face that smiled at every passing scene
Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time
When each emotion pinball in your mind

Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

With a shaken faith
From the pain of a broken heart
Toward feeling great
Feel like life has just begun
No more singing duets for one

I hold your picture here beside the bed
You had a party raging in your head
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt
And here today all I can do is learn

Seen justice denied by the voice of a gun

Touching truth and touching skin

Then I think about the love I have inside me

Now love's made it to the outside
I want to tell the world of everthing I've found
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
You turned my living upside down

And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels
Is it cloudy, is it bright
Is it day or is it night
Am I wrong or am I right
And is it real

Tell me where you learned the magic
The spell you used the day you made me fall
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside down but ten feet tall

On and on I've drifted with the tide
I didn't know that love could move me so

And you showed me which way to go

Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through

Tears from your little sister
Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch for the party to go
Oh but you know she'll get by

'Cause she's living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Momma's gonna love her just as much as she can

It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'll lose it in the snow on the ground
Out walking your dog to find a job

But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
You better go home where it's warm

And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
And a _______ prayer making you strong

My soul fights a war
I can't explain
I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire
And common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes, Belfast.

Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rock and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place, Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

Who's to say
On whom Heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try harder to recognize
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down,
Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers

A jealous green
Streaks down this faulty diamond
No bloody boots or crucifix
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
But I never saw a braver place,

Dark clouds above me, little people below
All walk with a purpose with someplace to go
It's my place to paint my own selfish scene
On this cold lonely canvas, it's just the weather and me

And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold strech of black across blue

But latitude captures the heart and the mind",Latitude

Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
Man got his make-up but wears it like a mask
Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
Man breathes his own deceit
Man worships his own defeat

I'm a man, working on the living part of life
You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can
Have a little faith in man

Shakespeare's a men, got all the lines
Modern man lives the back in time
Man got bravado in his big steel of hands
Runs with the wolf, he sleeps with the lamb
Man falls and cuts and bleeds
Man stumbles on his own belief

Oh I'm a man, I know what it feels like
I'm a man, working on the living part of life
You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can
Have a little faith in man

He's the hoax behind the thrill
The poison arrow, the bitter pill
Hard to swallow, hard to kill, hard to understand
He's the light behind the hill
The broken promise, the iron will
Hard to kill, hard to understand

Oh I'm a man, I know what it feels like

You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best

There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far

Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself

Elton John,"Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned our long before
Your legend ever will

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will",Candle in the Wind 1997
Elton John,"There was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun

I need to tell you
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay

And I can't explain
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

With your smile
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty
I'm speechless and I don't know where to start

And I can't explain
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Oh, it takes my breath away

Do I have a shot at the big part

Elton John,"And when we start we say forever
We say we care, we need, we feel
We read the movement of our eyes
But in our hearts we still believe

The end will come, before we know
The silent rule of love applies
We light the fuse and let it burn out
We just accept that love must die

And so they say, the end will come for us
And so the world, slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
But I don't believe, I don't believe that the end will come for us
No I won't believe the end will come for us

The end will come like sudden rain
The end is never what it seems
We sink the ship before we sail
We just accept what failure means",The End Will Come
Elton John,"Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it
After all these rough seas
Left me reckless and abandoned
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning
Break down the cold front
Give me peace and understanding

And you wait, and you wonder
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder
Will she still be the star to see me through
'Cause I can't steer my heart clear of you

No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view
And should I drift away, the compass holds the clue
You control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you

Make me your penance, show me your innocence
Everything is history
From the aching to the pleasure
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us
Everything gets twisted

Elton John,"I don't know what to say
I don't know where the light shines
It's a grey dawn rising on a green hill
And there's so much behind us

I don't know where we go

There's a great awakening and a new morning
And your spirit's pounding loud and clear

If the river can bend
I'll find you waiting
Home at last from the wild sea
All the twists and turns
We've made together
All the boats you rocked
With your harmony
If the river can bend
If the river can bend
If the river can bend

Come and embrace the struggle
But win or lose we live here

Breathe deep of the sweet fresh air",If the River Can Bend
Elton John,"Must have been the right month
Must have been a good time
Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
Every single glass of wine

Must have learned some home truths
Sitting in that cool grass
Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
Every shooting star that passed

Should have had a talk with god
Sitting in the great unknown
Watching all the lovers in the world get together
Sitting in heaven all alone

And we were love's knot after summer
Tied together in the dead of winter
Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
Bound together in the autumn
Every month means a little something
But January is the month that cares

Must have kissed you 'till I hurt you
Must have been a wild night
Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
Rag dolls in the morning light

Must have found a secret place
Hiding in our own world
Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
Every single sound we heard",January
Elton John,"I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out of the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

And his promise made was never clear
It just carve itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my hand
On the night he said to me

Someday
We'll live like horses
Free rein
From you old iron fences
There's more ways than one
To regain your senses
Break out the stalls
And we'll live like horses

We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the tribe
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of the wagon train
On the road to the golden gate
On the flat dry dessert I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now I shall be free

Someday
We'll live like horses
Free rein
From you old iron fences
There's more ways than one
To regain your senses
Break out the stalls
And we'll live like horses",Live Like Horses

Feel the cold wind haunt me
Streets are empty just like me
The murmur of an echo
Seems to come from every window
Is loneliness the same as being free

I guess I must have been dreaming
To think that I believed in you at all
Now I just can't fight it
As the shadow of the night begins to fall

Love's got a lot to answer for
Oh I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore
Let the cold night air cool the heat
Of two hearts gone to war
For no matter who wins, in the end
Love's got a lot to answer for

A sleep that soaks me up like surf and sand

A soft outline all poised and feather light
I come into the darkness now
To conjure up a dream and close my eyes

Don't disturb me if you dare 
Join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you

Elton John,"Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
""Two teas both with sugar please""
In the back of an alley

While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and ""Hey mom, do the papers say anything good.
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods""

Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback
The honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning

For cheap easy meals and hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Couldn't fool us

And barriers abound

When it's make or break 
Make no mistake
She appears like lightening in a bottle
I catch the spark 
Oh she lights the dark
The knot's undone the ideas come
Like two hands on a throttle

There's a place of one way streets and doubt

Elton John,"What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there

Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop

And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more

Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop

And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace

And I've been knocking
But no one answers
And I've been knocking
Most all the day

Oh, and I've been calling
Oh, hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear

Who lived there
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop

Now we pray for rain and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knocking
But no one answers
And I've been knocking
Most all the day

Oh, and I've been calling
Oh, hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And I've been knocking
But no one answers
And I've been knocking
Most all the day

Oh, and I've been calling

Ask no questions, take no side

Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Still we are, have always been
Will ever be as one

What is done has been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose

The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and tought me that friends never say

Never say goodbye

To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
The town's already on it's knees
Being worshiped is a breeze
I barely know the words to any hymn

Listen if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes
I can see is being sacrificed or stuffed
Let's be gods, the perks are great
El Dorado on a plate
Local feelings should not be rebuffed

It's great to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be defied when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a terrifying notion
All those prayers and those salaams
Any normal man would bridle if he's forced to be an idol
And a normal man's exactly what I am

All the same it's pretty clear
The scoundrels don't keep much up here
They must have zillions under lock and key
But gods can force then to unleash
Enough to make us nouveau riche
Beyond our wildest dreams so follow me

Can't you see I won't relax
If religious maniacs
Tell me I'm all-powerful and sublime
How can I be their belief
When I'm lying through my teeth
Why don't we just say some other time

It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings, keep them sweet is my advice
Be nirvana, be salvation
Be all things to all men
Butter up your congregation

The alternative is dire
Simply frying pan to fire
So sign on two new gods for paradise",It's Tough to Be a God
Elton John,"I see you in the distance and I see us as we are
So nearly so contented but a careless word too far
I see you in confusion for a once enchanted boy
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy

I longed to love you better but I swear I don't know how
You could have been my future but I had to have it now
The things we love completely we are fated to destroy
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy

It's easy to be certain that another's heart will fall
Much harder to be certain of your own
It moves you, and inspires you then it drives you to the wall
And leaves you so excited but alone

My heart dances, oh oh
My heart dances, oh oh
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy
But not for joy
But not for joy
But not for joy

",My Heart Dances
Elton John,"Often these days
And always these nights
I find I'm afraid
Of the turbulent heights

No matter how far

Are those where you are

For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to calm down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me

Once in a while
I slip back to my past
Where I long to remain
But the dream does not last
In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go

For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me

In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go
Oh don't let me go

For when you are laughing
Lile silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And you love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh, oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me

Elton John,"El Dorado, queen of cities
Paradise so wisely hid
Overshadows Barcelona
Aragon, Castle, Madrid
Where on Earth can match your riches
Match your people fine and free
Why return to old world values
This is how the Earth should be

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

El Dorado, queen of cities
Overflowing with excess
Every turn exotic, lavish
Prescious wonders numberless
Lead me now into temptation
Surely you would not deny
One who's come so far to find you
All your blessings save goodbye

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, (she could be the death of me) El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

El Dorado, golden prison
Sheer perfection, sheer despair
How can one who knows such splendour
Feel the answer lies elsewhere
All I know is I must leave her
Or she'll be the death of me
Put my trust in poorer places
Let the queen of cities be

El Dorado, (must leave her) El Dorado (queen of cities)
El Dorado, (sheer perfection) El Dorado

El Dorado, (or she'll be the death of me) El Dorado
El Dorado, (queen of cities) El Dorado

(Must leave her) El Dorado, (queen of cities)
El Dorado, (sheer perfection) El Dorado

El Dorado, (or she'll be the death of me) El Dorado
El Dorado, (queen of cities) El Dorado

",Queen of Cities
Elton John,"Some day out of the blue
In a crowded street or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you as if our love were new
Some day we can start again, some day soon

Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields

Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all and watched it slip away
Where are we now?

Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me

Some day out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you

As if we always knew
Some day we would live again, some day soon

I still believe
I still put faith in us
",Someday Out of the Blue [Theme from el Dorado]
Elton John,"Look out new world here we come
Brave, intrepid and then some
Pioneers of maximum
Audacity whose resumes
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam
On the trail we blaze

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze

Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child
On the trail we blaze

The trail we blaze
Is a road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be faint-hearted
We are part of the sumptuous grand design

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze on the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze
On the trail we blaze",The Trail We Blaze
Elton John,"Looking back it makes me shiver
Don't be scared to kick the past
Selling lovers down the river
Nothing built for speed will last overnight

All those years of desolation
Pretty boys and damage done
Not the way to find salvation
Looking after number one

Trust me
Try rolling with the flow
Trust me
I've been there don't you know
I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, you're naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust me

Too many years your heart has wandered
Scared to make a final move
Too many nights those boys have squandered
You got nothing left to prove

I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, butt naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust me

Trust me
Trust me

Elton John,"The more I learn, the more I see
The less the world impassioned me
The hungry heart, the roving eye
Have come to rest, do not apply
The frantic chase, the crazy ride
The thrill has gone, I step aside

I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you

The more I want the more I steal
The more I hold the less is real
All worldly things I follow blind
In hope not faith was paid in kind
The line is drawn, the change is made
I come to you, I'm not afraid",Without Question
Elton John,"To be young, gifted and black,
Oh what a lovely precious dream
To be young, gifted and black,
Open your heart to what I mean

In the whole world you know
There are billion boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black,
And that's a fact!

Young, gifted and black
We must begin to tell our young
There's a world waiting for you
This is a quest that's just begun

When you feel really low
Yeah, there's a great truth you should know
When you're young, gifted and black
Your soul's intact

Young, gifted and black
How I long to know the truth
There are times when I look back
And I am haunted by my youth

Oh but my joy of today
Is that we can all be proud to say

Is where it's at",To Be Young Gifted and Black
Elton John,"Yes my baby left me,
Never said a word.
Was it something I done,
Something that she heard?

My baby left me,
My baby left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word.

Now I stand at my window,
Wring my hands and cry.
I hate to lose that woman,
Hate to say goodbye.

You know she left me,
Yes, she left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word.

Lord, it won't be long,
You'll look for me and,
Baby, and daddy he'll be gone.

Elton John,"You can't always count on the prayers in your sleep
But this cold light's still killing me
If I pay the ransom
Well can they guarantee
To split the chains, slip the knots
I don't know if they'll ever set you free

I just can't rely on all these twisted signs
Too many bright lights turn you blind
The history of the blues
Seems to swim in your eyes
Pick yourself up, throw your head back
Take a long, long look into the sky

Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you 
What you've always known
It's the North Star that's the big one
And it's always gonna lead you home

Can't always agree on all my dumb ideas
I'm still looking for a way out of here
You can value what you want
But you pay for change
There's full moons, cold lifeless nights
And tumbled stars spell out your name

Close your eyes, take a ride
Think of every time that you
missed your opp
click your heels, see how it feels
Something so childish 
Sometimes seems so real",The North Star

Elton John,"Time has gone by
The calendar leaves ___
I might try phoning
If I could think of the words to try

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall

She left in the morning
_____ was her way
And on returning
I find I have nothing to say

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
No, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall

",Stormbringer
Elton John,"Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt

Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence

It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands

Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent",American Triangle
Elton John,"I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight

Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant

And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore

Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time

They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen",Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes
Elton John,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
DonÂ´t answer the question of what I am to you",Birds
Elton John,"Oh, I'm a dark diamond
I've turned hard and cold
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you

Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond
Dark diamond

Oh, I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love",Dark Diamond
Elton John,"We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment
On Orlando and 4th
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
Like a Chinese proverb
We were always searching

NightlifeÂ´s a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperorÂ´s new clothes

And the tears never came
They just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growing
Like PinocchioÂ´s nose
As we walked around in the emperorÂ´s new clothes

We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck weÂ´d been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly

We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperorÂ´s new clothes",The Emperor's New Clothes
Elton John,"I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man I've seen so much traffic

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough

A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

I want love, just a different kind

Elton John,"I'll take a rainy day
To make a champagne shower
Poach some horn and tusk
To build an ivory tower

Been to Philadelphia
The day it was closed
I walked to New Orleans
Down a Louisiana road

The skeletons they hung from the bushes and the trees
But not a skull among 'em said boo to me
In a time of wine and cheap cigars
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world Ma

Look Ma no hands
Look Ma ain't life grand
I'm a super power, I'm a handy man
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Ain't you proud of me

It takes a silver tongue
To have the Midas touch
Not your alchemist
Making gold from rust

Been down in Roswell
When the Martians came
I sailed to Mandeville
Across Lake Pontchartrain","Look Ma, No Hands"
Elton John,"You can take her
Make her change her name
You and your old money
Dance around the flame
But you can never, never love her like me

You can charm her
Calm her when sheÂ´s wild
Show a little comfort
Play with her inner child
But you can never, never love her like me

So I just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep
Sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week
You may have her in real world but if you could only see
How we rock this room in the twilight zone
And you can never, never love her like me

You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her
SheÂ´s the love of your life
And no, youÂ´ll never, never love her like me

You can bless her
Keep her conscience clean
You can undress her
Go all the places IÂ´ve been
But youÂ´ll never, never love her like me",Love Her Like Me
Elton John,"It's a case I guess of paradise lost
Ten years back on the hands of the clock
In that little house on Mansfield
On your old block
Sometimes the magic of the past is all we've got

Just you and me at a crossroads then
Ain't it funny how we were old friends
Accidentally thrown together
Did we intend
To be the romantic novel you never want to end

And it's the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room
And how I kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune
You said, 'Funny but it feels like I've known you all my life
And how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight'

In between the Star of David and the California moon
The Santa Ana winds blew warm into your room
We were crazy, wild and running
Blind to the change to come
In that little house on Mansfield
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone

In the candlelight I can recall
Your naked shadow looking ten feet tall
Like a wild pony dancing
Along the wall
Off balance I found love the only place to fall",Mansfield
Elton John,"Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof

Oh the furnace wind
Is a flickering of wings about your face
In a cloud of incense
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place

I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside

Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin,
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin

A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life

Up in the balcony
All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don't understand",Original Sin
Elton John,"You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles heading west
Picking up my pain from door to door
Riding on the Storyline, furnace burning overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried-up and sick to death of love
If you really need to know it
I never really understood that stuff
All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em as they say and weep
I never felt enough to cry

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles heading west
Picking up my pain from door to door
Riding on the Storyline, furnace burning overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

When I say that I don't care
It really means my engine's breaking down
The chisel chips my heart again
The granite cracks beneath my skin
I crumble into pieces on the ground

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles heading west
Picking up my pain from door to door
Riding on the Storyline, furnace burning overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

Oh, yeah",This Train Don't Stop There Anymore
Elton John,"Some days I think it's all a dream
The things I've done, the places that I've been
This life of mine seemed surreal at times
Wasted days and nights in someone else's mind

Could it be I'm not for real?
I've slapped my face to check out how I feel
There's hostages to prove it's true
Who lives behind the mask was never proved

Come on Robert Johnson 
Though we're worlds apart
You and I know what it's like
With the devil in our heart
You sold your soul at the crossroads
Kept a little of mine on hand
I'm wading out this muddy water
Been stranded in the Wasteland

Rattling chains all around my bed
Ghosts can laugh but they're already dead
I'm not dying and I'm far from gone
The blues man spent his candle but his pain lives on",The Wasteland
Elton John,"I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later
But love, I believe in love

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone
Without love, I believe in love

Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Without love I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you
And I wouldn't believe in me
Without love

I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love",Believe

Elton John,"I used to be a rolling stone you know
If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beating for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee high to a man, yeah
Gave me a piece of mama, daddy never had

Oh Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love you
Shine the light, through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom, I love-ve-ve you, yes I do

If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city (some people the city)
Some others choose the good old family home (some others choose a good old...)
I like living easy without family ties (living easy)
Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee high to a man
Mmm, gave me a piece of mama, daddy never had

Oh Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love you
Shine the light, through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom, I love-ve-ve you, yes I do

Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love you
Shine the light, through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom, I love-ve-ve,
You know I love-ve-ve , you know I love-ve-ve you
Yes I do,  Philadelphia freedom
I love-ve-ve you
Yes I do,  Philadelphia freedom
You know that I love-ve-ve you
Yes I do,  Philadelphia freedom
Don't you know that I love-ve-ve you
Yes I do,  Philadelphia freedom
Don't you know that I love-ve-ve you
Yes I do,  Philadelphia freedom",Philadelphia Freedom [Album Version]
Elton John,"Written by Thom Bell, Leroy Bell and Casey James
Catch a star if you can
Wish for something special
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself
Think of someone listening
One melody, you're all for me

I'll write a symphony just for you and me
If you let me love you, I'll paint a masterpiece
Just for you to see
If you let me love you, let me love you

Are you ready, are you ready for love
Yes I am
Are you, are you ready, are you ready for love
Yes I am
Are you, are you ready, are you ready for love

You're the one like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me

Say the word and I'll be there
Loving you forever
Don't let me go
Just say it's so

We'll hear the music ring from the mountain tops
To the valley below us
We'll serenade the world
With a lullaby so the angels will know us
Angels will know us",Are You Ready for Love ['79 Radio Edit]

I can see the red tail lights heading for spain
Oh and I can see daniel waving goodbye
God it looks like daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

Elton John,"Blue eyes
Baby's got, blue eyes
Like a deep blue sea
On a blue, blue day

Blue eyes
Baby's got, blue eyes
When the mornin' comes
I'll be far away and I say

Blue eyes holdin' back the tears
Holdin' back the pain

Elton John,"There´s a calm surrender
To the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world
Can be turned away
An enchanted moment
And it sees me through
It´s enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It´s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it´s laid to rest?
It´s enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There´s a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There´s a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours

[Chorus]
It´s enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best",Can You Feel the Love Tonight? [DVD]
Elton John,"Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty second row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Elton John,"When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens, hand in hand

There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh where we meet
Ooh where we meet
Me and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye

In this smoky room
There's a jukebox, plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light

That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh where we meet
Ooh where we meet
Me and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

There's a downtown smell of cooking
From the flame on an open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumping, Lord, have mercy
Ooh you can't sit still, oh, you can't sit still

That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh where we meet
Ooh where we meet
Me and you, rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Where we meet, in the club at the end of the street
I can't sit still
Where we meet, in the club at the end of the street

Elton John,"The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, ""I'm sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day""

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band

Elton John,"Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
