This track here may cause concern
For all ring leaders
Why don't you listen and learn
Love peace happiness once was strong
But due to society
Even that's turned wrong

Why?
Don't be a dumb dummy
And disrespect mommy
Why?
She put you on earth
And loved you since birth
And you

Hey young world
The world is yours
Hey young world
The world is yours
Young world young world
Young world young world

Reward is a brainwashed kid gone wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company and now you've been framed
Parents are hurting so hurt and ashamed
Why?
Hell lil' kids don't follow these dopes
Why?
Don't be a fool like those who ditch school
It's yours

Hey young world
The world is yours
Hey young world
The world is yours
Young world young world

Get ahead
And accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves they don't admire you
Their times are limited
And hardrocks too
Listen be strong
And scream
Woopie doo
Go for yours
Cause dreams come true
You'll make your mommy so proud of you too
And this is a message that the ruler rick threw

Why?
(slick rick)
Elders see our wise ones grow
Interest in what their kid learned 'bout
Seen how the offspring turned out
Knowing you can now safeguard self
Put upon an exciting path
You see immense pride they'll have

Hey young world
The world is yours
Hey young world
The world is yours
Young world young world

Don't discipline rule soundly
Kids that we have lose boundaries
Grow into what's called curse race lack independence
Worst case imprisonment death near for
Not what we brought kids here for
Morals and values of sorts should be the first thing installed

Believe it or not
God still shines on you
He guides you
And he watched you as you grew
Stay out of trouble
When it comes insight
Cause a man never loses a fight in god's sight",Hey Young World Part 2

Macy Gray,"He tends to get carried away
Like a talk show he's got drama everyday
Lots of rage and mental abusing
The way he treats me it's obvious he's confusing
Me for some dumb bitch
Who will stick around
I tend to stick around

You tell me that you love me if it's true
Why am I runnin' from you and who
Are these bitches on my answering machine
Yeah you you tell me that you love me but boo
If this is love
It's a good thing you don't hate me

Superfly
Someone who'll at least try
Who'll smoke me out from time to time
And love me all night
Tell me everything about him
And none of it turns out to be lies
Easy
Rainbows
These words come to mind
And he loves me all night

You tell me that you love me if it's true
Why am I runnin' from you and who
Are these bitches on my answering machine
Yeah you you tell me that you love me but boo
If this is love
It's a good thing you don't hate me

Never settle for the things that you don't really want
'Cause all it gets you is a big ol' piece of unhappiness
Happiness could be mine but it's so hard to talk to you
Baby
One day I will
Some day I will and
This is what I'll say

Hold me close
'Cause I'm the most and
Make a toast to you and me
See that's the way love's supposed to be
Not stressful alright

You tell me that you love me if it's true
Why am I runnin' from you and who
Are these bitches on my answering machine
Yeah you you tell me that you love me but boo
If this is love
It's a good thing you don't hate me

Never settle for the things that you don't really want
'Cause all it gets you is a big old piece of unhappiness
It's a good thing you don't hate me
Is this is love how could this be",Boo
Macy Gray,"I have finally faced it
The well is dry
And we're not gonna make it
Out of the war alive
He brings me close and says to me
Lets make this a happy ending
And try to stay friends
But you see
If this love affair was happy
Then it would not end

And I don't wanna be
One of your friends
If we must break up
Then that's where it ends

So please don't come around
Bringing me down
Listening for your love
I don't hear a sound
Please don't come around
Bringing me down
Tossin' and turnin'
My smile's upside down

Don't invite me out to dinner
Don't call me on the phone
You wanted to leave me baby
So won't you leave me alone

So please don't come around
Bringing me down
Listening for your love
I don't hear a sound
Please don't come around
Bringing me down
Tossin' and turnin'
My smile's upside down

It's all or nothing
We'll be one or none
Right now you need to know
That I cannot begin again
After what just happened
This ain't no TV show
My heart's completely broke
So...

So please don't come around
Bringing me down
Listening for your love
I don't hear a sound
Please don't come around
Bringing me down
Tossin' and turnin'
My smile's upside down

And I miss your love baby
And I miss your lovin'
So stay away from me",Don't Come Around

Gimme sound
Need to be touched by you but you're not around
Forgiveness
Please save some for me
Wash me down
Till I'm new
Till I'm pleasing you
Till I am nothing but true
Please save a little for me
Where is the forgiveness that you promised me
Am I too late
Gone astray
Misplaced the keys to all my churches
Seems I've chased all my angels away
So I bleed
Gimme speed
While I'm running back to you
And I'll be nothing but true true
Me you choose
See I was hopin' I could walk on your water with you

Please send some down for me
Where is the forgiveness that you promised me

And I'll be nothing but true",Forgiveness
Macy Gray,"Sorry that I'm late
I been searchin' for something great
Something to fill me up
He said join the club
Then we made love till my body ached

And baby when you have the time
I wanna tell you what is on my mind
I gotta get it off
Cause it's so heavy
After what we did the other night
I wanna be with you for all my life
I'm so glad you're a freak like me

Someone be a true one
See the last one made me cry
All the time my love
He said join the club
And we make love till
My emotions rise

After what we did the other night
I wanna be with you for all my life
I'm so glad you're a freak like me
Love like I dream of
Like they sing of in the beautiful song
Feeling it deep tonight
And I'd rather die
Than be without you when the morning comes
You make me feel like my search is done

Baby when you have the time
I wanna tell you what is on my mind
I gotta get it off

Macy Gray,"He drives a g wagon
And he looks just like my dream
I been climbin' all his mountains
I been swimming all his seas

No matter what or how I tried
I couldn't get the man to fall in love with me
Turns out he likes the girls with long and wavy hair
Mine is short and kinky
I have lost my mind

See'mon and
Gimme all your lovin'
Or I will kill you
Put one through your head
Gimme all your lovin'
Or I will kill you
And cry when you're dead

His whole body was shaking
And he holla'd when he fell to his knees
I held tighter to my ak
He said please please whatever you need
See I have searched the wide world
To find the peace for the war in me
Don't want to look no further
But you refuse to give it to me

And I have lost my mind
See'mon and
Gimme all your lovin'
Or I will kill you
Put one through your head
Gimme all your lovin'
Or I will kill you
And cry when you're dead

It's amazing what a gun to the head can do
My baby loves me now as hard as he can
My methods may be suspect
But you gotta get love however you can

I have lost my mind!",Gimme All Your Lovin' or I Will Kill You
Macy Gray,"You must be smellin' cherries and strawberries and peaches
And plums
Roses and dandelions
Special lovin' on the night I spent with you
It was the best that I've had lately
But it didn't mean anything
And I will be glad when you stop callin' me
Harry
Don't want to be your girlfriend
But boy when you want the lovin'
Come and see me harry
Swore my ever lasting true love to you
Said that I need ya I want ya didn't I baby

And I will be glad when you stop callin' my house
Harry
Don't want to be your girlfriend
But boy when you want the lovin'
Come and see me harry
It's a shame harry
Cause you such a beautiful thing harry
You tell em that you love and I bet you do
But love's not my thing right now harry

Cold like in my isolation cell

You are relating to a psychopath
Your role model is in therapy
You must be real far gone
You are relating to a psychopath

Noah's elephants are leaving the ark in eights
During the upside of my manic depressive state
Crickets sing in three part harmony

I try to walk away I choke and I stumble
I'm flying back so listen close when mumble
That you are so good at keeping me company.

You are relating to a psychopath
Your role model is therapy

You are relating to a psychopath

Yes I'm real far gone
You are relating to a psychopath

And it's when it kicks in that why mind chooses to go
My feel better begins
Just when I get attached
It ends

So I remain a psycho

Cartoon figures dance in my head
I said, love is butter won't you be my bread
And you are so good at keeping me company

Macy Gray,"When I was ten I had a live in babysitter, 
She had a pet Kangaroo wore big breasts and feathers. 
She gave me ice cream every time I screamed and hollered 
And I loved her till I caught her sexing my father.

She gonna hurt you daddy never again, 
She wasn't a friend, so I killed her. 
She gonna hurt you daddy never again 
She wasn't a friend, so I killed her.

When I was thirteen the plumber stopped by,
The house was flooding and no one knew why. 
Within no time at all he got rid of the water 
And I was grateful till I caught him plunging my mother.

He gonna hurt you momma never again, 
He wasn't a friend, so I killed him. 
He gonna hurt you momma never again 
He wasn't a friend so I killed him, 
She gonna hurt your daddy never again,
She wasn't a friend, so I killed her. 
She gonna hurt you daddy never again 
She wasn't a friend, so I killed her.

And I don't feel bad about it. 
Say what? And I don't feel bad about it.

Until he waved a gun at me.

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
The kid don't play
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!

Could never understand why my family had to suffer
May be it's because we're not as fortunate as others
At least we've got each other, and we can rely on one another

Through good and bad we refused to accept defeat
Trying to give us what they never could have
Not a day goes by that we don't thank god for what we have

So I waited patiently

I will not stand by and try
I cannot be by your side
You drained the life out of me

You are no exception

And I waited anxiously

You said you said you cared for me
I was so naive
I let you walk all over me

I’ve gained courage
Now, I am so better off
Without you in my life

You sold me out
And through it all you fuckin’
Wasted my time

I will not stand by and try
I cannot be by your side

You did not think too much of me
You helped yourself and did not think
To offer me your company

And that’s just fine

Even though I trust you they tell me doubt doubt doubt

Is it in my head

[Chorus:]
Is it in me head or am I falling down a hill
Gaining momentum
Towards the crash at the bottom
Where I began

Late night phone calls
Your voice seems unconcerned
I'm pulling my hair out
One for every word
Is it all imagination
I can only wish
Wouldn't be the first time that I've been so confused

Is it in my head?

[Chorus]

Time keeps counting down on me
Or is it just a dream

[Chorus]",In My Head
Madcap,"Get that out of your head
Is what they told me now
They tried to clip my wings
Keep my feet on the ground
But I've got something they can never have
I've got heart, I've got love tonight

[Chorus]
And it won't die
No matter what they do
It won't die
No matter what they do
It won't die
No matter what they do

Take your phony ideals and get 'em out of my face
Because I do what I want and not what others say
I've got heart, I've got soul tonight

[Chorus]

Get up get out, the said to me
There ain't no sense in chasing dreams
But I've got something they can never have
I've got heart, I've got faith tonight

[Chorus]",It Won't Die
Madcap,"Tonight there's gonna be trouble all around
From the midtown lights to the lifeless towns
Yeah, tonight we're gonna rock, we're gonna roll
I don't wanna hear it, you're coming with me
You got nothing to do and nowhere you gotta be
Cause tonight nothing gets in our way
Cause I don't wanna hear about bills to pay
No I don't wanna hear about that
Cause when the radio is on and the music is playing

[Chorus:]
I just wanna keep dancin'
Keep dancin'

It's getting kinda late doesn't work for me
Cause tonight is gonna burn for the world to see
Yeah, tonight we're gonna rock, we're gonna roll
I'm tired of the back stab, I'm tired of the scene
If there's something to be said then you say it to me
Cause tonight nothing gets in my way
Now the devil's gonna end up looking like a saint
Cause stop ain't the word to be said
Cause when the radio is on and the music's playing

[Chorus]

No I don't wanna hear about work today
No I don't wanna hear about that
Cause when the DJs on and the music's pumping

[Chorus]",Keep Dancin'
Madcap,"Every time I look at you I want to kill, want to kill
Stranger things that I would do to make you feel the way I feel
Its just that I have been broken so many thousand times
And every time I start again I wonder why, wonder why
Its been such a hard year, it won't ever change
My heart isn't cold now
Its not what it seems because
You say to me my heart feels far away
I'm lovesick now
Every time you look at me I want to die, want to die
Stranger things that I would say to make you feel the way I feel
Its just that I have been broken so many thousand times
And every time I start again I wonder why, wonder why
Its been such a hard year, it won't ever change
My heart isn't cold now
Its not what it seems because
You say to me my heart feels far away
Now day by day
I start to realize nothing's gonna change
So I became
It doesn't really matter anyway
Its not what it seems to me
because
You say to me my heart feels far away
I'm lovesick now",Lovesick
Madcap,"Midnight strikes, but I can't close my eyes
These dreams of mine keep me sweating all night
It's hard to see this gift slip away from me
Like water down the drain you watch it slip away
Daylight is closing in on me, it's closing in on me
It's closing in on me
Life brings another day
For some sunlight, others rain
What will it hold for me
There's hope my cards have not been seen

[Chorus]
You know your heart will carry you through
It's all you need and all you ever will
And when the rain comes falling at night
You'll find it warm wherever you feel right
Where you feel right
When midnight strikes

A bright light shines through a crack in a well closed blind
And so the sun reminds, to all those counting time
Start over again
Watch the sun fall from the sky
And when the smallest noise seems loud
You'll know midnight's struck

[Chorus]

And when it's fall down upon your head now
You'll find me there with cover drawn
So close your eyes because night is on the way now
You know you'll lie awake
When midnight strikes again",Midnight Strikes
Madcap,"Sometimes it's hard to see good times ahead for you
With all this hate and greed getting in the way
You should come ride with me
I know a place for free
We can run and hide
Through the day and night
New York or LA
Downtown's the place for hearts like ours
Together we're free
We'll run you and me through the city tonight
Somewhere in the city tonight

[Chorus]
Somewhere in the city tonight
We'll hide on
We'll be alright

Let's run the streets near 25th
Watch the fog roll over that golden gate
There's time tonight and nothing we can lose
New York or LA
Downtown's the place for hearts like ours
Together we're free
We'll run you and me through the city tonight
Somewhere in the city tonight

[Chorus]",Somewhere in the City
Madcap,"We've been fighting way too long now
I don't know if I want to give in or up
The never knowing of it's really starting to bug 
One day it's sun then the next day's full of clouds
You never know what you want to do

So this is me telling you

[Chorus]
You're so up, down, turnaround
Every which way, make up your mind
Up, down, turnaround
Movin' to the left, movin' to the right
Come on, come on you're making me crazy

We've been trying hard not to talk of it
But everywhere we go it rears it;s ugly head
Sometimes a broken heart is the price that you've goota pay
For a love that can sometimes taste so sweet
You never know what you want to do

So this is me telling you

[Chorus]

You're not happy until I'm unhappy... why?

You never know what you want to do
So this is me telling you

[Chorus]",Turnaround
Madcap,"Through eyes made of glass I watch her
Always in focus I snap away
Like a spider I crawl through the places
No one really wants to be
Paid money to bring home the bad news
About that lipstick you've never seen
And the red dress... oh how cute
She is such a bad girl, you better believe

She is under suspicion
She is under suspicion but you don't wanna hear about it

Out of the office, right to the motel
Always in focus I snap away
Close your door while she's closing the oven
Both cooking underneath the heat
Paid money to bring home the bad news
He ain't getting paid for working late
One more meal alone in the house now
He's such a bad boy, you better believe

He is under suspicion 
He is under suspicion but you don't wanna hear about it

Decisions get made, some bad, some good
But don't make a mistake, cause I'll be there
And now I have them, I've got them
Snap away

Through moonlight shadows I watch them
Listen through the sounds of a pouring rain
One on the balcony, the other in a backseat
Both think the other is home fast asleep
Paid money to bring home the bad news
It's not what it seems but it never is
Mommy and daddy made mistakes like they all do
But they didn't know I was watching them

They are under suspicion
They are undersuspicion
And they don't wanna hear about it",Under Suspicion
Madcap,"I can't stand this for another day
What kind of fool do you think I am?
You sit and stare like you see through me
But you know nothing of the way I live
When you were young were you just like me
A grim future but you didn't care
Now I can tell by the threads on you
You took a turn to stability
But that's okay, because that is you and this is me

[Chorus]
For me, it's a dirty world
For me, it's a doubtful world
For me
You can't control my feet now I'm dancin' to the beat
For me, it's a dirty world
For me, it's a doubtful world
For me, it's a time to speak
It's a youth explosion

Do anything that you wanna do
Go anywhere that you wanna go
Don't need permission like the rest of them
If this is loud then you're too old
When you were young were you just like me
A grim future but you didn't care
Now I can tell by the threads on you
You took a turn to stability
But that's okay, cause that is you and this is me

[Chorus]

Now the radio just ain't the same
And the tube airs nothing for me
So I spend a lot of time in my head
Where at least I know I'm free

Madcat & Kane,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out darling

Riding high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, cause I had everything
Walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

So why anytime I bleed, you let me go
Anytime I feed you get me know
Anytime I see you let me know
But, I plan and see just let me go

I`m on my knees when I'm (beggin'g)
Cause I don't want to lose (you)
I got my arms on spread
And I hope that my heart gets fed, matter of fact girl I'm beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out darling

I need you, (yeah) to understand
Tried so hard
To be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell
I used to be
Shadow of my life
Was hangin' over me

A broken man
That I don't know
Won't even stand the devils dance
To win my soul

Why we chewing, why we chasing
Why the bottom, why the basement
Why we got good shit don't embrace it
Why the feel for the need to replace me
Your the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint in a picture telling where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it the away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walking on, keep opening doors
Keep hoping for that the door is yours
Keep also home, cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl I am beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out darling

I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
Just can't make it
All alone (all alone)

I'm holding on
I can't fall back
I'm just a calm
'Bout to fade to black

And I can't come home

Anytime I seek, ya let me know

Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replacement?

Madcon,"When we broke up
Found out that you were cheating on me
And when we broke up
I was happy to watch you leave
And find another lover
I thought I wouldn't care then last that weekend when I saw you
I saw you standing there

And I thought that it was over, but it isn't
Just a little liquid courage got me wishing
Now my friends tell me I shouldn't go out drinking
But there's nothing I can do, party now

Got a little drunk last night
And I don't know what I said to you

At 4am I started texting you

And it really got me thinking

They told me that time would heal it
Said ""nothing I can't deal with""
But still recall the feeling of how we used to be
I'm good in life and though you ain't
The one I 'pposed to be with
And one thing is to know but it's another thing to see
Spotted you with your man out, added a couple of drinks
Put me into my feelings and spat out a couple things
Probably outta place but at least it was fucking honest
Nothing more I relate to than hearing my brother say

And I thought that it was over, but it isn't
Just a little liquid courage got me wishing
Now my friends tell me I shouldn't go out drinking
But there's nothing I can do, party now

Maddy Prior,"It's fifty long springtimes since she was a bride,
But still you may see her at each Whitsuntide
In a dress of white linen with ribbons of green,
As green as her memories of loving.

The feet that were nimble tread carefully now,
As gentle a measure as age will allow,
Through groves of white blossoms, by fields of young corn,
Where once she was pledged to her true-love.

The fields they stand empty, the hedges grow (go) free--
No young men to turn them or pastures go see (seed)
They are gone where the forest of oak trees before
Have gone, to be wasted in battle.

Down from the green farmlands and from their loved ones
Marched husbands and brothers and fathers and sons.
There's a fine roll of honor where the Maypole once stood,
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun.

There's a straight row of houses in these latter days
All covering the downs where the sheep used to graze.
There's a field of red poppies (a gift from the Queen)
But the ladies remember at Whitsun,
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun.

The holly bears a blossom
As white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To be our sweet Saviour
O the rising of the sun
And the running of the deer

As red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To do poor sinners good

By your leave, we will sing concerning our king

In ribbons so rare, no king can compare

We have travelled many miles, over hedges and stiles
In search of our king, unto you we bring

We have powder and shot to conquer the lot
we have cannon and ball to conquer them all

And we bid you adieu, great joy to the new","The King [Soundcheck Rehearsal, Adelaide-1982]"
Maddy Prior,"The priests go down to the river to fish for Friday's meal
The King is brooding day and night
Black with hate, cursing fate
To be ill when the foe is in sight.

The priests they kneel in the chancel in solemn peaceful prayer
The King is laughing, grim and slow
Three brothers die, he hung them high
On a gibbet they died a cruel show.

The priests they crouch o'er their books and scratch away at history
The King he rises from his bed
Leads his men, rides again
But before he sees the border he is dead.

The priests they walk in procession with the coffin of state
The King he leaves his work undone
It is his fate, despite his hate
That his foe lives on to fight his son.",Lanercost [UK Single B-Side-1985]

Show up wit a gang of cars
Valet to parley straight to the bar
Woo skinned suits Timberland boots
Spend enough loot when Made Men come through
We ball wit the ballas all bout dollers
Floss 10 G's in gems round they collars
Luxury life bring a buggin device

On a average night might bag ya wife
And make off like a thief with a bag of ice
Box in my goochie watch blow tight

Thought I'd step out one night
I longed to get the thrilling life I've missed
I met a youth 
A bit uncouth
Although he seemed alright
I knew him by the moment when we kissed

Then I got home, next day with a swollen head
My girlfriend asked if I'd had fun I said,
""Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
Did momma give me hell?
Did I get a thrill?
Am I full of quiver?
Was he rough?
Did I care?
Am I glad I fell?
Every time I think of him do I shiver?
Was he hot?
And was I?
And would he stand for maybe?
He would not?
Did I lie?
Does he still think I'm a baby?
If I was, am I still?
Do I care?
Don't be silly
Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
And did momma give me hell?

Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
Did momma give me hell?
With his hands loose as no refusin'
Did he fight?
Was I blue?
Almost shamed to tell
And I don't know yet the system he was usin'

Well I said, stop, please, behave!
Well what's the use of breathin'?
He said, give
So I gave
After all, what was I savin'?
Am I glad?

Have I had fun, you're askin' me?

That push and shove and won't bend to your will 
I'll keep them still 

Drink up, baby 
Look at the stars
And I'll kiss you again 
Between the bars 
Where I'm seeing you there 
With your hands in the air 
Waiting to finally be caught 

Drink up one more time 
And I'll make you mine 
And keep you apart 
Deep in my heart 
Separate from the rest 
Where I like you the best 
Keep the things you forgot 

The people you've been before 
That you don't want around anymore 
That push and shove and won't bend to your will 
I'll keep them still",Between the Bars
Madeleine Peyroux,"Love, oh love, oh careless love, 
You fly though my head like wine 
You've wrecked the life 
Of many a poor girl 
And you let me spoil this life of mine 

Love, oh love, oh careless love, 
In your clutches of desire 
You've made me break a many true vow 
Then you set my very soul on fire 

Love, oh love, oh careless love, 
All my happiness bereft 
'Cause you've filled my heart with weary old blues 
Now I'm walkin' talkin' to myself 

Love, oh love, oh careless love, 
Trusted you now it's too late 
You've made me throw my old friend down 
That's why I sing this song of hate 

Love, oh love, oh careless love, 
Night and day I weep and moan 
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine 
For my sins till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love
Madeleine Peyroux,"Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin 
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in

Let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone 
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon 
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of 

Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on 
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long 
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above 

Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born 
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn 
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn 

Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin 
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in

Lord, I've been waitin' so long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet daddy please come home

The snow falls 'round my window
But it can't chill my heart
Lord knows it died the day you left
My dream world fell apart

Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' so long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet daddy please come home
No, sweet daddy please come home

Through tears I watch young lovers
As they go strollin' by
And of all the things that might have been
God forgive me if I cry

Madeleine Peyroux,"I've seen love go by my door 
It's never been this close before 
Never been so easy or so slow 
Been shooting in the dark too long 
When something's not right it's wrong 
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go 

Dragon clouds so high above 
I've only known careless love, 
It's always hit me from below. 
This time around it's more correct 
Right on target, so direct, 
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go 

Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, 
Crimson hair across your face, 
You could make me cry if you don't know. 
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of 
You might be spoilin' me too much, love, 
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go 

Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy, 
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme, 
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy, 
I could stay with you forever 
And never realize the time. 

Situations have ended sad, 
Relationships have all been bad. 
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud. 
But there's no way I can compare 
All those scenes to this affair, 
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go 

You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing, 
Staying far behind without you. 
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying, 
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to. 

I'll look for you in old Honolulu, 
San Francisco and Ashtabula, 
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know. 
But I'll see you in the sky above, 
In the tall grass, in the ones I love, 
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.",You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go
Madeleine Peyroux,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Back Yard

Every time I hear your name
Tears begin to fall
Every time I hear your name

I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
Oh no, I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm just a jealous guy.

I was feeling insecure you might not love me anymore.
I was shivering inside,

Madeleine Peyroux,"Well you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

And you got paid on Friday
And your pockets are jingling
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruising with a six
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Trying to wipe out every trace
All the other days
In the week you know that this'll be the Saturday
You're reachin' your peak

Stopping on the red
You're going on the green
Tonight'll be like nothing
You've ever seen
You're barreling down the boulevard
Looking for the heart of Saturday night

Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin
Telephone's ringing; it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smiling from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
You're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
Now you're stumbling
You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night
Now you're stumbling
You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night",(Looking For) The Heart of Saturday Night

Far away, far away
A song that's fading

Put me on a plane tomorrow
I'll try to run from all my sorrow
Far away, far away
From endless waiting

It's so cold here without my sun
I'm so sad here, far away from everyone
What a fool to be ambitious
Moving here with all of my wishes
Far away, far away
From where my heart is

Shut the phone off and pack my bags
No more boys who boast and brag
Far away, far away
Where I belong

I'm so sorry for some things I've done
I'll be lonely till I can see my only one

Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees

Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile

Madeleine Peyroux,"The summer wind
Came blowing in
From across the sea
It lingered there
So warm and fair
To walk with me
All summer long
We sang a song
And strolled on golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind

Like painted kites
Those days and nights
Went flyin' by
The world was new
Beneath a blue
Umbrella sky
Then softer than
A piper man
One day it called to you
And I lost you
To the summer wind

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
Have come and gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on
And guess who sighs her lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickle friend
The summer wind
The summer wind",The Summer Wind
Madeleine Peyroux,"I remember what my daddy taught me
'Bout how one risky is in a cold ditch
And one more thing about good and evil
You can't tell which is which

Well, if the rest is lost and history
Or maybe wasted on a fool like me
And that these bare bones
Would leave me something after all

Old Hamlet's done now, dead and gone
And there's no ghost who walks
Poor [Incomprehensible] tells you everything he knows
With no tongue to talk

It seems the truth is hidden where the sun don't shine
And I'm never certain if it's their's or mine
It's just the bare bones
They give you that much after all

They preached the gospel down in [Incomprehensible]
They preached it in school
It never made much sense to me
Wonder if it was supposed to

You go on down a millionaires road
Watch a while, tell me what do you see
The truth itself, nothing but a gamble
It might or might not set you free

I guess, my old man was hard to read
And I don't really know what I believed
But in these bare bones
There's something lovely after all
",Bare Bones
Madeleine Peyroux,"My heart is like a hand me down
Made soft by older brothers
My body is like my father's house
The sin of generations

Damn the circumstances
Life is hard enough
Damn the bones that rattle
Faith is good enough

You shook the ground beneath my feet
My hopes turned into water
The house came crashing down on me
In the early morning hours 

Damn the circumstances
Life is hard enough
Damn the bones that rattle
Faith is good enough

Now the lines are drawn
And we sleep in rags at dust
Where all good will is gone
And the dreams we had went bust

Damn the circumstances
Life is hard enough
Damn the bones that rattle
Faith is good enough",Damn The Circumstances
Madeleine Peyroux,"I put on my gloves tonight, pull onto the road to San Berdu
They remind me of hustlers, confidence men, and you
My hands are warm beneath them, and easy on the wheel
Without your love and treachery the calm is all I feel

I shiver in the mirror, pull my belt across my hips
The leather's hard in bending as your fingers to my lips
I wrap it tightly in defense as if your arms were near
But for your love and treachery there's nothing left to fear

I'll take a glass of wine and recall the words you spoke
From the bottom of your cup, covered in spit and smoke
But in your voice I'll hear my own and recognize the crime
That all your love and treachery has ended up as mine

I see you in the rearview with just a passing glance
How your eyes shine, as if through mine, you'd see and understand
As if we'd played each other but never knew the score
And all was love and treachery but isn't anymore
That all was love and treachery but isn't anymore.
",Love And Treachery
Madeleine Peyroux,"Can I buy you something, can I stroke your hair,
Can I hold your hand and take you somewhere?
You're a young nobody, you're a perfect soul,
You're an empty altar that can make me whole.
Can I take you somewhere, can I wipe your tears,
Can I fill your pockets or befriend you here?
You're the final offer for the men who call,
My highest hiding place, our lady of Pigalle.

Will you be ascending in this midnight heat
On a flying buttress with stony feet?
In the revolutions we tear down your walls and then
Redeem you, reclaim you, our lady of Pigalle.

You're a young nobody, I'm a passing glance
In the mad injustice of eternal romance;
Beloved, broken into and caressed,
You will bridge the waters and I'll give you rest.
In the early hours when the streetlights fade,
For my inquisition and my last crusade,
You'll be savior, a reason for it all
And I'll be blessed and favored, our lady of Pigalle.

Will you be ascending in this midnight heat
On a flying buttress with stony feet?
In the revolutions we tear down your walls and then
Redeem you, reclaim you, our Lady of Pigalle.

Up to the places of your heart where souls wrestle angels in the dark
Ten thousand years the scent of life bottled up in you child,
You're driving men wild!

Can I buy you something, can I wash your feet,
Can I read you poems of my thirsty retreat?
I'm a young nobody, I'm a perfect soul,
I can take you in, I can make you whole.

On a flying buttress with stony feet?

Madeleine Peyroux,"Stop all this talk, turn off the telephone
Open up another bottle, send those people home
Let it get real quiet, turn that lamp way down low
I'm gonna float down this river of tears

I remember how we spoke on the days he was dry
Even now that he's gone he can make a woman cry
But he saw through me deaf dumb and blind
He knew his way down this river of tears

""Dashed hopes and best intentions"" people say
He could sit and drink the way a monk could pray
So grab that silver flask, pour yourself another glass and
Watch me rage down this river of tears

Turn out the stars now, darken every one
Watch the clouds cover that big yellow moon
Close the blinds, mute the sun
There's nowhere left to run

Picked up that old decanter that he used to drink from
Turned on his stereo just to hear it hum
Daddy I'm gonna wrap myself in blankets and listen to you sing
And I'm gonna float down this river of tears
",River Of Tears
Madeleine Peyroux,"Wide awake
Breath taken
I'm shaken by my sight
Couldn't sleep
Couldn't keep
Quiet secrets on the wind I hear

There's somethin' grand coming
Cool lumming
Through my empty city
On a night breeze so free lovers must collide
And the morning sun must rise

All is forgiven

Cool your heads
Highway men
Come what name in
Who run and fight
Here's your drink
Time to think
Soon you'll wandering away your fears

There's somethin' grand coming
Cool strumming
Through my empty city
'til the morning breaks
And the weary eyes are clear
Let the dreams of sleep take troubles far away from me

There's somethin' grand coming
Cool strumming
Through my empty city
'til the new day breaks
And weary eyes are clear
Dream of sleep take troubles far away from me

You can't do me, you can't do me, you can't do me the way you did before ?
'Cause when you do, and when you do, 'cause when you do, you know I get so blue!
When you do, and when you do, 'cause when you do, you know I get so blue and I go

Lost like a Chinese war baby ? gone, gone, gone!
Blewed like a Mississippi sharecropper, screwed like a high-school cheerleader,
Tattooed like a popeyed sailorman ? gone, gone, gone!

I should have been, I should have been, I should have been a pair of ragged claws.
I should have been, I should have been, I should have been a pair of ragged claws.
And for a while, for just a while, for a good long while you'd see me smile, smile, smile
I'd crawl the seas on my bony knees, no apologies for my brave new style. I wouldn't go
Bust like an internet millionaire, boom like a Lebanese belly-dancer,
Bang like a new year's firecracker ? gone, gone, gone! I wouldn't get
Bent like a rattan rockin' chair, blanked like a last place also ran,
Burned like an Arkansas griddlecake ? gone, gone, gone!

I should have been, I should have been, I should have been a pair of ragged claws.
And if I was, if I was, if I was then I'd complain no more.
And for a while, for just a while, for a good long while you'd see me smile, smile, smile.
I'd crawl the seas, on my bony knees, no apologies for my brave new style.
I wouldn't get ?

Wrecked like a rebel on a racetrack, jacked like a '51 Cadillac,
Macked like a bunny in a mansion ? gone, gone, gone!
Spitooned like an Alabama 'backy wad, harpooned in a Melville sailor yard,
Cartooned like a Charlie Brown Christmas card ? gone, gone, gone!

Schooled like a milk money bully whip, sued like a teenage downloader,
Unglued like a bull in a china shop ? gone, gone, gone!
Cranked like a speed freak high-roller, yanked like a little league ball swatter,
Spanked like a fly on a bar counter ? gone, gone, gone!

Duked like a pistol whipped card swapper, rebuked like a Bible Belt border crosser
Juked like a payola chart topper ? gone, gone, gone!

And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads

Planted on their columns now that binds me

Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you are moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from the gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a-rufflin'cold cowl
A dirty hat pulled low across my face

Madeline Bell,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Madeline Bell,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Madeline Bell,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before

I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My lips could move and talk

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

It's plain to see
We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

I'm yours, you're mine
And in our hearts
The happy ending starts

This world will be
With a world of love in store

I must hang around you

And I love too?

Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love

To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but
This time the dreams on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be

Madeline MacNeil,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Madeline Vergari,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)

There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give

ils ont peur de perdre c'qu'ils sont.
si tu tends bien les yeux tu peux les voir

dans l'espace emmitouflés dans des gants
y'a des gars qu'ont peur de perdre leurs doigts
ils sont coinçés là
dans l'espace les satellites sont des arrêts d'bus
où passent les étoiles filantes
des étoiles fuyantes
elles transportent l'espoir
sans même s'arrêter
nous on est coinçés là
on les voit filer

même dans les trous noirs on fait peur à voir
les météorites changent de trajectoire
on les voit passer
on n'ose plus jouer avec l'apesanteur
chaque soir on rêve de jours meilleurs
dans l'espace de nos têtes

alors on attend les étoiles filantes
qu'elles tissent pour nous l'horizon
ultra droit ultra stable
on a tellement peur d'être malades

et on s'emballe à la vitesse grand v
un rien nous touche on se fait ultra inquiets
on vire ultra violets ultra tremblants

He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The butterflies, I know you felt them too
I can still taste your lips
That night I wrapped up all my love in you
But deep inside I always knew
The sadness around you was deadly
I must hate myself
'Cause I also knew one day you'll destroy me

But there's something I've got to know
(Before we say goodbye)
Will I ever see you again?
(Somewhere in another life)

I remember our first fight
Your skeletons were all up over you
I can still taste that night
When you told me you'd been beat up and abused
You'd hide it all
Bruised mouths don't talk
It's not your fault
It was never your fault
It's an evil world for an innocent girl
It's not your fault
It was never your fault

But there's something I've got to know
(Before we say goodbye)
Will I ever see you again?
(Somewhere in another life)
I'm going to try to be okay
(But I need you to know)

But you said forever
You promised forever

I've forgiven you
And now I just miss you
I'll always remember you

Memories aren't clear
I lost touch with the boy I knew
While you were still here

Have you met your god?
Does he know I'm in pain?
Does he even have any plans
For me to see you again?

Morning sadness
So we meet again
Pack your bags 'cause we're leaving
Tonight

Damage done by a lost loved one
You can never forget
Questioning my faith in God
I know evil exists

So I look past the sky
It's where we're going tonight

Morning sadness
So we meet again
Pack your bags 'cause we're leaving
Tonight
On a mission to find her in heaven
Maybe we'll get to sleep next to God tonight

There's a razor with my name
It carves my life away
And I'll find out who's real
Right now

Morning sadness
So we meet again
Pack your bags 'cause we're leaving

To untie the pain
From a heart that has suffered

Madina Lake,"""Now Or Never""

Too long in the same place
I'm sinking into this town.
I've charmed the same old snakes
I think we gotta get out
Before I break away from me
This place is my lobotomy.
Imagine we were dead
Counting all the things we never did.

I remember when you told me
I should live like I'm dying
Not to close my eyes
While everything burns.

What are we waiting for?
These years are dying slowly,
Today is still in front of us
And we're breaking out
'cause today is now or never.

I can't contemplate the earth
All while my heads in the sand
'cause I've been buried alive
So take my bleeding hands
And breathe life into me
'cause right now I'm suffocating.
I imagine we were dead
Counting all the things we never did.

I remember when you told me
I should live like I'm dying
And not to close my eyes while
Everything burns.

What are we waiting for?
These years are dying slowly,
Today is still in front of us
And we're breaking out
'cause today is now or never.

I don't want a life of agony
I won't be another tragedy
And close my eyes while everything burns.
And I won't pretend I don't exist
Invisible until I turn to dust,
Open your eyes we're still alive.

Standing still is criminal
And never lasts forever.
The safest place in life is now,
Today's the day we're breaking out..

I remember when you told me
I should live like I'm dying
And not to close my eyes
While everything burns.

What are we waiting for?
These years are dying slowly,
Today is still in front of us
And we're breaking out
'cause today is now or never.

But you know that I'm spoken for
The way your sweat drips off your chest
You know that I'm wanting more

the lust, the sex, the heat, this sweat
And nothing else matters
You call my name without your dress

I already forgot her
You have no idea what you do to me 
And you, you have no idea what your doing to me

Pandora, I don't know how you carved your way into my heart
And I don't know how you snuck your way into my house
But I know that I'll regret what I did
And I know I'll regret it forever as I throw my life away, Pandora

the girl I love sits at home and I know that she's lonely
But I'm watching you take off your clothes
Your the star of this movie
The love the hate the guilt my fate is hanging in the balance
You have no idea what you do to me (Pandora)
Oh you don't even care what you mean to me

And I don't know how you snuck your way into my house
But I know that I'll regret what I did
And I know I'll regret it forever as I throw my life away, Pandora

and by the time that I come home she's already sleeping
Sit on the bed and take off my clothes
My nerves their shaking
The lies the sex the heat this sweat
Your body is quaking
The love the hate the guilt my fate
Against this temptress

They dig in your bones if you let them, they won't let go
They have no hope
They have no soul if you let them they'll take yours

I think it feels better on the other side
Cause their grass is green and your grass is diseased
Every day drowns in lethargy but to be content is to burn your way

They dig in your bones if you let them, they won't let go
They have no hope
They have no soul if you let them they'll take yours

when you die you want the world to remember you for who you really are
And when you die you want to love yourself cause you'll be all alone

They dig in your bones if you let them, they won't let go

She hangs herself with them as I try to disconnect
She wants to choke on her life again
Breathing it in like a deadly poison.

She cries cause she's lost and she doesn't even know what she wants
And Her eyes grow cold and she begs the world to just let her go

(But I won't let her go)

She lives and breathes in a world that brought her to her knees
And now I'm addicted to her 'cause that girl is just like me
And I'm gonna choke on her life again
Breathing it in like a deadly poison.
I just wana get through to her,
Before her last breath.

She cries cause she's lost and she doesn't even know what she wants
And Her eyes grow cold and she begs the world to just let her go

She cries cause she's lost and she doesn't even know what she wants
And she hides all alone inside the pain that she won't let go
Watching her life pass her by, watching it all through her watering eyes
But I'll be chasing dragonflies from her darkest skies until the day she dies.

I'm sick of this crowd, we are getting out!

I wanna go where there's no one here we know,
Where stars glitter like a 70's disco.
Come on, come on
I say ""Let's get outta here!""

We're gonna go where we have no worries,
Wet beaches and dry martinis.
Come on, come on
I say ""Let's get outta here!""
We're gonna go where we live out loud,
You know we're sick of this crowd.
Come on, come on
Let's get outta here!
Let's get outta here!
Let's get outta here!",Let's Get Outta Here
Madina Lake,"Sometimes I feel like I'm from another world,
And everything I want in life seems impossible.
Cause people they'll tear you apart.
But in the bottom of our hearts,
The dream's alive inside.
And we won't forget

So we say

You can't break, can't change, can't take us down.
(We run this town)
We'll stand, we'll fight, set fires all night.
(You'll never take us alive)
Wa oh oh oh oh oh

(You'll never take us alive)
Wa oh oh oh oh oh

For the last time I'll give myself to the enemy,
By letting their words just walk all over me.
Cause people they'll tear you apart,
If you are not like them.
And we are different.
Let the war begin.

So we say

You can't break, can't change, can't take us down.
(We run this town)
We'll stand, we'll fight, set fires all night.

There's no fear inside.
This is our time, no giving up.
When we connect our hearts, to our minds,
There's no stopping us.

So we say

You can't break, can't change, can't take us down.

What it's like to love
Yourself from the inside out

You don't have to hate the world
You don't have to walk alone

When you think the skies are falling down

Madina Lake,"I woke up to a dream passing by.
It was the middle of the night.
Was I awake? Was I asleep?
What was I doing outside?

I saw a man walk from the trees
He came and sat next to me
He said, ""Boy, if you don't follow your dreams,
You'll be dead someday. Just like me.""
Then he got up and walked away
And I started to think.
He turned around, I saw his face
And I looked deep in his eyes,
And I realized that man was me.

You're not for this world,
This world is for you
And now is the time.
(There's no tomorrow!)
So make the most of every day
While you're alive
(Stand for something!)

I contemplate my every day
And everything I've been afraid to change.
Never good enough, (promptly too late?),
Always excuses away.
I used to think if I never tried,
I would never fail.
Now I realize, I can do anything.

You're not for this world,
This world is for you
And now is the time.
(There's no tomorrow!)
So make the most of every day
While you're alive
(Stand for something!)

Too little too late
And then you die
And no one even knows your name.
Don't let your light fight from your heart
Your heart gives you the best advice.

Believe!
Believe!

You're not for this world,
This world is for you
And now is the time.

You know when alive is alive
And I can???t believe just how much I've been missing by being away from myself
You've shown how to live out each day
And really embrace every hour of each day sharing with somebody else

You've mastered the art of living
Embracing every day for yourself
When it comes down to it I look to you and no one else

I'm finally turning things around
It's nice to feel my feet on the ground
I can't thank you enough for this
You taught me what is living

You know when alive is alive
And I can't believe just how much I've been missing
By being away from myself
You've shown how to live out each day
To really embrace every hour of each day sharing with somebody else",When Alive Is Alive

I stumble fall fall to my knees
crawl to my knees and run away
I run away
I want no pain

The words you used you said before
You said to every other girl
You opened up your heart to me
You've taken mine to watch it bleed
I Stumble Fall

I look at you I cannot breathe I cannot breathe
You changed my soul
You changed my soul and made me weak
I run away
I want no pain

I stumble fall you made me weak
you changed my soul fall to my knees

Madita,"IÂ'd like to stay
But IÂ'm feeling very sorry for you
Life is too strange
I will not reply
Your easy flowing letter
Never ask why
You didnÂ't catch the matter

I tint your old tie and put in your cupboard for sometime
I brew you some caj
I should not forget to drink mine
I darn your old tights
In case of some lonely cold nights
DonÂ't show any tries
Just wanted to make myself satisfied

Maybe one day
We will talk about the weather
All rainy days passed by
Growing again
The touch of your hand above my
Heart and the kissing is tearing us apart

I tint your old tie
And put in your cupboard for sometime
I brew you some caj
I should not forget to drink mine
I darn your old tights
In case of some lonely cold nights
DonÂ't show any tries
Just wanted to make myself satisfied

Madita,"Something´s going wrong
For so long, wrong direction
You caught me so strong
Once upon with self-reflection

But I feel so alone, in my home, in my role
No wonder you go when I want you so strong

Something must be done
One by one new obsession
But keep yourself calm
Ask your mum with no protection

But I feel so alone, in my home, in my role
No wonder you go when I want you so strong",A Letter to You

Is thrilling me right

Of childhood in my mind

wanna be wise
Gonna survive
Reasons divided
By the tear in my eye

And what will you do",Mood

I go and don't want to be reminded at all
And though tonight you want me on your side
I go and donÂ´t want to be in your mind at all

My arms grow want to catch but air
My first thought how does look my hair

Soon I´ll be there wherever you need
It´s alright and it´s alright

tonight I want you to see clear
For all time you are my closest dear

Too many secrets that we share,

Madlib,"Slammin
Half a thang of heron in the bathroom
Keep an ak and the backup in the backroom
Cook a meal clean and she suck me like a vacuum
Took a vacation to the county, I'll be back soon
Sent a couple zero's, money on my j-pay
Payin off the c-o's, smoking on the gateway
Word around the block when I was locked she gave my thang away
Bout to have a baby with a nigga, thats what they say (they say)
Damn
Well please say it ain't so
Took off the glove, say it's love when it ain't though
Her classmate was coming over, that was strange though
Apparently the homework ain't all he came for
Maybe yous a stank ho, maybe that's a bit mean
Maybe you grew up and I'm still living like I'm sixteen
Like a child running wild in these sick streets
Man I put that bitch up on her feet, she cut a nigga deep

Damn
Bitch
That's why I treat these hoes the way I treat em
That's deeper than a motherfucker baby, know what I'm sayin

Slammin!
Smack it up and flip it, then I rub it down
Zip it up, and then I ship it to another town
Smokin hella weed while me and Willie bust a couple pounds
She used to like that type of shit, now we don't fuck around
Girl you used to say them other niggas wasn't hood enough
Got your hood degree, now niggas from the hood ain't good enough
Bitch you wasn't trippin when that old school was pullin up
You was short on ends at your college, you would put em up (put em up)
Well bitch I'm out here puttin on
I hope you feel the pain I'm feelin when you hear this song
Don't want a nigga that's gonna slang shit up in your home
But you ran off and got engaged, man that shit was wrong
All to a nigga that dont got nothin that I ain't got
Only difference is he trying to be a fuckin astronaut
Saw this pussy nigga when I walked up in the barber shop
Green as a leaf, lookin sweet, that cut a nigga deep

Damn
So these the type of niggas you fuckin with now baby?
Square ass motherfucker, you used to love a thug nigga

Uh
I loved her and she loved him, so I never touched him
She's got his baby in the oven, so it's mother fuck him
Ain't trippin cuz you got a nigga, I just think you rushin
But leavin him to be with me ain't part of our discussion
Plus I'm on the road now, different color hoes now
Layed back on the dope, I'm getting dollars off my shows now
Bitches wanna tie me down, but I ain't in that mode now
Five years later, why you calling up my phone now? (phone now)
Well bitch, how you get the number?
Like every other month I'm switching up that motherfucker
Back on the bus I used to finger fuck her singing Usher
Down on my luck and then she upped and left me for a sucker
I reminisce on all the crazy shit we did
You and me forever, shit we say when we was kids
She say I'm havin problems and I pray that he forgive
When he find out the baby ain't his, that cut a nigga deep

Damn
What the fuck?
What you trying to say baby?
The baby ain't his?
Who's is it?",Deeper
Madlib,"Yeah, Allah the merciful, the beneficent
Curse over blessing, pray it be heaven sent
Forgive me, my dirty deeds was desperate
Fuck the government, I got my own deficit
Death to me the only thing that's definite
Money rule the world, but when you dead that shit's irrelevant
Fingers numb from coka selling, no vote, but out for presidents
Granny found my dope, I told her I would stop for selling it
Nigga please -- she knew I was lying before I even spoke it
Empty promises left them all broken
She said Jamel, I can tell your perspective out of focus
You too obsessed with the liquor, bitches and weed smoking
A young nigga that's been thugging since the old days
Promise I've done seen everything but old age
Pray my demons never catch up from my old ways
Keep the heat cause I was going through a cold phase
Uh yeah
Keep the heat cause I was going through a cold phase
Promise I've done seen everything but old age

Surviving off cold cuts and cold Spam
Can't see eye to eye with my old man
Hiding my insecurities with this gang flag
We both despise the police, but he wore the same badge
And as I child I admired that, now I wonder how
He was a pig, but you was barely making 20 thou
I guess that's why you put me on that lick for 20 pounds
A life of crime is all we ever shared from then to now
And I'm a crook and you crooked, that's all we got in common
He chunked the deuce to my mama, so much for family bonding
But how could something so destined to be just get demolished?
Running through groupies and whoppers, I guess I got it honest
And honestly I know I'm out here fucking up
Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts
And seven bucks an hour wasn't good enough
Cause seven days a week I'm living in a rush
Seven days a week I'm living in a rush
Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts

And the money was the root to what the evil is
It's mandatory for me to live
I hustle harder than the next dude
Remember, everybody is out to get you
Niggas don't respect to live and let live
So I pack a .40 caliber cause that's how shit is
Out here, no fear, fuck feelings
Trigger man rule, that's the art of drug dealing
I'm trying to stack my money to the ceiling
No new friends, don't wanna talk about old business
Sex on the beach, sipping Guinness
With a bitch so thick she can't take no dick
Imagine working grave-yard shifts
Lost friends steady talking that shit
A million a day is for minimum wage
Work a nigga like a slave 'til he put him in his grave
Frail moments, same page

Seven grams of rock, I stuff 'em in my nuts)",Broken

This bed is cold, tonight
Pictures of you
I've lost in my time
Devil may cry

Appena mi sveglio sto dentro la ruota
E' da un po'che non ti sento non sento la moka
Sono off la mia casa è una bettola nota
Ho la colf non so mai dove metto la droga
Ora che c'ho un po'di grana e fama è risaputo
Che la gente è strana mi infama e poi mi saluta
Mo che l'abito fa il monaco ho I crampi allo stomaco
Crisi di panico l'alito che sa di sambuca
Gli occhi li ripeto di non piangere
Chiuso in casa come fossi in carcere
Col fuso di Los Angeles
So bene come ci si sente al margine
Ma più sono fragile più scrivo perle magiche
Prendo a calci
Tu immaginati un ciclo
Di giorni come pagine di un libro
Un bivio dove la via più facile è il suicidio
Da solo al buio dentro la voragine
Ho ingerito un bambino
Costretto a diventare cattivo

Devil may cry
This bed is cold, tonight
Pictures of you
I've lost in my time

Nella retta via mica ci cadi dentro
Non è terapia sto rap è accanimento
Sto in camera mia mi fumo un clarinetto
Mi alimento come il fuoco mille gradi dentro
Piscio nella vasca di un hotel di lusso
Per spiegarti quanto poco basta che poi perdi il gusto
Io sono brutto sono tutto tranne un bell'imbusto
Ma nelle mutande ho sempre un bell'imbusto
Questa tipa faccio finta che mi vuole bene
Dopo mi scordo come si chiama e anche da dove viene
Poi mi fumo più di un grammo e mangio come viene
Non so da quando c'avrò le valvole del cuore piene
Mo a chi mi rinfaccia I soldi faccio boccacce
Perchè gli rompevo il culo pure low budget
Guardami e rifatti gli occhi, collagene
Quando spicco il volo non piangere
Ciao

A sfamare sto cancro dentro
Che ora non ho più un argomento
Che ora che quando salgo scendo
E anche se adesso sto in alto al caldo sopra il palcoscenico
Ho un cuore di marmo e sto sudando gelido

Pago in contanti
Fisso gli istanti
Ragiono a scatti
Come le foto
Tutto mi arriva un po'dopo

Io sono mille forse, mica le risposte alle domande che temo di pormi
Mica sono scritte grosse, vedo tinte fosche, vedo un cielo che è pieno di corvi
Ora vado con troie a caso, il mio amore da mo che è morto
Il mio cuore non lo incolli è un puzzle, se ti dico ti amo ho tre droghe in corpo
E mi sento un tot in colpa, tipo un autogol in coppa
Ma alla fine poco importa

Volevo stare bene e dare tutto a te
Ma riesco solo a bere e neanche so il perché
Ti sorrido e dentro sono triste
Ciò che cerco forse non esiste

Volevo stare bene e dare tutto a te
Ma riesco solo a bere e neanche so il perché
Ti sorrido e dentro sono triste
Ciò che cerco forse non esiste

Il tempo va veloce, non gira
Ora che vado a letto alle sei, anche se so, che non ci sei
Dopo che prendo le gocce mi spengo, sento la tua voce e sospira
Tu per me eri una crocerossina, io per te ero un'atroce tossina
L'ultima storia mi ha reso uno straccio, era in salita
Alla fine ti ho avuta ma tu sei sparita, eri come un miraggio
Viaggio in hangover, col sole di maggio
Gli occhi, le ? Di sesso selvaggio
Gli stessi forse, lo stesso disagio, forse per questo mi faccio
Perchè c'ho un peso nel cuore che è un pezzo di ghiaccio
Oggi ti scrivo random, il tempo passa, te ne invio un altro
Rimpicciolisce la stanza, quest'ansia mi sta divorando
Ho un difetto ma non posso mai aggiustarlo
Ho una fitta come un morso, nel miocardio
Cambio tipo mare mosso, poi di nuovo calmo
Quando ho le tue mani addosso nel mio palmo
È lampante e chiaro, ogni amante è un baro
Io ho seguito il faro che porta lontano
Ho trovato un diamante raro
Ti nascondo poi ti porto a farti incastonare
Guarda il mondo che si fotto dalla mia astronave

Volevo stare bene e dare tutto a te
Ma riesco solo a bere e neanche so il perché
Ti sorrido e dentro sono triste
Ciò che cerco forse non esiste

Madman,"Sai che la mia merda è forte come il crack
Il flow sfonda porte, corre come in crank
Quando droppo un'altra track senti il botto tipo patatrac 
Patatrac, patatrac

Io col rap non t'insegno, t'imparo
E non è che lascio il segno, ti impalo
E non è che faccio il culo brò, dilanio
E non è che faccio il duro, il flow è titanio
Rimani calmo, tanto non colmi il divario
Rimani calvo come di vaio, di canio
Dammi tutto quello che c'è in palio
O per il grano mi spacco il cranio come supermario
Sì, sicario siriano, picchia tipo titano, o pinta con gin chiaro
Una hit a ogni spliff che attorcigliamo
Con la click nel tuo timpano cicchiamo
Non facciamo roba finta, non quittiamo
Perché a darti la partita vinta non ci stiamo
Giriamo la quinta come icaro, ci issiamo
Ci batti nel calendario inca o egiziano
Zero facce da star
Parlavo coi fra, di come farcela al bar
Ora mangiamo, lasciamo mance da zar
Te devi levà dar cazzo, devi facce passà
Salto, rappo e il palco rimbalza
Spacco, becco un sacco di cassa, tu un pacco di pasta
Ho un flow da arresto ma è in grazia di stato
Perché sopra al beat sono in stato di grazia
La mia roba torna anche da morta, samsara
Tu nel rap hai vita corta, sei una zanzara
Vado finché non collasso, ho tipo la smania
Passo e non vi lascio un cazzo tipo taz mania
Esco con l'album e spacco la piazza
Bevo fin quando ti sbratto la tazza
Sto così fatto che in bocca ho un impasto 
E c'ho il cazzo che è un arto fantasma

Sai che la mia merda è forte come il crack
Il flow sfonda porte, corre come in crank
Quando droppo un'altra track senti il botto tipo
Patatrac, patatrac, patatrac

Non mi fotti col tuo flow, M knows better
Il tuo rapper preferito perché non smette
Le sue barre cancellate dal mio solvente
Le sue cagne accecate dal mio gold member
Molte erbe come propellente
Tu diventi verde come Denver
Non puoi fare niente, sono il top dei rapper
Non mi batterebbe neanche un doppelganger
Sono bullet proof, sono duke nukem
Spacco sul subwoofer, non su tumblr
Io sono un berretto verde, tu uno sturmtruppen
Manco ti reputo un rapper, sei uno youtuber
Sono crudo chef rubio
Tu venduto per per un rublo, ti hanno fottuto
L'anno dopo nessuno che si ricorda come dopo il rufus
Frate in pratica è stato uno stupro
Spingo troppo finchè doppio il suono
fumo l'oppio e chiudo gli occhi Yokohama
Killo flow, se rappo sono un mitra con le dita sputo colpi 
Boko haram
Questa tipa sta con quello ma non se lo caga
Gliela porto via col vento rossella o'hara
Bianca panna sammontana
Un culo da samoana
Tanta roba, ciao, sayonara
Guardami salire quando vado in major
Ho già fatto troppe rime sono stato lercio
Questi devono capire che lo stile che io padroneggio
È la merda che non sta in commercio
Frate' la mia mente è reattiva
Perché la svolta qua te la prendi, non è che arriva
Io sto in alto mare, te a riva
Non mi batti neanche se ti inietti creatina nella vena creativa!

Che le ho dato un nome si chiama Roxana
E non è il nome di qualche puttana
Fa solo rima con xanax
L'ho preso senza ricetta
Da un amico che ne ha fatto incetta e lo rigetta
Mo che per qualsiasi cosa c'è una fonte certa
Alza la colletta, droga a casa ti aspetta
Milano come Gotham, il diavolo che ti sfiora la gota
La coca, carioca, infame, iscariota, la ruota
La gente bionica è riprodotta
La gioia psico-indotta
Tonica e Wiborowka

Tu vai in giro col puzzone, frà, c'hai l'erba gatta
Sai che è tutto quanto finto proprio come un wrestlers
Anche oggi hai fatto un dritto con il Pony Express
Dice che c'è un tipo, ha tipo un bazar
La guarda ti dice il taglio, tipo Shazam
Sto dal pusher mentre conta i soldi e
Ci sta un tipo, tipo non parlarne con mia moglie
Se ne avanza un passo, un sasso dentro al portafogli e
Sa che la droga da, che la droga toglie
Io ogni mattina cartina e caffè
Fumo un grammo a colazione, due prima del thè
Quando schiaccio play risento ogni rima per tre

Ci sono stato un anno e qualche mese
Per questo conosco tutte le droghe, pero' non parlo inglese
Non contiamo le spese, in un giorno parte un mese
Cominci felice finisci in storie più tese
In qualunque paese tu vada la trovi
Qui la vende Ali Babà e i quaranta ladroni
Un giro in città, vedo il buio, sento il vuoto
Ma che lucidità, frate neanche ho messo in moto
Fammi pubblicità, dillo a tutti, me ne fotto
20 grammi di charas, imboscati qui sotto
Sulla traccia, fuoco, magma

Un paio di tette tra i pollici e il palmo
Droghe sigarette e narcotici random

Madman,"Come cazzo va?
A sedici anni mi volevano muto e composto
Ma I grandi facevano tutto l'opposto
Poi ho imparato bene che tutto ha un costo
E se c'è il verde è tutto apposto
Ti è mai capitato fra
Ti hanno chiesto mai sei pazzo?
Un secondo prima che stai decollando
Io una vita che non sento altro
Merde che ti guardano dall'alto in basso
(Succhiatemi ancora il cazzo)
Poi mi sono rotto il cazzo ho detto li sorpasso
Senza avere la sirena pure senza clacson
Posso fottere il sistema pure senza password
Mi sentivo sfrecciare tra la gente in coda
Dentro al centro commerciale con la mente vuota
Quando pompo dallo stereo c'ha la pelle doca
Frate è come stare su un aereo quando perde quota
Su-sulle voragini mai prese strade più facili
La notte in giro coi grandi
Di giorno dormivo sui banchi
Pensano sei stanco ti immagini?
Ora che ho il cash a tre zeri
Tutte ste puttane, Tezenis
E mi sveglio allora che voglio
Ora che mi riempio il portafoglio con il textedit
Volevamo essere I primi come dei pionieri
Ma non siamo nati ricchi come petrolieri
Fatti coi tatoo e coi piercing coi problemi
In strada tanti Misfits coi poteri

Dalla merda fino al primo posto
Ora mi conosci pure se non ti conosco
Sbrano questa cena fino all'osso
Stappo il vino rosso
Finche è tutto apposto
Stappo il vino rosso finche è tutto apposto
Faccio un tiro grosso finche è tutto apposto
Parlano di me ma per me è tutto apposto
Se c'è il verde è tutto apposto

Tutto apposto
Soldi nella tasca sì ma pochi
Prima andavo avanti come Steve Aoki
Chiudo la porta così questi non mi fottono nemmeno da tergo
Tiro su due mani nel mio letto d'albergo
Panetta da due piani io c'ho un etto a castello
Così non penso alle occasioni che non mi hanno dato
Chiuso in casa con lo stomaco annodato
Uccido questa scena chiama l'avvocato
Tu prendi un bus compagno con la bussola
Che mi sono perso in mezzo a ste due big boobs
Sei confuso tipo anziano con un ictus
Tu fai schifo quindi esploderai con il pus
(Ora tutto questo per me)
Cerco di restare calmo ma spesso il cervello mi sbotta
Il mondo va al contrario infatti vede un sacco di vermi con l'uccello in bocca
(Quindi non giocare con me)
Non ho scheletri ho solo quest'indoor chiusa negli armadi
Qua tutto apposto ora fra sono il capo
E tu qua batti il capo solo quando cadi

Sotto il riflettore tipo Truman Show 
Giovane terrone tipo Puglia Shore

Ma se serve mi trapiantano un rene 
Giro con la gente con cui stecco 10 grammi 
Da quando c’avevo 13 anni 
Con cui ho imparato con le guardie come comportarmi 
E i pezzi di merda come evitarli 
Fumo questa per medicarmi 
Menti deliranti 
Sempre pronti per la merda e per i party 
Il flow è alieno la gente si pensa che ho i contatti con la N.A.S.A. 
Invece ho una delivery giù in plaza 
Take away prendi e porta a casa 
La mia testa gratta il cielo 
Chiediti chi rappa il vero 
Il pezzo di merda che entra sulla traccia tre anni dopo e la uccide ancora 
Pappappero

Not very rich, but never any poorer
Jaunty old george, a happy sixty-three
Not very tall, but healthier than me
He whistles timeless tunes as he saunters down the street
Springs in his legs and elastic in his feet

But in the middle of the night
He steals through your garden
Gives your hosiery a fright
And doesn't say pardon
As soft as a breeze
With an arm full of underwear
On his hands and knees
Dreams about the knicker scare

Hello there george, newsagent on the corner
How's the old car, yes the climate's getting warmer
Chatty old george as you get your morning paper
Read about the knicker thief, underwear taker
Bids you 'good day', as you wander out the door
Never closes early, always cleans the floor

But when darkness hits the town
And there's washing on your line
Get your knickers down
Before the dreaded sign
When the clock strikes eight
And you're snuggled up in bed
He'll be at the garden gate
Filling underwear with dread

Nice man george, newsagent on the corner
He was closed today, maybe gone to mow the lawn
I had to go further down the road to get me current bun
Hello, isn't that george on page one?
No, it couldn't be, but yes, it is

Well, as you can see we've got a new recruit to this land of hope and glory
Hands behind backs and legs apart and tell us all of your unfortunate story
Who me, sir?
Yes, you sir!
I was an innocent man till someone grassed me of a plan
Of earning some big-a-money
If I hadn't mouthed it about, I am sure without doubt
I'd 'ave missed this land of hope and glory

I suggest you eat what's given you even if it doesn't agree with you
'Cause it's all you're be getting up until twelve-thirty
In-between it's time to stay up in your room, you can dream of life's good things
Two years of my teen age life given to this stand-to-attention life
Of land of hope and glory
I get so bored as time goes by, I think I'll do something dirty
I pick at the floor for juicy butts and I'll make myself a smoke
A bog roll and envelope stick-it, all this helps to pass my time
As the evening drags on, you can watch a little telly
Hot Gossip pans people with a little bit of belly
Hot drink served cold with the heat of yesterday
Don't complain, learn the game and you'll get through another day
I watch the second hand on the clock at long-last, it's nine thirty
Off to bed, straight to sleep as I leave this land of hope and glory
But only for a few seconds am I in ecstasy

Not very rich, but never any poorer,
Jaunty old george, a happy sixty-three,
Not very tall, but healthier than me.
He whistles timeless tunes as he saunters down the street,
Springs in his legs and elastic in his feet.

But in the middle of the night,
He steals through your garden,
Gives your hosiery a fright,
And doesn't say pardon.
As soft as a breeze,
With an arm full of underwear,
On his hands and knees,
Dreams about the knicker scare.

Hello there george, newsagent on the corner,
How's the old car, yes the climate's getting warmer,
Chatty old george as you get your morning paper,
Read about the knicker thief, underwear taker.
Bids you 'good day', as you wander out the door,
Never closes early, always cleans the floor.

But when darkness hits the town,
And there's washing on your line,
Get your knickers down,
Before the dreaded sign.
When the clock strikes eight,
And you're snuggled up in bed,
He'll be at the garden gate,
Filling underwear with dread.

Nice man george, newsagent on the corner,
He was closed today, maybe gone to mow the lawn,
I had to go further down the road to get me current bun,
Hello - isn't that george on page one ?
No it couldn't be, but yes it is,
Difficult to see from these photofits.

But they are after him,
Of that you can be sure,
They've called him on the phone,
They've knocked on his door.
A-but he's gone away,
Gone to stay with some mates,
He got the papers early,
And saw his own face.","In the Middle of the Night [Rehearsal Tape, 1979]"

No turning back the door's already shutting
Standing on his tiptoes to reach the nineteenth button

Set off down the westend on our usual spree.
Things were as normal for an hour or so,
Then my nimble hands were a bit too slow.
Two store detectives made a fast approach,
One grabbed my jacket (you're nicked!)
The other grabbed my throat.
So they caught me at last, one said with joy:
""You'll have to do some time, my light fingered boy!""

If only I'd remembered my common sense,
They captured me red-handed with evidence.
If I go to the manager and say I'm sorry,
Maybe he'll forgive me for my youthful folly.

But what will me social worker say,
If I don't come home today?
He'll give me a clout!
What if they don't let me out?
I told him I'm on me own!
Don't they understand?
I'm from a broken home!

I'll tell them I'm the product of a broken home,
And I always went out on my own.
Was it too late to say I'd pay,
And I'll never steal again 'till the end of my days?

It was the best job I ever had
Until some blokes on their bikes came through
Said ""Come on down the Youth Club and see what's new""
Well come on, come on, come on

Went to the dance like they said I should
It cost three bob, but it was quite good
The band were jumpin' and a-jivin' around
Their twenty-watt amps really made a sound
Well come on, come on, come on

Well, I'll have a cup of tea and then I'll change my name
And I'll put my records o-ah-o-ah-on
Till all the geezers in the flat complain
Wish that rock star bloke was gone (instrument!)

Sold all my records and I bought a bike
I found some blokes who do what I like
I saw the vicar who ran the hall
He said we can rehearse there any time at all
Well come on, come on, come on

Stops to whisper with the shadows but still keeps me in his sight
I shout at passing strangers but they don't seem aware
Don't want to get involved in my spiritual affair

I feel him brewing up an evil curse
I sense a chill creep up my spine

And makes no sound he stirs them to the ground

Madonna,"Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel

Madonna,"You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy

Some boys hug me
I think they're ok
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (that's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance
Some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause we're living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world

Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world

You know that we are living in a material world

I wanted more than just a one night stand
He had a way of making me believe
That he was mine and that he'd never leave

Madonna,"Como puede ser verdad

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Madonna,"Make love not war we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight
But not with guns and knives
We've got to save the lives
Of every boy and girl
That grows up in this world

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

They think that love's a lie
But we can teach them how to try
Love means to understand
Reach out for someone's hand
'Cause everything you do
Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

We've got to take a stand (Love makes the world go round)
Love makes the world go round
(If you don't hear the sound) Love makes the world go round)

Don't judge a man 'til you've been standin' in his shoes
You know that we're all so quick to look away
'Cause it's the easy thing to do
You know that what I say is true

Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round

Make love not war we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand

You make me want to hang my head down and cry

You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say
Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart with the key

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Open your heart, I'll make you love me

Open your heart to me, darlin'

Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know
Like a train you'd come and I'd lose my place

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

I've had a map laid out from the day I was born
But the roads are blocked and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

My conscience is clear I know right from wrong
That's a lie, I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky

Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

Madonna,"Spotlight, shine bright
Tonight, spotlight

No one knows you better than you know yourself
Do the thing you want don't wait for someone else

Spotlight, this world is yours and mine

When you feel the rhythm, I'll be by your side

Madonna,"For thou art the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory
Forever and ever. Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee,
Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy...

Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishment
But most of all, because I have offended Thee, oh my God
Who art all good and deserving of all my love.
I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace
To confess my sins, to do penance, to amend my life,
And to avoid the temptations of evil.

Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishment
But most of all, because my God, I have offended Thee
Who art all good
Like I knew you would
And deserving of all my love
I reserve, I reserve, I reserve
I reserve, I resolve
I have a reservation
I have a reservation!

Madonna,"Baby face don't grow so fast
Make a special wish that will always last
Rub this magic lantern
He will make your dreams come true for you

Ride the rainbow to the other side
Catch a falling star and then take a ride
To the river that sings and the clover that
Brings good luck to you, it's all true

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade

If the land of make believe
Is inside your heart it will never leave
There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait
And dancing moons, for you

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade

Your dreams are made inside the love parade
It's a holiday inside the love parade

On the merry-go-round of lovers and white turtle doves
Leprechauns floating by, this is your lullaby
Sugarplum fingertips kissing your honey lips
Close your eyes sleepy head, is it time for your bed
Never forget what I said, hang on you're already there

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade",Dear Jessie
Madonna,"Keep, keep it together forever, together
Keep people together forever, together
Keep people together forever, together
Keep people together forever, together

I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face
I'm tired of sharing all the hand me downs
To get attention I must always be the clown
I want to be different, I want to be on my own
But Daddy said listen, you will always have a home

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I hit the big time but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just givin' to get something
Always wanting something back
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker than any other circumstance

Keep, keep it together forever, keep it together
Keep people together forever, together

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker than any other circumstance

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever",Keep It Together
Madonna,"Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there, just like a prayer",Like a Prayer
Madonna,"Je suis prete. Est-ce que vous etes pret, aussi?

Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind
Oh no baby my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind
Don't go givin' me one of your lines

Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run seem to have all the fun
But are you wasting my time -- she's so fine
Are you just being kind

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
That's how I feel, don't fog my mind

Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Love song, love song
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know
That this is not a love song that I want to sing",Love Song
Madonna,"Little girl don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one who felt all the pain

Little girl never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try, it's not the same

Keep your head held high, ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care

Little girl don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss, kiss her goodbye

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
I was afraid you'd go away, too

Little girl you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try, but it feels like a lie

Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on, but I'm doing it wrong
Can't kiss her goodbye, but I promise to try",Promise to Try
Madonna,"I know for sure his heart is here with me
Though I wish him back, I know he cannot see
My hands trembling, I know he hears me sing

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand; at least he was a man

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?

You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight but we cannot win this blind
Stand your guns against the wall
Who's next in line to fall

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?",Spanish Eyes
Madonna,"Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't,
'Cause you don't love me no more

You need so much but not from me
Turn your back in my hour of need
Something's wrong but you pretend you don't see
I think I interrupt your life
When you laugh it cuts me just like a knife
I'm not your friend, I'm just your little wife

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

The bruises they will fade away
You hit so hard with the things you say
I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows
You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that, she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore

He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts the fight, she starts the lie
But what is true, when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay, here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that, she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore

He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts the fight, she starts the lie
But what is true when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

She's had enough, she says the end
But she'll come back, she knows it then
A chance to start it all again

Madonna,"I'm gonna show you that good guys don't always win
I'm gonna show you the brighter side of living in sin.
So when you're six feet under, you won't wonder why
Just 'cause you got a halo don't mean that you can fly.
If you thought it was over, you're way off track
You made a blunder, and

You put me back, back in business,
This ain't no hit or miss, I'm gonna get my way.
'Cause you put me back, back in business,
You're my first witness, and I'm here to stay.

I'm gonna show you good guys always finish last
Speaking of virtue, being nice is a thing of the past.
When I want something done, I'll say it with a gun
Just 'cause you're an angel don't mean you're having fun.
I just wanted to thank you for what you lack
Hope they don't hang you, 'cause...

You put me back, back in business,
This ain't no hit or miss, I'm gonna get my way.
'Cause you put me back, back in business,
You're my first witness, and I'm here to stay.

A tisket, a tasket, you've lost your yellow basket.

I just wanted to thank you for what you lack
Hope they don't hang you, 'cause...

Give me a hand and I'll take a bow.
He's back in business now
Bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah.
He's coming back in style

Madonna,"My guy is really something, he's sensitive and shy
My guy is such a bumpkin, it doesn't take much to make him cry.
If you hurt someone helpless, it's like taking away all his toys,
He's just a cry baby boy.

My guy is sentimental, he's always feeling blue
He can be so temperamental and I don't know what I should do.
If you step on a little bug he cries all over the floor,
He's just a cry baby bore.

[Chorus]
I don't want to hurt his feelings,
But his outbursts have me really
Boo-hoo-hoo-ing all the time,
If I turn out like him, I think I'm gonna cry, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la,
He's such a cry baby,
La, la, la, la, la, la.

And I'll tell you something else

My guy is such a wet noodle, he's always teary-eyed
He acts like a real cock-a-doodle, he can't even tell you why.
If you just play him a sappy song, he acts like his doggie just died,
He's just a cry baby guy.

No kidding, oh dear

My guy is such a whiner, he's worse than baddie so
A cockroach seen in the diner, and the tears flow out of the blue.
And if I ask him to knock it off, he goes and cries in the can,
He's such a cry baby man.

[Chorus]

I love a cry baby,
La, la, la, la, la, la.
He's such a cry baby,
La, la, la, la, la, la.

Would you knock it off please? Thank you.",Cry Baby
Madonna,"Come over here!

Some girls, they like candy, and others, they like to grind,
I'll settle for the back of your hand somewhere on my behind.
Treat me like I'm a bad girl, even when I'm being good to you,
I don't want you to thank me, you can just spank me. 

Some guys like to sweet talk, and others, they like to tease,
Tie my hands behind my back and, oh, I'm in ecstasy.
Don't slobber me with kisses, I can get that from my sisters,
Before I get too cranky, you better

Madonna,"All work and no play,
Makes Dick a dull dull boy, career gets in the way.
Square jaw, ooo, such a handsome face,
Why do you have to save the human race?

Life of crime, no it never pays,
Clean up the streets and make your secret get-away.
All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, had to let her go.

You're a man with a gun in your hand,
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun

All boss and no brains,
Bullies and thugs, they take up all your time in vain.
Can't let go, someone cries and you hear the call,
Who's gonna catch you, don't good guys ever fall?

All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, I would never let you go.

Madonna,"Hola! Ese bato loco!

I'm going bananas,
And I feel like my poor little mind is being devoured by piranhas,
For I'm going bananas.

I'm non compos mentes,
And I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist,
For I'm non compos mentes.

Who knows?
Could be the tropic heat
Or something that I eat,
That makes me gonzo.
I do carry on so, for I'm going bananas,
Someone book me a room in the hot haciendo with all my mananas
For I'm going bananas.

I'm going meshuga
All day long there's a man in my brain incessently playing ""Booga wooga"",
But I'm going meshuga.

There's bats in my belfry.
Won't you make sure this straightjacket's tight,
Otherwise I might get myself free.
Yes, there's bats in my belfry.

Who knows?
Could be the wine I drink
Or it's the way I think,
That makes me gonzo.

Madonna,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,
Which was fine with me.
Because I had rhythm, music, love,
The sun, the stars and the moon above,
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.
That was when the best things in life were free.

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,
Which is fine with me.
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,
But look at what I got to go with 'em.
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.

Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!

Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score.
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition
I find counting a bore.
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.
[More! More!]

I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue,
Now, however, I own the view.
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more.

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four,
And if you like four, why not a few
Why not a slew
[More! More!]

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
[More! More!]

Never say when, never stop at plenty,
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.
[More! More!]

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar.
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less.
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more more
[Except all, all, all]
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all [have it all]
You may find all else above [find all else above]
That though things are bliss,
There's one thing you miss, and that's
More! More!
More! More! More! More!
More! More! More!",More

Madonna,"Seems I've played the game for much too long
I let people buy my love and I
Never got to sing my songs for you

I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love you pay your dues

Say that happiness cannot be measured
And a little pain can bring you all life's little pleasures
What a joke

I was not your woman, I was not your friend
But you gave me something to remember
No other man said love yourself
Nobody else can
We weren't meant to be
At least not in this lifetime
But you gave me something to remember
I hear you still say, love yourself

I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love I've paid my dues

Guess I'm waiting for my place in your sun
Wish I had the chance to know you and it wasn't stormy weather
What a shame, who's to blame?

I was not your woman, I was not your friend
But you gave me something to remember
No other man said love yourself
Nobody else can
We weren't meant to be
At least not in this lifetime
But you gave me something to remember
I hear you still say, love yourself",Something to Remember
Madonna,"Sooner or later you're gonna be mine,
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine.
Baby, it's time that you face it,
I always get my man.

Sooner or later you're gonna decide,
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide.
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter.

Baby, you're mine on a platter,
I always get my man.

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me.
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me.
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again.
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when.

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen.
I'm counting to ten, and then ...

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known,
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone.
Sooner is better than later but lover,
I'll hover, I'll plan.

Only the blues
Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
Say it to her, what can you lose?

Maybe though she knows

As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door

Well, if she does
Those are the dues
Once the words are spoken
Something may be broken
Still, you love her

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself",Express Yourself
Madonna,"I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat 
Incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Hoo, like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine 
And you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Whoa
Whoa, ah
Whoa

You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
'Till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel

Madonna,"It's funny that way, you can get used
To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father I have sinned

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away
Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away

Maybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good by myself",Oh Father
Madonna,"I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

With you I'm not a little girl
With you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me
Comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious
You see that I am weak
You see that I am silly
And pretentious and a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could be
A person that loves me

Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe) I'm drowning
Baby throw out your rope

With you I'm not a fascist
Can't play you like a toy
And when I need to dominate
You're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry
For a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart
When she's demanding
You bring me to my knees
While I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer
And deliver and despise
And right while I am standing there
I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe) I'm drowning
Baby throw out your rope

Love is understanding
It's hard to believe
Life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an S.O.S.
Stop me from drowning
Baby I'll do the rest

Rescue me (rescue me)
Your love has given me hope (your love has given me hope)
Rescue me (rescue me) I'm drowning
Baby throw out your rope

Rescue me (rescue me)
Your love has given me hope (your love has given me hope)
Rescue me (rescue me) I'm drowning
Baby throw out your rope (baby throw out the rope)

Ooh aah, ooh aah, love is understanding
Ooh aah, ooh, aah love is understanding

Love is understanding
It's hard to believe
Life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an S.O.S.
Rescue me, rescue me

It's not my business to decide
How good you are for me
How valuable you are
And what the world can see
Only that you try to understand me
And have the courage
To love me for me

I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe (I believe that you can rescue me)

I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe (I believe that you can rescue me)

I'm saying I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe (I believe that you can rescue me)

I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me baby
This I know 'cause it's

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh so many times
Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love was all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear
I said

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you

'Cause it's true love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you

No more sadness, I kiss it good-bye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love, it's

You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do.","Deeper and Deeper [Shep's Classic 12""]"
Madonna,"Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter

[Chorus:]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me

[Bridge:]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

[Chorus:]
The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

[Bridge]
[Chorus:]

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

[Bridge]
[Chorus:]

Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
[Repeat]

You got to just let your body move to the music
You got to just let your body go with the flow

Madonna,"Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of
I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do, I don't want to feel blue

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy

Something's happened and I can't go back
I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me
What happens now, I know I don't deserve you
I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you
Can't bring myself to let you go

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start

Madonna,"This is not a love song
Bye bye baby

I keep on waiting, anticipating
But I can't wait forever
You say you love me
You're thinking of me
But we're never together

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
This time we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

You had your chances
All your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you

What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?

I don't want to keep the bright flame
Of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowin' in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adios

Uh, this is not a love song

I'd like to hurt you

What excites you? What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say goodbye
Bye bye

The first time and the last time
You can forget about it baby
Forget the rules, forget the fools
Forget your fears, forget my tears
You can forget about it baby, bye bye baby bye bye
You can forget about it baby

You'll ever see me cry

Madonna,"Tick tick tock, Mo is on the jock
I did her in the limo as we went around the block
Sucked the mole on her hip, licked the lipstick off her lip
She got real excited, yo she started to flip
She says 'Dre baby 'Dre baby oh
I said just relax, yo chill Mo
We made a right turn onto Central Park West
One hand gripped the car, the other on her breast

(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it

Walkin' around showing off their hinies
Wigglin' they're jigglin' they're swingin' and flingin'
9-7-0 Yo Ho, your phone's ringin'
You get a call from your John, you meet him at the mot'
He's chillin' in a pamper and a fur coat
Your head starts spinnin', you drunk too much gin in
Your jaw starts grinnin', and this is the beginnin'
Of a night of an average Ho
It ain't all about working on the streets no more
Here's another episode of dropping off a load
Peter was on the beater, I was about to explode
I couldn't hold back (so what did you do)
I took 'er to my place (yo, did she sit on your face)
She was so good just like uh, Campbell's soup
I won't try to front so here's the rude scoop
I dipped it and I stripped it and I ripped it like before
I had her screamin', nope no diddily, nope no more
I can't stop once I get started
But yo honey, uh, get them legs parted

They come with the rough stuff, boy we hit it, split it, and forget it
In the same order as ya hear, boy I'm not frontin'
Me not front, don't ask what, me tell ya the truth, you understand me eye?
The iron eye can get busy, you know what I'm saying?
Clean up me rifle, clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, me elephant rifle
Clean up me rifle, you clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, elephant rifle

I flipped her from the top of my head, enough said
I'm the brother with the short short dreads
A couple different styles, a couple different 'fros
Just some that my souls about some girls I know
I gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto
And I cover up the moans by turnin' up my stereo

If I'm in charge and I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild

You give me fever

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
Listen to me baby, hear every word I say
No one can love you the way I do
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
Bless my soul I love you, take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago

Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie baby, you're my flame

'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight

Fever when he holds me tight

That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene

Had a very mad affair

Madonna,"Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only twenty three
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

What for?
Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
He said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case
Ignorance is not bliss

Have you ever watched a grown man cry (what for)
Some say that life isn't fair (what for)
I say that people just don't care (what for)
They'd rather turn the other way (what for)
And wait for this thing to go away (what for)

Madonna,"In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess
Will I still be thirsty
Will I pass the test
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
'Cause I'm not supposed to see
'Cause the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

I still believe, I still believe
'Cause after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
'Cause the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
It's in my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

Somewhere in fountain blue
Lies my secret garden",Secret Garden

When you didn't feel like running from your feelings like you are now
What happened? What do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Break my heart (waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (just waiting)

Break my heart (waiting for you)
Don't break my heart

Break my heart (waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (just waiting)

Break my heart (waiting for you)
You broke my heart
You broke my heart (waiting for you, just waiting)
You broke my heart

Madonna,"I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about

I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you
In case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Now what could be better than a home cooked meal
How you want to eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want and you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that
It's not fair to be selfish or stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Colonel Sanders says it best
""Finger lickin' good""
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood
Are you still hungry
Aren't you glad you came
I'm glad you brought your rain coat
I think it's beginning to rain

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is
That's where my love is
Come inside, that's where all life begins
It's warm inside",Where Life Begins

Madonna,"Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

You think you're so smart
You try to manipulate me
You try to humiliate with your words
You think you're so chic
You write me beautiful letters
You think you're so much better than me

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

You think you're so shrewd
You try to bring me low
You try to gain control with your words

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

Friends they tried to warn me about you
He has good manners, he's so romantic
But he'll only make you blue
How can I explain to them
How could they know
I'm in love with your words
Your words

You think you're so sly
I caught you at your game
You will not bring me shame with your words

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

Too much blinding light
Your touch, I've grown tired of your (words)
Words, words

A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation (words)
Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
In short, a lie
A message from heaven, a signal from hell
I give you my word I'll never tell
Language that is used in anger
Personal feelings signaling danger
A brief remark, an utterance, information (I've grown tired of your words)
Don't mince words, don't be evasive
Speak your mind, be persuasive
A pledge, a commitment, communication, words",Words

Madonna,"Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein
For the time is near

He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him

Those of you who have not learned
What some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works, I know your toil
And your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men

But have tested those who call themselves apostles
But are not and found them to be false
I know that you are enduring patiently
And bearing out for my namesake

And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned the love you had

I know your tribulation and your poverty
And the slander of those who say
That they are Jews but they are not
They are a synagogue of Satan
Do not fear what you are about to suffer
Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping, praying for you to justify my love

And I saw a beast rising out of the sea
With ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bears

And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power
And his throne, and great authority
One of his heads had a mortal wound
But it seemed to have a mortal wound that was healed
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder

Men worshiped the dragon
For he had given his authority to the beast
And they worshiped the beast saying
""Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?""

And the beast was given a
Mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words
And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous words against God

It was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it in vain

If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping

Then, I saw a new heaven and a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying
""Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them and they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them

He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For these things will have passed away

To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son

But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone""

And he said to me, he said to me
""Do not seal up the words of the prophecy
For the time is near, let the evildoers still do evil
And the filthy still be filthy
And the righteous still do right
And the holy still be holy""

""Behold, I am coming soon
I am the alpha and the omega
The first and the last
The beginning and the end""

Amen

Madonna,"Just one kiss on my lips
Was all it took to seal the future
Just one look from your eyes
Was like a certain kind of torture

Once upon a time
There was a boy
And there was a girl

Just one touch from your hands
Was all it took to make me falter

Forbidden love
Are we supposed to be together
Forbidden love
Forbidden love
Forbidden love
We seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love
Forbidden love

Just one smile on your face
Was all it took to change my fortune
Just one word from your mouth
Was all I needed to be certain

Once upon a time
There was a boy
There was a girl
Hearts that intertwine
They lived in a different kind of world

Forbidden love
Are we supposed to be together
Forbidden love
Forbidden love
Forbidden love
We seal the destiny forever

Sometimes I think that I made you up
But wouldn't it be better if I gave you up?

Are you surprised?

Tell me whatch-ya want, tell me whatch-ya need
Tell me whatch-ya want, tell me whatch-ya need
I, I betcha I, I give you whatch-ya need
Take a walk within me, venture through the dark sea
Can't you see, I need you beside me
Don't you see, I want you to want me

Madonna,"I can't stop thinking of you
The things we used to do
The secrets we once shared
I'll always find them there
In my memories

But this heartache isn't going anywhere
In the public eye I act like I don't care
When there's no one watching me
I'm crying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

I keep a picture of you
Next to my bed at night
And when I wake up scared
I know I'll find you there
Watching over me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

You'll always be inside of my heart
Inside of me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love still carries on

(I will always feel you)
You'll always be inside of my heart
I'll always have you inside of me
(I will always have you)",Inside of Me
Madonna,"Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow

Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life
Who needs the sky
It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life
Who needs the sky, when the ground's open wide
It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs a smile, when a tear's so full of love
Who needs a home, with the stars up above
It's here in your heart I want to be carried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the light, with the darkness in your eyes
Who needs to sleep, with the stars in the sky
It's here in your soul I want to be married
You are my sanctuary

And the earth was void and empty
And darkness was upon the face of the earth
Is all of this pain so necessary
You are my sanctuary

Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow
As the water follows the moon, silently

Who needs the sun (With fluid steps)
Who needs the sky (Around the globe)
Who needs to sleep (I hear your voice)
You are (You are) my sanctuary
You are (You are, you are)
You are (You are) my sanctuary",Sanctuary
Madonna,"I wanna kiss you in Paris

For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

Talk to me, tell me your dreams, am I in them?
Tell me your fears, are you scared?
Tell me your stories, I'm not afraid of who you are, we can fly

Poor is the man whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I wanna be your baby, yeah

You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever lovin' anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

Madonna,"Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Light are low, the curtains down
There's no one here (There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)

Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around (No one around)
Watching you, watching me,
One lonely star (One lonely star you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

Say good-bye (Bye bye), say good-bye

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart (Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile,
All the world loves a clown (Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played (Role that you played)
No more masquerade,
You're one lonely star (One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

Say good-bye (Bye bye), say good-bye

All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart

I've always been in love with you (I've always been in love with you)
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

Say good-bye (Bye bye), say good-bye
Say good-bye",Take a Bow

And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go

'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibi
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I never
I never
I never
I never",Drowned World/Substitute for Love [BT and Sasha's Bucklodge Ashram Rem]
Madonna,"Sky fits heaven so fly it
That's what the prophet said to me
Child fits mother so hold your baby tight
That's what my future could see

Fate fits karma so use it
That's what the wise man said to me
Love fits virtue so hold on to the light
That's what our future will be

Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go

Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go

Hand fits giving so do it
That's what the Gospel said to me
Life fits living so let your judgments go
That's how our future should be

Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go
I think I'll follow my heart

Madonna,"I ran from my house
That cannot contain me
From the man that I cannot keep
From my mother who haunts me
Even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets

I ran to the treetops
I ran to the sky
Out to the lake
Into the rain
That matted my hair
And soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and ran
I was looking for me
I ran past the churches
And the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards
And the lady that never talks
Up into the hills
I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath
And thought about your death
I ran to the lake
Up into the hills
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All the forgotten names
I tasted the rain
I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels
I tasted my fears
And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
The black sky opened up
Blinding me

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran
I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes
And up to the hill
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I smelt her burning flesh
Her rotting bones
Her decay

I ran and I ran
I'm still running away",Mer Girl

And you don't have a dime
And you can't even call them on the phone

The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no

You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do ya wanna go higher?

There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

Your heart is not open so I must go

You were my lesson I had to learn

There's no more heart to bruise

And I asked her for some happy news 
But she just smiled and turned away 
Well I went down to the sachet store 

Where I heard the music years before 
But the man there said the music wouldn't play 
Well now in the streets the children screamed 
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed 

But not a word was spoken 
The church bells all broken

Just like a ship that's lost at sea

Make sure it doesn't land on me

Saying your name out loud
I guess you met your match
Now what will you do

Way up like a bird in the sky

And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know
There is nothing to fear
And I know that love
Will take us away from here

Sometimes it's such a pleasure
Sometimes I want to tear it all down
It's easy to be lazy
And hard to go away from the crowd

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
We'll never be the same

And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know
There is nothing to fear
And I know that love
Will take us away from here

Say hello to your life, now you're living
This is it from now on
It's a brand new day
It was time to wake up from this dream (from this dream)

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
You'll never be the same

Madonna,"There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

Oh mother, why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go

I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away

They couldn't take my loneliness
I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work
I used to think he was a jerk

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that I would never need
Another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

(I gotta give it up)
(I gotta give it up)
(I gotta give it up)
I gotta give it up

Forget your problems
Administration, bills, and loans
Come with me
In the evidence of its brilliance

Spoken:
In the demonstration of this evidence
Some call it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?

Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide love inside their eyes
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
Love controlled by time
Future lovers shine for eternity
In a world that's free
Put away your past
That will never last
If you're holding on to a dream that's gone
I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

No hell below us

Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far

It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to set me up

Me and my bro, we was headed back to the A block
Then some homies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere

My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'd like to put you in a trance

If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try and reject it

If I'm in charge
And I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to

I'd like to put you in a trance, all over
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic

Once you put your hand in the flame
You can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction
In a little bit of pain

I can see you understand me
Tell that you're the same
If you're afraid, well rise above
I only hurt the ones I love

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to

Faster than the speeding light, she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when earth shall be as one

And I feel like I just got home and I feel

When we're six thousand miles apart

Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we’re at our best when we're miles away

So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away

I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone you realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles a-a-away

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

Madonna,"I should have seen the signs way back then
When she told me that you where her best friend
And now she's rolling rolling rolling
And you where stolen stolen stolen
She started dressing like me and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast
And love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It wont be the same (it won't be the same)

I should have seen the sign when you weren't here
Under a different light it's oh so clear
She was stealing stealing stealing
And now your feeling feeling feeling
She started dying her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She's started reading my books and stealing my looks and lingerie

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast
And love you in the shower
The feelings are momentary
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It wont be the same (it wont be the same)

She is licking her lips and she's batting her eyes
She's not me
She's got legs up to there and such beautiful hair
She's not me
Oh devoted for life make a beautiful wife
She's not me
If you spend some more time I guarantee we are fine
She's not me

I know I can do it better
If someone wants to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up all the things you like
You gonna have to watch your...

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (it wont be the same)

Never let you forget (She's not me)
She's Not Me and she'll never will be (repeat 2x)

Pharell-
Gotta find a new way to show your feelings
I guess it was some bullshit say you love me love me
Guess my expectations hit the ceiling
When you come back it will cost us trust, trust me

She's not me, She's note me, She's not me and she'll never will be (x2)

Never will be",She's Not Me

Madonna,"Who is the master? Who is the slave?

Treat me like a curse
And tell me I'm your savior
I'll never know the stranger
I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer
Is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you're playing 'round, like it's on rewind
You blew it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

First you say you love me
Then you wanna leave me
Then you say you're sorry
You play the game so well
I bought your illusion
You're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you
When you sold it to yourself

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you're playing 'round, like it's on rewind
You blew it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you

Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

This is where I long to be

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But i'm a bad girl, anyway
Forgive me

Hey, ey, ey, ey

Madonna,"Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell 
But most of all because I love Thee, 
And I want so badly to be good

It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them eight o eight drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

The room is spinning
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun

Madonna,"I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear
If I took another path
Things would be so different, but they're not

I could have just kept my big mouth closed
I could have just done what I was told
Maybe I should have turned silver into gold
But in front of you
I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
Do you wanna know how to make out loud
Telling your plans

We coulda bought a house with a swimming pool
Fill it up with Warhols
It would be so cool
Coulda gone buyin' estates in the countryside
With a pack of great things
Kissing eye to eye
We coulda do the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach all soaking wet
We coulda found a mountain seen a perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We coulda got a building built on the echo run
We coulda got ourselves arrested and sold our mum
We coulda live like crazy til' the day we die
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
Je suis desole
I wish I could take you back but I can't

And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?

And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane

There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

I'm leaving the past behind

Including this time and these crazy dreams

'Cause I don't want to say where I'm going

Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice cause the temperatures pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with a person just like you

I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game

Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules

And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them eight o eight drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

The room is spinning
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But I'm a bad girl, anyway
Forgive me

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild",Girl Gone Wild [Justin Cognito Remix] [Radio Edit] [Edit]
Madonna,"Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell

Bang bang
Bang bang

I thought you were good
But you painted me bad
Compared to the others
You're the best thing I had

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

I thought it was you
And I loved you the most
But I was just keeping
My enemies close

I made a decision,
I would never look back
So how did you end up
With all my jack?

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead in the head

Bitch out of order
Bat out of hell
Fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

I made a decision,
I would never look back
So how did you end up
With all my jack?

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang bang, shot you dead in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

And then I discovered
It couldn't get worse
You were building my coffin
You were driving my hearse

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, in the head

I thought it was you
And I loved you the most
But I was just keeping
My enemies close

I made a decision,
I would never look back
So how did you end up
With all of my jack?

Bang bang, shot you dead, in the head

Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang bang, shot you dead, in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

(I need you to die for me baby)

You have to die for me baby
That's right, you have to die for me baby
How could I move on with my life
If you didn't die for me baby
If you didn't die for me baby
I need you to die for me baby

Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Now my lover is dead, and I have no regrets
He deserved it

And I'm going straight to hell
And I've got a lot of friends there
And if I see that bitch in hell
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again
'Cause I wanna see him die
Over and over
And over
And over
And over
And over
And over
And over

Now drive bitch
I said drive bitch
And while you're at it, die bitch
That's right drive bitch

Now drive bitch
I said drive bitch
And while you're at it, die bitch
That's right drive bitch

Now if you're gonna act like a bitch
Then you're gonna die like a bitch",Gang Bang
