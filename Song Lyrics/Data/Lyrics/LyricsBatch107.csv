Fauve,"Vieux frère,
J'suis encore arrivé en retard ce matin
Comme hier,
Comme avant-hier,
Comme tous les jours depuis 3 semaines
Il est à peu près 11h,
Et j'dors encore sur mon clavier
J'ai le nez dans la manche de ma veste pas lavée,
Qui dégage une odeur bizarre
J'fais semblant à un point où c'est devenu absurde
J'suis vraiment une imposture

Et aujourd'hui encore j'vais mettre en marche
Le simulateur de travail pour envoyer des bouteilles
Aux autres vieux frères et aux belles
Qu'est ce que j'fous là,
Où est-ce que j'vais
Est-ce que ça va être ça ma vie,
Rester 40 ans sur les mêmes rails?
Mais je serai jamais assez fort,
J'aurai jamais les épaules,
J'arrive plus à suivre,
J'ai déjà des points de côté des 2 côtés

Heureusement ce matin c'est un peu différent
C'est grâce à ce qui s'est passé hier soir quand on était ensemble
Quand on était ensemble avec les autres vieux frères dans les mots,
Dans les bruits, les tambours les échos et les images,
Et qu'on a avancé sans baisser la tête
Qu'on a pu transpirer et crier sans contraintes,
Sans retenue et sans crainte

C'était impensable de vivre ça,
D'avoir le droit de sortir ce qu'on avait dans notre tête,
Depuis tout ce temps, ces choses
Dont on pensait que tout le monde se foutait
Ça m'a fait du bien
Ça m'a fait du bien parce que c'était vrai, parce que c'était sincère
Parce que c'était nous, vieux frères",Rag #3
Fauve,"Vieux frère,
Tu dois encore être en cage à cette heure ci,
Moi j'ai pas fait grand chose depuis ce matin j'ai écris un peu,
Je me suis touché un peu aussi

Ce midi j'ai vu les autres vieux frère elle est belle
C'était éclairant comme à chaque fois
Et puis cette aprè'm je suis allé récupérer mes affaires
C'était tellement étrange

J'ai dis au revoir à la photocopieuse
Puis à ceux et celles qui restent à bord
Ils m'ont souhaités bonne chance
J'ai hâte qu'on se rejoigne tous dehors demain
Au premières heures du jour et qu'on s'en aille enfin

Tu te souviens quand on parlait de changer de vie,
Si on avait su que ça arriverait

Moi aussi je suis inquiet forcement,
On a pas été habitué à tous ça c'est vrai,
Mais je sais aussi qu'on sera pas seul, qu'on sera avec tout les autres vieux frères
Et qu'ensemble on a de quoi faire,
Et puis les signaux sont là tu les entends et tu les vois comme moi

Alors finalement même si on sait pas où tout ça nous emmènera il faut qu'on ose
Qu'on fasse le geste,
Il faut qu'on se lance vieux frère

Je crois qu'y a rien de plus fort
Je sais pas comment expliquer ça, c'est que ça se voit dans les yeux,
Tu te dis merde j'ai l'impression de faire quelque chose
Tu croyais pourtant c'est pas grand chose

Pourtant, c'est pourtant, c'est pas grand chose.",Rag #4
Fauve,"Je me suis mis à, à déconner complètement
Y'a quelque chose qui a sauté là dedans
Je sais pas
Je pense que c'est parce qu'inconsciemment
J'ai eu l'impression de perdre le contrôle
De perdre le contrôle sur toutes les choses
Dans lesquelles j'étais impliqué
Sur tous les éléments de ma vie
Ça m'a plongé dans un état de colère
Absolument indescriptible
C'était insoutenable
C'est comme être enfermé dans une boite sans lumière
Dans laquelle le temps s'arrête
C'est comme être dans les limbes en fait
Tu peux plus aller en avant plus aller en arrière
Tu peux plus aller dans aucune direction
T'es complètement bloqué
À l'arrêt en panne
T'as les pieds dans le ciment

Je me suis senti comme un requin tigre
Vous savez que les requins quand ils avancent plus
Ils crèvent
Et le requin tigre c'est le plus agressif
Quand il est immobilisé il défonce tout ce qui passe
Et c'est la même chose avec les loups quand tu les coinces
Moi je me servais de la musique et des mots et de l'écriture pour avancer
Pour progresser à travers l'existence
Alors quand j'ai perdu ça ben
Ben j'ai perdu ma capacité à progresser
C'est comme ça que je me suis mis à gueuler

Tu peux plus interagir avec le monde
Tu te renfermes petit à petit
Tu deviens totalement hermétique aux autres et au quotidien
Parce que le matin quand tu te réveilles
Et le soir quand tu te couches
Quand tu marches quand tu bosses
Quand tu parles quand tu conduis
Tu te répètes en permanence
En permanence
Je suis nulle part
Je vais nulle part
Je suis pétrifié
Et je serai jamais rien d'autre que ça

Il faut choisir de, de pas y penser
Choisir que ça existe pas
Choisir de pas avoir de problème avec ça
Il faut sortir
Faut voir ses amis
Et attendre que ça revienne",Requin-Tigre
Fauve,"On a parfois le cœur soulevé par la sauvagerie du monde.
On est écœuré par l'annonce d'une nouvelle tyrannie.
Le raffinement des anciennes par les mensonges.
L'odeur du fumier dans les villes.
L'horreur qui pèse sur tous nos lendemain.
On s'engloutit alors dans un sombre désespoir.
On a peur, on a honte puis on est triste d'être humain.
On réclame en pleurant une naissance nouvelle,
Ou du moins l'admission par baptême dans une nouvelle confrérie.
Et on redoute de n'pas pouvoir obtenir ni l'une ni l'autre,
Que le monde refuse de s'arrêter pour nous et qu'on ne peut que le quitter.
Plonger dans une douteuse éternité.

Notre foyer lui même nous semble hostile
Comme si tous les talismans qui définissaient notre identité
S'étaient retournés contre nous.
On se sent déchiré et en pièce et en morceaux.
On prend alors avec terreur que si on n'peut pas s’asseoir pour réunir ces morceaux
Et les assembler à nouveau, on va devenir fou.
Mais parfois se produit pourtant une manière d’événements mystérieux et éblouissants,
Qu'on contemple encore longtemps après,
Et avec un émerveillement mêlé du respect qu'impose le sacré.",Tunnel
Fauve,"Vieux frères
Vieux frères, j'vous écris en pensées alors que vous êtes sûrement déjà en train de dormir,
Cueillis par le sommeil,
À part évidemment notre vieux frère qui veille
Et les autres vieux frères qui se lèvent de l'autre côté de la Terre.

Vieux frères, c'est une nuit claire et silencieuse.
Le blizzard du dehors est enfin reparti.
J'voulais profiter de ce moment de répit pour vous parler de quelque chose,
De quelque chose d'important.

Vieux frères, y'a longtemps, plusieurs années déjà,
On m'avait offert une amulette, un genre de talisman
Qui m'avait pratiquement sauvé la vie,
Qui m'avait permis de mieux voir, de distinguer les cordons d'argent.

Vieux frères, malheureusement, on me l'a enlevé.
Il s'est éteint après avoir clignoté comme un néon fatigué.
Je l'ai perdu puis retrouvé puis reperdu et reperdu encore 100 fois,
Jusqu'à baisser les bras.

Mais pourtant vieux frères,
Contre toute attente,
J'crois qu'il est en train d'se passer quelque chose.
Je sens que quelque part à l’intérieur, ça recommence à bouger,
Que les pulsations reprennent.

Vieux frères, au début, elles étaient très faibles et très espacées,
Au point que je l'ai entendais même pas
Mais depuis ça s'est accéléré,
Petit à petit.
Depuis, on dirait que la machine que j'pensais hors-circuit est en train de redémarrer.

Vieux frères, ça a commencé y'a plusieurs mois mais au début j'ai pas relevé.
Comment je pouvais me douter en même temps?
J'ai pas remarqué tout de suite les flash colorés dans le noir,
Les éclats furtifs sur les parois et les visages.

Vieux frères, d'abord c'était sous les arcades
Lorsqu'on a cru toucher le fond et y rester pour de bon
Mais qu'on a réussi à resserrer le cercle par deux fois
Puis y'a eu les fumigènes, les fusées parachutes tirés de partout
Comme des cris d'ralliement faisant écho dans les vallées.
Ensuite, ça a été au tour du vieux frère qui a changé pour devenir sage,
Puis au tour de l'autre vieux frère qui s'est remis en selle pour toujours.
J'me rappelle aussi de ce soir du moi de mai,
Du jeu de fléchettes et qu'on était encore rentré seul comme des cons mais soulagé d'en rire.

Vieux frères, encore après y'a eu la route.
On traversait les grands espaces du Loiret
Quand j'ai vu notre vieux frère prendre une photo avec ses mains.

Et enfin vieux frères, y'a eu hier soir
Hier soir à 10 000 pieds alors que l'avion était plongé dans l'noir,
Chacun votre tour, en quelques secondes,
Comme en plein jour, comme dans les rues
Quand la nuit tombe,
Chacun votre tour vieux frères, vous vous êtes allumés,
Vous vous êtes parés d'un halo bleu doré, j'ai cru voir un tableau. L'temps s'est arrêté.
J'vous l'jure sur tout ce que j'ai de plus précieux,
J'vous le jure sur la vie de tous les vieux frères, sur celle des belles et sur la mienne.

Vieux frères, j'crois que j'suis en train de retrouver la vue.

Vieux frères, c'est c'que j'attendais depuis tellement de temps,
C'est pour ça Que j'bossais dans l'noir, que j'écrivais des mantra
En m'faisant violence pour y croire,
Sans savoir à quoi ça pouvait ressemblait réellement
Parce que j'avais oublié.

Vieux frères, peut-être que j'suis cintré,
Peut-être que ça va disparaître, peut-être que j'me suis trompé,
Peut-être que c'est que dans ma tête
Mais pour l'instant c'est là et bien là
Et pour preuve je l'ai dans l'creux d'ma main
Au moment où j'vous adresse ces phrases.

Alors vieux frères, avant d'se faire ken encore une fois,
Avant qu'les ténèbres avalent cette flamme,
On va mettre le dernier coup de rein et montrer les dents,
On va replonger dans l'torrent
Et peu importe pour combien de temps parce que maintenant on sait qu'ça peut exister,
Que c'est possible.
Vieux frères, on va s'casser de ce tunnel,
On va prendre notre revanche vieux frères, on va gagner la belle.",Vieux Frères
Fauve,"Barre-toi!
Casse-toi, je t'ai dit, qu'est-ce qu'il t'faut d'plus?
T'en as pas vu assez?
Et arrête de m'regarder comme ça
T'as rien écouté, t'as rien compris
Comment j'dois te l'dire pour qu'ça imprime?
Écoute pauv' conne, j'suis pas quelqu'un d'bien
J'suis pas une belle personne
J'suis une sale bête
Une bouteille de gaz dans une cheminée
Et j'vais finir par t'sauter au visage si tu t'approches trop
Comme ça t'es avec les autres!
Mais tu sais pas d'quoi tu parles
J'ai essayé, ça sert à rien, on change pas, on change jamais
Et quand bien même de toute façon, ici y'a pas de deuxième chance
On efface pas les ardoises
Me dis pas que t'es pas au courant, t'as pas vu?
C'est imprimé partout
Dans les journaux, sur les écrans, dans le regard des gens
C'est même écrit en grand sur les immeubles, la nuit
Quand les gens bien comme toi sont endormis
C'est marqué en rouge
Tu nais comme ça, tu vis comme ça, tu cannes comme ça
Seul à poil face à ton reflet avec ton dégoût de toi-même, ta culpabilité
Et ton désespoir comme seul témoin
Non, crois-moi, tu veux vraiment pas que j'aille plus loin
Parce qu'au mieux ça t'empêchera d'dormir
Et au pire, ça t'donnera envie d'me cracher à la gueule
Alors avant que j'me transforme encore une fois
Pars en courant, fuis-moi comme le choléra

Non, j'ai braqué personne, planté personne, buté personne
Mais j'suis un voyou, c'est comme ça qu'on dit, tout simplement
J'ai fait des choses que j'regrette suffisamment
Suffisamment pour y penser tout l'temps
J'pourrai t'donner un million de bonnes raisons
Pour qu'on m'attrape, qu'on m'casse les genoux, et qu'on m'cloue au pilori
Mais si un jour, on vient m'chercher
J'résisterai pas, j'sortirai les mains sur la tête, sans faire d'ennui
Mais avant qu'ça arrive, je voudrais qu'tu saches que j'ai compris
Que j'passe mes nuits entre cachetons et insomnies
Et que j'vais m'battre, pour reconstruire un apprenti, un repenti
Et tant pis, si ça m'prend toute une vie

Pardon?
Que j'parle un peu moins fort?
Ah, on vous dérange, en fait, merde
Et bah, si on t'dérange, tu t'casses
Ou sinon, tu fermes ta gueule, tu r'gardes ton assiette
Et tu nous fous la paix cinq minutes
Le temps que j'termine, tu peux faire ça?
Qu'est-ce qu'y a?
Ça t'gêne qu'on t'coince comme ça, devant tout l'monde?
Ah ouais, c'est chiant, j'comprends mon gars
Mais dis-toi que t'as d'la chance, toi
Toi t'es né bien comme il faut, t'es solide, t'es cohérent
Tu mets personne mal à l'aise dans les restaurants
Tu dors bien sur tes deux oreilles
T'es un bon p'tit Français, t'es beau, t'es bien
Comme un magasine de déco, comme une maison témoin
Ça t'arrive pas ces choses là, hein?
Tu vois absolument pas d'quoi j'parle?
Et bah, ouvre pas trop la porte de ton placard, alors tu pourrais être surpris
Ça va t'faire tout drôle, le soir, où les choses que tu pensais avoir enfouies
T'font savoir, qu'en fait, elles étaient là, juste là, planquées sous l'tapis
Elles sortent une main, puis te plantent une seringue dans l'pied, avant d'disparaître
Alors là, ça t'prend à la gorge, comme des odeurs d'ammoniac
Ça t'colle des sueurs froides, t'as les dents qui claquent!
Beh, non j'me calme pas, j'me calme pas!
Il sait pas c'que c'est lui
Il sait pas c'que c'est que d'être un crevard
D'être mal foutu, d'être une crasse, un pantin
D'être le terrain où l'bien et l'mal s'affrontent
Il sait pas c'que c'est!

Non, j'ai braqué personne, planté personne, buté personne
Mais j'suis un voyou, c'est comme ça qu'on dit, tout simplement
J'ai fait des choses que j'regrette suffisamment
Suffisamment pour y penser tout l'temps

Et tant pis, si ça m'prend toute une vie

Comment est-ce que tu peux penser qu'tu tiens à moi, si moi même j'y tiens pas?
Pourquoi tu dis qu'tu m'aimes alors que moi-même j'me déteste?
Pourquoi t'es là, pourquoi tu restes?

Comment est-ce que tu peux penser qu'tu tiens à moi, si moi même j'y tiens pas?
Pourquoi tu dis qu'tu m'aimes alors que moi-même j'me déteste?
Pourquoi t'es là, pourquoi tu restes?

Non, pas ce soir, pas ce soir, laisse-moi s'il-te-plaît
Non, j'veux pas y aller, j'veux pas rentrer, j'veux pas dormir
Mais surtout, non, j'veux pas parler
Ce soir, j'veux juste hurler
J'ai besoin d'ouvrir les vannes, tu comprends, de tout lâcher, comme un puceau qui ment
De hurler mes mots pesants, avec ma voix d'adolescent qui a jamais mué
De hurler ma peur de l'abandon, ma r'cherche phonétique d'attention
Mon besoin de reconnaissance en permanence, comme un chien, des caresses
Mes tentatives désespérées d'me faire passer pour un mec que j'suis pas
Et que j'serai probablement jamais!
De hurler mon absence de courage, ma cruauté, ma politesse maladive
Mon optimisme débile, mon zèle dangereux, mes réflexes à la con
Mes accès d'colère, ma culpabilité bidon, ma sexualité en vrac et mes fantasmes tordus
De hurler ma peur panique des autres
Ma mesquinerie sournoise, mes regrets, mes erreurs
Mes névroses, mes obsessions, mes méta-obsessions
Ma phobie d'la douleur, de la perte, du suicide, de la dépression

Non, j'ai braqué personne, planté personne, buté personne
Mais j'suis un voyou, mais c'est comme ça qu'on dit, tout simplement

Fauve,"Encore le même matin
Encore le même réveil
Seul dans les draps sales, putain
Dans les draps sales de mon sommeil
Encore rêvé d’mes dents qui tombent
Cette fois-ci y avait aussi des morceaux d’ongles
Du sang séché
L’autre fois j’ai vomi du verre pilé
Je finirai par me les limer, mais plus tard, plus tard
Pour l’instant je tâte ces dents désunies par le tabac
Du bout de ces doigts jaunis par le tabac
Je sens cette haleine vieillie par le tabac
Sortie par ces lèvres qui veulent plus rien avaler
Ou seulement deux trois fièvres, des canettes et des pots délavés
Dans ces nuits, en chien de fusil
Quand mes os apparaissent translucides
Quand mon cœur tape et perce, limpide
Contre ma peau

Encore les mêmes larmes
Et moi je me surprends à les faire tomber sur la cigarette qui diffuse
Je passe mon temps à pleurer n'importe quand
Pleurer dans mon lit, pleurer sur ​​les chiottes, pleurer sous la douche
Mais surtout pas devant les autres, non, ce serait être salaud
Y'a que les écrivains qui savent rendre ça beau
Tout ce que je peux faire c'est de passer la journée à brûler comme une braise
Brûler comme une braise, le cul vissé sur ma chaise, à faire
Ces minables sourires qui puent l'encens
Ces sourires jaunes d'arnaqueur,
Avec toujours ces dents et ces lèvres sans couleurs,
Et cette langue si sèche collée contre mon palais
J'arrive à peine à sortir des râles
Je préfère encore tordre mon visage pâle et me racler la gorge
Et déglutir dans la grille de l'évier mes crachats noirs, mes soupirs,
Et puis me regarder dans la glace
Me tâter la gueule, me tâter les gencives
Je voudrais
Je voudrais me casser la gueule, me casser les gencives
Pour secouer le sac à geindre que je suis

Si ça s'évapore pour rejoindre le néant
Si ça devient tout, c'est le temps
Le temps seul qui finit par le dire
Une relation, c'est un potentiel laissé à l'avenir
Mais pour moi, le ciel s'est posé comme un couvercle
D'un simple geste, elle a refermé le cercle
Et tout ce qui me reste c'est un empire de vent et de poussière
Où l'on ne sait pas rire, où l'on ne connaît que la pierre
La ville n'est qu'un charnier, peut-être une île, rien d'autre à faire
Que regarder se vider à côté des autres ses plaies, et les fêlures de ses côtes
Mais pourquoi est-ce qu'il faudrait encore que je saigne?
Je me sens déjà suffisamment vidé

Il a fallu qu'elle se souvienne qu'elle ne m'aime plus
Le seul désir qu'elle m'a laissé c'est de dormir avec mon frère
Tout ira bien, la douleur vient, la douleur passe
On y arrive

Même les déchets remontent à la surface
On se lève un matin sans cette odeur rance, sans cette odeur d'encore
On se rend compte que la souffrance vaut toujours mieux que la mort
C'est moins définitif aussi
J'ai pas envie j'ai pas envie j'ai pas envie j'ai pas envie
Qu'on trace encore le périmètre de ma vie
Il m'reste encore quelques kilomètres et quelques envies
J'peux encore m'en aller rouler loin dans les fumées
Jusqu'à ce que la voûte devienne bleue
Et j'peux encore choper des croûtes, me brûler les yeux
À mater le soleil décliner
Peut être que tu le trouves moche
C'est vrai qu'on y trouve que de la cendre, que de la roche
N'empêche qu'y m'reste encore mon empire de vent et poussière
Qui n'est pas à vendre
J'y suis roi et j'y dors, j'y suis tellement fier
Le cul posé dans le froid sur mon trône de pierre
Même que j'm'y balade encore
Libre et la bite à l'air",Azulejos
Fauve,"Et ce type allongé sur les cloues qui gueule sous les hallebardes.
Et cette vieille Chinoise qui pisse dans la rue à trois mètres de l'entrée du Franprix
Et la fille sur le quai regards noirs sourcils froncés
Et les caractères de print qui nous traitent tour à tour comme des animaux ou comme des attardés
Et le cosaque pouilleux qui transportent sa maison de quartier en quartier
Et les cahiers qui s'abîment les mains dans la glace sous les cascades de néons bleues
Et le camion du samu qui nous frôle à toute bombe avec le souffle d'une locomotive
Et les sirènes et les gyrophares et les klaxons et les alarmes des tirs
Et les sept musiques de l'enfer
Et la mère bossue de ce vieux pote qui est devenu fou
Et ces amis fragiles qui font flipper
Et lui qui veut pas comprendre que tu pourrais le gifler avec des idées que ça rentrerait quand même pas
Et l'autre connard qui parle trop fort trop mal qui passe son temps à chier sur tout le monde
Et lui qui trouve pas parce qu'il cherche pas
Et lui qui veut se casser loin
Et elle qu'à le regard vague et lui qui maîtrise pas son cerveau
Et elle qu'est tombée malade alors qu'elle n'avait rien fait à personne
Et lui qu'a plus d'élan vital
Elle est où ta rage, elle est où ta passion
Elle est passée où ta gaule de six mètres de long
Et elle qui comprend plus sa chatte parce qu'elle s'est faite sauter trop de fois sans qu'on la rappelle
Et ma tête qui me joue encore des tours
Et moi qui galère à m'mettre à couvert
Qui me frotte trop près aux débris
Qui m'perd trop souvent dans l'triangle des Bermudes
Et les grands verres que je m'envoie sur une base régulière une belle éponge
Et l'odeur d'feu d'bois qui m'colle à la peau
Et ma tête d'anxieux c'matin
Et le champ de bataille quand je nous vois tous éparpillés éclatés en vrac
Et nous qu'on se branle H-24 puis qu'on se flagelle parce qu'on se branle
Puis on dit qu'on fait et en fait on fait pas
Alors on dit pas et puis on fait puis on se fatigue
Puis on s'excuse d'être malheureux puis d'être heureux puis de s'excuser
Puis c'est le merdier ça y est c'est l'merdier
Continue à creuser copain continue à creuser
Et moi qui doute qui déconne à plein tube qui branle dans le manche
Et mon projet qui m'fait du mal parfois mais putain c'était pas prévu comme ça
Et les rimes pauvres et les orgasmes arides
Et les fausses promesses
Et les nouveaux visages de la bêtise maquillés comme les Renaults trafics des putes de la guerre de Caen
Et les fous furieux en trente pièces qui faudrait déboulonner
Et les cœur qui s'envolent
Et l'courage et l'espoir qu'on écrase enfin qu'on essaie
Et les belles choses qu'on fait tout pour abîmer mais ça ça bougera pas non
Et les miens qui ramassent et les miens qui avancent
Et les miens qui m'soutiennent et les miens que j'rejoins toujours
Et moi qui pousse ma voix comme une machette comme une fronde comme une balise
C'est pour mon salut.",Bermudes
Fauve,"Vendredi 5 Juillet, 22h57
Je descends la rue dans la chaleur de la nuit
Pas mal de monde, pas mal de bruit
Un léger souffle d'air tiède traverse mon t-shirt et glisse sur ma peau
Ça fait comme les caresses d'une ado timide
Les trottoirs et la chaussée sont pleins,
Y'a de tout des Blancs, des Turcs, des Cainfrs, des Indiens, des Albanais, des Pakis
Des gens pouilleux, des gens sapés, des filles jolies
J'en croise une plus âgée que moi et je me dis que j'aimerais bien essayer une fois
Pour pas mourir idiot
Je circule entre les épiciers, les taxiphones, les kebabs louches
Les affiches de chanteur du moment mondialement inconnus et les bars branchés
Où j'ai jamais trop su comment me tenir mais c'est pas grave si certains y sont bien
Alors c'est bien
Ça sent le cumin et le safran, la bière renversée, la cigarette, la viande grillée
Ça sent l'été, le vrai, celui qui répare mais déjà je dois m'engouffrer dans la station
C'est pas grave ce soir rien peut me toucher
Je flotte au dessus du sol les planètes sont alignées
Dans les galeries pas de grosse surprise encore cette odeur douteuse
Et ces 4 par 3 toujours pas indispensables
Pour un film obscur qui fera sûrement un four, une comédie raston
La énième tournée d'adieu d'un groupe de vieux musiciens aux cheveux teints
Pour des spectacles de jeunes comiques en théorie pas hyper marrants
Pour des marques de vêtements portés par des filles
Qui ont l'air d'avoir des problèmes avec leur père
Et une campagne pour la mobilité qui sensibilisera peut-être personne
Mais avec une actrice plutôt mignonne
Et là je re-croise ces deux filles longilignes qui se tiennent par la main
Exactement les mêmes que j'ai vues hier près de chez mon oncle
Je trouve ça touchant et étrange
Autant que cet immense Guinéen au bout du couloir qui braille avec une voix métallique
Comme un putain de cor tibétain
Une goutte d'eau croupie tombe des poutres Eiffel dont la peinture fait des cloques
Elle atterrit dans mon cou c'est dégueulasse mais j'ai pas le temps de jurer
J'entends la sortie de la rame au loin
Ce soir rien peut me toucher, je flotte au dessus du sol, les planètes sont alignées

Dans la rame un Kosovar qui joue d'une trompette-violon bizarre
Je me demande quelle vie il avait avant,
Tandis qu'il anime mon trajet et celui du groupe de ricains à côté
Ils ont l'air un peu perdus avec leur physique tout lisse de gros bébé du futur
J'arrive à mon changement je passe devant les vendeurs de fausses clopes à la sauvette
Qui courent, qui crient, presque jour et nuit
Ça m'effrayait parfois quand j'étais gamin
Et qu'on venait dans le quartier avec ma mère et les frangins
Mais maintenant ça va, maintenant c'est cool
Je monte vers le quai de la plate-forme aérienne
Et à chaque fois que je suis là bizarrement je repense à cette fille
Avec qui j'ai fait l'amour pour la première fois
Elle habitait juste à côté
On m'avait dit que c'était un peu une traînée mais en vrai pas tant
Ça avait été une jolie nuit
Je laisse mes pensées dériver où elles veulent
Constatant avec satisfaction le plaisir d'arriver à faire rouler les images et les mots
Comme sur des colliers de perles
Mais j'oublie pas que je dois faire des chansons
Dans tous les cas ce soir rien peut me toucher,
Je flotte au dessus du sol, les planètes sont alignées

J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
C'est fou comme le temps file
J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
Et je pourrais me dire que les belles années sont derrière moi
J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
Pourtant j'ai pas de regrets
J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
Et ce soir j'ai l'impression d'être en '98

Je sors et toujours la chaleur dehors
J'avance sous la voûte des marronniers qui font comme une tonnelle
Je serais bien aller dans les magasins pas loin
Chez ces mecs pas méchants mais un poil suffisant
Poser mes doigts sur un instrument mais c'est fermé et puis il faut que j'avance
Tout d'un coup sorti de je sais pas où de la musique genre malienne
Mais chanté en espagnol ou peut-être de la folk indienne
En tout cas un truc que j'ai jamais entendu mais j'aime bien
On dirait Dear Prudence, y'a des drums rondes et mates et asynchrones
Ça intéresse pas beaucoup les blédards désœuvrés qui traînent dans l'allée
On arrête pas le buis' aller ça s'enjaille, ça s'embrouille
Y'a une odeur nouvelle dans l'air depuis quelques temps
Une odeur d'apocalypse
Je me surprends à penser que le déclin est arrivé, ça y est c'est pour nous
Mais malgré tout je suis pas si inquiet, après tout faut arrêter
On a de la ressource, on est pas les derniers burnés, on va se démerder, bref
Je suis arrivé en bas de l'immeuble terminus, je dois monter
Ce soir rien peut me toucher je flotte au dessus du sol, les planètes sont alignées

J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
C'est fou comme le temps file
J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
Et je pourrais me dire que les belles années sont derrière moi
J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
Pourtant j'ai pas de regrets
J'ai 27 ans, bientôt 28
Et ce soir j'ai l'impression d'être en '98",Juillet (1998)
Fauve,"Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Et à travers les roselières
Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
J'irais chercher, les hautes lumières.

Aux innocents les mains pleines,
J't'emmène lancer des médailles dans l'eau bleue des fontaines
Et cueillir à nouveau ces visions qu'on s'offrait autrefois,
Comme des couronnes.
Ces visions qu'on s'échangeait pour se dire, pour se rappeler,
Je suis veilleur, tu es musée.
Je veux sentir les feuilles de menthe craquer sous nos dents
Avec la chlorophylle qui s'échappe.

Et t'faire écouter le son de carillons qu'fait le claquement des drisses de pavillon
Contre les mâts, avec en fond le grand fracas de la mer qui rapporte,
Et au dessus la procession de cargo des nuages bas et blancs.
Je voudrais te faire rencontrer les femmes cyprines et les bolqueens
Qu'elles nous habillent de robes et de diadèmes au croisement d'Amsterdam,
Et d'la 80ème pendant que moi je te mettrais au poignet des bracelets de tissu
Qui deviendront des bracelets de fleurs, puis des rubans, puis des violons.

Je porte le blason d'mon clan,
J'l'ai désormais gravé sur la face visible de mon cœur,
Mais ça ne fait pas mal rassure toi au contraire,
J'ai fait broder nos souvenirs étincelant sur des manteaux de nuit
Qu'mon offert des frères tisserands drapiers de canut
J'ai à la main mes aussières, je suis prêt.

Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Et à travers les roselières
Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Je t'offrirai les hautes lumières.

Aux innocents les mains pleines je t’emmène plonger dans la Seine
Et nager dans les courants fort de Beauchamp,
Nager dans les rivières, remonter les ruisseaux,
Puis prendre un bain brûlant, où je laverais ta peau
Au lait d’ânesse, avant de sécher ton corps moi même
Comme avant, quand on était adolescent.

Je veux faire l'amour dans les champs, dans les clairières, dans les taxis,
Je veux faire l'amour partout, même sur les toits de Paris.
Je veux résider au creux de ton cou, et dans tes draps parfumés aux lilas,
Tandis qu'une madré enveloppé d'un châle rouge bénit nos fronts
En silence avec des croix de baume au camphre.

Je te montrerai comment décrocher les boules blanches des symphorines
Pour les éclater sous nos pieds et entre nos doigts,
Avant d'aller regarder la lumière d'un lampadaire qui rougeoie
Et qui vacille sur les berges du fleuve endormi,
Dont les risées de vent emplissent la surface.

Je veux offrir cette cigarette à ma mère,
Cette cigarette d'après la guerre et son odeur vanillé,
Je t’emmène voir le granit rose de ses îles qu'on ne peut pas déplacer
Mais c'est pour nous protéger,
Je t'emmène tout rejouer, peut être tout perdre,
Mais peut être aussi tout rafler, tout braquer, tout gagner

Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Et à travers les roselières
Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Je t'offrirai les hautes lumières.

Aux innocents les mains pleines je t'emmène voir
Taulet, Cavour, Sienne et Navone,
Toucher la faïence des rues de Lisbonne,
Et le marbre blanc, lisse et brillant des palais.

Je veux entendre les Salam des chauffeurs,
Et qui nous crie, les enfants je vous emmène à Orléans si ça vous plait.
Je veux t'offrir le tintement des couverts d'argent contre le cristal
Et les mots précieux des miens.

Je veux écouter les histoires des anciens encore et encore,
Ces histoires millénaires qui renaissent,
On s'est connu y a trois mille ans, on se retrouve maintenant,
Et nos enfants feront de même.

Je t'emmène loin des griffes de la colère, loin des regrets, loin des nausées,
Je t'emmène loin de la barbarie et des odeurs de kérosène brûlé,
Je t'emmène courir après des filles, après des garçons, après des rêves,
Et contempler les vivants, ces gens qu'on croise parfois
Et qui nous font tomber amoureux pour deux, pour trois.

On doit encore parcourir la terre,
On doit trouver cent mille sœurs et cent mille frères,
Pour plus jamais être seul dans les cimetières,
Alors sur la colline du Palatin, par dessus les dômes byzantins
Bientôt nous serons postés, nous armerons nos flèches de diamants,
Pour devenir sagittaires et décrocher, les hautes lumières

Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Et à travers les roselières
Après la nuit,
Avant le jour,
Je t'offrirai les hautes lumières.

Sortez les stylos et les carnets
Allumez les bougies et réveillez les esprits, faites chauffer les machines
Montez les basses, dégueulez les kicks, faites claquer les snares
La nuit va être longue vieux frère
Vieux frères ce soir encore je vous appelle en renfort
L'heure est à nouveau venue de tremper des torchons dans la paraffine
Et de descendre au fond de la mine
De faire ce truc qu'on a appris à faire au fil des ans depuis tout ce temps qu'on roule ensemble
Braconner les mots juste pour avancer
Tout mettre à nu avant de coucher ce qu'on a sur le cœur sur l'instru'
Nos quêtes, nos frustrations, nos rêves et notre vécu
Sans non-dits, sans compromis, sans jamais de tendre notre cul ni écarter les fesses
Bancale c'est pas grave, bancale c'est très bien
Mais tiens moi à distance de mes désirs mesquins
Je sais qu'il faut mettre ça au placard sinon c'est baisé
On peut pas se branler, miner des mondes et toujours construire et charbonner
Même si parfois je vois bien que c'est compliqué
On est pas encore tiré d'affaire, il reste du taf, il en reste à faire beaucoup à faire
On se doit d'aller au boulot, au bout du tunnel avec toute notre hargne
Jusqu'à nous coucher comme des masses le matin venu pour rempiler dès le réveil
Alors ce soir on va embrayer, mettre en marche le deuxième chantier
On se reposera plus tard t'en fais pas
On se reposera quand on sera vieux, vieux frère

Aujourd'hui je regarde en arrière, je me surprends à sourire
Tous ces souvenirs en si peu de temps
Ça m'a fait comme une seconde naissance
A une époque je pensais que ma vie était derrière moi
Et si j'avais su tout ce qui m'attendais, tous ces moments, tout ce qu'on a construit
De rien et à bout de bras
Et je suis fier de ça, ça me fait du bien
J'crois que j'suis plus heureux, moins amer, moins en colère qu'avant
Plus apaisé aussi j'espère
Moi qui était bon à pas grand chose en tout cas dans ma tête
J'ai récupéré de ma dignité
Au passage j'espère en avoir fait profiter les miens autant que j'pouvais
Mais c'est pas fini, rien n'est gagné, on est peut-être à l'abri pour l'instant
Mais il faut rester vigilant
Et puis on a pas encore tout dit parce qu'on a pas encore tout vu
Il en reste dans l'éponge, il en reste dans nos casiers, il en reste sur notre route
On a pas encore été au bout de l'histoire, au bout de nous même,
Au bout des autres, au bout du monde, loin de là
Et on s'arrêtera pas, on s'arrêtera pas tant que ce sera pas fait
On a ce privilège, cette torche qu'on peut tremper dans la paraffine
Et on va continuer à descendre au fond de la mine pour creuser
Creuser jusqu'à la sortie, on a passé tant d'années à attendre,
À chercher dans le noir comme des galériens
A marcher sans savoir où aller, à se faire du mal pour rien
Hors de question de flancher ou de revenir en arrière
Je sais que je peux compter sur toi vieux frère

Les maisons sont quelconques mais bien lisses
Les maisons sont couvertes de goudrons mais si lisses
Et ouvertes à ton cœur en fusion
Tu touches à l'espoir et tu glisses
Un regard et un jour il s'accroche
On rebouche les fissures, on referme tous les murs
On retaille dans la roche, on répare le vitrail
Et on disperse le brouillard, plus de gènes ni d'averses
Dans les nuits rien ne lasse, on ne fuit plus les belles
On oublie le poison, je préfère aux morues et aux figues
La sueur de la rue, je préfère la fatigue de mon front

Et je sens le sommeil qui gagne du terrain
On ne doit pas trop tarder

Et partir

Mais avant de m'endormir contre vous
Permettez-moi d'incliner la tête et le haut de mon corps
D'ouvrir mes mains et de vous rendre hommage
Dorénavant je suis votre, je me fais votre serviteur
Désormais vous avez mon cœur, ma voix ma tête blonde
Mon corps encore jeune
Mes mots, mes jolis mots
Ceux que j'essaie d'écrire
Mon histoire, mon avenir
Mes chansons, mes fantômes, mes faits, ma lumières, mes baisers
Et toutes ces choses au fond qu'il faut sortir
Mes secrets, ma rage avec la bave aux lèvres
Ma hargne, ma folie, mon courage peut-être
Mes rires profonds, mes cris de joie, mes cris de guerres,
Mes coups de sang, mes coups de poing, ma mystique
Tout est à vous
Ma chaleur, mes mains, mes triques, mes saillies, ma queue, mes nuits
Tous mes ornements, des mes bagues à mon collier
De ma lame à mon armure
Et mon palladium et mes arcanes
Prenez aussi ma fortune, mes coups du sort, mes coups de cocu
Mes aubaines et mes peines avec, mes combats
Ma victoire, mes succès, mes défaites
Mes causes perdues, mes batailles gagnées, mes blessures apaisées
Ma parole, mon honneur, tout est à vous

Tout est à vous

Tout est à vous

Vous qui avez calmé ma tête

Aujourd'hui tout est changé
Les images ont du mal à passer les portes, grâce à vous
Vous ma promesse, mon vaisseau, ma garde, mon escorte
Mon tableau, ma prière, mon baptême
Mon branle-bat, mon qui-vive, ma corne de brume
Ma ligne de vie, mon clan, mon ordre
Mon rang, mon calme plat, mon continent
Vous mon monde, ma nation, ma terre, mes collines,
Mes hauteurs, mes océans, ma jungle et mes forêts
Avec les fleurs des champs, mon aurore boréale
Mon amour, mon mariage, mon chandelier
Tout est à vous
Vous mon flambeau, mon feu de Bengale, mon bouclier
Mon tonnerre, mon ciel
Ma foudre, mes ailes
Mon pardon, mon cristal, mon métal précieux enfoui
Vous mon pavois, mon grand pavois
Mon étendard, ma bannière, mon blason
Mon drapeau, mon zénith, mon torrent, mon déluge
Ma steppe, ma pleine
Vous mon empire, mon système, mon roi, ma reine
Tout est à vous

Tout est à vous

Du moins défini
Ce qu'on entend par relation d'ordre sur un ensemble
Je dis défini, sinon étudié
Parce que nous n'avons pas tout dit, loin de là

Face au miroir, j'craque une allumette
J'invoque le feu et j'fais tourner mes mantras à voix basse
J'les égrène comme un chapelet
Bientôt va falloir montrer les dents et rentrer dans l'arène
Sous les strobes et l'bastringue
Le stress me tourne autour façon vautour, j'en mène pas large
Mais j'sais que t'es avec moi, qu'tu peux faire jaillir l'orage de tes doigts
En c'qui m'concerne j'serais pas en reste
J'aurai l'chrome dans ma main droite même si au début j'tremblerais peut-être
Allez écrase ta sèche dans un verre plein
Avale ton mélange d'une traite
Pour l'coup d'fouet, défais tes mains
Et serre-moi contre toi
On va rejoindre les autres
On va reprendre notre place dans cette colonne
Dans ce cortège des bras cassés, des lâche-rien, auquel on appartient
Plus que quelques secondes et on va pouvoir à nouveau envoyer nos coups d'chien
Regarder la folie reprendre ses droits
Danser comme des pantins
Tanguer d'bâbord à tribord
Et chanter tous ensemble, ce refrain, à la façon d'un chant d'marin

Que la fièvre marche avec nous

Lâche tes chevaux, rends-les fous
Attrape le tonnerre à pleines mains.

Les yeux rivés au plafond, j'entends le vent mauvais dehors
Qui s'remet à hurler sur les avenues et les boulevards
Avec la rage d'un ex-taulard qui ferait le tapin
J'me raconte des histoires étranges et puis j'essaye d'penser à rien
La panique me sert les rouleaux façon vie ragot
Mais je sais qu'tu seras jamais loin,
Toujours dans le coin d'mon œil dans mon champs de vision
Toi qui peut cogner si fort,
Quant à moi j'te laisserai pas t'porter t'inquiète
J'essayerais d'faire en sorte que l'air dans mes poumons soit brûlant
Aller passe toi d'l'eau sur le visage, mets toi quelques gentils claques,
Fais craquer tes phalanges et serre moi contre toi
On va retrouver les gars
On va reprendre notre place dans cette colonne
Dans ce cortège des bras cassés, des lâche-rien, auquel on appartient
Plus que quelques secondes et on pourra encore une fois
Jouer aux Indiens sur un champ d'mine
Hurler à la lune
Danser comme des pantins
Tanguer d'bâbord à tribord
Et chanter tous ensemble, ce refrain, à la façon d'un chant d'marin

Que la fièvre marche avec nous
Sous les arcades et sous les coups
Fleur au fusil, sourire en coin

Fidèle compagnon d'voyage
Face au vacarme, j'ai mes rituels étranges
J'ai les mains au fond d'mon blouson
Dans lesquels j'ai passé mes fétiches que j'fais s'entrechoquer
L'angoisse me file la courante, c'est pas gagné
Mais j'sais que t'es là toujours à ma portée
Comme j'suis à la tienne, tu l'sais
J'tiens mes promesses, je mens rarement
J'ai des cartes pleins les manches, pleins les manches
Et tous mes talismans
Aller aller, avale tes pilules
Descend, rejoins moi dans la rue que j'te serre-contre moi
On va rattraper les autres
On va rattraper l'train
On va reprendre notre place dans cette colonne
Dans ce cortège des bras cassés, des lâche-rien, auquel on appartient
On a des heures d'vant nous pour buter la nuit, boire, fumer, s’abîmer la santé
Et s'dire des belles choses et fantasmer

Fauve,"J'ai jamais vécu de happy end ailleurs
Que dans des salons de massages douteux d'Asie du sud-est
J'ai pas besoin de tes faux miracles en plastique
Ni que tu me serves des five-timers, romantiques au rabais
Je veux pas de tes mauvaises contrefaçons de sentiments
Il me faut du vrai, du complexe, du diamant 24 carats
Alors sauf ton respect, mets toi au cul tes scénarios bidons
Ceux qui embarque la peau avec quand ils prennent feu façon nylon
Façon made in China
Tu peux garder tout ça
Cette fille dans la publicité m'aimera jamais
Même si t'essaies de me la faire à chaque fois
Tori Black non plus ne me baisera pas
Elle baise plus en dehors des plateaux
Quand elle rentre elle est fatiguée, elle est crade c'est normal, c'est pas grave
Et merde amenez-mois de la raide, du rouge, du seroplex ou même les trois
Si ça marche pas je peux encore taper dans le liquide de refroidissement
Les escort-girls, j'y lâcherai tout mon compte, tout ce qu'il faut
Tant que tu fermes ta gueule

J'ai pas besoin de mon horoscope, ni de matériel de bureau nickel
Ni de la vitesse de la lumière,
Ni d'une nouvelle voiture plus intelligente que moi
Ni d'une nouvelle conscience, ni d'un meilleur cerveau
Ni d'un nouveau moi-même
Nouveau quand bien même je saurais quoi en foutre
J'ai pas besoin de problèmes de santé et encore moins de nouveau défi
J'ai déjà tout ce qu'il faut merci
Alors arrête de me parler comme à un abruti
Je veux pas qu'on me serve la purée ni qu'on me fasse mes lacets
Et puis ton truc c'est mal fait, tu trouves pas, mais regarde-toi
Tu fous le bourdon
On a envie de se jeter d'un pont tellement t'es con avec tes machines,
Tes petites machines dans ta tête
Parait que tes traits grossiers, tes faits tranchés
Tes choses trop simples pour être honnête
Mets tes couilles sur la table tiens
Au moins une fois dans ta vie
Crache ta valda, remonte ton froc t'as le cul qui fuit
Et boucle la ça fait comme bruit blanc c'est épuisant
Bordel on s'entend plus penser
Faut sucer qui pour que tu nous foutes la paix

Au passage tu peux aussi rembarquer tes diagnostiques de rebouteux foireux
Par exemple ""Julien n'est pas un commis démissionnaire""
Ni aucun autre de tes raccourcis
Julien rêve de mers turquoises, de calme et de poésie
Comme beaucoup d'autres il n'est pas un schéma
Ni un animal c'est pas un objet
Julien est complexe, il se dope gentiment, va en boite
Caresse son collègue quand il est amoureux fort dans les cuisines
Julien a besoin de sens profond
Et moi j'ai pas une envie débordante de fumer la gueule de mon voisin
D'ailleurs je crois bien que c'est pareil pour lui
Alors te donne pas de peine, reprends ta merde tes dernières haines
Ravale ton venin, tes hantises, tes psychoses ça me sert à rien
J'ai pas besoin de nouvelles peurs ni de nouveaux cauchemars
Ni de nouvelles tocades, j'ai déjà largement donné c'est bon là
Et puis tu veux que je mette ça où?
J'ai pas la place, nulle part
Mais que dalle je te dis
Alors remballe, remballe et tire-toi loin d'ici
Tu me feras pas croire que l'autre est un enculé puisque l'enculé il est en moi
Et au passage t'as le même chez toi
Donc tu me verras pas sauter sur mes semblables
Et tu me mettras jamais derrière un flingue ou uniquement
Uniquement si t'as des chances de passer devant
Peut-être que la vie est une chienne
C'est vrai qu'on entend ça parfois en attendant
Moi je vois des milliards de choses douces et belles
C'est pas du sable artificiel, c'est du métal très solide
Comme le parfum des fleurs
Je vivrai, passerai le règne de ta terreur",T.R.W.

Et bien moi j’ai décidé que pour les cent prochaines années il avancera les yeux bandés » Et Pierre de répliquer « Seigneur soyez pas pute laissez-lui au moins des indices par-ci par-là j’en sais rien » Et il en fut ainsi Depuis Jour et nuit je traque les épiphanies Avec la rage d’un mercenaire sous crack D’un alcoolique en manque de Jack D’un dément D’un amant qu’on plaque Jour et nuit je traque les épiphanies Avec la rage d’un mercenaire sous crack D’un alcoolique en manque de Jack D’un amant qu’on plaque D’un dément qu’on claque Je revois encore Matthieu et les étoiles dans ses yeux entre deux cigarettes fumées à la fenêtre de ma chambre Il me disait comme ça « Mon vieux tu savais que le verbe cristallisait la pensée ? Je te jure un mot sur une idée foireuse c'est exactement comme un baiser T'as pas remarqué ? C'est une question de perception » Et au fond je sais qu'il a raison Il y a quelque chose de mystique dans son affaire Pouvoir ramasser les mots par terre et les jeter comme des pierres Contre les parois plongées dans le noir pour en faire sortir les choses qui blessent Grâce à la parole réussir à s'armer contre les sales pensées et faire des plans Serrer les poings serrer les dents les cogner leur rentrer dedans Essayer d'attraper les syllabes à la volée pour en faire des bougies qui éclairent et qu’on placera sous les paupières Ou des jolis bouquets pour une fille qui nous plaît Finalement c’est pour ça que j’écris Je revois encore Thibault éclairé par le halo de la lampe à pétrole Il me disait comme ça entre les vapeurs d'alcool « Tu sais qu'on peut flotter au-dessus du sol Rien qu'avec la parole ? Je te jure On faisait ça quand j'étais enfant Sur le terrain vague derrière chez mes parents C'est juste une question de conviction » Et je prie pour qu'il ait raison Il y a quelque chose de magnifique dans son histoire De savoir que si tout foire il nous en reste dans les tiroirs Grâce à eux qui ont reçu le feu sacré qui permet de tout voir Eux les machines à observer Les machines à mettre des mots sur tout Eux qui écrivent plus vite que la pensée Et avec ça ils agrandissent la Vie Ils font apparaître les fils qui relient toutes les choses entre elles Et ça leur donne le courage de tout affronter Même la Kolyma En attendant moi quoi ? Moi j'ai rien vu rien lu rien entendu et surtout rien compris Mais c'est pas grave je t’attends tant pis La parole comme vaccin contre la mort La parole comme rempart contre l’ennui Parler parler encore Parler pour affronter la Nuit,COCK MUSIC SMART MUSIC

Aller au bois pour que quelqu’un accepte enfin
De toucher ton zob
Tripoter de la lycéenne
Porter des robes?
Te trémousser en talons hauts comme un gogo
Puis arpenter les ruelles sombres en secouant ta clochette

C’est un peu à cause de tout ça si tous les soirs c’est la même histoire
Métro apéro lexo clopes et pornos à l’ancienne
Sur lesquels tu t’entraînes rageusement
Même si ça fait longtemps que ça t’amuse plus vraiment

Mais il faut pas que tu désespères
Perds pas espoir
Promis juré qu’on la vivra notre putain de belle histoire
Ce sera plus des mensonges
Quelque chose de grand
Qui sauve la vie qui trompe la mort qui déglingue enfin le blizzard

Imagine-toi, t’es là en train de te reprendre un verre au bar
Quand tout à coup tu croises un regard qui te perfore de part en part
Imagine-toi, t’es là ça te tombe dessus sans crier gare
Un truc bandant un truc dément qui redonne la foi
Un truc comme ça

«Bonsoir quelle chance de se croiser ici
Bonsoir bonsoir je voudrais partager tes nuits»

Tu connaîtras les nuits fauves je te le promets
Elle sera tigre en embuscade quand tu viens te glisser sous ses draps
Tandis que toi tu feras scintiller tes canines lorsqu’elle enlève le bas
Elle t’offrira des feulements dans sa voix lorsqu’elle reprend son souffle
Qui s’échappent dans la cour pour aller faire gauler la Lune
Des coups de bélier invoqués comme un miracle
Et qui veulent dire «Si tu t’arrêtes, je meurs»
Toutes ces choses qui te la feront raidir rien qu’à te souvenir
Pour le million d’années à venir

Malheureusement tout ce qu’on t’offre pour l’instant
C’est des chattes épilées et des seins en plastique en vidéo
C’est terrifiant
Tout le monde veut la même chose
Même les travelos rêvent du prince charmant
Et pourtant on passe notre temps
A se mettre des coups de cutter dans les paumes
A trop mentir à force de dire
Je t’en supplie, me parle pas, range la guimauve, écarte les cuisses
Ferme ta gueule, laisse-moi juste kiffer mon va-et-vient de taulard
Et m’endormir direct moins de trois minutes plus tard»
A force de faire tout ça, on croyait quoi?
On se meurtrit on fait l’amour comme on s’essuie
Quel putain d'gaspillage
Mais il faut pas que tu désespères, perds pas l'espoir
Promis juré qu’on la vivra notre putain d'belle histoire
Ce sera plus des mensonges
Quelque chose de grand

Imagine-toi, t’es là en train de te reprendre un verre au bar
Quand tout à coup tu croises un regard qui te perfore de part en part
Imagine-toi, t’es là ça te tombe dessus sans crier gare
Un truc bandant un truc dément qui redonne la foi

Offre-moi dès ce soir
Ta peau brune et tes lèvres mauves
Tes seins tes reins tes cheveux noirs
Et qu’on se noie dans les nuits fauves

En échange de tout ça
Je t’offre ce dont je dispose
Mon corps mon âme prends tout tout de suite
Et qu’on se noie dans les nuits fauves

Et tant pis si on nous prend pour des demeurés
Bien sûr qu’on sait qu’ici c’est pas Hollywood
Sauf qu’aux dernières nouvelles
Le fantasme c’est encore gratuit

C’est pour ça qu’on se réfugie dans nos pensées
Qu’on ferme les yeux très fort jusqu’à voir des couleurs
En attendant que ça passe

Y a que comme ça qu’on peut rêver de caresses au réveil
Et de regards qui veulent dire «T’inquiètes plus, t’inquiètes plus»
De coups de poings dans le cœur
De 40e qui rugissent dans nos poumons à faire sauter les côtes
De torrents dans nos veines
D’une épaule pour pleurer sans honte
Et d’une oreille pour tout dire
Tout dire toujours quoiqu’il arrive
De serments argentés prononcés face au rayon vert
«Est-ce que tu veux m’épouser? Vivre et mourir à mes côtés?»

On rêve de réapprendre à respirer
Que la médiocrité qui nous accable
Aille se faire enfler au Pakistan
On attend désespérément celui ou celle
Qui apaisera d’un doigt nos muscles noués
Et nos encéphales en sous-régime
On attend désespérément celui ou celle
Qui fera battre notre cœur
Plus grand

C’est pour ça qu’il faut pas que tu désespères
Perds pas espoir
Promis juré qu’on la vivra notre putain de belle histoire
Ce sera plus des mensonges
Quelque chose de grand

Fauve,"Hey! Excuse-moi
Est-ce qu’on peut parler deux minutes?
Ce sera pas long je te promets
Après je disparais
Il fallait juste que je te parle de quelque chose
Et je me connais
Si je le fais pas maintenant je vais encore me défiler et m’en vouloir
Voila, j’arrive pas à te sortir de mes pensées
Je peux pas te le dire autrement
En même temps c’est pas très compliqué
Je pense que tu comprends
Je suis désolé si c’est un peu direct mais je me dis qu’on n’a qu’une vie
Qu’elle est trop courte, trop fragile
Et puis vaut mieux avoir des remords que des regrets

Je sais pas d’où ça sort
Je sais pas d’où ça vient
Je pourrais pas te l’expliquer
Et je comprendrais que tu me prennes pour un dingue
Je t’en voudrais pas
C’est juste que quand je te vois
Il y a des flashs dans ma tête
Il y a des images qui se répètent en boucle
Et j’ai besoin d’en avoir le cœur net
Je nous vois danser au ralenti sur du rub a dub
Et toi tu me déposes des mots précieux au creux de l’oreille
On se regarde droit dans les yeux
On veille jusqu’au lever du soleil
Je nous vois sortir marcher boire et partir sans payer
Tirer des plans sur la comète
Et faire l’amour les fenêtres ouvertes
Je vais pas te mentir sur le marché je suis pas forcément ce qu’il y a de meilleur
Parce que je suis bancal menteur pas fiable jamais à l’heure
Mais si tu veux je peux me faire boxeur, voleur, chauffeur, docteur, serviteur, dresseur de lions

Je vais pas te la faire a l'envers, tu pourras forcément trouver mieux
Parce que je suis maladroit, nerveux, égoïste et coléreux
Mais si tu veux je peux être souriant et même heureux, poli, généreux
Écrire des morceaux moins teigneux
Ou même des chansons pour les amoureux
C’est marrant parce que je me sens à la fois un peu ridicule de te balancer tout ça d’un coup
Et en même temps tu sais ça me fait beaucoup de bien
D’abord parce que je peux enfin être fixé sur ce qui se passe de ton côté
Mais aussi parce que je réalise la chance que j’ai
De pouvoir encore avoir des sentiments pour un être-human autre que moi
Ça me change tellement la vie
Tu te rends pas compte je crois
J’ai l’impression de plus être la même personne
C’est comme si d’un coup je me remettais d’une cuite qui avait duré genre deux ans
C’est long deux ans
Je me sens différent
J’ai envie de me lever à l’heure
De me remettre en mouvement
De moins fumer
De moins boire
Et puis, de plus draguer n’importe qui par peur de la solitude

Je sais pas d’où ça sort
Je sais pas d’où ça vient
Je pourrais pas te l’expliquer encore une fois
Ça faisait tellement longtemps que ça m’était pas arrivé
Et là ça me tombe dessus comme ça
Moi jusque-là je faisais un peu n’importe quoi
Je passais d’une personne à une autre sans réussir à m’attacher vraiment
C’était assez glauque mais bon
Je suis comme tout le monde, qu'est-ce que tu veux?
Alors que là je nous vois carrément danser au ralenti sur du rub a dub au corps à corps
On se regarde droit dans les yeux et puis on repart en tirant des bords
Je nous vois courir nager nus rougir transpirer jusqu’à brûler
Tirer des plans sur Jupiter et faire l’amour sous les éclairs
Alors je vais pas te mentir sur le marché je suis pas forcément ce qu’il y a de meilleur
Parce que je suis bancal menteur pas fiable jamais à l’heure
Mais si tu veux je peux me faire boxeur, voleur, chauffeur, docteur, serviteur, dresseur de lions
Je vais pas te mentir tu pourras forcément trouver mieux
Parce que je suis maladroit, nerveux, égoïste et coléreux
Mais si tu veux je peux être souriant et même heureux, poli, généreux
Écrire des morceaux moins teigneux
Ou même des chansons pour les amoureux

Et même si je sais
Que je suis loin d’être parfait
Si tu veux qu’on se lance
Qu’on essaie
Moi je pense que ça peut donner quelque chose de beau
Parce qu’après tout on sait jamais
Et même si tu vois
Que je suis pas quelqu’un pour toi
Si le soir quand ça va pas
Que t’es triste
Qu’il y a quoique ce soit
Fais-moi signe
Je serai là
Je te promets
Je bouge pas

Non vraiment, vraiment je vais pas te mentir
Sur le marché je suis pas forcément ce qu’il y a de meilleur
Parce que je suis bancal menteur pas fiable jamais à l’heure
Mais si tu veux je peux me faire boxeur, voleur, docteur, serviteur, colporteur

Je voudrais pas que tu te fasses de fausses idées non plus
J’ai pas l’intention de te demander en mariage
Et même si évidemment je peux pas te forcer à me fréquenter
Par contre je peux te demander de me croire quand je te dis tout ce que je te dis ce soir
Je suis pas un énième connard qui veut juste coucher avec toi
Me mets pas dans le même sac
C’est tout ce que je te demande, c’est tout ce que je te demande 
Allez, je vais te laisser tranquille maintenant
Je parle beaucoup, je sais, je suis désolé
Mais t'es pas obliger de me répondre tout suite tu sais
Puis en attendant, comme je te disais je bouge pas, je bouge pas
Bonne soirée",RUB a DUB

You lost me now twenty years and no one to talk to nothing to tell you

I've come this far and the place I found is the same one as before

Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so

Said when the next one arrives

I left there in a hurry

I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

I've come to talk with you again,

Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

And hold me close
Is it here you wanna be
Or in your daddy's arms?

Feargal Sharkey,"He gave everything
His heart, his dreaming
She just spat it back at him
This time she's leaving
This time she's leaving

She walks out and closes the door
I wonder in the corner
Catches fall, stairs echo
This time she's leaving
Yes, this time she's leaving

Each new day he tries again
Tries to smile but oh, the pain
Wonders if he'll go insane
'Cause he's a bitter man

No one really liked him
No one really can
That's the way he likes it
That he understands
'Cause he's a bitter man
",Bitter Man
Feargal Sharkey,"He's the man who's gonna do her right
Turn new pages
What can she see with the naked eye?
Nothing changes

That if he could, he would have been so fine
As it is they're strangers
It wasn't this that he had in mind
Being a lonesome ranger

Keep stepping outta line now
Get up, get out
Don't leave it to nature
Oh, no

A step in the light now
Get up, get out
Don't leave it to nature
Oh, no

There's a girl, she's gonna take him first
In easy stages
And every time he thinks he could be worse
It grows more contagious

This is a plan of your own contriving
It's a plan to see what you're going through
Couldn't stop your bridges burning
But don't you worry 'cause you're still learning

So when he says he's gonna do you right
Turn new pages
'Cause it isn't this that you had in mind
Being a lonesome ranger

Feargal Sharkey,"Take the ghost train away from freedom
One minute you're there and the next you're not
The game's called surprise

Guess the change has come
And the worst part about it is
You don't know what you've done

Ghost train, ghost train
You get a one way ticket on a ghost train

It leaves no time to ponder
No time to change your shoes
It's a fast paced game that you're certain to lose

When you hear that whistle blowing
Just stop what you're doing
You gotta get that train on the road to ruin

Ghost train, ghost train
You get a one way ticket on a ghost train

The compartment is so tiny
There's only room for one
The conductor is so huge
That he blocks out the sun

You can reach for the cord
But don't try to pull it
The windows are one way
So you can't see through it",Ghost Train
Feargal Sharkey,"I hear a lot of stories, I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do for you
High is the risk of striking out, the risk of getting hurt
And still I have so much to learn

Well I know 'cause I think about it all the time
I know that real love is hard to find

And a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high, I blame it on my youth
Soon enough I'll learn the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter then boast how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

Well I know 'cause I learn a little every day
I know 'cause I listen when the experts say that

That a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I reflect on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't as foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find

I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know it will be worth it in the end

A good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

A good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart

With this heart of mine

Feargal Sharkey,"I have no use in waking
Sleep walking is all I do
I was no one to nobody
'Til the day that I met you

What good were all my dreams
But endless fantasy?
Just a heart that had no laughter
'Til the day you came to me

Then I looked into your eyes
I knew that love had come to me
So I held out my hand as I opened my heart and said
Darling please

I wanna be
Someone to somebody
And that someone is you
Don't you wanna be
Someone to somebody?
Then be my someone too

Oh, what good was all my freedom
With my heart tied up in chains
Though I claimed free expression
There was no way to explain

That I was filled with feelings
No one to show them to
What I hadn't known was that all along
I had saved my love for you

Now my days are so much warmer
And my nights no longer cold
'Cause you looked at me
And you held my hand and said
Darling, I wanna be

How was I to know

Full confession

Well I guess I always knew it
Somewhere deep inside of me

Feargal Sharkey,"When I was a young man
I guess you could say
I would hopefully smile at the start of each day

That you cannot hide
Over and over
This story I tell
Caught by surprise
Sent right to hell
For love is a gamble but this is no bet
The more you give the less you get

This is love

I don't want no part of it
Get to the heart of it

The more I tried to find you
The more you got lost
I knew that I must have you
No matter the cost
But all this is over
I've thrown off those chains
You're looking at a man
Who's pulled in those reins
Over and over

Organise my life again one more time
Never looked cause I can never see the point of it
Now I realise that was just unkind
My heart talks back, says you've misplaced love
My heart attacks and it won't let up
My heart talks back says enough's enough

Why don't you set me free now
Can you just let me be now
Why don't you set me free now
Can you just let me be now

One of these days I'm going to get up early
Start to think it through again one last time
Not that I cared so much, I just needed a reason
To criticise someone when it's all in the mind

My heart attacks and it won't let up

A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Federico Britos,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Fedez,"E' un'altra notte in ansia in cui non riesco a dormire
E cosi com'è iniziata doveva finire
Una discesa troppo lunga per non trovare una salita
Un sogno troppo bello per durare una vita
Da quando non ho più i tuoi occhi non mi bastano le stelle
E anche con 200 troie non mi basteranno quelle
Forse troppo vecchi per non pensare più alla morte
Ma ancora troppo giovani per un rapporto così forte
Non è la prima strofa che ti scrivo
Ma forse è la prima che faccio veramente con il cuore
E se ti guardo in faccia, ti dico solo amore

Perché mi riesce difficile spiegartelo a parole
E con l'ultimo bacio dato
Ho capito l'importanza di ciò che prima davo per scontato
Presi dai nostri lavori e dalle circostanze
Questa non è per dirti addio, è solo per dirti grazie.
Questa è per te che mi hai capito, sostenuto, sopportato
Lo ripeto all'infinito (sei unica al mondo)
Con cui mi sono aperto, con te gioco allo scoperto
Lo ripeto all'infinito (sei unica al mondo)
Per te che mi hai abbracciato quando ne avevo bisogno
Non sembra ma ti ho amata più di ogni altra cosa al mondo
Se non te l'ho mai detto è perchè me ne vergogno
Non so se l'hai capito (sei unica al mondo)
(Sei unica al mondo)

Fedez,"Il tuo cuore batte a tempo
Ritmo nuovo mai sentito
E da quelo poco che l'ascolto
È già il mio pezzo preferito
Mangio merda da vent'anni
Ma non perdo l'appetito
Poi mi fanno pure fare la scarpetta con il dito
Labbra gusto di fumo
Mischiate col Pampero
Rende la testa pesante
Ma il cuore più leggero
E tu sei il cigno nero
Stanco di seguire il branco
E IL CUORE grande come il sole
Ma freddo come il marmo
Né giovani nè grandi
Nel cuore piove grandine
Stasera niente alcol
Voglio bere le mie lacrime
E una crepa sopra il petto
Che diventa una voragine
Al quale non puoi fare le iniezioni di collagene
Io sono senza scrupoli e tu sei senza carattere
Togliamoci I vestiti ma teniamoci le maschere
Se mi fissi bene non vedrai I miei occhi sbattere
Sogno ad occhi aperti perdo l'uso delle palpebre

La lacrima che brucia
Il vento la consuma
Il nero che mi sporca
Tanto poi si lava
E tutto ciò che ho perso
Io lo perdo ancora
Mi tengo dentro il vuoto
Che di te mi resta

E a cosa servirebbe dirci che ci siamo amati
Tanto quando esce il disco ci saremo già lasciati
Godiamoci il momento perché prima o poi finisce
L'amore spesso prende ma poi non restituisce
Io sto ancora aspettando il cuore che gli ho dato in prestito
Se la vita insegna io sono un alunno pessimo
È come se facessimo una gara
È un inizio lungo ma alla fine non è poi così lontana
Già, sei bella e dannata
La metà mancata di una mela avvelenata
E io cerco il sollievo in una dose di veleno
Chi è stato allattato da chi ha le serpi in seno
La consapevolezza che non c'è certezza
Vieni stammi vicina, sì ma a distanza di sicurezza
Io ti ho dato un dito invece tu mi hai preso il cuore
E sono sempre stato incline agli sbalzi d'amore

La lacrima che brucia
Il vento la consuma
Il nero che mi sporca
Tanto poi si lava
E tutto ciò che ho perso
Io lo perdo ancora
Mi tengo dentro il vuoto
Che di te mi resta

E il tuo nome è stato scritto a matita
Per poterti cancellare una volta finita
Tra me e te sai
Sei l'errore più bello della mia vita
Il tuo nome è stato scritto a matita

Su abito da sera sogna l’anima gemella l’altra metà della pera
La figlia del sultano sta in un harem di uno yacht
Giusto per arrotondare chiede mille e una notte
Quartiere, Far West, ghetto con gli stivali
Biancaneve la più amata dai principi colombiani
La principessa sul pisello assieme all’uomo nero
Ha capito che le dimensioni contano davvero
Nel mondo delle favole son tutti meno stanchi

E mettitelo in testa contro loro non puoi vincere
Il tuo Stato è Pollicino e ti ruba anche le briciole
Pinocchio è diventato consigliere regionale
Guarda quanto gli si allunga la fedina penale
E più che il congiuntivo ama la condizionale
Perchè qua i grilli parlanti sono visti molto male
Uomo di marzapane mette il lievito nei prezzi
Perchè ormai un lieto fine giustifica I mezzi

Fedez,"Hai mai pensato che scrivere al Papa su Twitter e non ricevere risposta è l’equivalente di pregare?
Ecco prova a pensare

Il monaco non fa l’abito e manco l’arbitro
Almeno penso io
Sua Eminenza aspetti un attimo
Si è preso l’attico per stare più vicino a Dio
Mi sembra patetico ma io non pontifico
Un occhio benefico e l’altro sul bonifico
Oro alle pareti carta da carati
Le regge dei preti sembrano emirati
Anche mia nonna giura che la fede ti cattura
Le banche vaticane hanno un mandato di fattura
Il vino dentro al calice ai poveri non darlo
Ce lo beviamo a Montecarlo
La Chiesa accumula ricchezza ma il denaro è del demonio
Forse gli stanno solo sequestrando il patrimonio
Chiese con l’ascensore ma che benedizione
Fede, messa e rock‘n’Rolex

Ed un loft a New York
Il sushi a Saint Tropez
Il bidè di Chanel

Io c’ho la Limo
E non pago l’IMU
Sono proprio un Cardinal Chic

Quando un prelato passa il piatto a un altro uomo
Molto probabilemnte è il suo maggiordomo
Pensare a queste cose fa un po' riflettere
Che la Chiesa è un lusso che non ti puoi permettere
Vestiti su misura per credenti e non
Stilisti dello IOR don Vuitton
Scarica il rosario dall’Apple Store
Vieni a benedire il tuo smartphone
La speranza è in vacanza come il culo di un politico
Lo Spirito Santo è a Borghetto Santo Spirito
I peccatori sono tutti quanti a Porto Cervo
Dici ora li raggiungo sennò a cosa servo
Prosciutto di Prada e fedeli al lastrico
La ricetta giusta per un patè d’animo
La libertà si guadagna non si compra

E i fedeli ai piani bassi che al massimo sbucciano cipolle pregando di fronte a un frigo vuoto
Le madonne inizieranno davvero a piangere sangue
A noi le ostie a voi le ostriche
La vostra eucarestia è la nostra carestia
Aspiranti don Verzè con la faccia come il culto
Ipocrisia incastonata in collane e anelli d'oro pesante

Sei andata via cosi senza nemmeno salutarmi
Può darsi che un giorno passerai a trovarmi
Quante notti insieme svegli fino a notte tardi
Vite appese ad un filo di cashmere
Mi preoccupo perchè non ho più niente di cui preoccuparmi
Si dice che la vita è una tienitela stretta 
E che il successo uccide lentamente ma io non ho fretta
E se mi guardo indietro con dieci anni di distanza 
Ero con le tasche vuote e le palle piene di speranza
È andata come è andata via! ce la siamo giocata
Ora io faccio la differenza e tu fai la differenziata
Dai pezzi dentro disco rigido al primo disco fisico
Uscito con un'ora di ritardo e dieci anni d'anticipo
Dal vuoto del Grand Canyon a vincere il Gran Premio 
Riconosco un uomo disperato a casa anch'io ho uno specchio

Mi odi a priori lo so
Più parlano più penso che sia per sport
Non cambiano
Non sogni tutto quello che io ho
Come no
Come no,come no

L'invidia arriva sempre dal basso verso l'alto
E per ogni passo falso è più sangue di un salasso
Sai perchè si punta in alto e non in largo? 
Perchè gli sputi sono sempre dall'alto verso il basso
Tu lo fai per hobby io lo faccio di mestiere
Infatti tu non odi me ma solo ciò che non puoi avere
Quando sei una stella di mestiere chi non ti può vedere
Esprime un solo desiderio: vederti cadere

Mi odi a priori lo so
Più parlano 
Più penso che sia per sport
Non cambiano
Non sogni tutto quello che io ho
Come no
Come no,come no,come no

Più la gente critica più questo mi gratifica,
Perchè significa che ho il fascino della classifica
Più ci mangi e bevi ti andava bene finchè c'eri
Perchè sputi nel piatto in cui pippavi fino a ieri
Sorrisi artificiosi buoni per gli artificieri
Perchè qua più sono finti più ti dicono di essere veri
Questi parlano alle spalle mentre io sempre di fronte
Infatti loro sono spalle, io invece sono il frontman

Mi odi a priori lo so

Più penso che sia per sport

Il problema è che gli altri due sono i genitori
Con in mano il testamento tipo Nonno quando muori?
Ti trovi a quarant'anni a dire Mamma dormo fuori

Tipo che l'Iphone smette di scrivere e tu smetti di vivere
Pazzo per gli autoscatti? Sei fotosensibile
Su Facebook si è iscritta metà popolazione
L'altra metà ha ancora dei problemi con il modem
I suicidi ormai non fanno più tanto rumore
In tuo onore ci sarà un minuto di silenziatore

Scrivo fine in un secondo se in te c'è un secondo fine
Lo so è brutto da pensare
Mi aspetto che ti piaccia stare
Sotto le coperte e non sopra le copertine
L'amore a prima Visa
È un sentimento splendido
Mi ha detto un indovino che legge le carte di credito
Vomito, amore tossico, per me sei stata il mio primo bacio
Sulla bocca dello stomaco
A volte sembra che mi sfidi ma non mi spaventi
Nella vita hai provato più vestiti che sentimenti
Istruzioni di lavaggio per cuori sintetici
Ti prego dimmi che mi ami
Potrei persino crederci
E tutte le tue amiche fanno un muro da spavento
I miei tatuaggi non sono di loro gradimento
Io sono sporco all'esterno ma giudicare le apparenze
È l'atteggiamento tipico di chi è sporco dentro

Di storie ce ne sono tante
Pensavo fossi l'ultima e invece no
In fondo anche tu
Sei solo un segno in più
Che sulla pelle fa più male
Continuerà a bruciare anche se ora lo so
Che in fondo anche tu
Sei solo un segno in più

A volte è Dio che sbaglia la tua ordinazione
Per questo se chiudi la porta si apre un burrone
Sei il mio punto debole
La mia causa di forza maggiore
Un senso di rivoluzione
Un golpe al cuore
Più truccata di un appalto su uno scorcio suggestivo
Se ti guardo a luci spente sei un tramonto abusivo
Inverti lo schema e cambi anche il teorema
Prima eri un problema di cuore ora sei il cuore del problema
Non ho difficoltà a dirti quel che penso in faccia
Anche se non sembra so bene quello che faccio
La verità è che ho invertito il senso di marcia
Da quando ho avvertito il senso di marcia
Arrivi portando brividi e scappi lasciando i lividi
Gli opposti si attraggono ma amano i propri simili
Sentimenti tossici per loro non c'è cura
Perché l'amore eterni finché dura

Di storie ce ne sono tante
Pensavo fossi l'ultima e invece no

Un cielo instabile
Che quasi sembra piangere, piangere

Fedez,"Per strada ho perso amici come le monete 
Faccio tutto quello che voi mi chiedete 
È bello quando in giro mi riconoscete 
(Ma tu sei Emis Killa? Ehm no) 
Lei si aspetta un addio da film struggente 
Ma perché versare lacrime sul niente 
Nella vita un vaffanculo è più che sufficiente 
Bicchieri mezzi pieni di rimpianti 
E party ai piani alti 
Dove più sei coglione più hai bisogno di farlo sapere agli altri 
E avanti 
La cara vecchia vita scordala 
Uscire sempre con un bodyguard 
Perché per ogni applauso c’è sempre nascosto un vaffanculo dietro 
Le fughe dal retro 
Le mani sul vetro 
E chi se lo ricorda più di come è fatta una metro 
Da quant’è che non ci sentiamo? 
Ti serve un accredito, possibilmente un pass backstage con accesso al palcoscenico

L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu 
L’hai voluto tu

Ma a quanto pare ho una vita niente male 
Ma per me in Italia niente mare 
In cerca di un bel posto dove posso stare 
(Guardi per lei Timbuctù è perfetta) 
Faccio foto ricordo in giorni da dimenticare 
Ma almeno con gli autografi risparmio sui regali di Natale 
E io che nelle discoteche non ci ho mai messo piede 
Ora son pagato per andare con la maschera di Fedez 
E non sempre è un bene

Una pioggia di lampi colorati incendia il palcoscenico 
Ma la prima cosa a bruciare è il tuo stomaco 
Gli effetti speciali precedono sempre gli effetti collaterali 
La fama è solo il franchising del successo 
Ti fermano per strada perché sei qualcuno 
Ti chiedono le foto perché sei qualcuno 
Ti invitano alle feste perché sei qualcuno 
E quante volte tu più che qualcuno avresti voluto essere qualcun altro 
Nuove amicizie attratte dal soldo 
Rapporti umani costantemente in saldo 
Nessuno al mondo è ricco, ci sono solo poveri e poveri con I soldi 
La differenza tra l’essere in bolletta e il non voler pagare la bolletta, specie quella dei riflettori

Ma è pericoloso spegnere le luci della ribalta se hai paura del buio 
Se gli piaci troppo è perché non ti hanno capito 
Se gli piaci affatto è perché non ti hanno capito 
Essere è non essere compreso 
Il tuo privilegio è l’IVA di un prezzo troppo alto da pagare 
Per quanto potrai guadagnare le tue debolezze resteranno un lusso che non ti potrai mai permettere di ostentare 
Ci sono giorni in cui rinuncerai al successo, ma oramai è successo

Sapessi quante ne ho viste di scalatrici sociali
Regalano due di picche aspettando il Re di denari
Quante volte ad un ""Ti Amo"" hai risposto ""No, non posso""
Hai provato dei sentimenti e non ti stanno bene addosso
Parliamo allo stesso modo ma con diversi argomenti
Siamo nello stesso Hotel ma con due viste differenti
L'Amore è un punto di arrivo, una conquista
Ma non esiste prospettiva senza due punti di vista

Anche se poi tutto è magnifico
Non lo prenderò come un rimprovero
È possibile abbia sogni sbagliati, un po' illusi al momento
Mi appartengono

Fuori è magnifico
Si ma tu un po' di più
Sei la bellezza a due passi
A portata di manicure
Ma so che quando troveranno il centro dell'universo
Rimarrai delusa a scoprire che non sei tu
Ognuno coi suoi pensieri e I suoi segreti
Lo so siamo divisi dalla spazio senza essere pianeti
L'Amore rende ciechi devo dirtelo
E io devo smettere di cercare le scarpe nel frigorifero
Ma tu non guardi me continui a guardare fuori
Ti ho dato I giorni migliori dei miei anni peggiori
Contraddizioni e vizi, a ognuno il suo
Ma questa notte dormo sul mio fianco preferito, il tuo

Anche se poi tutto è magnifico
Non lo prenderò come un rimprovero
È possibile abbia sogni sbagliati, un po' illusi al momento
Mi appartengono

Anche se poi tutto è realistico
Non lo prenderò come un rammarico
È possibile abbia sogni sbagliati, un po' illusi al momento

Quando sto all'Esselunga le signore non mi cagano
Ma quando arriva al sabato sapessi quanto pagano
La mia presenza con un po' di frutta al tavolo
Insieme a dei flute di plastica che poi nemmeno lavano
All'Esselunga costo poco come un doccia shampoo
Ma dentro al locale valgo almeno trenta volte tanto
Mi fanno le foto mentre fanno sorsi piccoli
In posa con le mani fanno degli strani simboli
Il soprammobile perfetto per una Jacuzzi
Accompagnato da un piattino di more e lamponi
Se vuoi far sapere a tutti che la tua cintura è Gucci
Sistema sempre la maglietta dentro i pantaloni
Ordinane un paio, ordinane un camion
Se vuoi sembrare ricco allora ordina la magnum
Se chi trova un Moet trova un tesoro
Tu hai trovato una collana d'oro fatta di polistirolo

È da un po' che rum e pera fanno hating da tastiera
Perchè ogni sera sboccio più dei fiori a primavera
Quello dei Club Dogo fa le felpe col mio logo
Adesso aspetto solo che mi fanno fare il videogioco
Non devi essere dell'arma per avere una divisa
Ma se vuoi venire armato allora armati di Visa
Quelli che si tatuano una lacrima sul viso
Hanno ucciso della gente vogliono prenderne il merito
Io invece tatuo lacrime sopra la carta Visa
Per quante volte ho ucciso le vostre carte di credito

Ma non batte ciglio quando il Paese affonda
L’italiano fa casino durante il minuto di silenzio
E poi sta il silenzio per anni quando dovrebbe fare casino
L’italiano per protestare in piazza aspetta che ci sia il sole
Il bollettino meteo guiderà la rivoluzione
Le Poste entreranno in Alitalia e mia nonna che ha paura di volare
Penso non andrà più a ritirare la pensione, sai che danno
Se fossi il fidanzato di Trenitalia sarei stufo di comprare test di gravidanza per ogni suo ritardo
Il sindacato è caldo ma poi tutto è troppo calmo tra chi incrocia le braccia e chi incrocia uno sguardo
E in Italia le mamme fanno le raccomandazioni mentre i figli di papà si fanno le raccomandate

Nelle foto segnaletiche dei fuorilegge una volta c’era scritto wanted
Ora sotto quelle foto ci trovi scritto “Votami”
Il tuo Paese ti ha allattato fin da quando eri neonato
Ma poi ti ha lasciato in strada parzialmente stremato
E il senso del ridicolo che continua a fare danni
In un Paese senza tempo ormai fermo agli anni ‘80
Qui dove il giovane regista ha appena compiuto 40 anni e il giovane architetto invece ne ha 50
E l’italiano che allo stadio urla negro a Balotelli e poi dal parrucchiere gli copia il taglio di capelli
L’italiano va allo stadio come se stesse andando in guerra
E poi se ne va in guerra come se andasse allo stadio

Paths that never had crossed
Lonely but free
Wandering aimlessly
Two separate lives
Colliding like clouds in the sky

Cautious at first
Afraid of repeating the hurt

Drawn like the surf to the shore
Helpless to run
Stronger than rays of the sun

I can't forget Caribbean sunsets
I will return
Then to retrace the footprints we made
As the tide was getting low
Hoping we'd never go home

Drifting in dreams
Through islands lost in the stream
Waking to find
Only the memories of mine
Counting the days
Waiting for something to take me away

To the bed as I took off my shoes

Why did you shut me down
Then change your mind
Tell me why

By a pro at an early age

And I still have a lump in my throat
The lady in red is history
And all she left was a note

Why did you tell me you could
But you couldn't
Why did you toss me off
Then put me on
What went wrong

I thought you were my friend

Looking at the world through silver clouds

Gotta cut these ropes around my hands

Burning out for solo

There's no new religion
And there's no real solution
Got to pull myself back in

No more indecision

Et si il s'échoue qui devra ramer?

Qui bat les épouses en disant les aimez?
Qui porte les coups qui ne veut pas s'en mêler?
Qui se la ferme, est un chic type, veut juste faire sa petite vie?
Tous ceux qui ont quelque chose à perdre

Mais qui fait taffer comme un homme un môme?
Qui fait le café?qui choisit l'arôme?
Qui fait des affaires dans le sang?
Qui en consommant consent?
La réponse ne va pas te plaire

Guide ce navire, si, si
Et si il s'échoue qui devra ramer?

Si, si
Si, si

I'm gonna tease ya till you beg for euthanasia

That it had to be this way
Please don't hate me,
But there's nothing you can say
To change my mind
I've got to go away

He wanted more and more

Bye bye boyfriend

Lay down and work

It was fun but it couldn't last forever
Bye bye pretty boy,

Let me tell you how it was when we started off
The tattoos and the lip pierce and raggedy style you used to rock
Lately everything you do and say is messed up
Things have changed, down is up we're outta luck

And baby I'm sorry
That it had to be this way
Please don't hate me, but there's nothing you can say

You never put the effort in to the things that really counted
A word here, and a kiss there
Could change the way its turning out
You work so hard at all the things I never cared about
How hands work & fingers moving, eyes wide shut
And baby I'm lonely
Though your right in front of me
You controlled me
That was the girl I used to be
Gave up myself
Well its over now

The guy that I fell for
He wanted more and more

Why you break your promises to me
Daddy daddy
Don't you know you hurt me constantly

And there's something I think you should know
I'm not the little girl you left waiting at home

Where were you when I was scared to go to sleep
Where were you to soothe my insecurities
Why can't I be angry

Where were you the first time someone broke my heart
Where were you when I first learned to drive a car
Where were you when I plugged in my first guitar

Don't Let Me Fall

If you should go
We'll never know
We can try a little harder
We can let the eagle fly away

[Chorus:]
Don't let me fall
I need you in my life
To take me through
Don't let me go
Try it one more time

Hide from today
We tried, we gave
Couldn't see that things were changing
Till the changes came to tear us down

[Chorus:]
Don't let me fall
I need you in my life
To take me through
Don't let me go
Try it one more time

Is it snowing where you are
Guess it must be getting dark
And the quite streets of home
Are weakful
They never leave me alone

You say we're fine
As if I'm blind
Tell the weight upon your shoulders
And the pain behind your drying eyes
Lets try it one more time

[Chorus:]
Don't let me fall
I need you in my life
To take me through
Don't let me go
Try it one more time

Try it one more time

And I'm sitting here soaking wet, waiting for you

'Cause I know what rainbows do

They fade away,
Fade away,
Fade away, away,
Stormy day, found its way
And I wish I could hold you now

I'm only a rainbow away, my friend

What others see
You wouldn't feel so bad

That storms are like rainbows too

Let me tell you how it was when we started off
The tattoos and the lip pierce and raggedy style you used to rock
Lately everything you do and say is messed up
Things have changed, down is up we're outta luck

You never put the effort in to the things that really counted
A word here, and a kiss there
Could change the way its turning out
You work so hard at all the things I never cared about
How hands work & fingers moving, Eyes wide Shut
And baby I'm lonely
Though your right in front of me
You controlled me
That was the girl I used to be
Gave up myself

All about you
And now, I'm staring in your eyes and shake down
I'm all about you
And in our mind it comes so easily
But it's a feeling coming over me
I want to show you but there's no where we can really be free
Everybody's watching

Wouldn't it be good if we could be together?
Take me away
Take me far away from here and I will run
With you, don't be afraid
Navigate, and I will steer, into the sun,
We will run

I try, to remember when I was just a child
In my room
My, imagination used to run wild
But I never knew
That things are never as they seem to be
When I dream to life, it's my reality
It should be easy when 2 people love each other, like we
Everybody's talking

Wouldn't it be good if we could be together?
Take me away
Take me far away from here and I will run
With you, don't be afraid
Navigate, and I will steer, into the sun,
We will run

Will run

Will run
Oh ya ya ya

Wouldn't it be good if they would understand us?
Wouldn't it be good if we could be together!!

Don't go girls and boys can rule the world
Don't go boys and boys should be together
Don't go girls and girls can rule the world

I've got jumbo polka-dotted trousers with the empty pockets
It's funny to me that the two of us could fit in one pair
Kings and queens on magazines that have me on the cover
But none of that compares to just one night alone with you
And what you do

Don't go girls and boys can rule the world
Don't go boys and boys should be together
Don't go girls and girls can rule the world

Don't go girls and boys should be together

Got me wishin' I was just a little squirrel at your window
Got me whistlin' a song I thought I never could like just for you

But she's a beauty queen
With liner dripping from her eyes
Her tears keep burning holes
Into her sick abusive lies
All the poison tears
And rips away at her

You're a troubled girl just like me
There's no need to hide your insecurities

[Chorus:]
(Cause) I can see
I can see right through you
I can see
I can see the truth

Her high schools full of guys
That hang around
And want a date
Stand straight
Shoulders back
Oh she's so full of hate (wait)

Lifts her skirt
Pulls his hair
That's why she's always late (hate)
But still you around
Like you're some kind of f****ing saint

You're a troubled girl just like me
There's no need to hide your insecurities

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
There's a part of me
That wants to be like her
Perfect skin
Long legs and blond hair

[Chorus]

We should've stood together
Now I can't breathe if I'm not breathing with you
I can't sleep if all I'm dreaming is you
Can't you see I've got no air without you
I can't breathe I can' breathe

So I cracked and called you today
And the tears froze on my face
'Cause you said we were over
You were so cold

I can't sleep if all I'm dreaming is you

I can't catch my breath
It's getting harder to speak
You should be proud of me
But you're too insecure and too vain

'Cause every time I hold you, I'll be waiting for you
Try to pull away from what I truly thought was love
Maybe it's a sickness preying on my weakness

Last night I thought I saw you, black jeans, faded tattoos
That's when I knew it was you so don't go taking me back

De andar a pie, pasé un Ferrari 
De un bus pasé a un avión 
Que nunca ganaría un Grammy, haciendo reggaetón 
Que tampoco llegaría a ser el uno en el Billboard 
Me confundieron con un loco cuando era un soñador 

Ahora vivo lo que soñé 
Y tú vienes buscándome 
Que raro que ahora me digas que me amas 
Debe ser por cómo me ves 

Qué raro, que ahora que estoy más caro 
Cupido te haga disparos 
Y que andes loquita por mí
Eso no me queda claro 

Que ahora que estoy más caro

Y que andes loquita por mí

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Eso no me queda claro 
Qué raro

Me acuerdo cuando de mi tú te reías 
Y ahora ya no quieres salir de mi vida 
No tiene sentido que busques mi compañía
Yo me moría, tu seguías conmigo fría

Cuando viva lo que soñé
Ya no vengas buscándome
Qué raro que tú digas que me amas
Sabré que es por cómo me ves

Me acuerdo de ti cuando no era cantante
Cuando no me vestía tan elegante
Cuando lo material era lo importante
No te parecí un hombre interesante

Ahora los tiempos han cambiado 
Han cambiado bastante 
Han cambiado bastante 

Que raro, que ahora que estoy más caro 
Cupido te haga disparos 
Y que andes loquita por mí 
Eso no me queda claro

Dicen que el amor solo llega una vez
Y yo sé que contigo lo encontré
Eres todo lo que un día quise tener
Tu cuerpo, tu carita
Y tu forma de ser

Tienes mi mundo de cabeza, princesa
Ya no volví a sentir tristeza
Y cuando te vas siento que falta la mitad de mí

Ya ninguna más me interesa
Tu boca, qué rico me besa

Y si nos vamos pa' Miami, mi mami
Tú sabes lo que me gusta a mí
Un traguito bien fine, en la playa de Hawái
Siento que se van las luces
De solo ver como se luce
Bailando en la orilla del mar

En serio que estoy mal de la cabeza, cómo tú me besas
Cómo te desempeñas sin ropa con destreza
Cómo te mueves cuando el ritmo empieza
Cierra los ojos te tengo una sorpresa

Es inevitable pensar
Mami que en el amor siempre me iba tan mal
Yo sabía que tenías que llegar
Somos tal para cual

De tu cintura se desprende el calor, calor 
La locura que entra por mis venas
A la cordura le decimos adiós, adiós
Sin ataduras que nada nos frena

Siente el latido de mi corazón
Porque me verás, you turn me on (You turn me on)
Tú regulas mi presión
Tengo un problema y tú eres la solución, bombón

Que este amor me está causando demencia
La cosa va en ascendencia

Feist,"When I was a young girl I used to see pleasure
When I was a young girl I used to drink ale
Out of the ale house, down into the jail house
My body salve-aided and hell is my doom

Come mama come papa and sit you down by me
Come sit you down by me and pity my case
My poor head is aching my sad heart is breaking
My body salve-aided and hell is my doom

Please send for the preacher to come and pray for me
And send for the doctor to heal all my wounds
My poor head is aching my sad heart is breaking
My body salve-aided and I'm bound to die

Feist,"I went to London town to clear up my mind
Then on to Paris for the fun I could find
I found I couldn't leave my memories behind
Where can I go without you

Tried seeing Singapore that wouldn't do
So I went Vienna but I found you THERE too
Even in Switzerland your memory came through
Where can I go without you

So I wanted to travel and I wanted romance
So I just took off and chased my rainbow across the sea
But it's all over I'm tired of faces and QUAINT old places
Baby if you won't be there with me

Back on the boat again farewell to France
So long West Germany it hasn't got a chance
I'll trade the sides I've seen for one loving glance

He acted that way and hello will be like a cut
Fill me up and pour me out, realize the doubt
We had the same feelings at opposite times

When good man and good woman
Can find the good in each other
And good man and good woman
Bring out the worst in the other
The bad in each other

Where to love to find it now
When we'll become two
Floating into the blue and the neon river
The sadness can move either without or with him

The good man and good woman
Can't find the beauty in each other

Under slow dancing trees
Birds are telling me stories
Saying you were meant for me

With their bittersweet melodies
Like a sweet memory
Bittersweet melodies
Can't go back, I can't go on (without those)
Bittersweet melodies

Weakened kitchen floor
Snow slips under the door
Tiny speakers were singing
Telephone always ringing 

With those bittersweet melodies
Like a sweet memory

Can't go back, I can't go on

I remember us
'Fore we turn to dusk
Just when these feelings were all about
When we still could trust 
In our hearts

Can't go back, I can't go on

Unlock the lock inside of me

Caught me a long wind

A long life wind
I got to know the sky
But it didn't know me
Got to see the light
And land on top of the sea
And be the bird, be the key
And now the current tells
What the wave withheld
And then the lightning say
Oh where light the will lay
Where will you go?

Lightly banging on the cymbals
A writ into the night
Came storming to your house

My bear had lost its innate calm

I, and you are the same and

And your pleasure

Oh, an echo calls up the line
Indication of time
Our togetherness
That is how we evolved
We became our needs
Ages up inside
Escaping similar pain
Dreaming safe and secure
Generations in line
Old and then the youth
Come to meet or fade
A chromosomal raid
Built by what we got built for
As much as what we avoid
So the mystery lifts

We know enough to admit

It's my pleasure

Still waiting for the main attraction

We broke the ties that bind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The moon is new

And while I'm waiting here

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you

Felicia Sanders,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On!
Felicia Sanders,"Barbra Streisand If I Love Again Lyrics:
I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again",If I Love Again
Felicia Sanders,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Felicia Sanders,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon
Felicia Sanders,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?
",The Song from Moulin Rouge (Where Is Your Heart)
Felicia Sanders,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today

Pido que vuelvas con mi corazón

No es que no te quiera es que ni pude hablarte 
Guardo en mi cabeza lo bueno ya me olvide de lo malo 
Y aprendí que la tristeza me hace mejor ser humano 
Ahora soy un hombre nuevo 
Y soy mejor y aunque me prometa olvidarte 
Por ti aprendí lo que es amor 

Girasoles, once meses, mis canciones, tus mirada 
Yo se que también te acuerda y no es malo eres humana 
No te escribo para nada diferente a recordarte. 
Y a pesar de los seis meses sin hablar y no mirarte 

Yo te quiero y no para volver, 
Te quiero por que parte tuya me a enseñado 
Que es amar y que es crecer, 
Ya no siento mas y con la mano en el corazón

Ouvrirons tous les hôtels,
Y coucherons les poules et les gazelles
Et les chiens et les p'tits pots de miel.

Plus de frontières

Plus qu’une main de femme fait frissonner mon corps
Mes ailes fatiguées ne peuvent pas la suivre
Sans île dans l’azur plus de raison de vivre

Qu’ai-je fait, qu’ai-je dit durant tous ces hivers
L’oreille sur ma porte attendant une venue?
La porte s’est ouverte dans un éclat de rire
Et à l’oiseau en cage une île est apparue

Depuis bien des matins je t’apprends la marée
Le semence du grain et la fin des gelées
Mais toi riant tout plein tu m’apprends que la joie
Tu la portes en ton sein et que l’auteur c’est moi

Félix Leclerc,"C’était un petit bonheur
Que j’avais ramassé
Il était tout en pleurs
Sur le bord d’un fossé
Quand il m’a vu passer
Il s’est mis à crier:
""Monsieur, ramassez-moi
Chez vous amenez-moi"".
Mes frères m’ont oublié, je suis tombé, je suis malade
Si vous n’me cueillez point, je vais mourir, quelle ballade !
Je me ferai petit, tendre et soumis, je vous le jure
Monsieur, je vous en prie, délivrez-moi de ma torture"".

2.
J’ai pris le p’tit bonheur
L’ai mis sous mes haillons
J’ai dit: "" Faut pas qu’il meure,
Viens-t’en dans ma maison"".
Alors le p’tit bonheur
A fait sa guérison
Sur le bord de mon coeur
Y avait une chanson.
Mes jours, mes nuits, mes peines, mes deuils, mon mal, tout fut oublié;
Ma vie de désoeuvré, j’avais dégoût d’la r’commencer,
Quand il pleuvait dehors ou qu’mes amis m’faisaient des peines,
J’prenais mon p’tit bonheur et j’lui disais: ""C’est toi ma reine"".

3.Mon bonheur a fleuri,
Il a fait des bourgeons.
C’était le paradis,
Ça s’voyait sur mon front.
Or un matin joli
Que j’sifflais ce refrain,
Mon bonheur est parti
Sans me donner la main.
J’eus beau le supplier, le cajoler, lui faire des scènes,
Lui montrer le grand trou qu’il me faisait au fond du coeur,
Il s’en allait toujours, la tête haute, sans joie, sans haine,
Comme s’il ne pouvait plus voir le soleil dans ma demeure.

4.
J’ai bien pensé mourir
De chagrin et d’ennui,
J’avais cessé de rire
C’était toujours la nuit.
Il me restait l’oubli,
Il me restait l’mépris,
Enfin que j’me suis dit:
""Il me reste la vie"".
J’ai repris mon bâton, mes deuils, mes peines et mes guenilles,
Et je bats la semelle dans des pays de malheureux.
Aujourd’hui quand je vois une fontaine ou une fille,
Je fais un grand détour ou bien je me ferme les yeux...(Bis).",Le Petit Bonheur

Qui n'doit rien à personne
Qui sait tout éviter qui jamais ne reçoit plus que donner ses yeux plus que donner l'espoir

Il m'a donné son parapluie

Me piégeant, me blessant
Me tuant

Mais là-haut, au-dessus d'eux
J'étais là-haut, dans une étoile rouge
Leur faisant des grimaces
Et l'étoile était rouge
Parce que c'était du sang, le mien
Et le tien est venu
Tous ces cheminements
Pour arriver à toi
Pour arriver souffrant
Où étais-tu, mon âme
Pendant cet heureux temps de misère
Et de vent?

Maintenant, je m'assois
Et je vis avec toi
Qui as daigné mêler ton âge
Avec le mien
En sortira un lien
Qui me vengera bien
En se tenant très près des hommes
Faux ou vrais
Ce que je n'ai pas fait

En se tenant très près surtout de sa mère
Ce que j'aurais dû faire depuis que tu m'attends
Maintenant je suis là
Si demain je m'en vas, retiens-moi
Rejoins-moi, si je meurs
Nous irons vivre ailleurs",Mes Longs Voyages
Felix Mendelssohn,"There's a sunny little funny little melody
That was started by a native down in Waikiki
He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it
And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit
Funny little gay Hawaiian Chant
Ow way tah tualan Me big bad fightin' man
Tho it started on an island down Hawaii way
It's as popular in Tennessee or Ioway
If you wander into any cabaret
You will hear this gay Hawaiian Chant",Hawaiian War Chant
Felix Mendelssohn,"I want to go back to my little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii

It won't be long 'til my ship will be sailing back to Kona
A grand old place that's always fair to see

At the moon in it's flight

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Will it fade way out of sight

To wake up all the neighborhood
To bring to every boy and girlie 
His happy serenade on wood

He's as happy as a bumblebee
All day long
To serenade your lady
Just find a tree that's shady
And when you hear that

Tick-a tick tick sing right along
Come on and try his rhythm
And let your hearts beat with 'im

Felix Swing Band,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day

Fell Desire,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Cause I needed you so desperately.
We were too blind to see, but then,
Most of all, I do love you",Still

Love comes, it goes, and it’s high, and it’s low, it’s too fast, too slow. It’s any way the wind blows
I’d of given you the sun the moon the stars, to be right where you are, but God knows you can’t change

Only God knows why, I always come up dry

You gotta learn, to love yourself again - I’m trying to learn, to chase my dreams again
 
There’s a thousand things that I knew you would’ve seen, and one million more if you left them out of me
And I kept praying that you would change your mind, cross that line and set me free, but time ain't really that kind
cause I’d of spent my whole damn life, and every night, chasing all those dreams I would never find, I’d of wasted all my time
Now I see that sunset, and I look for rest, there’s nothing left, the only way out is through, she said.

they hit me twice at first glance and then a second time

He kicked me out

He doesn't own me

Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'
Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'

The black rinse align your face
Like a deer drinking water in a picture frame
I swear to God I've seen those eyes
The back of my lids when closing mine
With clasped hands we shake it out, shake it out
Lace the boots and we walk away
I felt slightly connected to him and said
Now boy, now you own me

Arrows land, we’re fallin'

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
He doesn't sleep
So in truth he never wakes up
Another day rushing to his death
Out of breath on the treadmill of the famous
He makes mistakes tells stories to his paintbrush
And when the world finally sees his art
He wishes that he never would have made it
Just escape, just escape
Ricochets and eclipses faith
Living in a city with a grey umbrella over your shoulders
And you're becoming suffocated by the weight, can't hit those breaks
This is what you wanted, huh
But you got it all in vein
'Cause you forgot who you are
Right as the world learned your name it goes

Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'
Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'

Let me ash my issues
Ashtray is this asphalt
American spirits, black coffee, conversations and a passport
When God gives you everything
Everything that you ever asked for
And it still looks a bit different
Then when you pictured it on that back porch, and I'm gone
World traveler all I got is my songs
When the nights start blending into one another and I don't recall
Tom Petty in this motherfucker, all I wanna do is free fall
Yeah free fall
And I'm so caught up, I'm caught up
I'm caught up and I'm so tired
Swore that I wouldn't stare into the light and guess who tried it
Shit I'm blinded by this lime light
This lime light, it's all night, it's all day
These bright lights, these bright lights
Once you turn 'em on, you can't walk away
Don't die here, don't die here
I came too far, I'm too great
But I'm too scared and I'm too afraid
To stare this world into its face
I'm almost home, I'm driving lost
My eyelids closed, light turns to grey
The cameras off, the show is over
You close the curtains and just escape

Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'
Arrows land, we’re fallin'

Feel the breeze against your face
Touch my hand, a warm embrace

We can make this last forever

Leaving all our friends behind
Kidnap each of those minds

I can make you cry
We would find that it's in the sky

At the end of the night maybe you’ll find love

If the people get lost, underneath the moonlight
Hectic topic, paparazzi, hold it while I take this pic
Speak easy, rocking the fellas I’m breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, cause believe me, I’m a beat mean

It don’t mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I ain’t in your eyes

Fergie,"Baby, baby, when you're looking deep in my eyes
I know you're seeing past my make-up
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry
When her parents fought
Tryin' to be strong
You can see the hurt in me
The cover-ups so secretly
And all that I aspire to be
You see, you see
You know who I really am
No entourage or caravan
And do you even give a damn
About all that, tell me?

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

So, I don't mean to scare you now or push you away
Cause I'm not tryin' to rush anything
But when I look into your eyes
I'm not scared as you say I see little you
I'm in the picture too
Like a happy family tree
We're together constantly
This could be eventually
We'll see, we'll see
But all that I have got to know
Is with me, baby, will you grow?
Sun and rain and heavy snow
Oh, tell me so now, baby

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

It's as simple as one and two
I'm in love with you
And three and four
You're all I adore
To the seven and eight
See, I've been making mistakes
Cause when you're on my mind
I just can't think straight
Back to the five and six
I'm all in you mix, and I'm all into you
Without the lipstick
Without the L'Oreal
You remain the same angel that I fell for you
For real, for real

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking
I must go alone
I must take the baby steps till I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life

And big girls don't cry

We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend, and you'll be mine
Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers, and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside

Ever since I was a baby girl, I had a dream
Cinderella theme
Crazy as it seems
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day
But I would have to wait
Make so many mistakes
I couldn't comprehend
As I watched it unfold
This classic story told, I left it in the cold
Walking through un-open doors that led me back to you
Each one unlocking more of the truth
I finally stopped tripping on my youth
I finally got lost inside of you
I finally know I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

Mmm

I remember the beginning you already knew
I acted like a fool
Just trying to be cool
Frontin' like it didn't matter
I just ran away
Put on another face
Was lost in my own space
Found what it's like to hurt selfishly
I was scared to give up me
Afraid to just believe
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place
Stumbled through the mess that I had made
Finally got out of my own way
I finally started living for today
I finally know I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

Mmm

Finally, finally

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences

Up in the sky

Livin' my life
In the fast lane

For the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy

The glamorous,
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
For the glamorous, oh the flossy flossy

Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines
Shopping for expensive things

I be on the movie screens
Magazines and boogie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm n queen, I'm no machine

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as Hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell

After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm in

We flying the first class
Up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life
In the fast lane
And I won't change

I'm talking Champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue to do with us

I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Brother gotta keep enough lettuce
To support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous

Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Takin' trips from here to Rome
So If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home

I got problems up to here
I've got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy things
That I don't want to know (fuck y'all)

I've got money in the bank
And I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank
Thank you really though

'Cause I remember yesterday
When I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that be really dope
Damn, It's been a long road

And the industry is cold

I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm n queen, I'm no machine

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as Hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell

After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm in

You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue to do with us

I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Brother gotta keep enough lettuce
To support your shoe fetish

All the fans, I'd like to thank
Thank you really though

When I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that be really dope

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself instead of calamity

That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

Its time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

I must go alone
I must take the baby steps until I'm full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

'Cause I want to hold yours too
Well be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds

Its getting late, dark outside

Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down, da da da da da da

Record sales are on the mark
Cause that's about the time the rumors start
Where all the people talking out their ass
Well, someone gotta school ya cause ya got no class
Well I've paid my dues
I'm a seasoned dame
So why you gotta throw salt in my game
You hide behind the computer screens so that you don't have to be seen
How could a person be so mean

Who are you-and what do you do
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes
The pedestal
You put yourself on
Well since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone-gone-gone-gone-gone

Probably one of them tag a longs down 4 the free t-shirt
Cause you're a hanger on
You think you got me figured out
Never met me have no clue what I'm about
Maybe I got things you wish you had
You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad
I work around the clock, so fill your mouth up with a sock
And get you head up off your jock
Tell me who you are and what your background is
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this

Who are you-and what do you do
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes

Tell me who you are and what your background is
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this
You think I don't see you on the Internet, I read it, don't think I won't forget

Every day when I wake up
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup
But it seems like I never finish
It's always half full, or is it half empty?
Maybe it's my own superstition or a kind of self protection
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead?
Oh, oh, oh, still sittin' here
Just watching the sun go down, (down), down, (down), down

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?
(Ha yeah, who really cares?)

Every conversation gets me high on motivation
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation *yeah)
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable
In the midst of all the madness, remember life's beautiful
Still I'm feeling restless, thinking I should rest less
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times)
In my heart I know, less is more (more)
More (more) more, more, more

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?

It's time to take this out of my hands
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end?
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone
Never stray too far from home ( yeah, yeah, yeah)
But then again this way I'll never know, never know
Maybe I should go

Go crazy, go insane, go for everything
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?
Really, really, really really though?
Really, really, really though?
Feel the vibration of the higher ground
Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations, people makin' speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi
You call yourself a rider
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti
Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?

He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street

but you can't tell the women from the men sometimes
They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get em home ain't no tellin what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet""

Somethin's on my mind and I just can't shake it

I gotta get away from the human race
