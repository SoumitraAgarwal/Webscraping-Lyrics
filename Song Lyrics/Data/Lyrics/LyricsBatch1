But I had to follow through,
She had no idea what I wanted to do
It was a bad idea
But I had to hit it anyway

Candy caught my eye when she walked by lookin' like a freak
I leaned over kissed her on the cheek.
I was being careful not to move too fast,
But she smiled when I gave her a backstage pass.
A real star fucker, she put me to the test,
Then I noticed Doug Ray tattooed on her breast.
I thought I was blessed to meet this treat
Candy had a place right down the street.
It didn't take long to achieve my goal
And I lost control of mind, body, and soul.

It was a bad idea
But I had to follow through,
She had no idea what I wanted to do
It was a bad idea
But I had to hit it anyway

Let me tell you how I got my pumas stolen.
It was a summer day and the sky was golden.
I was having a slice down on University
And in comes a cutie, about 5 foot 3
Caught her checkin' me out so I flashed a smile.
Introduced myself 'cause that's my style.
She said, ""Yeah I know you, I love your CD.
I know all your rhymes, you're my favorite MC.""
Quick to the point no time at all
Snuck on in to her residence hall.
In ten minutes flat we were both butt naked.
She was screaming and yelling yo I just couldn't take it.
Her roomate got pissed while we fucked in her bed,
Bitch stole my pumas while I was getting head.

I can't believe I'm never gonna see you again,
You were more than a lover, you were also a friend.
The things I learned, in just one night,
When I say goodbye, it'll be alright, alright, alright!
Now people let me tell you 'bout this girl Suzanne,
Met her at the bar and I was like god damn!
She didn't have a man, no drink in her hand,
Bought her a shot and took her back to the van.
She was tall, slim, and tan. A White Owl fan,
Asked if I would take part in some perverted plan?
She dropped her skirt, she had another head.
I lost my pride in that groupie's bed

It was a bad idea
But I had to follow through,
She had no idea what I wanted to do
It was a bad idea
But I had to hit it anyway","[Bad Idea, Cheeky Monkey, Five in the Morning, No1, Turn It Up, Number One, Ouch, Don't Be Punks, Down on the Floor, Getting Around, Jason's Addiction, Miles Away, Summer on the Underground, Warning, A, If It Ain't Broke, Fix It Anyway, Monkey Kong, Old Folks, Over It, 6 O'Clock on a Tube Stop, Champions of Endings [*], The Distance, Going Down, Hi-Fi Serious, Nothing, Nothing [CD-ROM Video][*], Pacific Ocean Blue, Shut Yer Face, Something's Going On, The Springs, Starbucks, Took It Away, W.D.Y.C.A.I., Everybody In, Getting Me Off, Better off with Him [Sampler Version], I Wonder [B Side], Wisdom, 2nd Coming, Afterburner, Better off with Him, Black Hole, Hey, Rush Song, Wake Up, Worst Thing That Can Happen, Human Condition, Sleeping, Take Your Time, A Minha Menina, No Trophy, Sunshine, Sweet Like a Champion, This Town, Chicken Payback, Go Karts, Horsemen, Hourglass, I Love You, No Atmosphere, One Glass of Water, The Start, These Are the Ghosts, This Is the Land, Wash in the Rain, End of the Street, The Bee's, Got to Let Go, The Bee's, Left Foot Stepdown, The Bee's, Listening Man, The Bee's, Stand, The Bee's, A Band of Bitches, Guerra Nuclear, Mambo en Trompeta Para Ti, No Money, No Fame, Noreste Caliente, Track 3.I4, Take My Hand, The Time, The Bluest Eyes in Texas, Elephant, Rock 'N' Roll Ghost, Silent Night, Walking the Cow, Bear on the Beach, Chinatown, The Crowning, Golden Teeth and Silver Medals, Here Are Many Wild Animals, I Signed the Line, It's Not Easy to Be Human, Love Has Left the Room, My America, Stronger Than Jesus, The Weed Had Got There First, Can't Buy Me Love, ...]"

As soon as you return my wasted time

Been there done that don't like re-runs
If I do I'll rent the video
And cancel your show
Does somebody need a big hug?

Spending your dough
Are you worrying or just sniveling?

And not one tear came out of me
Decided right then I was just born tough
And nothin' ever gonna ruffle my feathers

High school quarterback, football team
A revved up, fine-tuned, mean-machine
And when I got sacked I'd flash a grin
Saying ""What's the matter boys, can't you do any better?""
No pain, no gain; I couldn't get hurt
'Cause I didn't feel a thing
Then one day I saw your face
Now everything's changed

My heart's always hurtin'
My legs are barely workin'
Feels so good to kiss you on the couch
Sweet mama, your daughter's makin' my eyes water
And only one word comes out of my mouth
Ouch

Ache all over from your tender touch
You say my name, and I get goosebumps
Well, baby, this former man-of-steel is putty in your hands
And I love this feeling
Those eyes, that dress
Cryin' uncle; it's no contest
It's all your fault I fell in love
Now look what you've done

Makes you wish that you were me
'Cause we got no job for life
Build 'em up like Frank Lloyd Wright
No two days turn out the same
Only sleeping on the plane
Not exactly Monkey days

Only dogs can hear the notes
Be myself to pay the bills
From L.A. to Skillmans Hill
We've done time for stealing shows
There ain't nothing we don't know
Plug us in and watch us go!

C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump from the back to the front, go!

You're so cool on the inside
You hate being recognised
Going off on outside

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs!

Coming round for one more go
Way too loud for radio
Mosh pit full of casualties
OAP's get in for free
Time to even out the score
Thought we'd done enough before
Now we're kicking down your door

Come on, rock it up, to the back
Measure twice, cut it once
Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch!

So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on

Through those eyes, made me cry
And the summer is forever
It's the endless summer 

And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you
Remember what I told ya
The night in California
And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 

It's OK to leave your jacket on in the ocean
It's OK to sing the saddest song, Vibrations 

Thanks a lot, you can be
What you want, honestly
Magic days, golden nights

It's the endless summer

And it's not about your boyfriend

All I got is best intentions
I got fears, too much to mention

Were the different ways we went

And away from doubting
Tell me straight from the spirit
From the top of the mountain

Let love be the reason between me and you
As real as the morning, as fresh as the dew
If fates got a hold then it's up to you
It's a simple thing we've got to do

Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Do the best I can

Tell me something before I stumble
And show my weakness
Tell me right on the limewire
Fighting for progress

I can hear there's a sound that's coming through
There's a post in the ground so what we gonna do?
You can have all your dreams if you really believe
In something that's something true

Just a listening man
Trying to understand
Just a listening man
Do the best I can

Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Get carried through this land

Tell me something without any lies
That cover my feelings
Give me time now I understand
These lessons have meaning

Let love be the reason between me and you
As real as the morning, as fresh as the dew
If fates got a hold then it's up to you

Ha ha ha si ya te vi jadeando

Cuarenta y cinco grados y un chingo de cervezas
Y un montón de sombrerudos tirando fiesta
Hechos madre en la troca, peor que el viejo oeste
Pero así es como nos gusta en el noreste caliente

Bailando el cumbión y cotorreando el acordeón
Para que nunca termine esta canción, bueno pues, saca el carbón
Ya no te hagas wey y saca las frías
Me dijeron en la esquina que tu las traías
Escurriendo en hielo, escurriendo energia
Y que tú solito con ellas no podías

Se armó el reventón, toda la raza en el trocón
Echando cotorreo por constitución
El termómetro sube, a que pinche calorón
Y este pinche puñetas que no trajo el cartón
No
Te hubieras traído el cartón cabrón
No mames
Culooo
Baboso
Mira pa'l sur
Mira pa'l oeste 
Pero esto es el noreste

Cuarenta y cinco grados y un chingo de cervezas
Y un montón de sombrerudos tirando fiesta
Hechos madre en la troca, peor que el viejo oeste
Pero así es como nos gusta en el noreste caliente

Y este es el corrido del pinche calorón,
Ni con todas las cervezas te quitas el sudor
No hay pedo wüero pos si ahorita lo arreglamos con clamato y con limón
No le pegues al llorón cabrón
Sobres camarada pos jalate pa'l depo
Vámonos por cheve fria y pasamos por los hielos
Pasamos por el disco de Ramón y su acordeón
Y después a mi cantón pa' sacar un billetón

In a place
Where the far reaches of this mind
I have seen a true nightmare
With the kiss of lovers lips
What a friendly offer
Just a memory
It still hurts
When I think that once
She was mine

Because I'm lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you

I guess its only right
To give someone what they need
Even if its nothing they ever
Wanted in the first place
I've seen with my own two eyes
The hurt and pain
That love causes
That's why I won't let you
Go down that road
Too emotional overdose

If I had her again
Everything would be alright
But nothings alright
And nothings ok
When you live in a memory

Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you

Just a breakdown of the heart
I'm lost for words that won't mean a thing
A tragic ending
A farewell to
A friendship that meant
Nothing at all
You let her in
You let her win
Is there anything else
To break or mend a bond as strong as ours
That wallow all through love
All through life

A piece of who I am today

And if it's a fight they want, we'll bring the hell they're looking for
With bullets blazing, the cowards hit the floor
Stand up and fight like men, let God decide who's goin'

Now sit back and watch the story unfold
Of the fair Juliet and her Romeo
Two young lovers with one heartbeat
In their devoted grave is where they'll sleep

They are the passion in a city of hate
Watching two families quarrel, ruining lover's fate
You are the ones who took your children's lives
See your two martyr's dying in love's true light, light

Sing me to sleep tonight, sweet Juliet
Two star-crossed lovers married, looking for regrets
By daybreak I'll be gone and searching for your kiss
Leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips

In every war there will be casualties
Even family members and best friends bleed
Another tally on the body count
So how many more until we're all bled out?

Let's not forget about this tale of love
Replay the story as it's told to us
Life is precious but worth giving away
For ideals of beauty and better days, days

Sing me to sleep tonight, sweet Juliet
Two star-crossed lovers married, looking for regrets
By daybreak I'll be gone and searching for your kiss
Leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips

I'm killing cousins, revenge I seek
In fair Verona I will lay him down, down to sleep
In desperation, poison becomes
This story's ending in a tomb of lover's trust, trust

Sing me to sleep tonight, sweet Juliet
Two star-crossed lovers married, looking for regrets
By daybreak I'll be gone and searching for your kiss
Leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips

Wonderin' through the nights

In hotels we are only voices
Kept safe and sound in phone lines
The distance makes the stronger weaken
So many days we'll never know

Well, don't give away
What we've tried so hard to keep

All things are said
I will be enough for you
Afraid or not
I will be enough for you

When I am gone
I will be enough for you
All things are said
I will be enough

The road we take will be the long one
So hold on tight, don't leave me
Take my hand, I'll bring you safely
To home, your home

Across the country this I promise
I'll be back to take you on a
Trip to sunny, sandy beaches
But first we've gotta meet halfway

Don't throw away love
We've worked so hard to make

Of hearts and flowers

Believin' that the things that I love

That we could all be makin' a change
Fly together like one in the same
Ride together like a charm and chain
But that won't happen 'cause we're d-d-deranged
So addicted to watchin' you laid

Like we best of friends

Leave all the lights on

I wish I could get back to the way things were
When we were young, having fun, so self assured
But now that's all a blur
I miss the way we always used to talk
Now we talk ourselves in circle till we forget why we fought

And maybe I'll find my way back home.
Leave all the lights on,

Leave all the lights on,

Leave all the lights on
If you still care I need to know
Leave all the lights on

Why can't we work it out? can't we work it out?
This makes me so down down down
I've been trying to see, if you were meant for me.
You get me so down down down, I'm gonna turn this car around
Just know that it's the last time,
Ya it's the last time

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home

I'm afraid of the ending, but I'm reckless
I've torn apart my inner binding now
That's what it takes to turn myself around
To be become a new project

And that's more than I need right now
And my thoughts convey deception
And my wall I'm building
The want, the pain, the urge, the concept will last forever
It won't be destroy

Were exposed here and I will never grow (I will never grow)
All I've learned erased the will to know
Where I belong

This blood, my life, disarray inside
To hell for the way I live
To shred on the guilt I feel
I'm afraid my open heart is ripe

My hopes are bleak and numb
And my wall I'm building

두 번째는 대중들의 작은 집중 뿐
세 네 번째 부터
이 썩은 scene의 귀중품
새빨간 19금 딱지가 붙었지만
still 진실만을 썼다
음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal
득과 실 벌써 decade
Still mic를 check 해
Like JK형 밝은 미래 in my arms
실낱 꿈 풍파와 입맞춤
가사를 쓸 때마다
혼자가 아니야 in my room
내게 숨 같던
친구들의 반이 하늘나라
내가 대신 꾸는 꿈 속에서
편히 잠을 자라
맺힌 내 땀을 봐라
I\'m a damn 괴물
Made an independent label
cause I won\'t ever settle
at your level
Like Bob Dylan
I\'m Not There\' in this 폐허
레어 성서
in your eyePod 플레이어
Till I see God up there
높이 솟아올라
세상은 유대자본이 지속한
몰락 속에 피로 차올라
But 징조가 좋다
To the free mountaintop

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다
내가 해냈으면 너도
충분히 할 수 있으니 believe
내가 해냈으면 너도
충분히 할 수 있으니 believe
If I can you can
If I can you can
If I can you can
Never once did I stutter
한 계단씩 걸어
from the gutter to the top
Never 떨어
\'cause we hot like summer
서러웠던 날의 어깨의 먼지 털어
정승처럼 쓰면서 미친 개처럼 벌어
Like I\'m Lil Wayne
made a few milli still
I\'m insane in the brain
like I\'m Cypress Hill
Cypher\'s killed when I rap
얼굴 찌푸리면서
Like a drummer in the back
너넨 뒷북이나 쳐
마음이 뒤틀린
낙서 가득 기운이 앞서
누구나 깎아내는
조각가들 신물이 났어
차라리 신문이나 펴
요즘의 경제면처럼 마땅한
대안 없는 음악 믿음이 안 서
착실한 기반 닦은 확실한 상품
어설픈 화가들의 막 칠한 작품
둘 중 하나를 분명히 해
이력서를 써
결과야 뭐 어떻던 미련은 못써
If I can you can
If I can you can
If I can you can
오늘도 천천히 걸어
걸어 정상으로 가
if I can you can
if I can you can
if I can you can

I laid down wondering where it led
I laid down by the river’s edge

There were flowers in my hair
River flowers floating everywhere
And all the fishes came and kissed my feet
Dear old fishes, they said to me

They said oh, we could love you
But we are not yet what you want
Because oh, anyone could love you
You’ve got to find where you belong

All my needles, they were gone so fast
Not a needle left on a branch
I grew weaker
And the river strong
I said, hey fishes
But the fish were gone

Now the boulders
I know they heard me cry
But they were stone-faced
And they stood aside
So I went on at the river’s pace
With my eyes closed, I thought I heard them say

They said oh, we could love you
But we are not yet what you want
Because oh, we would only crush you
You’ve got to find where you belong

How does it feel
To be so certain
Without question
Of your purpose
Your position
Of your place
Of your home?
Of your place
Of your home

It trickles through your fingers

That's what you said to me
And I knew that it was true
Until you threw my heart in the sea

How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to feel
How do I act like we never met
When everything is telling me it was oh so real

If it's life on the defense
The stinging pain of being made to fool
All the cynics and the irony
Won't save you when you're drowning
In loves' sweet pool

How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to feel
How do I act like we never met
When everything is telling me it was oh so real
Baby, baby

It's only fair that you tell me
Just what it was you think I did wrong
If I was looking through the same lens
My prescription must of been all wrong

How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to fell
How do I act like we never kissed
When everything is saying it was oh so real

If we saw through the same lens
Then you'd see I want you here right now
Instead of waiting for the day
When memory has clouded
Everything we loved about it

How do I adjust my vision
How do I pretend not to feel
How do I act like we never met
When everything is telling me it was oh so real

How do you adjust your vision
How do you pretend not to care
How do I act like we never met
And that you didn't see
What we know was there baby

Heroes and villains
And old lovers walk by
They tip their hats but
They never answer why

Why does it always seem
To bring me back to this
Searching for home
In someone else's gentle kiss
Searching for home in places
Home just don't exist

I tightened up my tie
And I need to make her wait
No sleep from the night before
Her dad answers the front door
And already knows my name

I stand in fear
As she gets near
That everything's okay
I hope this feeling never goes away

I never thought I'd find a love like this
There's no need to hide that feeling we get
Whenever we touch we can't resist
We go back to our first date
Our first kiss

Her face lit by a movie screen
She's leaning into me
And time seems to slip away
Later on we take a walk and
Good thing she likes to talk
'Cause I can't think of what to say

She looks at me
And she can see
The chance I wanna take
She moves in close
And takes my breath away

I never thought I'd find a love like this
There's no need to hide that feeling we get
Whenever we touch we can't resist
We go back to our first date
Our first kiss

Every time feels like a first time

Looking back on what we had it never went away
She still makes me feel it every day

Jumped in the jeep drove out to Arizona where we met a couple friends of ours
It was something in the water,
‘Cause now it’s getting harder and nothing’s gonna stop us now
With the soul Cal drummer,
And Dana’s little brother now we’re making our parents proud.

There’s a town in California where we keep our friends around
Made our way to Arizona never turned a party down.
And out in Massachusetts is where we meet up to hit the road.
Just shows how small the world really is
And we call it all home.

Drove out to Burbank thought we should sure take advantage of the winter time
Made a record and a plan,
packed up the van and it died every hundred miles
We almost got caught but we fooled the cops with a vegan in snake skinned boots
Made it to Philly drank a beer with a really cool dad who liked to get loose

There’s a town in California where we keep our friends around
Made our way to Arizona never turned a party down.
And out in Massachusetts is where we meet up to hit the road.
Just shows how small the world really is
And we call it all home.
Yeah we call it all home.

Spent the day off with Johnny and Josh
Making work seem more like fun
In Arlington Heights,
We stayed the night getting woken up by the sun
Out on the road wherever we go we never feel too alone
Making vans and hotels feel like home

Until we’re back in California where we keep our friends around
Make our way to Arizona never turned the party down.
And out in Massachusetts when we meet up to hit the road.
Just shows how small the world really is
And we call it all home. 
Yeah we call it all home.
And we call it all home.","[Bad Idea, Cheeky Monkey, Five in the Morning, No1, Turn It Up, Number One, Ouch, Don't Be Punks, Down on the Floor, Getting Around, Jason's Addiction, Miles Away, Summer on the Underground, Warning, A, If It Ain't Broke, Fix It Anyway, Monkey Kong, Old Folks, Over It, 6 O'Clock on a Tube Stop, Champions of Endings [*], The Distance, Going Down, Hi-Fi Serious, Nothing, Nothing [CD-ROM Video][*], Pacific Ocean Blue, Shut Yer Face, Something's Going On, The Springs, Starbucks, Took It Away, W.D.Y.C.A.I., Everybody In, Getting Me Off, Better off with Him [Sampler Version], I Wonder [B Side], Wisdom, 2nd Coming, Afterburner, Better off with Him, Black Hole, Hey, Rush Song, Wake Up, Worst Thing That Can Happen, Human Condition, Sleeping, Take Your Time, A Minha Menina, No Trophy, Sunshine, Sweet Like a Champion, This Town, Chicken Payback, Go Karts, Horsemen, Hourglass, I Love You, No Atmosphere, One Glass of Water, The Start, These Are the Ghosts, This Is the Land, Wash in the Rain, End of the Street, The Bee's, Got to Let Go, The Bee's, Left Foot Stepdown, The Bee's, Listening Man, The Bee's, Stand, The Bee's, A Band of Bitches, Guerra Nuclear, Mambo en Trompeta Para Ti, No Money, No Fame, Noreste Caliente, Track 3.I4, Take My Hand, The Time, The Bluest Eyes in Texas, Elephant, Rock 'N' Roll Ghost, Silent Night, Walking the Cow, Bear on the Beach, Chinatown, The Crowning, Golden Teeth and Silver Medals, Here Are Many Wild Animals, I Signed the Line, It's Not Easy to Be Human, Love Has Left the Room, My America, Stronger Than Jesus, The Weed Had Got There First, Can't Buy Me Love, ...]"

I am your heart attack
Hey beautiful deadly, I have seen you before
This crime is undone
Shh, be still and I'll keep you always
Trust me, you will not feel a thing
Defuse the thrill to kill
Refuse what you will
You fell in love with the chase
Let me give it to you straight
I'm onto you
Survive the way that you're made to
The conscience killer always gets away
The stage is set for the collapse
Let's face the truth and stop pretending
You kill to prove, you are one of us
But truth be told you are better than all of us

Tied-up, barely conscious
Awaiting to see what's going down
Instead of fighting you said you're on your own
It's better that I go
I may be blinded
The change is proof we've grown
It follows me where I go
Instead I'm looking back to where we met
I found the chance to live again
Instead you'd rather see where we end
The conscience killer always gets away
Defuse the thrill to kill
Refuse what you will
You fell in love with the chase
Let me give it to you straight

Survive the way that you're made to

She weakens behind his eyes
She urns for him inside her
Collapsing by the bedside

You want more
You got more
Can't be too safe girl
Its alright
Just undress
Her lips and
His caress

Will unveiling the curves of our bodies
(We get along, along so well)
A parasitic feeding
Off of the blood of someone else

Two bodies lie shackled
By the clenching of their fists
One body lie injected
Behind the others head
With the sun pressing on
She weakens behind his eyes
She urns for him inside her
Collapsing by the bedside

You're up boy
Don't slow down
With constant temptations
Who said love
Its alright
Will become by the end of the night

Will unveiling the curves of our bodies
(We get along, along so well)
A parasitic feeding
Of off the blood of someone else
Were sharpening the spectrum
Of these feelings
(We get along, along so well)
A puss eating believing we would
Ever share with someone else

I feel you breathing
Behind my neck

Can I still feel you breathing
Behind my neck

Will unveiling the curves of our bodies
(We get along, along so well)
A parasitic feeding
Of off the blood of someone else
Were sharpening the spectrum
Of these feelings

Ever share with someone else

Fell asleep between her legs
Medicate before tomorrow

Now all I need
Is you to come with me

'Cause there's a million miles of road
Take us anywhere we wanna go
With the wind in your hair
And the sunset burnin' gold
And from the mountains to the sea
Great Plains to New Orleans
Where the Mississippi River flows
Don't it feel like Heaven is close

We don't need all the fancy things
Like the brand new cars or the diamond rings
Just roll the windows down
And baby sing with me

I pick up this old guitar
And teach you how to play underneath the stars
Your favorite song
Is ""Me and Bobby McGee""

'Cause there's a million miles of road
Take us anywhere we wanna go
With the wind in your hair
And the sunset burnin' gold
And from the mountains to the sea
Great Plains to New Orleans
Where the Mississippi River flows
Don't it feel like Heaven is close
Lord, don't it feel like Heaven is close
Guitar, ya'll

Time is just a memory
And baby there's just one thing that I need
That I need

'Cause there's a million miles of road
Take us anywhere we wanna go
With the wind in your hair
And the sunset burnin' gold
And from the mountains to the sea
Great Plains to New Orleans
From the Mississippi River flows

'Cause there's a million miles of road
Take us anywhere we wanna go
With the wind in your hair
And the sunset burnin' gold
And from the mountains to the sea
Great Plains to New Orleans
Where the Mississippi River flows
Don't it feel like Heaven is close
Lord, don't it feel like Heaven is close
I said, don't it feel like Heaven is close","[Bad Idea, Cheeky Monkey, Five in the Morning, No1, Turn It Up, Number One, Ouch, Don't Be Punks, Down on the Floor, Getting Around, Jason's Addiction, Miles Away, Summer on the Underground, Warning, A, If It Ain't Broke, Fix It Anyway, Monkey Kong, Old Folks, Over It, 6 O'Clock on a Tube Stop, Champions of Endings [*], The Distance, Going Down, Hi-Fi Serious, Nothing, Nothing [CD-ROM Video][*], Pacific Ocean Blue, Shut Yer Face, Something's Going On, The Springs, Starbucks, Took It Away, W.D.Y.C.A.I., Everybody In, Getting Me Off, Better off with Him [Sampler Version], I Wonder [B Side], Wisdom, 2nd Coming, Afterburner, Better off with Him, Black Hole, Hey, Rush Song, Wake Up, Worst Thing That Can Happen, Human Condition, Sleeping, Take Your Time, A Minha Menina, No Trophy, Sunshine, Sweet Like a Champion, This Town, Chicken Payback, Go Karts, Horsemen, Hourglass, I Love You, No Atmosphere, One Glass of Water, The Start, These Are the Ghosts, This Is the Land, Wash in the Rain, End of the Street, The Bee's, Got to Let Go, The Bee's, Left Foot Stepdown, The Bee's, Listening Man, The Bee's, Stand, The Bee's, A Band of Bitches, Guerra Nuclear, Mambo en Trompeta Para Ti, No Money, No Fame, Noreste Caliente, Track 3.I4, Take My Hand, The Time, The Bluest Eyes in Texas, Elephant, Rock 'N' Roll Ghost, Silent Night, Walking the Cow, Bear on the Beach, Chinatown, The Crowning, Golden Teeth and Silver Medals, Here Are Many Wild Animals, I Signed the Line, It's Not Easy to Be Human, Love Has Left the Room, My America, Stronger Than Jesus, The Weed Had Got There First, Can't Buy Me Love, ...]"

Downtown late of three of course
Just came from fishing couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whitened sandwich and again it stopped
But with the bail though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loots of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and hear comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhyth's move in
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelick makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no lunch because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about this times
The worlds famons and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
Cause there's only a few hours left

After Hours it was cool

The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tic-tocs
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last nights game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'

Beats in her public, beats her in private (yes)

Took my cousin to the park so we can play (yeah, park)
On the way, a couple resembled
The one I just described, everything assembled
Another young man walked in their direction (yeah)
Bumped him a bit, excused his imperfection
But the man with the lady grabbed the other by the neck
Demanded an apology and also respect (uh-huh uh-huh)
The young man aggravated grabbed him back and smacked him
The girl just laughed and laughed and laughed at him (oh man!)
He felt ashamed for what he had done
It looked like a fool to everyone (OH!)

Reality, is sometimes a ditty (yeah uh huh)
Like Grodzilla from The Twilight Zone
Earth to your brain, is anyone home? (What you talking bout?)

Some veggie links and some fish that stinks

Smelled like she conjured up a mouse
Eggs was frying, ham was smelling
In ten minutes, she started yelling (come and get it)
And the gettin's were good
I said, I shouldn't eat, she said, I think you should
But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians
No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian
Strictly collard greens and a occasional steak
Goes on my plate

I like lemons and limes
And if not that, take it the road see and the salad sopped

Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes
A sight for sore ones and some bore pies
And other goodies that are filled with goop
With fried apple roots
Delectable delights, control my appetites
Mines is for me, right, but I know what I like
Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner
Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin' winner

Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?
They'll put you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails
(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck luck will drive you butt baddy
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
It's the creme de la creme, and you can bounce with that
It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life

Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition
Sure, the sugar-babies want to give you a chance
With the French ""savoir faire"" and the sexy dance
But is she really fly, or is she a guy?
I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him like
A case of positioning the feet in the shoes
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown
I had to make the sound, his life is too profound
On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup
Young and naive, it's hard to believe
As long as you're strong, you can quest with the questers

With my man, Q-Tip

In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
She went lower than low, into limbo
A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo
She answered no, so she had to go...on with the program
Credence, it seems that I've forgotten your name
But it seems that she's done the same
And now something has happened
Suddenly, she's been distracted
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Now, I think you understand
Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
Right then and there, she fainted
A really grim picture is painted
The brother who she acquainted
Was the enemy, scary ain't it?
The Pubic Enemy

Yeah!
Let me tell you more about pubic enemy
Hey, Q-Tip

Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Had a lady queen, married since 18
He protested, that he was infested
Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it
All propaganda, one big fat lie
'cause I see the king with my very own eye
Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king
And popping up on the teammates scene
And popping and pimping on hunnies with moneys
Whole situation to me, was kinda funny
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
Caught the king scratching, so she had to assume
That he got vicked by the enemy's trick
The thought of cheating made the maiden so sick
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screaming
Threw a pot and his dome was beaming
You could hear him yelling in the motherland
""Baby, baby please. Baby, understand.""
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate, of the enemy
The Pubic Enemy

Propmaster (yeah) Please listen to me (what?)
Something lurking by the Jim Browski
(Who? Jenny?)
No, not propulated
A horrible creature that must be penetrated
He gets all into ya, then he tries to do ya
You better run fast, he's gonna pursue the,
(What? Yo listen here, propmaster whiz, no one fears}
Oh, the caves know, just thought I'd let ya know
How he lives and how he go
Watch yourself when you're out on the run
The enemy is missed, we'll have too much fun
There's four friends of mine that thought they were bad
And laid up this girl, so now, they're sad
They scratched and scratched like it was Saturday and

Listen here, This is Cool DJ Red Alert
Known as the true, the only, the very one, the Propmaster
There's only one thing I gotta tell ya
There's a whole lotta propmasters out there, you know what I mean
Shaheed a propmaster, Q-Tip a propmaster
The Jungle Brothers a propmaster, BDP a propmaster
45 King a propmaster
I won't tell you nothing bout the ladies, they ain't no propmaster
But you know who's the main propmaster

For me to be your idol, but dig this recital
If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissing
Slinging this and that, cause this and that was missing
Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected
Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected
Afrocentric living, Africans be givin'
A lot to the cause cause the cause has been risen
Some brothers, they be flamming, thinking we ain't slammin'
Coming off like the days where we used to wear the tans and
A blue-collar talker, a hemisphere stalker
A glass of OJ and a ten mile walk-a
If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearing
Can I get a beep and a side order of cheering?
I am what I am, that's a tribal man
We all know the colors, we all must stand
As we start our travels, things they will unravel
""Que sera sera"", for this unit is like gravel
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is

Push it along, push it along, yeah

Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher
The ills of the world make the situation lighter
The clock is always ticking, the systems should be kickin'
Like Tip said in ""Ham and Eggs"", I eat chicken, chicken, chicken
Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever
Embellish on the funk as we start to endeavor?
The roots of the rap filling up the gap
With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap

The boom, the bip, the boom bip
Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles
Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble
It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty
So I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
This ain't trial and error, more like tribin' era
Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
The street can't depart from the bloody heart
Repair the wear and tear, don't stop 'fore it starts
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is

Push it along, push it along, yeah

Marching off the project, we hope that you will subject
It's good to be an object and never, ever reject
The tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda
Keep it in boom and never will we slander
Redeems should be handed, don't let me demand it
Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it
Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
Although she's flipping crazy, give my love to Gracy
God, could you help cause this Quest is crazy spacey?
The pigs are wearing blue, and in a year or two
We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe
What we gonna do, save me and my brothers?
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that
We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?
This society of fake reality
Are nothing but a peg of informality
While I sing my song, sing it all day long

The usual rhythm
Devoted to, the art of moving butts

Don't fear the rhythm because it's strong
On the corners, brothers bop their heads
From the high-tops to the knotty dreads

Took the crust away from the third eye lid
Now, it's kinda open, longs to see the site

Night after night, day after day
Questin' for the rhythms of the Native Tongue lay
Rhythm is the key as we open up the door
Things a b-boy has never seen before
Polyrhythmatic with a big fat boom
You have an eargasm as you start to consume
The ghetto beat with a ghetto poem

Got the instinct to travel miles and miles
Gotta whole lot of room for piles and piles

It's a ""stone groove baby""
Continue, on the windy road

Will we be on point for the ninety deck

But trudging, we are used to

The five foot assassin with the ruffneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family

No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You want to diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half

I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Messing round with this you catch  the sizing of em?
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper

Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed so won't you Seckle With the Mission
I never walk the streets, think it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be

I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

Zulu Nation, brothers that's creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape

The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse to get my
Point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt

Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work,
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smoking R&B cause they try to do me

Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug

On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged
Buggin' out, buggin' out,
Buggin' out you're buggin' out

Yo when you bug out, you usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding

You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
'Comafied' your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind

Oh yo he's acting stank, really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you want to but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks

Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying, mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged

Yo, I am not an invalid although I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on the real hardest so we can have the big fun

When I left for Rosie I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his baddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me

Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did

Supposed to be my man but now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongest and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, Cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys, they know who they are
I was the B-ball playing fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match, her name was Flo
Yeah - I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me, like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playin' with my mind
The only thing I learned is, good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D I need somebody for me
Not someone who's mind is blank and tryin' to juice me for my bank
Swingin' with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that, yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I met my match
Was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settlin' down with one girl, wasn't tryin' to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used ta love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em, also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again, how would I know
After all this time tryin' to be a superhoe
She finally played me, but yo, I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter

Butter, like butter baby
Butter, like butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strickly butter baby, strictly butter

I remember when
Girls were goodie two shoes, but now they turned to freaks
Allofasudden ""We love you Phife"" ease of ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you goin', where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so hon, don't want me now
Here, here, take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from lookin' fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dyin' your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sportin' a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really loved yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
If you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me ""Diane made it""
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Tryin' hard to look fly, but yo, you're lookin' dumber
If I wanted someone like you I woulda swung with Jamie Summers
You want to be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sens-a-tiv-I-ty
See I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers

We used to kick routines and presence was fittin'

And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter

That we used to make spiffy like mister clean?

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then push it along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk

One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum

Looking at Miss Lane, it was the fast lane
Barely knows her name, struck by fame
She just got a Benz, she rides with her friends
Gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
Rollin down the block, checking out the spots
She winks at the cops, always give her props
She knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her
Hangs out for the loot, makes her papes from the gutter
Tried to make my moves on Miss Lane, she called me young boy
Told her not to dis me I just want to be your love toy
You young boy, my love toy, I doubt that very highly
Just because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me
Business oriented, egos never dented
Always sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it
Distractions never hurt, always did the work
Always was alert, she never got jerked
Queen of the feats, thrive to compete
Love the funky beats while she drive down the street
She was justified, couldn't get a job
Had to feed her family, so she had to play, then rob
Pulling out the ooh wop, listening to doo-wop
You don't have to say a word
That's all ya heard

""Everything is fair when you're living in the city""

She's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner
Instead, I met her later, my love is much greater
Put me on her roster, to rid her of impostors
And to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler
Love is my motive, now I'm drug promotive
Plus I needed duckets to fill up my buckets
Supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
Now I'm missing action for this fatal attraction
But don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
And don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
'cause if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be
I'll be damned if I let a brother try to gas me
I played my cards well, try to live swell
For the G, I would sell, 'cause I was deep in hell
But then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin
Who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
Elaine, she kinda new, that I would do the do
But she didn't tear, I did my work with care
That's all that really mattered, he money never splattered
As long as she was paid, she was in the shade
You can't really blame her for holding on a flamer
Society taught her, but they didn't tame her
A ten clip salute, honey here's a troop

Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listening to hip hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of be-bop
I said, well daddy don't you know that things go in cycles
The way that Bobby Brown is just ampin' like Michael
Its all expected, things are for the looking
If you got the money, Quest is for the booking
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly modes
Still got room on the truck, load the back boom
Listen to the rhymes, to get a mental picture
Of this black man, black woman venture
Why do I say that, 'cause I gotta speak the truth man
Doing what we feel for the music is the proof and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bonafied strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
We deliver it each year on the street for the beat 'cause
You can find it on the rack in your record store(store)
If you get the record, then your thoughts are adored and appreciated
Cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishing out the plastic, do the dance till you spastic
If you dis, it gets drastic
Listen to the rhymes, 'cause its time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it baby
All the way to Africa a.k.a. The Motherland (uh)
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black Man (man)
Only if you was noted as my man (man)
If I get the credit, then I'll think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that (ass) (what?)
A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half (come on, come on)

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

You gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these Excursions so you must realize
Hip hop continually, about the Zulu
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what could you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a (bitch), brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be into this society
Everything is fair, at least that how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
It could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do to is know that the Tribe's in this sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

We gotta make moves

Classic example of a, a date rape

Listen to the rhyme, it's a black date fact
Percentile rate of date rape is fat
This is all true to the reason of the skeezing
You got the right picking but you're in the wrong season
If you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break
Especially if a squad tries to cry out rape
You be all vexed 'cause she got it going on
You don't want to fight 'cause you know that you're wrong
So instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch
Envision in your head of a great sex bout
Worthy opponent, all you want to do is bone it
You ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick
This is the case, the situation is sticky
Should you try to kiss or head for a hickey
Not even, you can ask Steven
If the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leaving
Hit the road Jack and all of that
But if she offers her abode, to drop ya load
Right smack dab in the middle
Get the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles

Uh huh, you know science, you get buckwild
Running mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles
Or better yet Magic or even Karl Malone
Regardless who it is, your aim is to bone
If she tries to front, then you start to dis her
If she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her
Might as well get to the point, no time to waste
Might as well break the ice, then set the pace
You start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone
Step out of the shower, throw on cologne
All of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho
She's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abendego
You listen to After 7, break fool after 10
Do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again
There goes round 1, ding, there goes round two
Now tell me what the (fuck) are you supposed to do
What do you know, when the meow is completed
Girly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it

Sweetheart, we ain't going out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't going out like that (zulu)
We ain't going out like that (zulu)
We ain't going out like that

Now baby bust it, if you want to groove
Me and you can do it, it will be the move
I won't cry over spilled milk
If you won't let me take you to the Hilt
I don't want to bone you that much
That I would go for the unforbidden touch
I'm not the type that would go for that
I'll have to fetch a brand new cat
Baby, baby, baby I don't want to be rude
I know because of your bloody attitude
I know why you act that way
It usually happens on the 28th day
I respect that crazily
When you're done with the past can you come check me
This ain't a joint to disrespect you
Because one head ain't better than two
Check it out

To the effect of nothing, effective fronting
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
I am a bon-a-fide
Not too modest and not a lot of pride

Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my momma is sick I'm by her beside
Used to watch the show on channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in-Tide cause it's too damn cold out-Tide
That's how the running's go
If there ain't no dough, then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter (ass)
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash

If you want to see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest you ask the Quest you ask real fast
Cause I don't want to see em, start buckin'
Throwin' chairs in the air while you be duckin'
What what? Don't step to me with that
If you promotin' the show make sure it ain't wack

Or else I'm leaving (let me tell you)
I'm leaving (let me tell you)
I'm leaving (let me tell you)
Your wack show

Yo man whats up with that?
Yo don't sweat me
C'mon, five hundred, that was the deal
C'mon man, don't try to play me out
We don't need you, sorry!
You know you need me

And the Abstract rapper says

I want chicken, and orange juice, dat what's on my rider?
And my occasional potato by Oreida
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Ain't takin' no shorts no more, now

Please act proper 'fore I call the Crime Stoppers
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no
Make sure you count your money real slow
Be alert, look alive, and act like ya know
It's, the 90's, time to make moves
Not, the 80's, do away with cha womb
So what? You got a crew
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zoo

But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg, is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye, to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah!)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go

Later (later!), later alligator

Then they rebuked then you had to smack

Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego

Powerful impact - boom! - from the cannon

Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
The ups and downs with the hoes (The Business)
Always gettin' fronted on at shows (The Business)
People gotta stick their nose (In the Business)

Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speakin' to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the games just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real

They're givin' you the business and puttin' on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say Where's my loot?
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're makin' fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cos you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, more soup wit' ya meal?
Cos this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say

Shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'bout these no-talent artists gettin' signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Goin' out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flyin'
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers makin' albums when they know they can't hack it
Cos they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cos your lyrics is butt

Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)

The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and ridin' high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
""Oh, he's a cutie"", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The born cipher, cipher master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game
And I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters' not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefin' (Boy, get a job)
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willin' and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
(For what?) That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbin'
When it comes to rhymin' you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile

Those who don't believe, see you're laid behind
Got our skypagers on all the time
Hurry up and get yours 'cause I got mine
Especially if you do shows, they come in fine
If you're with a G and you're sippin wine
Eating caccatore with a twist of lime
Gotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9
Joint by base, then you get your high

If you get your then high, mine is next
The 'S' in skypage really stands for sex
Beeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks
Keep my bases loaded like the New York Mets
At times I miss the pager so you don't get vex
Having bad days like a voodoo hex
Conceptually, a pager is so complex
'Cause I be standing by the phone ready to flex

Uh, so funky, uh, so funky, uh, so funky

The batteries I use are called Duracell
They last for three weeks so they do me well
Don't be going through no phases my joint stays on
24-7, from dusk til dawn
If you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach
You greed for the Phifer, I can be reached
A number of importance, I just put it on lock
You leave code '69"", that means you want some (cock)

People tend to think that a pager's foul
Well it kinda is, 'cause it makes me scoul
But it really hurts when you're on the prowl
Brothers know it hurts when you're on the prowl
Grabbing on my joint 'cause I'm an eager owl
Get paged by a G or a business pal

And my man came by the studio
And his name is
Busta Rhymes in effect, Shaheed is in effect
Phife Did-awg is in effect
Check it out and give me my 'spect

I'm moving, yes I'm grooving cause my mouth is on the motor
Use the Coast in the morning to avoid the funky odor
Can't help being funky, I'm the funky Abstract brother
Funky in a sense, but I play the undercover
Once had a fettish, fettish for some booty
Now I'm getting funky and my rapping, that's my duty
Brothers tend to jock on the style in particular
If you got the ego like some brothers, then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck)
My motto in the 90's is be happy making bucks
Girls love the Jim, 'cause it causes crazy friction
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I still understand the 'cause that's what I met her for
I'm hooked on the swings, so just call me the music whore
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
Quest the people's choice, we thrive it for the spirit
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensils
Write my rhymes straight up, don't get with no fancy stencils
The rhymes we get is sweet, we stay away from tart
Our perfection is at work, perking up the art
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock
Your demise is coming up and I want your man to watch
Be the prime example, I deep instilled the sample
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a claker
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker?
The crazy move faker, I used that to break her

Phife is in the house, Uncle Mike is in the house
Bob Power is in the house, Tim Latham is in the house
Wise Men is in the house, Brand Nubs is in the house
The J Beez, they in the house and De La, they in the house

I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
Please don't be deceived by ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action
The ladies of the '90's want more than satisfaction
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring
I keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
With the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
My people been up on Quest to long, no more will we be down
People tend to riff 'cause they don't know the mental
People tend to bug 'cause their beats are hard but gentle
Afro kinda lurks through the body of this youngun'
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and your coming to
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival
If flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival
The Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching
The Black and Puerto Ricans
'cause their butt naked, streakin' through the ever murky streets
Of the urbanized areas
Blastin' out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria

Craig is in the house, Pete Rock is in the house
CL is in the house, Ultra Mag is in the house
Nice and Smooth is in the house, Big Daddy Kane is in the house
Beatnuts is in the house, Special Ed is in the house

Yeah
This one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass
Now check it out
Born into the 91 decade

That we drop Scuds, there won't be no duds here
Rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip
But when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick
Now I'm not for the rock, I know the territory
Go ahead and try, that's a different story
Similar to Grimm, I could tell a better one
All about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run
Stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
Resorts to bagging Billy, asking could he have some
No never ever, go back and try again man
If you come back, I'll be the first to shake your hand
Competition's good, it brings out the vital parts
The Abstract Poetic, majors in recital arts
Do it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers
We know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers
Gotta feel the vibes, real from my creation
If the hands clap I'm filled with elation
Here I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam
Think I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream
Cause that's how good it feels child
Let your hair down, so we can get buckwild
Do your ill dance, don't think about the next man
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan
Division we will fall, we must stick together, see
I'd like to take this time to say what's up to Kool G
The name is Q-Tip, the Midnight Marauder
Giving nuff respects to Afrika Bambaataa
As a man in the world, I must do my job
Take care of Mama Duke, I won't resort to rob
Bob you'll get your dough, Mase is my witness
Obsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness
Like shooting Cee-lo, and always hitting head cracks
The industry is luck, winning with the fake raps
Peace to the crews who pump the real hip hop
Not selling out, from hardrock to disc jock

I don't know what to say, but here I go freak it
If the papes come, then you know I'll seek it
I'm just a short brother, dark skin face
Weigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist
Hair is crazy curly, flip like Mr. Furley
To this day I still believe that no MC can serve me
Brothers try to front, but everybody know
I get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show
Party animal I was, but now I chill at home
All I do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit and bone
Found my thrill in Amityville, I'm always in the Island
Fudge and Lucky know the time, they know who keeps 'em smiling
Go out on my own, something that I gotta do
Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double
Yo, I'm out like Buster Douglas, I say peace to MC Trouble
Rest in Peace

Word Up, rest in Peace, and you know what else?

All the people in Long Island, we got the vibes
Brooklyn and Queens, we got the vibes
Uptown and Now Rule, we got the vibes
People Upstate, we got the vibes
If you're in DC, you got the vibes
Maryland, Virginia, Carolina vibes

In the Bahamas, we got the vibes
Over in Europe, you know what, we got the vibes

Good with the girls, I get a whole lot of 'em
From fat to skinny, Freda to Winnie
Emma to Cindy, Constance to Wendy
Cause I be real friendly, never on the snotty side
I don't brag to brothers about the little papes I got
My vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary
It's only legendary, my father well prepared me
My job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot
Better yet the long term, I don't have a perm
In a way I do, call 'em the perma-naps

People give your ears so I be sublime 
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine 
Niggas, take off your coats ladies, act like gems 
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns 
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the mo-mo 
Ludicrous, we speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo 
Heard me in the eighties, J Beez on the promo 
On my never ending quest to get the paper on the caper 
But now, let me take it to the Queens side 
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side 
All the residential Questers to invade the way 
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there 
You can be a black man and lose all your soul 
You can be white and blue but don't crap the roll 
See my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and dolo 
Of delf for self, see there's no one else 
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that 
So, do that, do that, do do that that that(come on) 
Do that, do that, do do that that that(OK) 
Do that, do that, do do that that that 
I'm bugging out, so let me get back 'cause I'm wettin niggaz 
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothas 
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class 
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

Back in '89, I simply slid into place 
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face 
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste 
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case 
I have a quest to have the mic in my hand 
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman 
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts 
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt 
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy 
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy 
Top notch baby, never coming less 
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest 
Sit back , relax, get up out the path 
If not that, here's the dance floor, come move that ass 
Non-believers, you can the steps 
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract 
Niggas know the time when the Quest is in the jam 
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am 
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees 
Living mad phat like an over sized Bam-bi 
The wackest crews try to dis, it makes me laugh 
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft 
So, next time that you think you want something here 
Make something deffer, take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin it
But I'm goin to stay strong cause I ain't buyin it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

Problems, problems, problems, woe is me I'm having
Problems, problems, problems

Just last week my girl was stressin me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we look cute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you got put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your botty face!

Problems, problems, problems, Lord knows I'm havin
Problems, problems, problems, Jesus Christ I'm havin
Problems, problems, problems, pray for me I'm havin
Problems, problems, problems

Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside
Hah, and you'll be alright, knowhatI'msayin?
Love and peace from Phife for '93, knahmsayin?

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club you would not pay
Hey yo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puero Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that We Can Get Down
Now let's Knock the Boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm Above the Rim and this is how I ball
A pretty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking bout you

Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Staring at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger Than Pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the putang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madeline Woods
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, ""No,"" labeled me a hoe
I said, ""How you figure?""  ""My friends told me so.""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that

I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep
Keep it in the down, yo, we keep it discrete
See, I'm not the type to kid to have my biz in the streets

If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me sink the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seamen's Furniture

Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P
Stacy, DJ and my man L.G.
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is  of men, never ever of mice
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice

There's a million MCs that claim they want some
But see I create sounds that make your ears go numb
Peace to Sayres Ave., yeah you know how we go
My best friend Steven at the Home Depot
Laurelton is in the house, I can't forget Southside
Walk past MCs like that girl did to Pharcyde
I'm labeled as the cat's meow, the MC with the know-how
Act like you know, not now but right now
Beast of the East, on MCs I have a feast
I'd eat that ass like quiche, crack a smile like Shanice
Straight outta Jamaica, seen? Jamaica, Queens
But you could find me out in Georgia, or anywhere in between
Now if my partners don't look good, Malik won't look good
If Malik don't look good, then Quest won't look good
If the Quest don't look good, then Queens won't look good
But since the sounds are universal, New York won't look good
Picture Phife losing a battle, come on, get off it
Put down the microphone son, surrender, forfeit
Did I hear something 'bout a crew? What they wanna do?
You better call Mr. Babyface so he can bring out the cool in you
Or it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton
And I'll dissect you like a fraction
Oh, you wannabe top cat MCs, I'll pop you like a zit
You wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit
Big up myself every time when it comes to this
MCs be running scared as if they're watching the Exorcist
I kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead
My styles are milk, man, you'd think that I was breast-fed
You know the steelo when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
I dedicate this to all the MCs outta Queens
That goes for Onyx, LL, Run DMC
Akinyele, Nasty Nas and the Extra P
You need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other
Nuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover
Yo, Tip don't worry none you know I get the party jumping
Get on the mic and break 'em off a little little something
Yo, Tip don't worry none you know I gets the party jumping
Get on the mic my man and break 'em off a little something

""Oh my God!""

We got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit
So recognize me, kids memorize me
Everyday, I be scrounging, really I be lounging
I play the down low, very very incognito
Aries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme
Sometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the honeys wiggle
Intellect is the major, some heads like to wager
The skills on the hill, overlooking dollar bills
Man, you're crazy, thinking you can phase me
The Ab doesn't study mere nonsense, money
Life seems to need me, MCs seem too cheesy
With their doody ass renditions of defeating competition
I rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man
Bet your bottom dollar Vinia will make you holler
As you stand at attention, did I forget to mention
MCs will give me twenty if I sense that they act funny
Lyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant
Just mentioning the fact that the area is fat
I dwell in the under, so honey it's no wonder
That I get plenty of tail, well I even get white
I'mma bet hitting head crack, there money, take that
Breaking niggas off, cut their bank, then I'm off
While my Nikes match my Lo hat, beat joint is mad fat
Got the cutter of the box if a kid think he's ox
For tier means creator, the poetry relator
It's hemmed like Betsy Ross, let me tell you who's the boss

Don't come around town without the hip in your hop
Cause when the shit hits the fan, that ass'll get dropped
MC's want to attack me but them punks can't cope
I'll have you left without a job, like Isley from The Love Boat
So money watch your mouth, or I might have to bust ya
Battling MC's, from JFK to Russia
Back down to London, Sweden and Brazil
Do a U.S. tour for three months and then a chill
Styles be fat like Jackie Gleason, the rest be Art Carney
People love the Dawg like the kids love Barney
""I love you, you love me""
The shorty Phife Dawg is your favorite MC

Bring the blunts and the brew so

Whassup kids? The Ab is speaking from the moon
Thanks for your support, hey yo I'll be home soon
But the only thing I ask when I return from my task
Is a whole bunch of beats and a Blass full of ass
My fist stands firm because I'm, black and solid
I open up your pores like a plate full of collards
C'mon take it easy wouldya, easy easy
I'm up in the gulley, that's when I am her Buddy
She told me pull her hair, I did, it drove her nutty
Filled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty
When we over joints like this we never cruddy
Extra P hooked the beat, and kids it feels lovely
Check it out, cause my conception is immaculate
A bachelor, looking for a bachelorette
Back to you MC's, this is what your gonna get
A first degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette
I hope you like Malboro, Paul you know we thorough like Denver
The beat feels like a never-ender
But all things good must, so I won't sweat it
Drop the see's for the youthful crew, I hope you get it
As I stand, grip this mic inside my hand
Boy I smack you up, like I was your old grand
So respect yourself Son, and come and gimme love
Once again the Ab is who you think of
So chill with the beef money, we got a Jetti

On the country once again here to win

Eff with for the rest of my life"" yeah yeah now check the method

There's 8 Million Stories in the city it's a pity
Don't fuck with the skins if she's trying to act shitty
Shout to the Guru, Primo and Zulu Zulu

Wakin in the morning I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the drum sensation
Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on so of course communication
Bogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation
Decaptatin foes yo as if my name was Jason (come on)
Makin all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over (original, uh!)
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor
Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa
Representin on the mic it seems to be my daily
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey
But when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go

(I got lyrics to go) It's like that y'all, come on y'all
Lyrics to go It's like that y'all, come on y'all
(Lyrics to go) It's like that

I know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin
Would have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin
The mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin
Walkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it
The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly (bust a rhyme)
Today's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? (uhh)
Worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded
Steady kickin styles so I can reach that other level (uh)
Don't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal
Always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble (right)
I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? 
This I dedicate to all the honiest that be bogle-in
Cause at the end of the night y'know Malik will have his Trojans
But when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go

Check it out here we go!

Please proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato (yes dread, uh)
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh (right)
Calm and serene like the study was Tao
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease I defeat organisms
That are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters
Quitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangling my cord with hopes that I’ll stop rockin
Never will that happen only if it is permitted (uh)
Wait, I think somebody shitted (come on)
I guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin
I go for what I know doin a show for human beings
Always try to lead yo never will I follow

Puts the short down, to be exact one pound
He shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down
Scared money don't make none
He threw a trick on the ace now he's out son
Hits the local bodega to wolf down a gyro
Son is on a midnight run like De Niro
Spots a shorty rock standing on his block
The fiends be hounding him to pump so he asked it it's not
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
Increased intensity, cause damn she was a fly one
Took her to the crib there she ran her jibs
About mind upliftment and being positive
He yawned and he sighed til 1:05
Then he finally realized that honey wasn't live
At least he didn't plan on building for the evening
Threw the Fila on the dome and said 'Come on yo, we leaving'
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
Saw his man Stan with the blunt in his hand
(Ah sh) You know the transaction
Brothers gettin lost in the weed satisfaction
Coming down the block man loud as 
You would swear Redman was inside the truck
As the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt
They interrupt your cipher, and crush your blunt
See you left your work at home so they pat you down for nothing
Why in the hell does 10-4 keep fronting
You push to the park even though it's still dark
The kid is nice on the hoop, he said 'I'll spot you troop'

The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But now the night is on my mind

The night is on your mind
Ayo the sun'll still shine
But now the night is on my mind

As for me I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates
On a young black man who makes the niggas speakers shake
The nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy
It's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound
The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
The night makes the aura and the Jake can't hack it
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
And the stars dance around, a-yo I think it's fly
Intensity, most rappers don't see it
Spirit wise, musically, you gotta be it
Serenity and silence of the sounds and emotions
In the concrete jungle and the sun don't bungle
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel
I paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel
But let me slow down, I think I ran my jibs enough
Peace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough

The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
The night is on my mind

The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But now the night is on my mind","[Bad Idea, Cheeky Monkey, Five in the Morning, No1, Turn It Up, Number One, Ouch, Don't Be Punks, Down on the Floor, Getting Around, Jason's Addiction, Miles Away, Summer on the Underground, Warning, A, If It Ain't Broke, Fix It Anyway, Monkey Kong, Old Folks, Over It, 6 O'Clock on a Tube Stop, Champions of Endings [*], The Distance, Going Down, Hi-Fi Serious, Nothing, Nothing [CD-ROM Video][*], Pacific Ocean Blue, Shut Yer Face, Something's Going On, The Springs, Starbucks, Took It Away, W.D.Y.C.A.I., Everybody In, Getting Me Off, Better off with Him [Sampler Version], I Wonder [B Side], Wisdom, 2nd Coming, Afterburner, Better off with Him, Black Hole, Hey, Rush Song, Wake Up, Worst Thing That Can Happen, Human Condition, Sleeping, Take Your Time, A Minha Menina, No Trophy, Sunshine, Sweet Like a Champion, This Town, Chicken Payback, Go Karts, Horsemen, Hourglass, I Love You, No Atmosphere, One Glass of Water, The Start, These Are the Ghosts, This Is the Land, Wash in the Rain, End of the Street, The Bee's, Got to Let Go, The Bee's, Left Foot Stepdown, The Bee's, Listening Man, The Bee's, Stand, The Bee's, A Band of Bitches, Guerra Nuclear, Mambo en Trompeta Para Ti, No Money, No Fame, Noreste Caliente, Track 3.I4, Take My Hand, The Time, The Bluest Eyes in Texas, Elephant, Rock 'N' Roll Ghost, Silent Night, Walking the Cow, Bear on the Beach, Chinatown, The Crowning, Golden Teeth and Silver Medals, Here Are Many Wild Animals, I Signed the Line, It's Not Easy to Be Human, Love Has Left the Room, My America, Stronger Than Jesus, The Weed Had Got There First, Can't Buy Me Love, ...]"

When the mic is in my hand, I'm never hesitant
My favourite jam back in the day was Eric B. for President
Rude boy composer, step to me you're over
Brothers wanna flex, you're not Mad Cobra
MC short and black, there ain't no other
Trini-born black like Nia Long's grandmother
Tip and Sha they all that, Phife-Dawg ditto
Honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow
Did not you know that my styles are top-dollar?
The Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar
Hip-hop scholar since being knee-high to a duck
The height of Muggsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip

Queens is in the house represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
No taming of the style cos it gets irreverent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent

Huh-huh, here we go, you know that I'm the rebel
Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil
Funky like your grandpa's drawers, dont test me
We in like that, you're dead like Presley
When we coming through get tickets to see me
We work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie
Lyrics are abundant cause we got it by the mass
Egos are all idle cuz the music is the task
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it
I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it
Right, now I must move with the quickness
Here comes Shaheed so we must bear the witness

Stir it up! Stir it up! Stir it up!
Steve Biko

A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent

MCs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
I let my lyrics flow, and juxt your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after
Yo Tip settle down, whats the reason for the laughter?

I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying
So much going on, people killing, people dying
But I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental

Yo I'll take it back, I'm the Indian giver
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver
Percussion isn't less, D's wear the vest
Why they dodging bullets, you should be dodging Quest
Dont get me wrong, violence is not our forte
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pele
Tip educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo
Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo

Ok, I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all as we mingle at the ball
We welcome competition cos it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card
Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
Try to be the phattest also to stay alive","[Bad Idea, Cheeky Monkey, Five in the Morning, No1, Turn It Up, Number One, Ouch, Don't Be Punks, Down on the Floor, Getting Around, Jason's Addiction, Miles Away, Summer on the Underground, Warning, A, If It Ain't Broke, Fix It Anyway, Monkey Kong, Old Folks, Over It, 6 O'Clock on a Tube Stop, Champions of Endings [*], The Distance, Going Down, Hi-Fi Serious, Nothing, Nothing [CD-ROM Video][*], Pacific Ocean Blue, Shut Yer Face, Something's Going On, The Springs, Starbucks, Took It Away, W.D.Y.C.A.I., Everybody In, Getting Me Off, Better off with Him [Sampler Version], I Wonder [B Side], Wisdom, 2nd Coming, Afterburner, Better off with Him, Black Hole, Hey, Rush Song, Wake Up, Worst Thing That Can Happen, Human Condition, Sleeping, Take Your Time, A Minha Menina, No Trophy, Sunshine, Sweet Like a Champion, This Town, Chicken Payback, Go Karts, Horsemen, Hourglass, I Love You, No Atmosphere, One Glass of Water, The Start, These Are the Ghosts, This Is the Land, Wash in the Rain, End of the Street, The Bee's, Got to Let Go, The Bee's, Left Foot Stepdown, The Bee's, Listening Man, The Bee's, Stand, The Bee's, A Band of Bitches, Guerra Nuclear, Mambo en Trompeta Para Ti, No Money, No Fame, Noreste Caliente, Track 3.I4, Take My Hand, The Time, The Bluest Eyes in Texas, Elephant, Rock 'N' Roll Ghost, Silent Night, Walking the Cow, Bear on the Beach, Chinatown, The Crowning, Golden Teeth and Silver Medals, Here Are Many Wild Animals, I Signed the Line, It's Not Easy to Be Human, Love Has Left the Room, My America, Stronger Than Jesus, The Weed Had Got There First, Can't Buy Me Love, ...]"

Socially I'm not a name, black and white got game

Falling out between the dome of the white man's mouth

But I don't, neither does the youth cause we
Em-brace adversity it goes right with the race
And being that we use it as a term of endearment

If you don't know me by now, you'll never know
Stepping on my critics, beating on my foes
The plan is to stay focused, only then I can grow
Straight from the heart, I represent hip hop
I be three albums deep, but I don't wanna go pop
Too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
Too much candy is no good, so now I'm closing the shop
Crushing competition like Italians on grapes
My rhymes styles be blending like a Ron G tape

When the Tribe is in the house that means nobody is safe
How can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define
The music of our youth from 1979
We rap by what we see, meaning reality
From people busting caps and like Mandela being free
Not every MC be with the negativity
We have a slew of rappers pushing positivity
Hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap
So Mayor Barry smoking crack, let's preach about that
The trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter
The more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter

Devote it to your lover and make it thrive

Got my Timbo hooves and my Doublemint pack
Hit the city streets to enhance my soul
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
I can do a trick with the opposite breed

And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same
And when it comes to ripping mics hey yo it ain't no games
One one, one two one two

Hey yo you know it's Busta Rhymes, ev-ery time
Oh yes, I'm coming wicked with the new design
I'm saying
One one, one two one two

MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body, and the health make me wiser
The tantalizing wordplay yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come, with better, compositions
I write and recite to make good position
In this, rap game here, we engineer
Stabbing up the jam yeah son shit's clear
And I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way
Beating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-Seventy-Three, and C-Seventy-Fo'
Do a little something when I'm out on tour
Coming through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flapping shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll, cause we in control
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times toll
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll

Question Why is that, MC's be wack
And major labels wanna sound like crap, hey yo Funk that!
Word to life I'm coming rugged
Cuz once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks Refuse it
Put down the mic kid, cuz you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg, and I got nuff styles
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swingin when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle
Rude boy official coming with the ill grammar
Coming back on kids, like Joey Montana
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty
Mad play, on WKRP in Cincinnati
So lord send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself
Cause all deez biting MC's, lawd them something else
See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer ripping parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about feelin what with lead
NEVER MIND DAT MON HERE COME DE DREAD

We coming far far far
Busta Rhymes is coming far far far
Ya know ya hear me Star! Bet your bottom dollah
Right after this jam about one million one two niggaz go follow
Whether it be to-day or to-morrow
Niggas be collaborating sickening you beat them like they father
Oh shit check out what I saying
You know my niggas don't be playing
Once upon a hacking time
I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot Just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops,
Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings!! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings
But before I be face to face
With my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race

Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone macking, master as in great
I'll have your brain going in circles as my style tends to modulate
I'm making moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so your stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flavor, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks
While you playing hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissing around with wack rhyming
You lose your grip from chalk climbing
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't want to see me, cause all MCs are getting served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cypher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
Cause rapping ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushing any beef
Ain't nothing sweet, the bakery's across the fucking street
Phife Dawg, swinging it back and forth just like Aaliyah
Making moves on your heart like that trick Tamia
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losing my breath

A, yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
You know the deal, ha, you know the deal

Big up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism
My mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism
My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism
As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smoking izm
Now, when I'm with some cheese, I be letting off gism
Writing rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism
I gotta brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him
Got the Lightro in the back talking bout (come on, get him)
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em
Sucker MC in my path, hey main, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is tripping
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slipping
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitching
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walking through your projects in your birthday suit
Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If you'se a sucker MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, everyday all day, similar to water
Crushing MC's as if my name was Sargent Slaughter
Keep shit hotter, than a sauna
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter
Hey, I tried to warn her
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill
So all ya sucker MC's, y'all best go chill
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Singing good stuff in my ear, running fingers through my hair
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations
Chilling with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians

You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
The coming attraction, what, the main feature
And I'mma greet ya, like a rhyming ass creature
Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts
The brother well prepared is the brother who will start
And that's me Akki, as long as the ladies move they bodies
We'll have a forum to stand

Sexuality, it is the format baby

My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info
Got the diamond in the back and the sunroof shit
That makes the hardcore MC's resort to being bitch
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit
Denouncing my beliefs, well then your wig get split
Lay your egos on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your clique
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips

Got the beauty of a flower plus dimensions like a prism

Occasional malfunction pressure time, we ain't joking
For security, yo we on this run like Logan
Kamaal's doing the hustle and you backstage vogueing
We all got faults, don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings, there's bullshit at the surface
Sometimes, I mean we rhyme, damn, we ain't prophets
And if you think so, you need to stop it
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel but next man don't get jel
Playa hate that all carries weight that we don't need
We slim with disabilities and thick with possibilities
Cause then you can't move with agility
Navigating with good visibility
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
And strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names it still ring bells
There ain't no plan B's, yo watch, we moving through with plan A
Money market doing things the right way

Shootin dice, talkin shit, hopin the cash would last
Yo, this was around the time when I didn't know no better
Juney moved around in a tinted out Jetta

Then he introduced me to that hydro smoke
Then I took one toke, yo, I almost choked
See I never smoked before so my nerves got shot
Then he told me about the party at the spot jam rock
It was guaranteed on but I said ""son, chill""
There's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real
Word

He said we got all day, so we gonna do it right
Hit your man's joint first, then jam rock at one night
Then I said ""aight"", then I hopped inside the jetty
Let me take a shower, I'm sweaty, and then I'll be ready
Tonight is the night I get my groove on steady
And get my drink on with that Ford named Betty

On some liquor, to meet my high quicker

The Alize had me stuck, I don't know where to begin

Me and the fellas started acting irreverent
Butt grabbin, mad laughin just assin

They say you drug one with this one, gibbin with that one

Phony rappers, check it out, aight

Yo, I was riding the train
And this Puerto Rican kid said simple and plain
Let's battle - it kinda took me by surprise
Cuz the brother was moving wit his eyes on the prize
I said screw it, I ain't got nuttin to lose but um
But I got to do this shit real quick so um
Hurry up kid, bust your joints and then I'll bust mine
And I be out cuz I got to see this hottie, he said ok
Now check it, check it out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's what he said
Then I came back and just fucked up his head
Cuz yo, he thought an MC who was seen on TV
Couldn't hold the shit down in New York City
Aiyyo, I showed his ass, then I went off on my task
To bless her ass Uptown, real MC's will hold it down
Yea, yea, sonny, to the beat like that
You wanna bring it to me, where you at

Yes, dread, I had a similiar situation
When this kid tried to tell me I didn't deserve my occupation
He said I wasn't shit that I was soon to fall
I looked him up and down, grab my crotch and said balls
Of course he tried to bring it on the battling tip
Ay, you know me, you know I had to come out my shit
Trying to lounge at the mall, meet Skef and Mr Walton
Finally I banged his ass wit the verbal assault
He said a rhyme about his .45 and his nickelbags of weed
That's when I preceeded to give him what he needed
Talking 'bout I need a Phillie right before I get loose
Poor excuse, money please, I get loose off of orange juice
Preferly Minute Maid cuz that's exactly what it takes
To write a rhyme, huh, to school your nickels and your dimes
Because an MC like me be on TV
Don't mean I can't hold my shit down in NYC

Phony rappers who do not write
Phony rappers who do not excite
Phony rappers, you know they type
Phony rappers, check it

It seems there's a sanitation, y'all full of thrash talker
Sounding good but money can you feed the dog hawker
Talking 'bout your mic days and your breakdancing
Not enhancing, you sound tired
Oh, shit, I didn't know you like to play yourself in front'cha friends
Sitting there, lying to no end
MC's for me make things happening
Talk about a world but in a form of rapping
Who will be the captain of this ship
If it goes down, don't you know you have to go wit it
Just because you rhyme for a couple of weeks
Doesn't mean that you've reach the MC's peak
Let me stop sounding all bitter
Ghetto child, never be a quitter
But don't be a phony in the litter
Take it as a letter from the better
Take it from a man who used to rhyme in busted ass Jettas

Yo, Phife, you need a condom
Word to God, mess around
catch AIDS from MC's being on my nuts too hard
Cuz on my blvd you better bring your bodyguard
And what's your blvd
LP, I represent naturally
So don't step on the rolly if you know that you're phony
Or else I bend that ass like elbow macaroni
Cuz I gotta keep it real (gotta keep it real)
A Tribe Called Quest, you see we never half step
(So on your mark) get ready, MC's be jetti
Me and Phifey be on ya like Veronica and Betty
Archie, Jughead, snuffing Mc's
From Brainslane down to Hempstead
Yes 'Quence, see over
His rhyme style is older that a Chrysler Cordoba
I'm wilder then the cats from Arizona
Villanova, un, un, Kentucky
Whos' the next MC stepping up to try and bust me
Bring him here and boy, will I ever let him have it
And when it comes to the microphone, don't even try to grab it

A Tribe Called Quest came to drop jewels wit' ease
Plus make you party, we do this music thing for everybody
Black, White, Latino and Asian, we cold raisin'
The stakes of hip-hop to a new plateau
To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations
A god-fearin' folk 'cause we all from the yolk
Of one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed
Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence
Even though not too long ago I was a truant
Now I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics
From man's obsession with money to holy prophets
Like Mohamed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky
Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me
Now I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats
Lex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat
But what about your contract, slick? Is you proper?
It's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable
I be striving yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet
And fulfill it, think about these kids, we can't kill it

Now every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year
All you gat pullin' MC's could never come near
All that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest
It's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess
So I even start to (Rap) when you know you have no (Haps)
Wit' your simpleton (Lyrics), your light-hearted (Act)
Step back, me no have no time for that
I'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots
In a world where you have like a zillion MC's
Ninety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs
Bitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know
I be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low
(His name is Phife Dawg) I label myself as The Boss (True that)
Same height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross
Queens representation, son, you know how we do
While Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest
I be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat
Yo, what about about them biters? Me not like that
My motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop
Come on party people, you must give me my props
Cause y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered
So head for the border you peasy-haired bastards
Before I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya?
Queens is in the house so all MC's go hold their corner

You know we feelin' pressures
Feelin' pressures in here
You know we feelin' pressures
We gotta stand clear
Jus' gotta stand clear

(And why's that?) American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend

Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream
Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember
Shatan got you caught in the storms of December
And brothers on the block packing nines like September
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender

Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo

All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly

But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies

You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'

So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact
With a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked
The switch hitting Queens, niggas liquid sword spittin
With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whip cream before the water runs dry
Niggas flash dancing, yo, I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I be trying to get star status like Shinobi
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's

And they all stressin me, yo, really?
What really goes on? ( I don't know)

We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump

One is for the beat and the two is for the rhyme
Three is for the life, now we on this incline
Never catch this kid stickin forks in swine
Never ran my gibs in nuthin less than a dime
A few of my brothas did that asshole one time
Strivin miss sunrise, sometimes is known as crime
The three twenty-five got that Windex shine
And when I shot skelly, I had my boxes in lines
All I wanna do is live life and be fair
I used to stress girls with long legs and long hair
Now, I want a woman with a spiritual flair
God will never make it too hard for me to bare
I'm hungry like a derelict whose stays in the diluse
Some can count me out, but yo, I doubt that I lose
The Westernized world got our minds confused
You frontin on me, ak, then you don't get bruised
The funny style cats, they be playin games like Chucky
Government officials shoot their same old
Made of devil agents a.k.a. the devil flunky
Stiff (ass) squares gettin mad cuz we funky
This the crap game, then we got the top rolls
The positive jumps the negative like frogs
Resentin evil vibes, yo, that (shit) is at the morgue
We celebrate laughin down in at the smorgas borg
You still lookin (shitty) like a to' down committee
Let's make this institution, buy the land for the smitties
I got girls with tails, plenty smarts and big (titties)
And they all stressin me, really

Oh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your rear section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies

You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealing

With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whip cream before the water runs dry
Niggas flash-dancing yo I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I be trying to get star status like Shinobi

I give my promise to all y'all to keep my shit hittin'
Half of y'all claim dog but now a light kitten
Flippin' on brothers just like Mary Lou Retton
Get off that ass and see what I'm settin'
Born with this inside, you just can't get it
This is the lethal pop and you have no weapon
Who is the native brother who keep asses steppin'
Make deep impressions and constantly be reppin'

When I was young I'd stretch gouch yo
Now I'm on Letterman, on the couch yo
The black thing with knives is called the back do'
Can't we be cool instead of being foul though
Ghetto child dreams of fast cars and fast dollars
Impressions of live sometimes makes ya holler
Scream all that devil shit and talk like a scholar
You dumb as a doorknob, and why do you bother

Phife Dawg puttin' the bite back in yours
Top dog, puttin' it up, flick his balls
MC from now til I get a frown
Shake that ass girl because you world renowned
Wake up, look at the sun, see the sights
Bull duke, you've got to die for your rights
MC's, y'all got to work for the mic
Zombies, do it from dusk to the night

Rock to the beat, yo it's never the same
Good girls usually got good game
Hot cats tearin' that ass out the frills
Block ass, you had no skills, that's the reals
Make this money without the friction
Take this honey, there goes your diction
Rappers better retreat, fix your joints
My whole crew got bumps on they points

Rumors being spread 'bout me and my click
We can't rock shows and our rhymes ain't shh
Might not've heard it, or maybe you have
Between me and you, they can kiss my ass
Used to get angry, used to get quite vexed
But say what you may, just cash my check
'Cause all I'm ever guilty of is going on tour
Doing shows galore, and bringin' it raw

Have you ever met a woman that just took your breath?
So deep inside her life, she contemplated death
Can't help but get attatched to a woman like that (true dat)
The contact was quite immediate, I had to attack
(Because you the man, yo, you know you the man)
We related and debated over food and tunes
Started out in September, now we enterin June (say word)
Simple night in the crib, no, it just won't do
(no it just won't do, no it just won't do)
Because she liable to start shit that's wildin you
(wildin you, wildin)
She wanna push my whip, buy diamond chips
And take on trips, conversin my flip
Gotta do her hair, take her out to the fair
When a jake be there, make sure you don't stare
At another one comin, don't be startin nuthin
Be a slave to her, don't be brave to her
Make sure that she's right, make sure that you're wrong
When she wants to do it, make sure that it's long
F anyone wanna make it work it's me (Phife Dawg help me out)
But we gotta come through with common ground baby
Any man, he can claim to be the one for you
But put it straight to your lover in life runs true

Get it going on, let's get it going on
And if it's me then let's get it going on

See, I'm not the one to be taken advantage of
And if you really think about it, I got nuthin but love
Now if your heart isn't in it, please let me know
There's no need to waste time, if it's no, then I'll go

When we made love she made it shake like jelly
Put her own video star on my telly
Lived in the Bronx on the block named Fortelly
Had to be jetty cause this other ho Netty
Kept blowing me up, her jonesing was steady
Told my man Louie that I really wasn't ready
Louie when we did it, man, we both got sweaty

This girl from my past had ridiculous ass
She attended UMASS and she passed every class
Walked down the hall with her stuck up sass
Talked to basketball players
She liked how they passed
But when I use to hit it, the bullcat she quit it
She wouldn't admit it but shorty was addicted
(Say Word) Word, nigga you heard
Like a fiend with a queen when he catches the bird

Knowing how we living I'mma talk about Mayo
Sagittarian mami, her love was a KO
We was on the under, had to stay on the lay low
Used to go so deep that she used to say A-yo
Rocked with her friend but her friend drove both way
Asked her about it and she used to say no way
Just let it go yo, I used to say OK
Just another day but Phife, anyway

I put it down man, what you gon' do
Well, I put it down son, what you gon' do
We put it down for the area crew

Come on Phife

Met a shorty named Kenny from East Saint Louie
Body good and plenty, the finest in Missouri
If you had no money, you better hit the highway
Even in her own right, she had to do it her way

It was an ill situation when I met Dantanya
Worked in Saint Louis in her mother's hair parlor
Use to hit her man for cake to come see me
Her and her man from home, they sold heemey
We had it hemmed, locked, sold and shit
When I dug her yo she said I was the ultimate
Broke her up kid, driving the drill like Truck Turner
All other things they did not concern her
People that we love yo, we love with a passion
I'm the type of cat that brings forth the action
You feeling me yo, I hope you hearing me yo
One more thing before you start cheering me yo

Hey yo who want to pull on Phifer long time no hear from
Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some
But that pop is non cypher, no can do
And if you think I'm a dope, then ask the other crew
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just step off with the hoe
Oops my mistake I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of the all the kids that done hit her
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
I heard she likes to do one-one my man John Ritter
But back to the subject you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could herb me 'cause know I where specks
You're full of jokes, but you your name ain't flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that but you're girl's quite doable
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me
I'm not a mad cohort, but I'm not Mr. Softee
Rappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart
So forget the chart because the action can start

Hot sex on a platter

Where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk
I'm the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas step up it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paper back books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excelling cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo I gets the pickens, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link on the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mardane
See I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah I can do that
I can also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind
Makes me pick up and go when it's time to drop a rhyme
My title is locked, the Abstract poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, especially for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear 'cause it's evident and clear
That I will rock, rock, rock

Tough like a nugget
Listen to the Abstract Poetic, dont snub it
The Midnight Marauder is the hype beat arranger
Dont front on the lyrics or the two cuz its danger
Hook you like a junkie, youll flip like a monkey
To the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because Im funky
I get down, down like a fly hookers panties
Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
I be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly
Upset when I rock, cuz yo, they beats is smelly
See, I got it goin on like a Forbes tax return
Listenin to these lyrics when its hot will make it burn
Baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens
The skies up above, the one you think of
Is the highly regarded, hell of the people
Your mic and my mic? Come on, yo, no equal
So if ya wanna do it to yourself
That is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself
Cuz you made your bed, so now you lay in it
Thats your (shit) on the floor, then go and play in it
I refuse to catch a L in a battle
Cuz yo, I got the jazz and Ill whup a rappers (ass)
Into little next to nuthin
Test me if Im frontin
Im passin flyin colors cuz yo

Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)
We've got the jazz
Come on
Come on, Phife

No need for introductions cuz you know who I be (the Phife Dawg)
Yep, the one who loves to slaugher MCs
I got style, grace and razamatazz
Im like my girl Patrice Rushen, yo
I add pizazz, now
Most people remember Phife from the Phife like smoothness
But now its time to hit you with roughneck rudeness
Im still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw
The first punk that tries to flex, Ill be cracking your jaw
Ill mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff
Dont ever try to test or else that (ass) will get whipped
Im forever poppin junk, its like a fat invite
To any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight
Gel up my posse up on Linden and 1-9-2
Pull up my brothas from Sayers Ave., the Brooklyn Zoo
All my crew up in Strong Island, so yo, dont sleep
Cuz it only takes a peek to watch that (ass) get beat
Brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some
Wanna be hero, but youre a zero, that means you gets none
Dont ever try to step to a kid you cant get with
Why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?
Im a negro, hes a negro, wanna be a negro too?
But beatin on a woman, is somethin that a puss would do
I love jazz, but that doesnt mean that Im timid
Not really a gangsta rapper but I can swing it for a minute

In come the bedroom dream

Bringin' all the pain and makin' things shiver

Rock for an hour and he might rock longer

On how he just murderlized the whole damn jam
He just got results that's smiles and waved hands

Until we bounce to a autumn where hot weather
And still we'll be able to rock and rip crowds

Oh yes, I'm coming wicked with the new design
I'm saying
One one, one two one two

MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body, and the health make me wiser
The tantalizing wordplay yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come, with better, compositions
I write and recite to make good position
In this, rap game here, we engineer
Stabbing up the jam yeah son shit's clear
And I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way
Beating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-Seventy-Three, and C-Seventy-Fo'
Do a little something when I'm out on tour
Coming through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flapping shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll, cause we in control
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times toll
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll

Question Why is that, MC's be wack
And major labels wanna sound like crap, hey yo Funk that!
Word to life I'm coming rugged
Cuz once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks Refuse it
Put down the mic kid, cuz you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg, and I got nuff styles
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swingin when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle
Rude boy official coming with the ill grammar
Coming back on kids, like Joey Montana
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty
Mad play, on WKRP in Cincinnati
So lord send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself
Cause all deez biting MC's, lawd them something else
See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks

I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot Just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops,
Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings

But before I be face to face
With my eternal resting place

I push a tractor, for horses grazin' in the pasture
Ya heard I was trickin', the whole room filled with laughter
In ciphers, I'm the one you don't rhyme after
You only know half of the math, it don't add up
The lead batter, my hits make ya frame shatter
Watch me now! Just begun like Jimmy Castor
I'm bad luck just like walkin' under ladders
Mad rappers, book of life, last chapter
Me and my squad build just like contractors
I break shit, you only give hairline fractures
Women flash us, don't know ya better ask us
A bastard, wit' more contacts than Lens Crafters
Tear down the rafters, venereals couldn't clap us
You need practice, hit chicks then I'm Casper

The church of scientology, feminine biology
Manic depressive psychologically, A.D.D. alive and we
Polluted by technology, the fumes and its ecology
While your thought you was out of copy I get nastier than sodomy
Probably an oddesey, started back on robbery
Was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty
Regarded as a prodigy, leery in sociology
Let the wallabees always conceal my gynecology
Rhymin' pathologically, that's how it gotta be!
Never makin' no apology, worshippin' my anthropology
Fuck modesty, studyin' microbiology
Causin' verbal lobotomy, it's in my geneology
Six months of sobriety, movin' very methodically
Like a unicorn, more ways than oceanography
Guard technology, rip shows antibiotically
True thugs bionically, give birth to criminology

Yo as a youngin', I swear to God you couldn't tell me nothin'
I swore I was gettin' somethin', clothes or humpin'
For girls with the church, slacks with some shirts tucked in
I set it up for money, my mom worked when I was cuttin'
Unsigned strugglin', for the heat I lit the oven
One would by the CD, the other would do the dubbin'
Before I met Rob, I was in the clubs frontin'
Oh yeah I know the Tip, when I see him I be duckin'
But now when I'm clubbin', those that used to dis were buggin'
Overweight chicks, spandex, they stomachs sucked in
Stay interruptin', dance and try to cut in
Told people you got in free when you really snuck in

We never get concerned about who's in the league
We just stay workin' so no one will need
An unconcerned outsider givin' niggas feed
My niggas puff weed but negotiate the seed
The family is granite and you can't intercede
I try to switch lanes at this operatin' speed
Cats in the game be gamblin' with greed
We the house, you the player and we gonna catch these
Who's the Sam Sneed makin' microphones bleed
Poker face creed while my mind just read
Shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed
That's insignificant but this take heed

They say I'm pretty like Clay is, bright like the day is
Beats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is
I'm swingin' this from Bay Ridge to where the Oakland Bay is
My game is tough to play, I'm tough to weigh like your safe is
The aim is, to make you recognize what the name is
Mos Def gon' set it straight from where the 718 is
The place with the greats who originate the flavors
An all-star block with some all-star neighbors
(Turn the music down!) This is probably some haters
Achin' cuz they hear us rotatin' on the playlist
From B-boy laces to Detroit gators
Yo Tip I got to bail, where the scale? Help me weigh this

To rock rock ya'll
Freak freak ya'll
To the beat ya'll

The fabulous What's The Scenario remix
Whereas there are seven MC's
Six which are in physical form and one which is in spiritual essence
And he goes by the name of, uh HOOD!

Check the vibe, walk that ass or get got
F it (shit) I lick buckshots
Hood, madman, I rip up stages
Lay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis
Extra, extra, pick up a clip
I'll tear ass out the frame (Ha!) and grab my dick (Ohh!)
I'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot kid, I drop bombs
I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty
I baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news
I'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews
Death on the phono, my skills are porno
You say ""oh no,"" you bitch ass homo
I bag up waste, electrifyin', I'm prime-time
I slaughter a slime, I'm the greatest of all time
Sick ass brother, nasty ass nigga
Pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can
(Say what, say what?) I'm a bad, bad man

Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip
Punchin' out hits like Gladys Knight and the Pips
The five-foot assassin has just raided your area
Your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason I ain't hearin ya
(So!) Roll out the red carpet cause I'm kickin' this
Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous
Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew
And to you other sellouts, oh yeah, F you too
And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to
You're better off calling D-Nice to your rescue
Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around
As for corny MCs, like Chuck D, I shut 'em down
The Artical Don of hip-hop and I won't stop
The five-foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop
So do like Michael Jackson and ""Remember the Time"" (Do you remember?)
Put on your dancin' shoes or somethin cause you sure can't rhyme

(Big up, big up!) Enter new identity
Next to say something cause you pass it to me
What does it take to check a technique?
(Many styles, many styles!)
Hostile heat, brings bursts of energy
Milo in De Dance is the new identity
One two mic check, select for the ruffneck sect
Ten to one that I come (Correct!)
In my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots
So I can grow dreadlocks
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)
Kicking right inna your what's it not
I could rock longer but fair is fair
So C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeah!)
C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeah!)

Makin moves y'all (Moves y'all!) On and on and on
(Check it, check it out!!) To the break of, break of dawn
(Who's that?!) just one of the L.O.N.S
And a Tribe Called Quest (East coast) to West
Remix mad kick, more than Metallica
To all MCs fall like the Battlestar Galactica
Stampin', stompin', rompin' Compton
(People all over the world!) I'm promptin (Style!)
Pick a style, any style, Strong Isle
Representation, sensationalization
""Scenario"" for the radio, 'BLS and KISS, so
(Here we go yo!) Yeah
Force, Main Source LP on the rise
In living color we'll see seen through original eyes
And I'm out like shout, Ooh Ahh, Ooh Ahh
(Ooh ah, ooh ah!) There it is baby pah

Flying in on a limb, slim trim, D I am
There I am (There I am!) Don't run from a grim
Sight we be right, be polite for my mics
Like I'm like (See sick, see syke)
And slip away, and off to the Poconos
Spot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose
Yamaha (Ay-Ha May!)
Let's split the funk, now it all spells (Hey!)
Enough enough, Ms. Fitted I'm with it
If I did it, I was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it
Cause yo, my vocal status at Knight's like the Gladys
Bed rest, spread test, and yo I'm like the maddest
Male, not female, hail from Uniondale
Bounce the b-ball cause beats are being yelled
In the hallways always ringing with a (Ho!)
This one two times nine on the Scenario

Check it out everybody, rhymes and mics
Black Benz gettin looped (Doin' what they like!)
Eight black brothers in the public eye
If you listen very close, I will tell you why
(Hood!) Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown
Shaheed, myself, and Busta Bust Down
Will commence to rock (Rock!) So bring on the flocks (Flock!)
In-terrogation for the knockin of the box
The boom-box ruler, controls the medulla
None come cooler, I win like Shula
So bust out the moves as you start to pursue her
Intensified mind, nine-blunt consumer
Tip will come booty (Well it's only a rumor!)
The meanin' so deep that it starts brain tumors (Tumors!)
Peace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner
Smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner

Hey what we gon do (Dooo) in '92
Even though we had fun (Fuuun) in '91
Wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down
Ponna ponna new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground
What's goin on my man? (Goddamn!) And now my brain is hurtin'
Listen up, Busta, rhythm will hit 'em then I get 'em
Rip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em
Open up your mouth if you want the food
To get rude, Flipmode, cause I'm in the mood
Ah-heh, ah-heh! Yeah man, that's how it goes
Body drippin with blood comin out your nose
Give me a Band-Aid, what are you askin for?
(More!) Only your sacred and pure
Adverse, Zig-Zag, check it and the Busta new rap
Rap, Busta Rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes
Yeah y'all in '92, I'm packin my roach spray (Anyway!)
Ding-A-Ling, Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School
Mad brother when stealthy RRRAAAOW RRAOW RRAOW!
To my dragon, baby, stop whinin' I see my influence still shinin'
More crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo

One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two

MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body and the health make me wiser

The tantalizing wordplay, yeah, that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come with better compositions
I write and recite to make good position

In this rap game here, we engineer
Stabbin' up the jam, yeah, son, shit's clear
And I be kickin' rhymes in my own damn way
Beatin' niggaz to the punch like Sugar Ray

Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to see Seventy Three and see Seventy Fo'
Do a little somethin' when I'm out on tour

Comin' through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flappin' shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last

Let the good times roll 'cause we in control
Take you out on your high, less you payin' a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Take you out on your high, less you payin' a toll

Question
Why is that MC's be wack
And major labels wanna sound like crap?
Aiyyo, funk dat

Word to life, I'm comin' rugged
'cause once you add the hip to the hop, kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks renuse it

Put down the mic kid 'cause you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap?
The name is Phife Dawg and I got nuff style
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild

So bust what I'm swingin', what I'm swingin' when I swing
I rap when I rap 'cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland, now he's Sleepless in Seattle

Rude bwoy official comin' with the ill grammar
Comin' back on kids like Joey Montana
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty
Mad play on WKRP in Cincinnati

So Lord, send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself
'cause all deez bitin' MC's, lawd dem somethin' else
See, I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt

Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer, rippin' parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about feelin' what with lead
Never mind dat mon here come de dread

We comin' far, far, far
Busta Rhymes is comin' far, far, far
Ya know ya hear me Star
Bet your bottom dollah

Right after this jam about one million, one two niggaz go follow
Whether it be today or tomorrow
Niggaz be collaboratin' sickening
You beat them like they father

Oh, shit, check out what I saying
Ah hah, ah hah, oh, ah hah, ah, hah
You know my niggaz don't be playing
Once upon a mah, hah, hacking time

I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowin' up the spot
Just to represent the Nations

Three dimensions, tri-clops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Mama so mama saa mamma ma kosah
Go back to the country to go check my grand mama

Eeeyah, bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings, delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings, watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings

But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Sit, dog sit
Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose is profound

Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends

So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make ya unball your fist
For we put hip-hop on a brand new twist

A brand new twist with the homie-alistic
So low-key that ya probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed

So raise up squire, address your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed

Then cool out to the music cause it makes ya feel serene
Like the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk

I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

We got the jazz

Competition, them Phifer come sideway
But competition, they mus' me come straightway
Competition, them Phifer come sideway
But competition, they mus' come straightway

Hows about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mike has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phifer really kick it?
Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?

I'm all into my music cause it's how I make papes
Tryin' to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another?  I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing

I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack

I take off my hat to other crews that intend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare

So jet to the store, and buy the LP
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skiff Anselm, he gets props too

Make sure you have a system with some phat house speakers
So the new shit can rock, from Mars to Massapequa
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done

So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theater nearest you

We got the jazz

Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut

Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline

The jazz, the what?  The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feelin' of pizzazz
It's the universal sound, best to brothers underground
In the one-six below, ya didn't have to go

Some say that I'm a sinner cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a stink, I ask
""What? What? What?"" now check it out

All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx a' Harlem ya don't stop

Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I say because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop

To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop

Everybody in the place ya don't stop
Ya keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot

Called her up and she made me feel right
Wish the bliss could never take flight

Sittin' back with this mic in my hand
Spittin' hot shit tryin' to see grand
Imprinted on my mind every minute
Make my plans and you always in it, yo

You're such a vivrant thing,
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing

And even though we both fly
Give each other space and not the evil eye
Actin' like grownups
Don't even try to hide cause the spot blown up

Girlfriend tellin' you she want to see
I say 'I dunno' but you say 'Gladly'
And when we both do hemp
We go on and on and on and on and on and

Sweeter than Ben & Jerry

Shorty thought she subtle but she really was blatant when she

Shook her thing and violated
Now these wolf-like thoughts are formulated
I'm sayin, ""Yo is this some heartfelt shit here?
Am I strong-backed nigga? Well shit yeah""

Plus we can hold a convo'
Or go to the movies, my crib, whatever yo
Just want to see you by my side
We on 95, know the stash is in the ride

A rappin' nigga for real
You would find me in a cypher if I didn't cop a deal

You buy, I sell, we split big cake

Move it around and shake your little thing

Goin' on an' on to the rhythmic variation
Wakin' in the mornin', I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation, please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the jump sensation

Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on, so I cross communication
Boggle at the party then you got the boggle-ation
Decapitatin' foes, yo, as if my name was Jason

Makin' all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic an' it's over
A Tribe Called Quest, we on the run for whatever
Trials an' tribulations that we have to endeavor

Brothers know my steelo, it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words, I'm loco
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa

Representin' on the mic, it seems to be my daily
I can do a split an' turn around like Alvin Ailey
But when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go

Lyrics to go

It's like that y'all
C'mon y'all, it's like that

I know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin'
Would have tried for singin' but that stuff was not my callin'
The mic is in effect, so you know I'm never stallin'
Walkin' through the door an' all them suckers started haulin'

Talk a lotta trash but no one can seem to beat it
Pull out your microphone an' watch the Phifer make you eat it
The MCs they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly

Today's a hip hop draft, will I be top seeded?
Worked too frickin' hard while all the rest were gettin' weeded
Steady kickin' styles so I can reach that other level
Don't worry about gettin' gassed, I push the pedal to the metal

Always wanted this 'cause it surely beats a scramble
I'm Jordan with the mic, wanna gamble?
This I dedicate to all the honies that be boglin'
'Cause at the end of the night, y'know Malik will have his Trojans
But when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go

I got lyrics to go [Repeat: x3]

Please proceed with caution 'cause the lyricist is fatal
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Playdo
Calm an' serene like the study was Tayo

Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease, I defeat organisms
That are waitin' in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies an' your moms'll get the jitters

Winners turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangle in my fore with hopes that I stop rockin'
Never will that happen, only if it is permitted
Wait, I think somebody shitted

I guess that will be me 'cause I'm the only one MCin'
I go for what I know doin' a show for human beings
Always try to lead, yo, never will I follow
Blowin' up the spot like Fred did to Rollo
An' when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go

I got lyrics to go [Repeat: x10]

All we want in this life
Is peace, prosperity and a little paper
Objects that seem greater
But I'm sure well over come when we illin on a drum

[Q-Tip]
We in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis
Y'all can be my witnesses
That a fella fascination with money has grown
To the point that he will shit on his own
We got to have it y'all, its not a Spike Lee cinematic
A piece of paper making niggas get dramatic
But the money doesn't come automatic
Gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it
We got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion
Some cats go about it with too much passion
We got to mediate our greedy levels
Cause the lust of currency can have us sleeping with the devil
Gotta recognize it, realize the power
that this little ma-hucking piece of paper will devour
Man can be greater than the thing he creates
See, I'ma do my thing and see how much I can scrape
Yo I'd rather have respect than money, no doubt
But listen to me y'all, I want the mass amount
That the Sesame Street Dracula cant Count
So that I can give my people when that thing surmounts
To higher levels, of being, so when I'm MC-ing
I hope to see you there steady G-ing (say word)
But the only way we can truly reach that goal
Is finding true inner peace and prospering souls
It's like that

[Chorus: x2]

[Phife]
Here comes your royal highness, one of Queens finest
Believe me, honest, you know you can't stop it
Come on son, never leave your mic round me
True MC for real ask my man Shaheed
Strictly focused on what I'm in this rap game for
Not for fame and screwing every whore after whore
With all that AIDS stuff going round
Tell me how that sound
Rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound
Now, don't get me wrong I love honeys galore
But see hip-hop's my bread butter
Cause that's what I get paid for
See this is what I wanted
Allah helped me to get it
And if the beat is wicked
You know Malik will rip it
From the bottom of my heart
That's where the love starts
The love for break dancing
My love for the art
And with this love I do hip-hop from the soul
A real MC, who never sweats how many copies are sold
Yeah I want to go gold, platinum, uh-huh etceteras
But why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya
I'm staying true 'nough respect to those that paved the way
From Bambaata down to Shah, that be my DJ
With out my peeps I don't know how the hell Id make it, word
Sometimes I feel that my career is headed for the curb
One love for the lending hand and giving all your help
Believing in me when I didn't believe in my own self
The Abstract with whom I'm always making rugged tunes
Kid Hood resting in heaven, I hope to see you soon
I keep things hot and this year they're even hotter
Big Mu and Shah, one day I'll take my shahada

Ego

I got one, you got one, and now we equal
Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people
Sometimes it has connotations of evil
Sometimes niggas call on it when they need to
It's called the ego

Ay, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated
Some may hate it and some may overrate it
It's a top story and you rarely see a trend
So all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen, it's called the ego
Come up with an idea, and no one seems to get it
Then every time you mention it, they stare like you're two-headed
But one day in your cubicle your idea really comes to view
Your boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you
She put you on the aces of all the stripper places
And has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well
You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego
She knows you need the chicken and she knows that she's your people
They call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy
They photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy
And now that inner voice, the ego, making you get wavy
Change your diet, hit the gym and say ""What were you saying to me?""
The ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music
Or run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis
It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest
Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest
It's the ego

Ooh, Jack White
Ooh, Jack White

A celebrated genius, my dick game's the meanest
I'll take the girl that's augmented, new me is invented
I'll take the biggest house in Calabases
Anyone for Michael Phelps swimming classes?
You need it when you're balling, equally when you're falling
Or when those kids in school on your locker they get to scrawling
Epithets that's racist and stupid and mean in nature
Something that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya
Ego make you violent, or govern like a tyrant
Or switch ya dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant
Fool the thirsty people, selling tap water in bottles
Fool a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models
Ego has no ending, has people pretending
Religious zealots get perilous 'cause God's will they're defending
This is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us
And closing for our ego, we know only God can help us

But what if they knew though and hit you with the cheat code
To a game you just start playing, no extra man
Leave you reckless on the court with no high percentage shot

Best of us are left for dead in cities that looks war-torn
Vietnam going wrong, heroin going strong
Neighbors would whoop that bad ass just for running through their lawn
Walt met Cheryl, Cheryl met Walt
Trinidadian love sprouting through the asphalt
Love was consummated and the angels registrated
Two were to be born but only one of 'em made it
Inside a cloud of sorrow, a silver lining and joy
It's a bouncing baby boy, a king's name they would employ
And before he even squeaks it's decided it's Malik
Now, give him hope, give him care, raise him while his grandma there
Watch out momma, if you stare light brown eyes will keep you there
Let's progress the story just a little bit
Malik, I would treat you like little brother that would give you fits
Sometimes overbearing, though I thought it was for your benefit
Despite all the spats and shits and cinematically documented
The one thing I appreciate, you and I, we never pretended
Rhymes we would write it out, hard times, fight it out
Made grace face to face, made it right
And now you riding out, out, out, out
Damn

Have you ever
Lost somebody
Way before you
Got to dream

Never thought that I would ever be writing this song (No more crying)
Hold friends tight, never know when those people are gone (He's in sunshine)
Soul so beautiful, opined indisputable
Heart of the largest lion trapped inside the little dude
Took the grip to Granny's house, now we eat the curry food
Talking hopes, dreams, plans, leak ice, never scared
Brand new pair of Nike Airs, avenue of stairs
Mailbox mayors, all our rhymes was written there
A nigga wanna battle, you know Phifey didn't care
Jarobi with the beat, into new ass we tear
I'mma flash forward, well took a trip to ATL
Cooking in the kitchen making sure my nigga eating well
Wedding in Tobago, you know exactly where I'm at

Roleplay, she plays the mannequin (they don't know)
Raising my hand, teacher says not again (they don't know)
The sun is up, but I feel down again (they don't know)
On just one hand I can count all my friends (they don't know)

The understudy for the star, the show must go on
I'm a beast on a leash, I'm towed from the lawn

Another notch in my belt, she shakes up the stairs

My mother said a lot of wise words to me
Her Bible was like her toolie
Peasy headed and unruly I made her think she got to me
Following the trail of reefer, and niggas talking through speakers
Fattest laces, through my sneakers, the rappers were ghetto preachers
Thought I had it so I tried it, for so long I would just hide it
Then I made the crowds say ""oh"", smoking more and get excited
I was hooked, I couldn't shake it, the more I got the I would take it
Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep,  but this life I would not forsaken

They say Illuminati and other ordeals
Is how my lawyer got me to avoid a raw deal
And now it's more real than it is for any other star
And that's enough to have you tearing up the mini-bar
I should probably get awards when the Emmys are
For how I deal with the path like Remy Ma
I get in the car like a sniper's on the roof now
But don't confuse how you see me, have to move now
I got bars like the cypher's in the booth now

'Long as they say my name right in the media

'Cause ever since I had the polo suit at the Grammys
I been spittin' at the camera like Trick Daddy
So swaggy, he could have broke up with IG
I ain't surprised that they broke up on IG
I got the game on IV
Might as well have a live feed
Keep a fresh cut from IB
So I always match the picture in my ID
They packin' Dub C and run with Mack 10
I was still a baby Similac then
And what the crack era did to black men
It had to be a error if you had a Cadillac then

House of lies, you niggas go run, hide
Peep the way the vibe conflict with they real lives

Bad news for niggas as I go emphatical, radical

And the president's refined, in her wings she's confined
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine
Caroline ain't nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs
To the top of the State building claiming that the flag is mine
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can't breathe
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for a second all the people are colored, please
Imagine for a second all the people in poverty
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone
Think the ones who got it would even think to throw you a bone?
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?
Nah cypher, probably no place to
Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude

And a little bit of coke I put the cake in and it's certified dope
Having anything to do with it we selling
Every rock that they can smoke so let's take a toke and Imma rake it in
Pillsbury the dough, to the dome, like I'm seeking through the soul
Like I'm peeking through the soul
But I'm reekin like our reefer, rather keep up with her, go
Straight to the dro
Creepin' on em, peeping on em, leave em in the zone
They don't even really know
Looking on em, keeping on em, taking every foe
For the love of the money B gotta reap in what I sow
But I keep it what I know
For the ending of the row gotta go will I go
When I get it Imma know to follow my known foe
My caliber lock and load alabaster box when I cock and I crow
Gotta Glock and I'm Bone Thug where you wanna flow
To the clock and the time zone

A$AP, but wait a minute
I’m probably one of the sickest niggas that ever did it
I’m in it cause I’m a win it
I’m a muthufuckin' lyrical tyrant
Pivotal giant of this shit
And I do way more, just twist the words
You better listen and observe, how I rip the verb
Niggas get the nerve to run up on me, but my shits superb
I’ll probably hit a nigga once before he hit the curb
So get at me, I’m kinda trigger happy
When it come to shootin' my gift

On behalf of the A$AP Mob, Bone Thug and, all in attendance
Knowing that all things belong to those
For the cleanliness and the power the first in the nation
To prove who they are
Through infinity, through eternity, through time span
Standing one man, if you hold my hand, hold my hand
(Make sure its a hand)
With all things around me I will never win
I won’t win with angels
I won’t win with the brothers
I won’t win with Rome
I won’t win with Sodom and Egypt

Some say I'm possessed, that's why Christ on my chest
I'm from the Southside so I throw up the ""S""
Disrespect, I lay you to rest
Boy you ass, you softer than breast
Bloody murder, I lay you to rest
Aim for the head ain't no need for a vest
Can't nothing protect you from this tec
Street educated, no use for G-tech
Niggas be talking but really don't want it
Put shells in your stomach, like pussy you wet
Flocka like Rambo, I stay with the ammo
Test me, that's a gamble like Russian Roulette
I stay with them commas, I been through the drama
You going to war, you better invest
Fuck is a ""K""? I ain't impressed
Got thousands of shooters I pay just to flex

Niggas say I'm real, bitches say I'm hot
Disrespect the Mob or Squad, then you get shot

All my people say ""Stomp!"" like I'm Kirk or something
Put 'em in the dirt like ""Work"" or something
He get on my nerves so fuck him
You turn ass like Tahiry when I pressed your buttons
And that was no diss, niggas quick for discussion
Y'all quick for the tweeting, y'all quick to be tumbling
How about a Vine, 2 clips to your spine
And Instagram pics of me dumping
I'm feeling your bitch so I'm fucking
I skeet-skeet like it's nothin'

That's a fallen soldier

I'm finna get back and start peelin' the burner
Now I'm beating that ass like Ike did Turner
You sit in a box, you sleep in a hearse
Wherever you from, that's my turf
Fergie Ferg and I'm putting in work
Young Flocka Flame gon' put 'em in the dirt
Sipping on the Henny and a nigga go berserk
Couple bitches gave me brain, then I skeet on they skirt

Yeah Ferg, you nasty
Pay attention, focus on what we came for
Got the drop on a nigga, got the info
Soon as I hop out, click-clack, then go bang

If our lives don't matter, no lives matter
Thus life is our future, dying is unacceptable
Living for what we believe in is life itself
And that in itself is beautiful, aight

Beautiful people let's take a second and think
We continue these issues our ship will drown and we sink
This is nothing political this is so we be sync
Stick together forever and we'll weather the rain
We'll weather the storm, let's try to move on
Build a better community, so our children be on
Transform from arms and bombs like Vietnam
Teach your kid how to eat and teach your kid how to farm
Watch what you put in your body so you can live it long
Mind, body and soul in tact, proud and you strong
This rap ain't no lap it's more like a marathon
This track ain't no track just something I set it on
Live life in harmony, put love in your arms
Forgive to receive the blessing of peace and calm
Just a product of Malcolm X and Farrakhan
Martin Luther and Marvin Gaye came all to do a ghetto song

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
People, people, people, people
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
People, people, people, people

Beautiful people can be defined by
Her hair, her eyes, her body
Beautiful people
Beauty is behind the surface
It is the soul, the spirit
That lies beneath the soul, the skin
It is the power of that beauty that holds us
That strengthens us
It is the way we dance when we wanna cry
It is our mind that creates the definition of the beauty
Clear your mind, clear your body
Reach for the strength within
We are all beautiful people

All my beautiful people, all my beautiful people
I'm the ghetto apostle, come on, follow I'll lead you
Tell them put down the pipes, liquor bottles and needles

Popping your collar pimping and this ain't nothin' 'bout stuntin'

Bullshit, I'm the pope, I think I am onto something
I wanna empower people, wanna empower people

He screamed ""lazy""

Tried to get a job

They would dance and sweat they perm out
If they scream we got beef, he would handle with no prob
Cologne and liquor was his odor
Fragrance, of a ridin' soldier
ODB was his persona, he was high on Mars

When grandma die from pneumonia

I'm the reason why your homies ain't deep
Now you wanna talk about peace
Get the bitches all up off these streets
Wonder why you rubbin' up feet
If you got high off what I sold
How his teeth platinum when he on shit row
Big belly bottle, I could still get throwed
Leave a nigga flat 'til his body get towed

Leave him with a hole in his skull

My love for your music is bittersweet every time that I hear it
Your great-sounding art helped build my walls
And pushes me away so I won't fall
I'm thinking in my head ""shit, oh my lord""
She texted me last night with all my faults
Downloaded your mixtape, it sound so good
But why you gotta say things that make me sound so small?
You talking 'bout your experience with other women
How you think that be looking?
My daddy and whole family hearing
Where's the respect? I don't feel it
And if you lose me, would you fear it?
Would you take back the silly acts that you was sharing?
About how you deceived and cheated with no caring
The honesty in music is fucking overbearing
I feel you, babe, I understand where you coming from
Just hear me out, just understand where I'm coming from
I'm not dumb, I know what I write
I don't wanna hurt you and I hate to fight
I'm conscious of everything I recite
Clench the soul through fingertips when I write
I don't really know if it's wrong or right
I feel like God put me here to shed the light

But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

My open letter to my girl who got my back
Who's affected by the real shit in my raps
What's that name of the song, the Jay-Z track?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
Still tryna figure my place in this world
Ain't mean to hurt the heart of my beautiful girl
See, I talk about the real so my niggas'll learn
Try give 'em motivation so my niggas'll earn
So I talk about how I shine and fuck on dimes
Rolling in the Maybachs, seats reclined
I know it sounds kinda harsh when I speak 'bout mine
And you'll be crying in the dark and wanna leave sometime
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

But I don't ever wanna let you go

He would dance, work out and fight your ass at the park
(For the bills, for the hundred dollar bills)
And he got two sisters preggo
He fucked the other one to get one jel-o
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
(On the hill, shit to get really rich)

He used to have the braids with the cuts in his body
Most stucked out, kept the hammer with his mommy
Grandma had the arthritis pain in her body
Kept the burner in the mattress, so her son don’t catch a body
Gassed and he danced, smoked crack with his posse
Front flipped through a building window, land in the lobby
He was cut like Bruce Lee but he didn't know karate
He came home bloody screaming ""nobody can stop me""
Nobody can stop me, I'm the baddest survivor on this planet
Fifty niggas better kill me, nigga cause I will do damage
Checked out the psych ward, I am nothing to manage
My life cut deep, nigga I'm nothing to bandage

With the brown paper bags for the ounces

When he got kicked out of his bitch crib
And he had nowhere to lizz-ive
Always find his ass on the benches laying at the park
After dark

Don't get it confused Uncle Psych, I love you to death
Just wanna get a couple of things off of my chest
Growing up you always was buck-wilding with stress
And though I'm older now, I don't know how to forget
I used to wear your Timbs around the house when you left
And if you had an open soda, I would finish the rest
Pretend I'm older, I like the liquor odor you left
Then put your camouflage vest on like I'm holding a tec
Then point it at the mirror like I'm holding your rep
Though that mirror wasn't me, but it was you I reflect
Wanted to be like you, jail tat on the chest

Life's so hard
R.I.P. Grandma
These cops play different
Every corner got a camera
I swear the game got a cancer
These lil niggas bust a hammer
With bitch made tendencies
Seize, make 'em wanna give they man up
Ain't about gang bangers or color bandannas
Or holding your fist up and repping The Panthers
See Willie still Lynching they want us to hang us
Game is still pimping adapted the changes
I'll take your 360, work off your anus
Shit on these niggas, like you constipated
See that's what I did
And Momma I made it
But I'm gone out my mind
And my point is vacated
I can't take this world
Ain't got the patience
Years of oppression, I'm feeling violated
And that's why my niggas be highly sedated
Addicted to money and driving new Ranges
Gone off the lean, want to stay faded
They can't even drink because their life is so jaded
I want to be clean but the world is so tainted
Ain't it?

Ain't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Come and take a sip with me, take a sip with me

Once again mister back selling crack
It's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map
Street raps, new face, sampled with no craze
Doubting myself cause I don't think the world can relate
To my surprise everyone does, so have faith
Half of the other side don't live it they push play
The young illest alive, Harlem world to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
Cause last year it was shoe box and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hits
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's 20 years of memory
And that's assuming I'mma live that long
If I don't, don't cry cause I ain't live that wrong
Just an artist in a purest form, I live that song
An artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino

I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'ma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it

Ain't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Come and take a sip with me, take a sip with me

Why fuss? I'd rather fuck
Treat her like my enemy, I just wanna bust
7 deuce, waiting on the bus
Before the boys bend the corner, tryna make a bust
Tryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks
Purple and the green got me on stuck
So I 2 step, move my foot and keep it pushing
Always bouncing back, got it keep the cushion
And that's something fat, like eating all the pudding
ASAP we got it slap, bruh good looking
Fuck that, ASAP where I come from
456, Ice City slums
Weed in my pocket, coke in his tongues
Buying swisher sweets, no more honey buns
Fresh white tee, bright like the sun
Only nigga round here rocking Мишка

Cause that purp shit I sip up, yo bitch chose, you slipped up
I get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up
Top of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind
We runnin', runnin', we gunnin', gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe, a weirdo but I'm real though

All these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em
Not a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em
Going broke is not an option, always on that cash flow
She used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low
Fuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke
ASAP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow
I slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up
That's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch
I'm headed to the future, Twelvy ain't no loser
Mixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster
I'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up
I lucked up, I see it as a come up
I'm on my job man, I see you when the suns up
Huh, young niggas run everything
ASAP to the top and these bitches love everything

God bless America, my flow is scarier
Style wild like my nigga Common after Erykah
Your bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good
Make a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her
But I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit
I be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?
Hoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard
East coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise
I know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers
Fashion killa word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya
Still sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in
Get your chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in
New York nasty flow that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen
Business man, middle finger to your fucking business, man
Great adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this
Motion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do

Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang

Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard

When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm mmm,"" let's play ball
In a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold, I rhyme cold
My K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9 drone that banana clip,
Straight from the rip, I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit

Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga

Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this, ""Ho, I'm the meanest""
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, on shit, no off switch

The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham (Big KRIT, shawty)

Spit like my last breath, casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes and cherish your wins
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, ‘86er, nigga, that’s my born year
Get the fuck from ‘round here, that’s just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma’s titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin’ hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won’t have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can’t you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past fuck your Louis flag,
Popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist","[Bad Idea, Cheeky Monkey, Five in the Morning, No1, Turn It Up, Number One, Ouch, Don't Be Punks, Down on the Floor, Getting Around, Jason's Addiction, Miles Away, Summer on the Underground, Warning, A, If It Ain't Broke, Fix It Anyway, Monkey Kong, Old Folks, Over It, 6 O'Clock on a Tube Stop, Champions of Endings [*], The Distance, Going Down, Hi-Fi Serious, Nothing, Nothing [CD-ROM Video][*], Pacific Ocean Blue, Shut Yer Face, Something's Going On, The Springs, Starbucks, Took It Away, W.D.Y.C.A.I., Everybody In, Getting Me Off, Better off with Him [Sampler Version], I Wonder [B Side], Wisdom, 2nd Coming, Afterburner, Better off with Him, Black Hole, Hey, Rush Song, Wake Up, Worst Thing That Can Happen, Human Condition, Sleeping, Take Your Time, A Minha Menina, No Trophy, Sunshine, Sweet Like a Champion, This Town, Chicken Payback, Go Karts, Horsemen, Hourglass, I Love You, No Atmosphere, One Glass of Water, The Start, These Are the Ghosts, This Is the Land, Wash in the Rain, End of the Street, The Bee's, Got to Let Go, The Bee's, Left Foot Stepdown, The Bee's, Listening Man, The Bee's, Stand, The Bee's, A Band of Bitches, Guerra Nuclear, Mambo en Trompeta Para Ti, No Money, No Fame, Noreste Caliente, Track 3.I4, Take My Hand, The Time, The Bluest Eyes in Texas, Elephant, Rock 'N' Roll Ghost, Silent Night, Walking the Cow, Bear on the Beach, Chinatown, The Crowning, Golden Teeth and Silver Medals, Here Are Many Wild Animals, I Signed the Line, It's Not Easy to Be Human, Love Has Left the Room, My America, Stronger Than Jesus, The Weed Had Got There First, Can't Buy Me Love, ...]"

Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals

Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants, bitch it’s Hammer Time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized

Ricky had a deuce-deuce two shotti pumps with a baby nine

Bone thugs had more thugs but that was the shit that made me rhyme
Whats up, what's on your mind? Hol' up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thuggin' like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the practice kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fist fights
And French fries and shootouts like one cig' with two rounds
And one clip left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one missed, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass

I’m so thuggish ruggish bringin’ ruckus, knuckin’ if you buckin’
Young and thuggin’, buggin’ showing out in public, but you love it

I only got one vision, that’s for kids in every color, religion
That listen, that you gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all got children and siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

Back once again
Chilling in the back of the ‘Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I’ll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the ‘Lac when I spin
Then it’s back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn'
And a crap when I tap that that then attack
Never tax, never that that, max on the ends
Spend ends, I remember way back when
A motherfucker used to have to borrow cash from my friends, friends
Just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I’m on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me, them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what’s up to me, from ugly to comfortably, suddenly

It all changed man
It was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly
And now I’m comfortable
I just only can thank God
Suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes

'Cause I dunno how long I can hold my heart in two

A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andre
Beef is on my entre, gin and juice that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, fitness on a Monday
My new crib came with Feng Shui
And my closet is like a runway
Come be fiancée, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge
Just a sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie ass bitch made wait to fuck for two days
Finally go the two day, swear to god my mood change
Top off like toupes, drop off, touche
Yeah my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tellem holla at a nigga G
Riding on my enemies, this my Ghetto Symphony

Whippin' Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle
She know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official
Now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive
Forget it, war ready, already tested
Tears and blood invested
Till my cardiacs arrested and my 40 oz is empty
Show me watcha owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down the lonely mile phony smile, was
Police on me now, still touring
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in it's purest form
Don't complain I came to reign
From here forward, still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning grains in my air force
And all I can see is clear ports

Since Rocky spit like Andre I'm gonna kill em' like Big Boi
These rappers is all my entrée
Eat em' like cookies, chips ahoy
Eat, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that I’d kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Prolly get found by a lil' fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenegger, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a Roy
Smoke what make a nigga trip collide
What took me how fast, you could grip a 9
Damn, look at how that hollow tip hit his spine
And the motherfuckers come in to cry
You niggas have a sour dipped in wine
Guess that’s why the ground sip the wine
Pourin' liq so I soak in different shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul get cold, all my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath choose souls you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies

Know what happens every time you speed

I hustle every day in life thinkin' back
Takin' packs up the block them older niggas said I couldn't hustle
Man fuck 'em niggas, I'll be back, strapped back pack
Bitch I'm flipping work, hand in hand, I think they call it trappin'
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there tryin' to knock the hustle
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin'
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red broaches on the cuff
On my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, ands or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spend on Goyard
Used it once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, real as a gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housing
Wildin' 'til they throw me in 'em cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartier's
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say Uhh
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're speakin' to the script
My life is like a movie, they should film me through it
Take a pic, then show the frame and shit, forever me, was always G

Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, taking me in zoom and bust my shit, my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now to sum up my performances, just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck Jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favourite rapper's corpses couldn't match up my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements

Where the darks and the light skin kids
Get along with the white percents

On a righteous pass, where you don't look back
Nigga spark your cig, niggas light your hash
Niggas light your spliff, where you puff, don't pass, just sit

So tell me now does it hurt, or is it too late?
I'm a man of my law, I gotta keep my weight up
But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say it never happened
I mean I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing
Left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like ""Flacko where your ass been?""
Heard you done with fashion, now yo ass is acting
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in Venice, Tommy and some mean Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture
Changed Hip-Hop on ya, smoking like a rasta was my pops culture
I be damned if I die sober
I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all

Let em see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Beamers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
Cause I be playing with these womens like they're sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, ""I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden""
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher, grab your lighter fluid
Might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how he do it
Sit back and watch me do it

But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

Okay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rapping bars it get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap with fashion four way, yeah I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ay just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away one day just like some love birds
Only one word I'm afraid of is the ""love"" word

More power to you, more power to you my lovely one
What's up bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who needs friends
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Man remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ay bitch you missed out, hashtag #Fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male

I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' but they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick what? Pimps up, hoes down
Woah now, slow down
See they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him

Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, mother fuck cops, what a blood clarts
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, bug shots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry

My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places, like apartments, basements
Garbage vacant, lots, garages, spaces, Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Mason Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my eye and lung 'til later die at 71

I lay down now
This someone's journey in the streets who gotta keep a, peace, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs who bang and never stood a chance
Some boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement
And my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the high in me
Used to never give a damn now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me, it's gotta be
A whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I've given

Gettin' money is what I do

I remember all the nights on different corners spittin' pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sisters daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Whore without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines, 'bout the section lines, I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that

Gettin' money is what I do, thought you knew
Gettin' money is what I do

Candy low slider, I'm a sole survivor
Keep a suite in my riser, bitch I'm keepin' it liver
Did not envy Joe, I thank fans, talk slow
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Gettin' me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on a cock, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck bout how you feel

Gettin' money is what I do, thought you knew
Gettin' money is what I do

I'm the best still in this game, I'm rich bitch like Rick James
Gotta group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne
The Louis store I drop bands, the Gucci store I drop bands
Prada store I went ham, my left wrist it cost a lamb
Your girlfriend a groupie like Trident she wanna chew me
Hell naw I ain't cuffin' 'em I'm a dog just like Snoopy
And when I leave the mall it's sold out, erryday shoppin'
Taylor gang, blowin' money, 50,000 on wrist watches
100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags
Bitch I came from hell and nothin', damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag
All I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag

Gettin' money is what I do, thought you knew
Gettin' money is what I do

Get money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' break ups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen inshallah
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together

I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.","[Bad Idea, Cheeky Monkey, Five in the Morning, No1, Turn It Up, Number One, Ouch, Don't Be Punks, Down on the Floor, Getting Around, Jason's Addiction, Miles Away, Summer on the Underground, Warning, A, If It Ain't Broke, Fix It Anyway, Monkey Kong, Old Folks, Over It, 6 O'Clock on a Tube Stop, Champions of Endings [*], The Distance, Going Down, Hi-Fi Serious, Nothing, Nothing [CD-ROM Video][*], Pacific Ocean Blue, Shut Yer Face, Something's Going On, The Springs, Starbucks, Took It Away, W.D.Y.C.A.I., Everybody In, Getting Me Off, Better off with Him [Sampler Version], I Wonder [B Side], Wisdom, 2nd Coming, Afterburner, Better off with Him, Black Hole, Hey, Rush Song, Wake Up, Worst Thing That Can Happen, Human Condition, Sleeping, Take Your Time, A Minha Menina, No Trophy, Sunshine, Sweet Like a Champion, This Town, Chicken Payback, Go Karts, Horsemen, Hourglass, I Love You, No Atmosphere, One Glass of Water, The Start, These Are the Ghosts, This Is the Land, Wash in the Rain, End of the Street, The Bee's, Got to Let Go, The Bee's, Left Foot Stepdown, The Bee's, Listening Man, The Bee's, Stand, The Bee's, A Band of Bitches, Guerra Nuclear, Mambo en Trompeta Para Ti, No Money, No Fame, Noreste Caliente, Track 3.I4, Take My Hand, The Time, The Bluest Eyes in Texas, Elephant, Rock 'N' Roll Ghost, Silent Night, Walking the Cow, Bear on the Beach, Chinatown, The Crowning, Golden Teeth and Silver Medals, Here Are Many Wild Animals, I Signed the Line, It's Not Easy to Be Human, Love Has Left the Room, My America, Stronger Than Jesus, The Weed Had Got There First, Can't Buy Me Love, ...]"

The feeling right, the Paris night
Did it's best to please us
And strolling down the Elysee
We had a drink in each cafe
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy and I
Smiled like Mona Lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

And now you're working in a bank
The family man, the football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Are you the hero of my dreams

I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all

Where ever you go
I´ll be around

Wondering where I might be
I´ll be waiting just around the corner of your eye

Everything you´re wishing for,

The rainbows end
Let me know and I´ll come true
I will give my all to you
But don´t let anybody take
Your dream away

In a key that unlocks every door

That's what it's all about 

Half past twelve
We're sneaking out the back door
Who said, we couldn't stay out long
Till the lights go out
We're gonna show what its all about
We're gonna take it to the top
Never gonna stop
'Cause we might, do it till we like
Spread the word around
When the drum rolls, time to get down

[Chorus]

Oh yeah
There's nothing that can stop us now
I swear we'll always be around

If you say, that it's okay
We gotta start right now

In the still of the night
I can almost feel you lying next to me
Like it used to be

And its hard to let go
When there's always something there reminding me
How things could be
I've tried to get you off my mind
I've tried to play my part

But every time I close my eyes
You're still inside my heart
Why can't I laugh?
Why must I cry?

Every time we say good-bye
Why does it rain
Here in my heart
Everyday that we're apart

Why can't it be
Just you and me,
What will it take to make you see
These are the words

To my Heartbreak Lullaby
Like the stars in the sky
You still keep on shining down you're light on me
But out of reach

And I know that in time
You will come back to your senses 
See the signs
And change your mind

I try to look the other way
And keep my heart on hold,
But every time I'm close to you
I lose my self-control

Why can't I laugh?
Why must I cry?
Every time we say good-bye
Why does it rain

Here in my heart 
Everyday that we're apart
Why can't it be
Just you and me

What will it take to make you see
These are the words
To my Heartbreak Lullaby
Why can't I laugh?

Why must i cry?
Give me just one good reason why
Why does it rain
Here in my heart

Everyday that we're apart
Why can't it be
Just you and me
What will it take to make you see

These are the words

All change -- don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue
It's Iceland -- or the Philippines -- or Hastings -- or -- or this place!

When your head's down over your pieces, brother

To be looking at the board, not looking at the city

Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town --
Tea, girls, warm and sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite

Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble

To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha
And thank God I'm only watching the game -- controlling it --
I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you

Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched, then your smile turned to a blush
I had to get to know your name
Then I got your number
Seventeen and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know 'cause there's things I got to show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you
Now your acting all shy, hm I wonder why
Every time I look at you, you turn and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me loosing my mind
With your zodiac sign, my perfect match in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash
Now it's all about us 'cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away

I can't get you out of my mind
I'd be lying,
If I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi, met eues when you passed me
Been inside of my head all day
What can I say?
All I can do is reminisce like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
And all that good stuff
Calling you bluff, now look at us
Just met and already talkin' 'bout trust
All the things we did
How we planned to live
How you got rid of that kid, who use to call you crib
Shut it down
Now look what you found state of dawn
You da bomb, plus you got props from my mom

I'm glad I made my move
I'm glad I stepped to you
Enough respect that my whole crew excepted you
Even my ex called you
She wasn't insecure
Feeling she got a little hurt but was being mature
Gave her blessing
She learned a valuable lesson
Now she's my best friend
Don't even stress, 'cause all I see is you and me
Like Latifah you're queen lets bring some unity
Ain't no reason to fight, We're always keeping it tight
Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike
Always on my mind with your Gucci design
Feel free to drop a line, yeah that would suit me fine
It's all about you boo, and all the things you do
Making dreams come true, buying rings for two
Now it's all about us 'cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Yo we from Hempstead as close to the shacks as Parkside

[Chorus]
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style and we be rippin shit
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style

Welcome to the PSG I represent
The littlest in the crew but first one to get up in em
I straight up skin em like wolves 
I wish you would have been 

Fakin' jack and get ya whole hood hit
But it's all good 
We do the things y'all wish y'all could
And play the bat yo and watch the brothas bark like wood

So knock on it
Go head you want it
Nobody want it 
You turned in for it pulled nine stingers like a brown hornet

While y'all was droppin' I was underground shadow boxin'
Layin' low puttin' final touches on the flow
So here we go, tryin' to snatch that dough
Got niggas breakin' camp like Dre from Death Row

From the streets to the jail, I represent well
Touch a nigga like brail, jacks are hotter than the third rail
Scale to tip in my favor, the livest save 
Grade up in the U.S. now let?s get this paper

[Chorus]

I'm yawnin' while I wake up to the early morning gun-fire
Another day another scar to acquire
Jumped out my bed tried to break my alarm
Took a shower and then I strapped on my firearm

Grab my Pelle Pelle 'cause I want to look fly when I die
But it ain't my turn to say goodbye
How do I know? Some people call it instincts
I like to call it my luck who gives a fuck

I'm stuck, in this environment can't depart from it
And if I try I always end up back where I started 
Plan A square one there's no escapin'
So I pun and realize my too

I'm tryin' to live a full life before my time is through
Clock's tickin', so I don't got no time for you
As I head outside amongst the rest of the animals
Where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand it

(To all my kiko's)
It's sort of like a family brawl
We gather up all the soldiers and form into a invincible
Swarm of kids, now it's on again

Drinkin' straight from the bottle warm gin drippin' down my chin
For the crippled children you can't win 
Against 25 niggas bent up with mac-10's
Semi-automatic, fully addicted crime addict

So long as there's cash involved I gotta have it
There's many different levels of the criminal mind
Either you're in it for the gusto or I'm wastin' your time

[Chorus]

Now is you ready for men, 'cause they your peeps that you saw
You probably heard about me and my crew doin' what we do
For my nigga True and Smif-n-Wessun
'Cause I be wreckin' mic-checkin' fools that come around second-guessin'

I sparks in the dark like stars in the sky
Spiritually, lyrically, since knee-high
The cradle, I represent my peoples and my label
'Cause when you take a ride through Parkside it's fatal

What's my time to shine my design you can't define
It only takes a line and a rhyme to blow that mind 
To have you buggin', niggas got they tapes dubbin
Where ain't no line for me to kick a rhyme pushin' and shovin'

Now it's over, walkin' like a soldier I told ya
Shorty droppin' bombs and shit, like Oklahoma
Kinda soul, comin' wit that bomb for sure 
Run for shelter little brotha when it rain it pour

[Chorus] 

First of all the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The cream'll have you shittin' on your people
Livin like lotto, everything is everything

Ain't nothing change but the clothes that my money bring
I'm makin' figures that I never thought possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army in techses

And them Acuras that made you get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been tryin' to blow for years
Gettin' bent off Moet spend a G on beers
Livin' life to the fullest, my story ends wit a bullet

To the chrome-oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you're lookin, you can find me risin' to the top
I'm a classic approach my level and get your ass kicked

Floatin' in a river wit yo body rapped in plastic
I'm tryin' to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky

While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real

Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at 
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen 
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

[Chorus: 2X]

Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something

[Chorus: 2X]

Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep 
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

I'm the true son
What you wanna do son
Yo this a story about me and my first love nah mean?
Yeah son hit it off

We hooked up at a party it been then ever since
When I first stepped to her I was nervous and tense 
Didn't know was bout to kick, I went freestyle
Straight off the top, with suckas on the side just clocked
She musta liked my flow, 'cause after that we got close
Spending long weekends freakin' up and down the east coast
We got intimate, deep as the pacific
The chemistry was meant to be so then we ran without the ministry
Up in this industry tryin' to get this platinum
Many rappers tried to tap her, it wasn't happenin'
I watched her from afar, starin' at her like a fan
And now I got her in the palm of my right hand
Forever, as long as we can stick together
I guarantee you we blow up, 'cause with 'em I'm a trend setter
We signed a contract said yo, its me and you
Meet you at the top of the charts, where the skys blue

Yo yo yo God bless a child that can hold his own
Its just me, myself and my microphone
Yo you gotta stick with it dun you cant leave it alone
Its just me, myself and my microphone
No matter where you plug it on the road or at home yo
Its just me, myself and my microphone
Yo God bless a child that can hold his own

My girl cant understand all this time we spend together
I tried to tell her
Its strictly business, she said she had a witness
Who saw us comin' out the hotel
Nosy people always gotta run and go tell
But it was just a tour date I had to do a show
So next time tell your friend to talk what she know
I wouldn't trade this shit for the world
In fact you better check yourself, 'cause I can always find another girl
The microphone is my first love my true companion
When I rap into it people think that I'm romancin'
I'm havin' visions, I'm foldin' it tight
Just me and you a phat track'll lead the spotlight

Right

We been through the ruckus together
Handle that beef
MCs got damaged in cyphers on they own streets
So ladi dadi, forget a shotty
I put a hole in your body with my lyrics when I rock it uh

[Chorus]

I hit her in the back of a club and no one showed her love
In fact it was a seminar you know how some women are
Takin' up my time, I tried to stay committed
Kedar and the Smith brothers made me stick with it
Now we politicin', on a mission tryin' to make decisions
To keep her on the cut and work just like a circumcision
Static in our relationship, its all distorted
The lines of communication, they got shorted
I cant ignore it, you know I couldn't afford it
To have this world tour planned for us abort it
Now I'm on some shit, rollin' with my clique
The mic is my companion that's all and that's it baby

[Chorus]

If I go on my way without you
Whoa where would I go
If I go on my way without you 
Whoa where would I go

I'm having flashbacks
Let me relax my dome
My whole joint's blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva'
Ties will never sever
You died tryin' to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin' in peace don't even stress that beef
Go 'head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
every time I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
it's all over bearing witness like jehovah
ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his body's underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue

[Chorus: x2]

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table blaow
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin', not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin' Sega
And buggin' on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin' on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
He used to talk about the box in the closet 
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin' just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, it's ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin' with that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin' in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin'

[Chorus: x2]

Aye yo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin'' nearer 
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes it's gettin' clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brother's bad scratch 
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin' no crap
Another rug rat, somebody tell me where the love's at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

Jump in my whip
Feeling right
Pick my man up from off of the strip
We take flight
What the dilly fella
ain't nothing really
Getting money
Before we hit up top
Let's hit the spot and cop a twenty
Hit the southern states
So we can bounce
Regulate
Throw a tape in
Join this new joke
Smoke escaping
Windows tinted
They coming down cars on my horn
It's my mom on the other end singing a song
When the clock ain't a ?
You at a spot to perform
Kid I'm down with getting paper
Pulling capers like storm
No doubt
Hang up the phone and continue to murk
Ghetto star in the game put a name on my shirt
Got this one chick on the ? I stop to see
Runs with a team of chicks living 1-6-3
They be buying it playing space PlayStation and all
I thought I heard the cops saying I'm going to give them a call
Get some juice play some hard
Yo I'm spinning my yards
Get my lines lined up
Smell good for the guards
Get my shine
Shine my baby
Then I'm making my flash
Lay my hand on shorty rest until it's time to make cash
Call her up on her cell
What's the deal on your half
I'm just ? up for chickens
I just got out the bath
I'm around the corner baby
Is there something you need
Just bring yourself now say no more

[Chorus: x2]
We do this all night
Got fellas spending money shorties looking right
Either twist the cap or pop a cork
This is how we getting down up top New York

We on the couch chilling
Everybody getting right
Complimenting shorty
Spandex fitting tight
Press the power down
Grab the sticks
Hit us on
Cause I'm sick of hearing my man singing that same song
Yo I'm going to bring it to you live
Mad 98
I'm going to get up in that ass
Shorty fix me a plate
Fried chicken French fries cold pepsi with ice
A minute left and I ? night
My only shorty
You wouldn't believe it with a bun in her hair
Said she want to hit the cut
That's music to my ears
Hit the bedroom
Shorty smelling like perfume
Grabbed the condom out my pocket because it's on I assumed
Seen her face blown out
Time to lay down my law
Lights down
Music on
Perfect time to score
Victoria secret's ?
You know how I'm feeling
When you laid up with a shorty getting money and chilling
Got a show in an hour
So I jump in the shower
My man napping
He know that we got to make it happen
He in the zone caught in the mix
Oh damn
Can't be mad at situations that me and my man dig
Well it's your luck shorty
Go wake his ass up
Got a move to make can't afford to pass up
So go tell your to go
Tell my man let's roll
It's all said and done
Jump in my whip
Take flight
As I switch lanes
Throw on my signal light
Fake rappers get they ass ate up

[Chorus: x2]

Smoke everyday
Yelling my name
I rip a show
Peep shorty and her friends assing out in the front row
Spilling mo'
Grabbing my jeans
Yelling my name
I'm used to it now guess it's all part of the game
Let me explain how I grab the mic
Move and finesse
Shorty in the blue dress
Body screaming caress
Took her to the rest
Lay her body down on my nest
It's deep in the this game
Why she got my name on her chest

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me

A little pimp like me will crawl underneath
It takes a lot more than word to move me
I don't give a P-H-you-K what you say
Actin all wild, unprofession-al
Who got beef, I knock teeth out ya smile
My lyrical lubricant keeps the crowd movin
You get booed when your stage show needs improvment
So if you want to see A+ the artist
You gotta Western Union me a key grand deposit
While that cats out there steady kickin garbage
Girls steady sayin, look I can see who the God is
You can't harm me or stop me
even on a poor quality bootleg cassette copy

Real friends never fall in love

Nevertheless I get an occasional crush
Say some romantic stuff to make you want to blush
Girls in all flavors, no matter what they race is
Rhymes amazin, makin Craig Mack faces

Take my time, don't want to catch no rape cases
Kiss her on the forehead and say goodnight

Yo it's the A-P-L-you, let me tell you
I'm sicker than any nigga that been admitted to Bel View
The rhymes I was born through a pen and my strongest strength
My pen is like a weapon when I hold it at arms length
With Kedar's consent I represent over tracks with Clark Kent
With some super vision from Superman
I get stupid man, you open off the verbal aerobics
I was in the Parkside state of mind when I wrote it
I'm the dopest, when it comes to this one
I'm invisible to ya third eye, you need a fourth or a fifth one
Maybe even a sixth one
Keep the Big Anther on the big gun for pin point accuracy to hit one
Never miss, the professional specialist remember this
The name A-plus it's anonymous with excellence
Don't forget that, before I have to get the click-clack
Give you a wetback believe me it'll be a major set back

Just to get you I take some steroids turn into a werewolf
Jump in the ring and bite your god damn ear off
If the combat is hand to hand I bang em' in
Going bannanas man like a angry orangutan
Double my rhymes walk back to the talk fast
And manufacture the data
Here on after for all rappers
For character, you can smash with the speed of the comic book character
Flash Gordan with verbal phonics spectacular
Hear you in the back of the audio screamin' like you want to enter this

Come on bring it on and prepare to get manslaughtered
With deadly force
And my style is causing nausea like the scorpion poison

There isn't anyone under twenty-one that could rock me
You feelin' this, forty-eight track ventriloquist
The actual synthesis passin' out the class syllabus
Just imagine if I rip your crew into fragments
Destroy the evidence so nobody will know it happened
Walking through the neighborhood full of dead men doing head-spins
Pickin' em' up like red-mans
Lyrically modified to kick the hottest rhyme
At the drop of a dime I limbo below the bottom line
Kick it tight, rhymes sent Method Man to another lifetime
Keep Erykah all to myself 'cause' I like dimes
Radiation from the bright shine meltin' MC's with height-lines
'cause' I'm very selfish with my mic time
When I recite mine, my rhymes explode likd a pipe bomb
Nobody in they right or they left mind can test mine

Almost slowly

How can you say

You see things in the depths of my eyes
That may love's run dry
No

We leave to their goodbyes
I've come to depend on the look in their eyes
My blood's sweet for pain
The wind and the rain bring back words of a song 
And they say: wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye

Wave goodbye

I don't want to fall again
Don't want to look this pain
Don't want another friend
Don't want to try again
Don't want to see you hurt
Don't let me see you hurt
I don't want to cry again
