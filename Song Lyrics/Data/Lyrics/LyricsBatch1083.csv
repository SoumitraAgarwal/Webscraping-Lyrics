Pedro the Lion,"If at first you don't succeed
Try, try again
If I were you I'd give up
The path is too narrow
The way is too steep

Save your applause
For the end of the show

Count it a blessing 
That you're such a failure
Your second chance might
Never have come",Winners Never Quit
Pedro the Lion,"Ultra-violet rays wash over
All the boys and girls
As their moms lay tanning by the pool
Oh, look, their dad's arriving home
All the children hug his neck
Unaware of their inheritance

All the experts say you ought to start them young
That way they'll naturally love the taste of corporate cum

God bless the Indian summer
God bless the Indian summer
God bless the Indian summer

Don't you just love the sun
Doesn't it make you feel good all over

It's my pleasure to announce
In conjunction with the fed
And my recent popularity

Thanks in part to mother nature
It will never rain again
It should do wonders for the GNP

If you're just joining us now
You've missed a brilliant speech
We go now live to the streets
To find out what the voters think
He's worked a miracle
I just now bought a brand new car

God bless the Indian summer",Indian Summer
Pedro the Lion,"This line is metaphysical
And on the one side
And on the one side
The bad half live in wickedness
And on the other side
And on the other side
The good half live in arrogance
And there's a steep slope
With a short rope
This line is metaphysical
And there's a steady flow
Moving to and fro

Oh look you earned your wings
Are you an angel now
Or a vulture?
Constantly hovering over
Waiting for a big mistake

Oh my God, what have I done?

Wouldn't you love to be
On the cover of a magazine?
Healthy skin and perfect teeth
Designed to hide what lies beneath

And I feel the darkness growing stronger
As you cram light down my throat
And how does that work out for you
In your holy quest to be above reproach?

Wouldn't you love to be
On the cover of a magazine?
Healthy skin and perfect teeth
Designed to hide what lies beneath
What lies beneath",Magazine
Pedro the Lion,"We were walking, holding hands
With our bare feet in the sand
And the seagulls overhead
When I broke the spell and said

""I could never divorce you
Without a good reason
And though I may never have to
It's good to have options""

But for now, I need you
But for now, I need you
But for now, I need you

But it was only in my head
Because no one ever says
What they really mean to say
When there's so much at stake

So I told her I loved her
And she told me she loved me
And I mostly believed her
And she mostly believed me",Options
Pedro the Lion,"Have you ever seen and idealist 
With gray hairs on his head
Or successful men that keep in touch 
With unsuccessful friends
You only think you did
I could have sworn I saw it too
But as it turns out
It was just a clever ad for cigarettes

'Cause if it isn't making dollars
Then it isn't making sense
If you aren't moving units
Then you're not worth the expense
If you really want to make it
You had best remember this
If it isn't penetration
The it isn't worth the kiss

We're so sorry sir
But you did not quite make 
The cut this time
And we'd appreciate it if you 
Cleared you stuff on out by five
Don't take it personal
Everyone knows you did your best
If it makes it easier
You should look at it 
From our perspective

'Cause if it isn't making dollars
Then it isn't making sense
If you aren't moving units
Then you're not worth the expense
If you really want to make it
You had best remember this
If it isn't penetration
Then it isn't worth the kiss",Penetration
Pedro the Lion,"Paramedics brave and strong 
Up before the break of dawn 
Putting poker faces on 
Broken bodies all day long 

The neighbors heard a fight 
Someone had a knife 
It must have have been the wife 
Husband's lost a lot of blood 
He wakes up screaming 
""Oh my God, am I gonna die? 
Am I gonna die?"" 
As they strapped his arms down to his sides 
At times like these they'd been taught to lie 
""Buddy just calm down, you'll be alright."" 

Several friends came to his grave 
His children were so well-behaved 
As the priest got up to speak 
The assembly craved relief 
But he himself had given up 
So instead he offered them this bitter cup 
""You're gonna die, we're all gonna die 
Could be twenty years, could be tonight 
Lately I have been wondering why 
We go to so much trouble to postpone the unavoidable 
And prolong the pain of being alive""",Priests and Paramedics
Pedro the Lion,"Here we have our dust free dining set
We guarantee it won't collect a spec
Freeing up the children to instead
Grow into your molding
Heed more of your scolding
Go early to their new self-making beds

It seems like you'd be tired of losing face
Like you'd want to put the children in their place
The more you have to tell them to do their chores
The more you run the risk of being ignored

If you're lucky they'll turn out as good as you
You tell them that they're good kids
But you know that it's not true

Your father drank a little
You're on liver number two

Progress has a way of feigning ease
Convenient new inventions bait the tease
For, though it is impossible to cure
A husband bent on cheating
The oxygen's depleting
A child who's always bragging
A wife's persistent nagging
We're equipped to live as though it were

If you're lucky they'll turn out as good as you
You tell them that they're good kids
But you know that it's not true

Your father drank a little
You're on liver number two",Progress
Pedro the Lion,"It's so priceless when you say you have to work late
When we both know you're at a motel
Here's the thing that's so much more depressing
Than the infidelity itself

Darling, you are so unoriginal
Each move more obvious than the one before it

You know I always said that I would kill you
If I ever caught you stepping out
Now I see I did not know the half of
What hatred and revenge were all about

Darling, you are so unoriginal
Each move more obvious than the one before it

And I guess I could be bigger but I'd rather make you pay

Darling, you are so unoriginal
You'll see that I can be so unoriginal just like you",Rehearsal
Pedro the Lion,"Wouldn't it be so wonderful if everything were meaningless
But everything is so meaningful
And most everything turns to shit
Rejoice",Rejoice
Pedro the Lion,"The impact
The aftershave
The European cigarettes

The taxi
The alcohol
That lingers on your breath

The lipstick
The street lamp
The woolen overcoat

The front desk
You tell yourself
It isn't over yet

Second best, oh, second best
I can learn to live with this
Plus, I really need a rest
After all, what's wrong with second best
What's wrong with second best

The motel
The distances
Cave into kisses, cold and wet

Familiar exchanges
Like needle pulling thread

The empty movements that once were so inspired
Desperate attempts to fan the flame without the fire

The mattress creaks beneath
The symphony of misery and cum
Still, we lie jerking back and forth
And blurring into one

Second best, oh, second best
I can learn to live with this
Plus, I really need a rest
After all, what's wrong with second best
What's wrong with second best",Second Best
Pedro the Lion,"Arizona curled up with California 
Then she tried to hide the whole thing from new Mexico 
Who knew before he saw them making out in yuma
That she was loving someone new

But California not California how could you
The bully loved her cactus 
The underdog her pine 
But she would only love one at a time 

New Mexico had always hated California
And though he knew that Arizona wore the pants 
He got loaded then he started throwing punches 
The poor Injun never had a chance 

Scissors cut paper 
Paper covers rock 
Rock crushes scissors 
Scissors break apart",Arizona
Pedro the Lion,"Bands with managers are going places 
Bands with messy hair and smooth white faces 
You don't believe when I say 
It won't be alright 
Vans with fifteen passengers are rolling over 
But I trust t. william walsh
And I'm not afraid to die",Bands With Managers
Pedro the Lion,"Having no idea that his youngest son was dead 
The farmer and his sweet young wife slept soundly in his bed 
In the shadow of the mountain as the cattle hung their heads 
Grazing only feet from where the broken body lay 
And would lay undiscovered for another couple days 

When the farmer would find vultures at their banquet in the hay 
The killer traveled eastbound in a golden brown sedan 
Weighing his most recent deviation from the plan counting down the hours til the sun came up again hired to hit the farmer by the farmer's asshole sun he had not yet decided between poison or a gun 
When suddenly he realized he would not use either one",Discretion
Pedro the Lion,"Deep green hills whose shoulders fade into thick grey 
Tall wet grass whose flesh makes fools of grazing sheep
Whose fleecing makes a fool of me 
Who shall I blame for this sweet and heavy trouble for every stupid struggle I don't know 

I could buy you a drink 
I could tell you all about it 
I could tell you why I doubt it and why I still believe
I can't say it like I sing it 

I can't sing it like I think it
I can't think like I feel it 
And I don't feel a thing 
Why I still believe it 

Why I need it 
And what the pharisees can't see 
We'd have more drinks 
And speak of so many things 
But I don't know you and you don't know me",The Fleecing
Pedro the Lion,"I don't want to believe that all of the above is true
But I could be persuaded if you were to give me proof 
Why don't you come over Thursday maybe we can talk it through 
As if some new information were possible to comprehend or introduce
After all you and I are nothing more than foregone conclusions 

You were to busy steering the conversation toward the lord 
To hear the voice of the spirit begging you to shut the fuck up 
You thought it must be the devil trying to make you go astray 
Besides it could not have been the lord because you don't believe he talks that way 
Too close to call yet still so tightly wound around our foregone conclusions",Foregone Conclusions
Pedro the Lion,"and when his tiny head emerged from hair and folds of skin
i thought to myself if he only knew he would climb right back in
i do
now that my blushing bride has done what she was born to do
it's time to bury dreams and raise a son to live vicariously through
the sperm swims for the egg
the finger for the ring
if i could take one back
i know what it would be",I Do
Pedro the Lion,"You got drunk
Drunker than you'd ever been
You hailed a cab and passed out cold
Before you told the driver where to go
So he drove you around Chicago
You woke up sicker than you'd ever been
You threw up and shit the bed

And there was no one there to clean you up
And the room was spinning all around
Make a fist and take a deep breath
Close your eyes and count to ten
Just keep swinging ‘til you're over it 
The mess you left had got you feeling pretty bad 
But she is a maid I guess that's what she gets paid for",Keep Swinging
Pedro the Lion,"The poison makes its way through my body slowly
Into the pleasure centers of my brain
If you were here I would admit that I'm an asshole
But now it's over and I can't stay sober
Though it isn't like I tried
And on the front porch, or on an airplane on vacation
Or out for dinner in a nearby town
I was so proud just to have you sitting with me
But now it's over and I can't stay sober
Pour and swallow
Follow one shot with another
I'll keep on till you agree to come back over
Or until there are x's on my eyes
My old man always swore that hell would have no flame
Just a front row seat
To watch your true love pack her things and drive away",The Poison
Pedro the Lion,"The plants and the factories are perfectly run
The workers and bosses are living as one
People are equal people are good
People are working as hard as they should be
It's food for my family and clothes for my kids
The class war is over and everyone wins
It's such a simple plan
To take it like a man
But I'm not sure I can
We fought for a decade corruption and greed
It gave me a purpose a reason to breathe
But now that it's over now that we've won
It's back to my bedroom alone with a shot gun
To think of my family no longer compels me
With all things in common they'll manage without me",A Simple Plan
Pedro the Lion,"Engine severs lower legs
Feel my bruised heart beating
Spinal cord remains intact 
Still sending and receiving

Laying back on shoulder blades
Cargo rushing past
Missing limbs beneath the cars
Twitching on the tracks

Click clack now handicapped
North am transcontinental
I remember as I bleed
Certain tales of bravery

A man who's legs were trapped beneath
A fallen evergreen tree
He decided he would chop them off above the knee
To sacrifice his shins and feet to set his torso free

The luxury of having been spared the hard part
You'd think would be enough for me to pull this off
But I'm left to bleed to death
Now all the man I've ever been

North am transcontinental",Transcontinental
Pedro Vargas,"De la sierra morena
Vienen bajando, vienen bajando
Un par de ojitos negros
Cielito lindo de contrabando

Pájaro que abandona
Su primer nido, su primer nido
Regresa y ya no encuentra
Cielito lindo, el bien perdido

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones

Ese lunar que tienes
Cielito lindo, junto a la boca
No se lo des a nadie
Cielito lindo, que a mí me toca

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones

Dicen que no se siente la despedida
Dile a quien te lo cuente, cielito lindo que se despida
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Del ser que adora
Dile que si se siente cielito lindo y hasta se llorar
Ay, ay, ay, ay

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones

Pedro Vargas,"Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tant",Gracias a la Vida
Pedro Vargas,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were",Nuestros Recuerdos (The Way We Are)
Pedro Vargas,"Acaricia mi sueño
El suave murmullo de tu suspirar
Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella quieta mi herida
Todo, todo se olvida

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal

El día que me quieras
Endulzara sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor
Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor

La noche que me quieras",El DĂ­a Que Me Quieras
Pedro Y Pablo,"Catalina tenia la rutina
del eterno crepúsculo en la piel
su comarca de sexo en una esquina
sus hectareas de pecho en un vaiven

Catalina sabia el argumento
de la sabana rota por amor
Me soplaba la letra con su aliento
why nos iba surgiendo esta canción

Labio sobre labio sobre labio
why la peninsula mia
Beso contra beso contra beso
why tu bahia

Cuando se hacen las dos de la mañana
cuando se hacen las cuatro del amor
sus pupilas hamacan porcelanas
en ojeras de rimmel why carbón

Catalina de fuego why nicotina
esperando volver a comenzar,
bocanada profunda que ilumina
a mirada marrón de par en par

Labio sobre labio...

La mirada en el techo de los días,
la ceniza en el suelo del pudor
why su nombre arrugado en una silla,
su apellido tendido en el balcón
Encendé la fogata que combina
mi melena, la tuya why la del sol,
un retrato de fuego, Catalina,
con rutina de lento caracol

Labio sobre labio...",Catalina Bahia
Pedro Y Pablo,"Bronca cuando rien satisfechos

Pedro Yerena,"Eres, una brújula sin rumbo 
Un reloj sin manecillas 
Una biblia sin jesus 
 
Calles, las conoces metro a metro 
Y bajo este pavimento 
Tienes la tumba y la cruz 
 
El frío quemó ya tu altivez 
Tu religión es la indecencia 
Admiro tu alma de hiel 
Para ti el mundo nada cuenta 
 
Oro que engañaste a la que adoro 
Y es aunque sus besos lloro 
Una lampara sin luz 
 
Por que si el hombre empeña 
Su anhelos poniendo a los 
Pies de una mujer su vida, 
Es posible que no haya ni un destello 
Que alumbre ni un poquitito 
Su ilusión perdida
 
Precio que tan caro mi destino paga 
Sabiendo que en mi corre la sangre herida 
Y es el alma que rasga un sentimiento 
Y que canta y que llora, porque esta muy fria 
 
El frío quemó ya tu altivez

Pee Wee,"Ah, ah

Que más me da si se interponen
Nos tendremos que amar
Ocultos tras los rincones
Como 2 camaleones

Dime si no hay otra salida
Si es que tu y yo
Nunca podremos escapar

Si ellos no me dan una alternativa
Yo tendré que actuar
Tenme fe y veras

Puedo fingir como un payaso sin alma
Puedo vagar como un fantasma
Y aunque no pueda acariciar tu espalda
Yo puedo cambiar de color
Puedo ser como un camaleón y no decirles de este amor

Este secreto tan secreto es mi mayor devoción
Pesa más que la luna y quema como el sol
Dime si sientes lo que siento si no merezco tu amor
Dime si aun no es tiempo y callar es mejor

Disimular todo lo que siento por ti
Con miedo de no ser perfecto para ti
Dame una esperanza o si no me convertiré
En un camaleón sin fe

Dime si la luz es muy tenue si al gritar
Ya nadie te puede escuchar
Yo me convertiré en un superhéroe
Y te iré a rescatar tenme fe y veras

Puedo fingir como un payaso sin alma
Puedo vagar como un fantasma
Y aunque no pueda acariciar tu espalda
Yo puedo cambiar de color
Puedo ser como un camaleón y no decirles de este amor

Este secreto tan secreto es mi mayor devoción
Pesa más que la luna y quema como el sol
Dime si sientes lo que siento si no merezco tu amor
Dime si aun no es tiempo y callar es mejor

Pee Wee,"Yo sé que es agonía
Yo he sufrido en carne viva
El dolor de una ilusión perdida
Con el alma vacía

Yo he aguantado en sangre fría
Las sorpresas de la vida
Yo moría hasta que oí
Una voz desde el cielo que decía

Irvine, levántate del suelo
Te ofrezco estos pergaminos
Son 10 and son unos consejos
Pa' que el que este deprimido

Oye todo lo que digan
Piensa and no digas nada
Ríe and respira alegría
No te deprimas por nada

Tienes que alzar la mirada
And no decir mentiras
Vive la vida and camina
Grita cada mañana

Ay que perdonar aquel que te falla
Tú verás que el que la hace la paga
Tú verás camarada, tú verás camarada

Yo rodaba por el suelo
Tan frustrado and sin consuelo
Yo tenía tanto and tanto miedo

De intentar de nuevo
Enterrado bajo hielo
Con ceniza el cenicero

Yo moría hasta que oí
Una voz que gritaba desde el cielo

Pee Wee,"Oh

El amor es tan extraño no lo puedo entender
Porque a veces hace daño pero a veces hace bien
Si lo buscas, el se esconde en algún lugar
Pero él a mi me va a encontrar

Como será, cuando vendrás
Me harás reír, me harás llorar
Cuando te vea el corazón me lo dirá

El amor es una estrella tan difícil de alcanzar
Sin un beso que me pueda hacer volar
Es como un rompecabezas que me cuesta tanto armar
Se que tú tienes la pieza que le falta a mi vida, para amar

Pee Wee Russell,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner
Pee Wee Russell,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over

Last night my heart was so gay

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

A little room where all the roses bloom

Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Miremos las cartas donde dices que me amas 
Guardemos silencio que quede en secreto

Pegasus,"Spending my vacation in the summer sun
Gettin' lots of action and a lots of fun
Scorin' like a bandit 'til the bubble burst
Suddenly it got to be September First

Woe is me
All summer long I was happy and free
Save my soul
The board of education took away my parole

I gotta go back, back, back to school again
You won't find me 'til the clock strikes three
I'm gonna be there 'til then
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
Whoa, whoa, I gotta go, back to school again

Geometry and History is just a pain
Biology and Chemistry destroys my brain
Well, don't they know that I deserve a better fate
I'm really much too young to matriculate

Well, mama please
Your child's come down with a fatal disease
Mama said
""Come on you lazy bum now get your butt out of bed""

You gotta go back, back, back to school again
It's bye, bye fun, get your homework done
You better be in by ten
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
Whoa, whoa, I gotta go, back to school again

I got my books together and I dragged my feet
And then I saw this angel boppin' down the street
I said, ""Hey, pretty baby, hows about a date?""
She said, ""I'm going to school and I can't be late""

Well, I can see
That look in her eyes was sayin' 'Follow me'
And I was caught
I thought of playing hooky but on second thought

I gotta go back, back, back to school again
You won't find me 'til the clock strikes three
I'm gonna be there 'til then

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

The crops ain't gonna fail

A rainbow by the tail
A certain man with eyes that shine
Voodooed up this heart of mine

It seems like
Happiness is just a thing called Joe
He's got a smile that makes the lilacs want to grow
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they see little Joe passing by
Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare
But when he kisses me it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy

Does he love me good?
That's all I need to know

Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe

For there's a bloomin' law agin'

And he took me by the hand,
And he said, ""How's poor old Ireland
And how does she stand?""
""She's the most distressful country
That ever yet was seen;
They're hanging men and women there
For wearing of the green.""

Then since the color we must wear
Is England's cruel red,
Sure Ireland's songs will ne'er forget
The blood that they have shed.
You may take the shamrock from your hat now,
Cast it on the sod,
But 'twill take root and flourish still,
Tho' under foot it's trod.
When the law can stop the blades of green
From growing as they grow,
And when the leaves in summertime
Their verdue dare not show,

You came a long way from St. Louis, you broke a lotta hearts between,

You came here from the middle west, and certainly impressed the population hereabouts.

A feeling I ain't gonna know.

until the clouds roll by a little.

we've got the world and all it's charms.

Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

I am his forever more",My Man
Peggy Lee,"If I knew the way I'd go back home
The countryside has changed so much, I'd surely end up lost
Half-remembered names and faces so far in the past
On the other side of the bridges
That were burned once they were crossed

Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here

Get back home where my childhood dreams and wishes
Still are none of my regrets
Go back to a place where I can figure all the odds
Have a fighting chance to lose the blues
And win my share of bets

Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear

I'm a girl and by me that's only great
I am proud that my silhouette is curvy
that I walk with a sweet and girlish gait
With my hips kind of swivelly and swervey

I adore being dressed in something frilly
When my date comes to get me at my place
Out I go with my Joe or John or Billy
Like a filly who is ready for the race

When I have a brand new hairdo
With my eyelashes all in curls
I float as the clouds on air do
I enjoy being a girl

And my teeth aren't teeth but pearls
I just lap it up like honey

I flip when a fellow sends me flowers
I drool over dresses made of lace
I talk on the telephone for hours
with a pound and a half of cream upon my face

I'm strictly a female female
And my future I hope will be
In the home of a brave and free male
who'll enjoy being a guy, having a girl like me

When men say I'm sweet as candy
As around in a dance we whirl
It goes to my head like brandy
I enjoy being a girl

With someone with eyes that smolder
Says he loves every silken curl
That falls on my ivory shoulder
I enjoy being a girl

When I hear a complementary whistle 
That greets my bikini by the sea
I turn and I glower and I gristle
But I'm happy to know the whistles meant for me

Peggy Lee,"Little boy lost in search of little boy found
You go a wondering, wandering 
Stumbling, tumbling, round! round!
When will you find 
What's on the tip of your mind?
Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit

Sits a ragged tent where there ain't no trees

Pack up the babies and grab the old ladies and everyone goes
Cause everyone knows Brother Love's show
Room gets suddenly still and when you'd almost bet
You could hear yourself sweat he walks in
Eyes black as coal and when he lifts his face
Every ear in the place is on him
Startin' soft and slow like a small earthquake
And when he lets go half the valley shakes

And when your brother is troubled you've gotta
reach out your hand for him 'cause that's what it's there for
And when your heart is troubled you've gotta reach out

Peggy Lee,"Oh the tango is done with a thin black moustache, 
a wide scarlet sash, black boots and a whip
Or the tango is done with seafaring trash, 
callous and brash, fresh off the ship
Or the tango is done as a dangerous dance, 
a treacherous step and if one should trip
The frail body breaks with a snap and a twist, 
And a gold watch slips onto a thick tattooed wrist
And a gray merchant ship turns black in the sun, 
as it heaves to the East when the tango is done.

Butterflies mounted on fields of black velvet
Neatly arranged in gleaming glass trays
One-eyed Etruscans play follow-the-leader
Forever around the edge of the vase

The phonograph's playing an old broken record
A tango and over and over it plays
Over it plays
Over it plays

A medieval tapestry hangs like a warning,
A needlepoint forest of dark green and brown.
The scene is the hunt, you will notice the hunter.
He takes careful aim as your eye travels down,

And finally rests upon the real victim,
Lying quite still in a silk dressing gown.
Lying quite still at the edge of the carpet.
One arm flung out for the peacocks to peck.
Blending in well with the blue and green background
Except for the bright scarlet sash round the neck

He was a collector of beautiful strangers
And life was a party right up to the end
The door always opened to love and loves dangers
Though dead, a lover, a stranger, a friend

Peggy Lee - A Doodlin' Song

Cy Coleman / Carolyn Leigh


Do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo

Do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo

Do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo

Why don't you join the group?

It's better than being a party-poop


Obbligato, pizzicato

Guy Lombardo, it's the craziest

When you noodle with a doodlin' song

Two, three, four

Like it so much, I'll doodle some more


Little softer, Perry Como

Even softer, pianissimo

Say you love me with a doodlin' song

be, see, D

Ooo, what you doodle-de-do to me


Say you love me, really love me

Say you love me true

Say you love me, please believe me

When you do, that makes two who

Go together, bet your boodle

Like the apples in a strudel do

When you noodle with a doodlin' song

What you call a real ball


Do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo

Do do-de-oo do-de-oo, I love you

Do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo


Here we go now, bet your boodle

Like the apples in the strudel do

When we noodle with a doodlin' song


All through, thank you

Peggy Lee,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Peggy Lee,"I remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up
In his arms and raced through the burning building out to the pavement
And I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over I said to myself, is that all there is to a fire?

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And when I was twelve years old, my father took me to a circus, the greatest show on earth
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
And as I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what, but when it was over
I said to myself, ""is that all there is to the circus?

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take take long walks down by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love
And then one day he went away and I thought I'd die, but I didn't
And when I didn't I said to myself, is that all there is to love?

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep

I know what you must be saying to yourselves
If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all?
Oh, no, not me I'm not ready for that final disappointment
'Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you
When that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is",Is That All There Is?
Peggy Lee,"Yes, it's a good day for singin' a song
And it's a good day for movin' along
Yes, it's a good day, how could anything be wrong
A good day from mornin' till night

Yes, it's a good day for shinin' your shoes
And it's a good day for losin' the blues
Everything to gain and nothin' to lose
A good day from mornin' till night

I said to the sun, good mornin', sun
Rise and shine, today
You know you've gotta get goin'

Why this joy when you touch my cheek?
I must tell you what my heart knows is true
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

And why this longing to know your charms
To spend forever here in your arms

Oh there's much more I could say
But the words keep slipping away
And I'm left with one point of view
Mister Wonderful, that's you

One more thing, then I'm through

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through

We are Siamese if you don't please

People have been baking up some pies
Peeping jumping up upon their window
Though delicious spice we could get into

Who is that who is living in that wire house
It must be a bird because it's not a mouse
If we're sneakin' up upon it carefully
There will be some bird for you and some for me

Maybe we could reaching in and make it drown

One o'clock 'til four 
And Lord, how slow the moments go 
When all I do is pour

Since the blues caught my eye 
I'm hangin' out on Monday 
My Sunday dreams to dry 

Now man was born to go a lovin' 
But was a woman born to weep and fret 
To stay at home and tend her oven 
And down her past regrets 
In coffee and cigarettes 

I'm moonin' all the mornin' 
Moanin' all the night 
And in between it's nicotine 
And not much heart to fight

To maybe come around",Black Coffee

Looking for the man she can't forget?
Misery in high-heeled shoes,
Holding a bouquet of blues.

Have you seen her go her lonely way,
Dressed in tattered dreams of good-bye grey?
Lost, with nothing more to lose,
She carries a bouquet of blues.

All she can hear is the echo of a voice saying ""This will last"".
All she can do is follow in the footsteps of the past.

Peggy Lee,"It's watermelon weather
That summer kind of weather
When people get together and sing

It's the time of year
The stars seem to dance with laughter
And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

So, why don't you meander
To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

Peggy Lee,"They call me coquette, and mademoiselle,
And I must admit I like it quite well.
It's something to be the darling of all;
Le grande femme fatale, the belle of the ball,
There's nothing as gay as life in Paris,
There's no other person, I'd rather be,
I love what I do, I  love what I see,
But where is the schoolgirl that used to be meÃ¢?Â¦.

Ah, the apple trees,
Where at garden teas,
Jack-o-lanterns swung:
Fashions of the day,
Vests of applique,
Dresses of shantung,
Only yesterday.
When The World Was Young

While sitting around we often recall,
The laugh of the year ' the night of them all,
The blonds who was so attractive that year,
Some opening night that made us all cheer;
Remember that time we all got so tight,
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight,
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,
I laugh with the rest ' it's all very bright.

Ah, the apple trees,
Sunlight memories,
Where the hammock swung,
On our backs we'd lie;
Looking at the shy,
'Til the stars were strung,
Only last July,
When the World Was Young.

You'll see me in Cape D'Antibes , or in Spain ,
I follow the sun by boat or by plane,
It's any old millionaire in a storm,
For I've got my mink to keep my heart warm:
And sometimes I drink too much with the crowd,
And, sometimes I talk a little too loud,
My head may be aching, but it's unbowed,
And sometimes I see it all through the cloudÃ¢?Â¦

Ah, the apple trees,
And the hive of bees,
Where we once got stung,
Summers at Bordeau:
Rowing at bateau,
Where the willow hung,
Just a dream ago,

Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight 
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat me right
You give me fever when you kiss me

Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long time ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie baby you're my flame""
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said ""Daddy, oh don't you dare""
""He gives me fever, with his kisses""
""Fever when he holds me tight""
""Fever, I'm his missus""
""Daddy won't you treat him right?""

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever
When you kiss them, fever if you really learn
Fever till you sizzle

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.

It would bore me terrifically, too.

You standing there before me.
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me.

When you open them dear

Peggy Lee,"Hear my voice, where you are, take a train, steal a car,
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me.
Catch a flame, catch a breeze, on your hand, on your knees,
Swim up high, only please come on back to me.
On a mule, in a jet, with your hair in a net,
In a shower wet, I don't care.
This is where you should be, from the hills to the shore,
By the wind to my door, raise the highway dust,
Break the law if you must, throw the world, only just
Come back to me.

Blast your hide, you recall, must I fight City hall
Here and now, damn it all, come on back to me,
Where on earth must I be, still I yell till I'm blue,
In control then when you come on back to me.
Have you gone to the moon, or the corner saloon
And to crack and to croon, oh my girl, where in hell can you be?
In a crate, in a trunk, on a horse, on a junk,
In a road or a van, wrapped in mink or saran,
Anyway that you can, came back to me,
Come back to me, come back to me, come back,
Come back to me, me!",Come Back to Me

That when your love wears golden earrings
He belongs to you
An old love story that's known to very few

By the burning fire, they will glow with every coal
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul

Make love your guiding light
And let this pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight

Whoever would have doubted those innocent eyes
And all the little kisses that you made me believe

Remember how I planned a little home by a stream
Where we'd spend every day
You must have thought me crazy when I painted that dream
'Cause you threw it away

I kinda wish that things would be different
Have a happy ending somehow
But I guess you only took me for a ride in the dark

Peggy Lee,"Mr. Irving Berlin
Often emphasizes sin
In a charming way.
Mr. Coward we know
Wrote a song or two to show
Sex was here to stay.
Richard Rodgers it's true
Took a more romantic view
Of this sly biological urge.
But it really was Cole
Who contrived to make the whole
Thing merge.

He said the Belgians and Greeks do it
Nice young men who sell antiques do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Monkeys whenever you look do it,
Aly Khan and King Farouk do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Louella Parsons can't quite do it,
For she's so highly strung,
Marlene might do it,
But she looks far too young.
Each man out there shooting crap does it,
Davy Crockett in that dreadful cap does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Our famous writers in swarms do it,
Somerset and all the Maughams do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
The Brontes felt that they must do it,
Ernest Hemingway could-just-do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
E. Allan Poe-ho! ho! ho!-did it,

H. Beecher Stowe did it,

Tennessee Williams self-taught does it,
Kinsey with a deafening report does it.

And our hearts beat high,

Each slap-happy sappy tree,
Each temptation that lures us along
Is just Nature elle-meme
Merely singing us the same
Old song.

In Texas some of the men do it
Others drill a hole-and then do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love
West Point cadets forming fours do it,
People say all those Gabors do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
My kith and kin, more or less, do it,
Every uncle and aunt,
But I confess to it-
I've one cousin that can't.
Teenagers squeezed into jeans do it,
Probably we'll live to see machines do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Each baby bat after dark does it,
In the desert Wilbur Clark does it
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
We're told that every hormone does it,
Victor Borge all alone does it,

An old cow polk went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A plowin' through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Yippee-I-yay, yippee-I-yo
The ghost herd in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hoofs were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

(Yippee-I-yay) yippee-I-yay (yippee-I-yay, yippee-I-yo

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
'If you want to save your soul from hell aridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride

There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

Peggy Lee,"Let someone start believing in you, let him hold out his hand
Let him touch you and watch what happens
One someone who can look in your eyes, and see into your heart
Let him find you and watch what happens
Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold
Maybe just afraid to be broken again

Give that deep love to you, and what magic you'll see

Peggy Lee,"When the sun comes out
And that rain stops beatin' on my window pane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singin' like they did before
That ol' storm broke out
And my man/gal walked off and left me in the rain
Though he's/she's gone I doubt
If he'll/she'll stay away for good,I'd stop livin' if he/she should
Love is funny, it's not always peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same
Til that sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour, it may not be long before
There's a knockin' at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in

He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh

Peggy Lee,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals

Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up 
in his arms and raced through the burning building out to the pavement. 
I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames. 
And when it was all over I said to myself, ""Is that all there is to a fire""

And when I was 12 years old, my father took me to a circus, the greatest show on earth. 
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears. 
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads. 
And so I sat there watching the marvelous spectacle. 
I had the feeling that something was missing. 
I don't know what, but when it was over, 
I said to myself, ""is that all there is to a circus?

Then I fell in love, head over heels in love, with the most wonderful boy in the world. 
We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes. 
We were so very much in love. 
Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die, but I didn't, 
and when I didn't I said to myself, ""is that all there is to love?""

You may grow up to be a fish

I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up 
in his arms and raced through the burning building out to the pavement.

And when it was all over I said to myself, ""Is that all there is to a fire""

There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears.  
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads.  
And so I sat there watching the marvelous spectacle.  
I had the feeling that something was missing.  
I don't know what, but when it was over, 
I said to myself, ""is that all there is to a circus?

Peggy Lee,"It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit before the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things",Just One of Those Things [Single Version]
Peggy Lee,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.
So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my !, how I lost out!

I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
how long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt;
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

The blues, they send to meet me won't defeat me,
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me.

Peggy March,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream
Peggy Monaghan,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air. 
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair.",Scarlet Ribbons

You know things they're not always
What they appear to be
And I don't want to happen to you
What happened to me

Listen, There are no words that can describe, what I felt inside
When I found out the man I loved loved another guy
We were at a party, Ohh to have a little fun
But when I looked around my-my man was missing
I walked outside, I couldn't believe my eyes
He was in Bill's arms breathin hard and french kissin

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

Bill has been to my house a thousand times
He and my man would go camping and fishing
Oh I tell you it never crossed my mind
Bill was a friend and he was God Uncle to my only son
Now it looks Uncle Billy wants to be his step-mom

Now you see I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
How do a woman compete with a man for another man

I asked my man why didnt you tell me that you were gay
when you knew, knew I build my world around you
I knew I had those feelings and I didn't want it to be
I thought by being with you, Girl I thought it would change
As tears came to my eyes, hesays I'm sorry I hurt you so
I got to pack Bill is waiting for me and I got to go

I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man
Thank you for using Top40db.com.

I don't feel ashame and I don't take the blame
My man was just a queen, he was a Queen that thought he was a King
He told before he left he said
I know you're hurt and oh I know you're mad
But if that's not asking too much,
could you tell my son I love him and I'm still his dad

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

I used to loan Bill my money, all the time he was in there tryin' to get

Peggy Scott-Adams,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...

And there's so much in my heart

We were old long friends

The work that quit our play
Carried us away then brought us home

Lying so close, so alone
Please turn to me, I'm almost gone

Hold on
There's time for rearranging
Hold on
I'm not me without you here

Put out your hand, touch desire
Where there's a spark, could be a fire
Open your arms, let me see
If there is still love in you for me

Pegi Young,"Can't believe I'm still here
With the morning so near
And last night so unclear

I see a trembling hand
And a gold wedding band
Wonder where do I stand

When the wild life betrays me
And I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me?
Will you shelter my heart till I'm strong
Or will you just hang up the phone?

Will my crazy old lies
And my worn out disguise
Turn to tears in your eyes?

What a fool I have been
There's no way I can win
Unless you take me back in

When the wild life betrays me
And I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me?
Will you shelter my heart till I'm strong
Or will you just hang up the phone?

When the wild life betrays me
And I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me?
Will you shelter my heart till I'm strong
Or will you just hang up the phone?

merry as a carousel,The circus tent was strung with ever
star in the sky,Above the ring I loved so well.Now
the young world has grown old, gone are the silver and gold,Chorus : Sit there and count your fingers, what can you do,Old girl, you're through.Just sit there and count
your little fingers, unhappy little girl blue.Sit there
and count the raindrops falling on you,It's time you
knew,All you can count on are the raindrops that fall on
little girl blue.No use, old girl, you might as well
surrender,Your hopes are getting slender, why won't
somebody send a tenderBlue boy to cheer up little girl

Penance,"Looking at changes beyond my control with hesitation
Setting in my life new goals, a liberation

Making my way blindly through life I see what I can
Sooner than later life takes its toll, a boy to a man

Wait, I see a chance at the window
Fate, mustn't always decide
I'll follow through with or without you
But I will be all right

It gets tougher every time, but to
Live and learn without getting burned
Is like not living at all",Reflections

Or mocking jest

Save the starry sky above

On a hurtlin fevered train

And the burnin of the coal 

Countin the towns flashin by 
And a night that's full of soul 
With light in my head 
With you in my arms... 

And I know I will be loosened 
From the bonds that hold me fast 
And the chains all around me 
Will fall away at last 

And on that grand and fateful day 
I will take thee in my hand 
I will ride on a train 
I will be the fisherman

To be the person that others would need
Hard to find a purse sometimes

Holding the truth so quietly inside
There's a fear to speak against the tide

Eu fico imaginando nós dois 
Eu fico ali sonhando acordado 
Juntando o antes, o agora e o depois 
Por que você me deixa tão solto? 
Porque você não cola em mim? 
Tô me sentindo muito sozinho! 
Não sou nem quero ser o seu dono 
É que um carinho às vezes cai bem 
Eu tenho os meus segredos e planos secretos 
só abro pra você, mais ninguém 
Por que você me esquece e some? 
E se eu me interessar por alguém? 
E se ela, de repente, me ganha? 
Quando a gente gosta 
É claro que a gente cuida 
Fala que me ama 
Só que é da boca pra fora

Pra que a vida seja mais alegre do que era antes

Que é você quem tem que resolver

Quantas vezes no seu canto 
Em silêncio você busca o meu olhar 
E me fala sem palavras que me ama 
Tudo bem, tá tudo certo 
De repente você põe a mão por dentro 
E arranca o mal pela raiz 
Você sabe como me fazer feliz 

Carne e unha, alma gêmea 
Bate coração 
As metades da laranja 
Dois amantes, dois irmãos 

Duas forças que se atraem 
Sonho lindo de viver

Peninha,"Tudo era apenas uma brincadeira
E foi crescendo, crescendo, me absorvendo
E de repente eu me vi assim completamente seu

Vi a minha força amarrada no seu passo
Vi que sem você não há caminho, eu não me acho
Vi um grande amor gritar dentro de mim
Como eu sonhei um dia

Quando o meu mundo era mais mundo
E todo mundo admitia
Uma mudança muito estranha
Mais pureza, mais carinho mais calma, mais alegria
No meu jeito de me dar

Quando a canção se fez mais clara e mais sentida
Quando a poesia realmente fez folia em minha vida
Você veio me falar dessa paixão inesperada
Por outra pessoa

Mas não tem revolta não
Eu só quero que você se encontre
Saudade até que é bom
É melhor que caminhar vazio
A esperança é um dom
Que eu tenho em mim, eu tenho sim
Não tem desespero não
Você me ensinou milhões de coisas
Tenho um sonho em minhas mãos
Amanhã será um novo dia
Certamente eu vou ser mais feliz",Sonhos

Dancing the best that I can

I saw a cold death at the end of the line

Up towards the sky but knew no one would
Answer me. I asked the trees why they
Grew toward the sun. I asked the clouds
And they rained down bad luck on me

I asked the teachers who taught me rules
To obey. I asked the gaes and prophets
Through time. Came up nothing but
A hole where my faith had laid no
Reason, no rite nothing feels fine tonight

I found the hole world as guilty as I

Hey quit - you want to get a fix
Hey try - you'll never make it tonight

What if I try to change the way I'm feeling deep inside

And now we don't know which way to go
And the pressure is building and it's ready to blow

A moments time-we're all gonna blow it away


Poor me-It's my own tragedy I was born in a time of lunacy
It was all fun-but now we're gonna pay

Whoever thought there would come a day when the world

As we know it could be stolen away-we didn't see it coming 'til it



Was too late and now it seems like the news is getting worse everyday

Watch it go down it doesn't matter to you but when it comes to an end
Well then you will know the truth

Can't figure it out, I guess we'll see, I know nothing comes for free
No one can say what the future holds and now I know I've lost control

Who knows what waits for me, no hope in sight, the futures bright for me
Too long I've been denied and hypnotized by the lies they've told me
And too long I've been controlled I've got to know what it feels like to be free
Of the grasp of their expectations, their tribulations, no reservations

Pennywise,"Hey Listen. take a look around and tell me
What’s your story? what’s your problem?
In your head tangled inside are distorted images
Images telling you what it should be instead of what is
Think about all that you have
Not about what you can’t get
Think about all that you have
Not about what you can’t get
Quick question: Don’t you realize how worse off you could be living?

Or not living at all
You’re lucky and you should see how many good things come your way
If you don’t you won’t make life a fun and pleasant stay
If you don’t feel good enough about life you should be shot
I’ve got better things to do than worry about what is not
I’ve got so many things to see yeah places to go yeah people to meet
I got so many things to see yeah places to go and things to be
Think about all that you have
Not about what you can’t get",Thanksgiving
Pennywise,"Mindless people wanna figure it out
games that we play make you wanna shout
taking my time to make the best of life
just one chance to wanna get it right
Cause everything left in my sight
Is a fight for freedom with all my might
Wanna make you, make you understand
something we’re not comprehending, it’s outta hand

wanna make you, wanna make you see
that until we will stop pretending, it’s violence never ending
til we all get blown away
Raise up the flagpole till ya shoot it down
Salute that flag now better safe than sound
Choose your best side gotta join that fight
Just one chance to gotta get it right
Cause everything left in my sight
Is a fight for freedom with all my might",Violence Never Ending
Pennywise,"The first impression you got typical policeman so it
Seems he took ride in his badge and gun
But on the inside what was on his deranged mind he was
Caught doing what he thought was good clean fun
From Scotland Yard to behind bars
I hope you get what you deserve
To protect and serve it seemed like
You protected she served now let’s
See you go through the torture that you put her through
My heart’s out to the lady who will live the rest of her life in fear of
Someone we were always taught to look up to
Can’t trust that policeman no more",What You Deserve
Pensive,"It was late we couldn't see 
The road spun around me 
We ran off the side 
It's no surprise that we both died. 

The news caught the whole scene 
My face is bloody and unclean 
My parents didn't know I died 
I didn't get to say goodbye. 

One accident changed everything 
This accident destroyed me 

Nothing more for me to be 
No future in front of me 
The wild ride was just a lie 
It's no surprise that we both died. 

One accident changed everything 
This accident destroyed me 

One accident changed everything 
This accident destroyed me.",Accident
Pensive,"Ticking clock won't stop 
Tick tock tick tock 
Pissing me off 
I need a night job. 

I lie in bed 
Thoughts in my head 
Another test 
No rest no rest. 

Cause I can't sleep 
No rest in peace 
Cause I can't sleep 
No rest in peace. 

I watch T.V. 
Old movies, Tom Green 
It's an ugly scene 
Just being me. 

Drugs don't help 
And my brain just melts 
From there I fell 
I hate myself. 

Cause I can't sleep 
No rest in peace 
Cause I can't sleep 
No rest in peace",Insomnia
Pensive,"Cuando menciono tu nombre
Tu bello rostro me observa
Lloro por tu perdón y es que
Imagino que me extrañas

Y cada noche al dormir
Perfecta en mi mente es
Y todo lo que te diré
Explica porque me siento así

Count the stars, steal the moon
I'd do this all just for you
Nothing's good enough

I'm trying to love you
Just tell me what should I do
Nothing's good enough

Caught in this soledad

Si supieras cuanto me importas
Sentirte así, tocar tu piel
Pero no sabes la verdad
Te ciegas al amor real

Qué mas te puedo dar no sé
Intento una y otra vez
Dirás que me amas
El primer beso no olvidaré

Count the stars, steal the moon
I'd do this all just for you
Nothing's good enough

I'm trying to love you
Just tell me what should I do
Nothing's good enough

From here ‘til eternity I'm
lost without your love
Watch the waves come
rolling in and pray they
bring you back again

Y déjame creer
Que tu me amas también
Y déjame soñar
Contigo hasta el final

Y déjame creer
Que tu me amas también

Pentagram,"They eat through your head
And straight to your brain
The decisions they make
Slowly drive you insane

This is the brotherhood of satan
And they're forcing you to kill
The apocalypse is now
Revalation being filled yeah

You seem so self-assured
When your leaders speak
But the lies all come out
When the power grows weak

So they only hide away
Unworried and unsure
Still feeding on your blood
Still searching for a cure yeah

You believe in your father
In his love so strong
But the thoughts you've been given
Well they come out so wrong

And on your day of judgement
You'll know who's in command
No man's law will matter
Under God's saving head yeah",The Deist
Pentagram,"The flames grow high in your eyes
Your tempers hot and it's on the rise
Furious storm builds deep inside
And the universe no place to hide

You watch the world fall to it's knees
Full of sins as they beg for peace
But your blood runs cold through your veins
You only laugh when you're in pain

Sunshine through the tree tops
Moonshine cross the sea
The wind blows through my hair
And takes my soul from me

Is the world near it's end
My god what's 'round the band
Will you fall to your knees and pray
When hell; it heads your way

If the world could only feel the love
That's within us and up above
We'd be glad to live and that we're alive
Instead we worry how we're to die yeah!
