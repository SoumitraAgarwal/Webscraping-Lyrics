Connie Eaton,"There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years
Baby, baby, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)",Angel of the Morning
Connie Evingson,"There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
The corn is as high as an elephants eye,
An' it looks like it's climbing clear up in the sky.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the cattle are standin' like statues,
All the cattle are standin' like statues,
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.","Oh, What a Beautiful Morning"
Connie Evingson,"Yes, it's a good day for singin' a song,
And it's a good day for movin' along,
Yes, it's a good day, how could anything go wrong,
A good day from mornin' till night.

Yes, it's a good day for shinin' your shoes,
And it's a good day for losin' the blues,
Ev'rything to gain and nothin' to lose,
Cause it's a good day from mornin' till night.

I said to the sun, ""good mornin', sun.
Rise and shine, today""
You know you've gotta get goin'
If you're gonna make a showin'
And you know you've got the right of way

Cause it's a good day for payin' your bills,
And it's a good day for curin' your ills,
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills,
Cause it's a good day from mornin' till night.",It's a Good Day
Connie Evingson,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give

Take these broken wings and learn to fly

Connie Evingson,"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door 
And kept my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

See the people standing there who disagree and never win 
And wonder why they don't get in my door 
I'm painting my room in the colourful way 

And when my mind is wandering 
There I will go 
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

Silly people run around they worry me 
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

That weren't important yesterday 
And I still go

Connie Evingson,"I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I

You didn't run, you didn't hide
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me

Say we'll be together every day

You don't look different, but you have changed.
I'm looking through you, you're not the same. 

Your lips are moving, 
I cannot hear.
Your voice is soothing, 
But the words aren't clear.
You don't sound different, 
I've learned the game.
I'm looking through you, 
You're not the same. 

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight. 

You're thinking of me, 
The same old way.
You were above me, 
But not today.
The only difference is you're down there.

Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.

Connie Evingson,"When I get old and losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?

If I'd been out 'til quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me? Will you still feed me
When I'm 64?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handing, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride

Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me? Will you still feed me
When I'm 64?

Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Well, indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away

Give me your answer, fill in the form
Mine forever more
Will you still need me? Will you still feed me
When I'm 64?

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away

Give me your answer, fill in a form

I'm watching the sea,,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!

Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.

Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin'

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind
Connie Evingson,"I'm impressed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With his influential friends

He's got very big connections
And I follow his directions
Bernie knows his way around
And so I always do what Bernie recommends

I am blessed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With the way he runs the store

He's got Dodger season boxes
And an office full of foxes
It's amazing all the different things
Your average guy might need a lawyer for

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I'm in touch
With my attorney Bernie
In a clutch
He can speed right to the scene

And if I'm locked up in the jail
With just one phone call for my bail
He said to call his club collect
Or deal directly with his answering machine

And when I dine
With my attorney Bernie
He buys wine
From the rare imported rack

That's 'cause Bernie is a purist
And not your polyester tourist
Bernie waves the glass around awhile
Then takes a sip and always sends it back

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I admire
My attorney Bernie
I admire
Any guy who knows his stuff

Sure we blew a couple ventures
With a counterfeit debentures
But you win a few, you lose a few
Like Bernie says, ""You keep on hanging tough""

Thanks to you
My attorney Bernie
Thanks to you
I'm considered well to do

Sure I made out like a bandit
Just exactly like you planned it
But like Murray, my accountant
Told me yesterday, I owe it all to you.

Connie Fisher,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
Stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray
I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",The Sound of Music

I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.
Heigh ho!
If love were all I should be lonely!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,

It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Connie Francis,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?
",The Song from Moulin Rouge (Where Is Your Heart?)

Still it's uncomfortably near

Need I say that my love's mis-spent
Mis-spent with Angel Eyes tonight

So drink up, drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people

Pardon me, but I gotta run

I gotta find who's now number one
And why my Angel Eyes ain't here.

Others have girls on that old tenderloin,

From Frisco up to the North Pole.

Of oil wells in Nebraska and gold mines in Alaska,

And only cold cash keeps you off the dole.
So some of them wash dishes,
And some of them are snitches,

Grifters who jump their parole,
Trying to sell bags of catnip for dope,

And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.

They'll come from near and far.
And they'll give a party when I go home,
With Irish jauntin' cars.
The spirits'll flow and we'll be gay,
We'll fill your hearts with joy.
And the piper will play an Irish reel
To greet the Yankee boy.
We'll dance and sing the whole night long,
Such fun as never was seen.
The lads'll be decked in corduroy,
The colleens wearin' green.
There'll be thousands there that I never saw,

I see us there upon the stairway to the sea
Where the mist softly kissed two lovers, hiding from others our love by the sea

Why try to find a new love when your voice keeps calling me?
I'm just a lonely prisoner of the stairway to the sea
And there you'll find me waiting for the day of your return
But till that day how memories can burn

This is my prayer upon the stairway to the sea
That you soon will be there before me, whispering ""Adore me"" there by the sea

To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.

To make me believe, when your eyes just deceive

Without you you got me singing the blues
The moon and stars no longer shine the dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do but cry-I-I-I-I over you
Well I never felt more like running away but why should I go cause I couldn't stay
Without you, you got me singing the blues 
[ Harmonica ]
 Well I never felt more like singing the blues cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love dear why'd you do me this way
Well I never felt more like crying all night
Cause everything's wrong and nothing ain't right
Without you you got me singing the blues

Connie Francis,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation
You were born to be kissed
I can't resist.

Connie Francis,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

This love will last though years may go

So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Connie Francis,"[Chorus]
The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart, 

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start, 

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love, 
My foolish heart! 

[Chorus]",My Foolish Heart
Connie Francis,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Connie Francis,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances

Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know

We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it my way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it my way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught. 
To say the things he truly feels; 
And not the words of one who kneels.

I took the blows 
And did it my way!",My Way

And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sittin' round the table as from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

That for you my door stays open and our love becomes a simple to A street
And it's knowing we're not shacked by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted on their columns now that bind us
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'

That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry

And the junk yards and the highways come between us

And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you movin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
The shadows freek in the autumn winds that make me draw inside myself in silence
Cross legged now I sit and watch the endless chase of leaves across my yard
And layin' down my hair brush I lean back within my window seat and find
That you're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry

Someone must taste of sadness

And it's much too bigger thing for mortal men
Just take a look around and see the writing on the wall
Somehow we've got to find a helping hand
This world has never been in the awful shape it's in

The mighty roar of gunfire is now a local sound

And our city streets are filled with angry men
Love is now a mockery throughout our troubled land
And destruction seems to be the current trend

The things that I love and hold dear to my heart
Are just borrowed they're not mine at all
Jesus only let me use them to brighten my light
So remind, me remind me dear Lord

Roll back the curtain of memory now and then
Show me where you brought me from
And where I could have been
Remember I'm human, and humans forget
So remind me, remind me dear Lord


Nothing good have I done to deserve God's own Son
I'm not worthy of the scars in his hands
Yet he chose the road to Calvary to die in my stead
Why he loved me I can't understand

Made him a slave to his wanderin' ways

And I can't remember much he said at all
Just that he was leaving town and must get off the phone
I can't remember when he told me he'd be home
Did he say Sunday noon or one day soon
I think he left with them but what if he said am
Did they go to meet the train or leave to catch a plane
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone
So I telephoned his house and asked his Mom
If she'd knew where her little boy had gone
I know she must have told me and I heard her loud and clear
But I can't remember anything but tears
Did she say fishing trip or he gave you the slip
Is he off to see the world or to see another girl
Did she say he took the car or what a fool you are

I said my love for him had died but I know it's not true
And if I talk to him my feelings would show through
Yes if I talk to him 
I take him back again 
I'm afraid to even answer the phone
Cause if I talk to him 
I take him back again

Now he is gone from the meadow my love goodbye

Where clouds're bloomin' birds were would sing, ribbon of darkness over me

And find that his love is not true
But if I refuse him, what if I lose him

The things they said that you and her were doing
Makes it seem you're a man I'd never knew

Connie Smith,"Well did you ever sleep at the foot of the bed when the weather was whizzin' cold
When the wind was a howlin' round the house and the moon was yeller as gold
And you give your good warm mattress up to Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Fred
How too many kinfolks on a bad night and you went to the foot of the bed
Well I could always wait till the old folks ate and eat the leavin's with grace
The teacher could keep me after school I'd still have a smile on my face
I could wear the big girls' wornout clothes or let sister have my sled
But it always did get my nanny goat to sleep at the foot of the bed
[ ac.guitar ]
It was fine enough when kinfolks come and the kid brought brand new games
You could see how fat all the old folks was and learn all the babies' names
Had biscuits and custard and chicken pie we all got Sunday fed
But I always knew when nighttime come I was headed for the foot of the bed
Now they say some folks don't know what it is havin' company all over the place

Or cold toenails a scratchin' your back and the footboard scrubbin' your head

Well I've done it over and over again in this land of the brave and the free
And in this all fired battle of life it's left its mark on me

And I don't think it's caused from a doggone thing

Connie Smith,"It makes no difference if you're rich or poor or if you're smart or dumb
A woman's place in this old world is under some man's thumb
And if you're born a woman you're born to be hurt
You're born to be stepped on lied to cheated on and treated like dirt

Oh if you're born a woman you're born to be hurt
A woman's lot is to give and give and go on giving
A woman's got to love and lose and go on living
Well I was born a woman I didn't have no say
And when my man fin'lly comes home he makes me glad it happened that way
Because to be his woman no price is too great to pay

Connie Smith,"(You were born to sing)
There's only one thing to do when you find out that you were born to sing
No matter what your age you gotta get on the stage cause you were born to sing
You gotta open up your heart let the music start it's a feeling you just can't explain
It's the kind of thing that makes a bird want to sing or a spark burst into a flame
It's the hard life they say but you want it anyway cause you were born to sing
Call it vanity your pride but there's a message deep inside
That you've just gotta bring

In a schoolhouse hall or a president's ball before beggar or a king

Connie Smith,"The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely girls like me
A cabarete a honky tonk their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget his name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other guys for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
Lights that say forget his love in a different atmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights",City Lights

I've been counting all the time that you told me you are mine
The time you've said how much you care
And I counted all of them on the fingers of one hand
And I still have five fingers to spare (yes I still have five fingers to spare)

If placed beside a blushing rose the rose cannot compare

The orchid now I find my dear was you

We kept chickens in a pen in the back
And everybody said we was po' folks

That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent

He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed

Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
And the howlin' winds would get pretty rough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love

On a little side street in old Bombay

I discovered much to my regret

But ev'ry night, in the mellow moonlight
When he's out dervishing with all his might

Are his best friends to his face
But there's no doubt, when he isn't about
They all come hurrying to take her out
She leads him a dizzy pace

He doesn't dream that ev'ry night when he goes out
To make an honest rupee
She steps out to make a lotta whoopee

Has a sweet and tender sound
But will he burn if he ever should learn

There's a land that I've heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to

And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me

Where troubles melt
Like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops

Taken by surprise
Nobody down below believes their eyes

We're swimming in the frozen sky
We're drifting over icy 
Mountains floating by

Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep

Conor Maynard,"Looking for a girl that was here but now she's gone
Felt so good even though she did me wrong,
She knows what I want but she's bad for me
She gets what she wants when she's touching me
I should known better but she took my self control

You can take my heart like a criminal
Won't you make me believe I'm the only one?
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more
You tear me apart like an animal
Like an animal, animal

I know I'm getting close from the trail of broken hearts
Hope she coming back to finish what she started
I never see the claws until she's touching me
She's holding me so tight it's getting hard to breath
I'll never win the game but it feels too good to care

You can take my heart like a criminal
(Like a criminal, like a criminal)
Won't you make me believe I'm the only one?
(I'm the only one, I'm the only one)

I can't read hands and surely not the stars

Just this notion
Your eyes scream liar, you cannot help it

I should have known from Glastonbury last year, was it June?
When everyone was so excited to go there, but not you
He must be some great rock star, tattooed and shirtless
Well maybe since you like being his new clown, join his circus

Can't hide it in your style or hide it in your charm

Breakups are always hard
Especially when you're young
I guess that's just it
I'm too young to be committed

I got nothing else to say, no need to further complicate
Find me something now to break
Don't touch me I'll be OK

And the way you fix your hair and two-step that’s insane, (you know it)
And every time you smile at me ooh girl you’re in my brain, (you know it)
But this is your world so I guess that would be OK, (you know it)

Beats about to drop,
Can't control my body,

I'ma do the dougie,
I don't even care if you watch me party!

I got that boom, boom clap for my headphones,
I'ma rock it like that in my zone,
Gonna pump that track 'til the bass blows out,
Turn it up, or turn the whole world down,
Got that boom, boom clap in my headphones,
I'ma go hard 'til I go home,
Now you can't stop me when I drop it low,
Don't need nothing but my headphones

On your way to work, on your way to college,
Pump them headphones, get your head jumping,
No matter where you are, no matter where you going,
Grab them headphones, get the beat pumping,
From here to Tokyo, LA to Miami,
Pump them headphones, get your head jumping,
No matter where you are, no matter where you going,
Grab them headphones, get the beat pumping,

Check! I put 'em on and turn 'em loud,
Baby girl that's how I do it,
I rock around the block,
They wonder what that kid is doing,
'cause I lean with it, an' yeah I rock with it,
An' what they knew where I fitted,
I'm looking fly like quit it,
So if I'm walkin' an' rockin' no talkin' to me,
But if you look like a model,
Then you can follow me,
I got that boom, boom, it's in my room, room,
Oh wait damn girl, was that too soon?

Conor Maynard,"Once I was seven years old, my mama told me,
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me,
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Before the morning sun, when life was lonely

Conor Oberst,"A short delay,
The parrot blues
Little voices mimic you
It's not so hard to make that sound

So watch your back,
The Ides of March
Cut your hair like Joan of Arc
Disguise your will
They'll find you out

And when they do,
Look out

There's money lenders inside the temple
That circus tiger's gonna break your heart
Something so wild turned into paper
If I loved you, well that's my fault

A bitch in heat,
The alpha male
Not something she'd ever tell
Except when she got deathly high

And out it came,
Like summer rain
Washed the cars and everything
Felt clean for just a little while

A telethon,
We drove down

The starving children they ain't got no mother
There's pink flamingos living in the mall
I'd give a fortune to your infomercial
If somebody would just take my call
Take my call
Take my call

Hello,
Patterns in my mind now moving slow
Sorrow all across the surface roads
Smoothing out the edges of the stone
The lights are out, where'd everybody go?
Alone

Erase yourself and you'll be free
Mendula destroyed by the sea
All we are is colored sand

So pay to ride the ferris wheel
Smile, all that you can feel
Is gratitude for what has been

Cause it did not,
Happen

There's money lenders inside the temple
That circus tiger's gonna break my heart
Something so wild turned into paper
If you loved me, then that's your fault

There's money lenders inside the temple
This crystal city's gonna fall apart
When all their power turns into vapor
If I miss you well that's my fault
That's my fault
That's my fault",Lenders in the Temple

Help me go slow

I'll go pound for pound
I keep death on my mind
Like a heavy crown

If I go to heaven I'll be bored as hell
Like a little baby at the bottom of a well

Fair child, fair child
How are you man?
Did you fix that store front?
Did you start that band?

Don't be scared of nothing
You go pound for pound
You bring peace to midnight

I'll be rooting for you like my favorite team
If somebody sweats you, you just point them out to me

All the sights and sounds
This little world's too crowded now
And there's only one way out

An elevator ride,
Through the tunnel, towards the light
And I'm nowhere bound
Keep going up and down
Up and down

Newspaper, newspaper
Can't take no more
You're here every morning
Waiting at my door

I'm just trying to kiss you
And you stab my eyes
Make me blue forever
Like an island sky

And I'm not pretending that it's all OK
Just let me have my coffee before you take away the day

Lazarus, Lazarus
Why all the tears?
Did your faithful chauffeur
Just disappear?

What a lonesome feeling
To be waiting round
Like some washed up actress
In a tinsel town

Before the record I'd come pick you up
We'll head for the ocean
Just say when you've had enough

All the light and sound
This little world's too fragile now
And there's only one way out

But if you let me slide
I'll do my best to make things right
And I'm nowhere bound
Just going up and down
Up and down

Milk Thistle, milk Thistle
Let me down slow
Just help me go slow
I've been hurrying on

I was poised for greatness
I was down and out
I keep death at my heels

So I've come to make a trade
You can hate me but just love me in return

I'll just slide back down to the bottom

There's nothing that the road cannot heal

Gone beneath my wheels
There's nothing that the road cannot heal

But that's a science too exact
I can prove it
Watch, we're crossing the state line
See those headlights coming towards us?
That's someone going back
To a town they said they'd never, yeah
They swore it on their lives

But you can't break out of a circle
That you never knew you were in

[Chorus]

Some would spend their precious time
Trying to decorate their lives
Taking measurements for some new look they want

So from one to ten, ten's exactly what I am
Zero being everything I'm not

Tell me what you like
Is it less than five?
Is it less than five?

There's nothing that the road cannot heal
There's nothing that the road cannot heal

Time hanging from a clothes pin
There's no sorrow that the sun's not gonna help

Smell the leather of your new car
Drive through the desert after night fall
Sleep on the shoulder keep the stars all to ourselves

The kinda love that makes my back hurt
Wearing nothing but a t-shirt
She's turning over on a mattress made of air

I close my eyes I see a stair case
Leading upwards into blank space
All of creation makes a sound too soft to hear

So I remain between her legs
Sheltered from all my fears
While bikers glide by highway shrines
Where pilgrims disappear

I know that trouble's been your good friend
Keep you company on the weekends
Keep you company even once your mind was made

Said it's over and it's finished
Now a headache is all you're left with
We're no different I got debts I'd like to pay

We should move to Sausalito
Living's easy on a house boat
Let the ocean rock us back and forth to sleep

In the morning with the sunrise
Look in the water see the blue sky
As if heaven has been laid there at our feet

So we remain between these waves
Sheltered for all our years
While bikers glide by highway shrines
Where pilgrims disappear

Where time takes icebergs
Where fields burn westward
Where pilgrims disappear",Sausalito

The whole world's just a little oyster

Conor Oberst,"I'm just trying to stay a human being
Sitting in the sun eating ice cream
Texting my friend about a bad, bad dream
Just had to tell someone who knows me

But I don't got time for this cuckoo clock
And I don't wanna go to your Mason lodge
There's nothing more sad than a lynching mob
Full of rational men who believe in God

But nothing makes sense when the wave rolls through
Nothing makes sense when the wave come through
So it could've been me or it could've been you
Whatever's in me is whatever's in you

My neighbor dreams big 'cause his house is small
Says all he needs now is some capital
It's a pirate world, it's a free-for-all
Just take your bright ideas and they make them dull

Now everyone I see I think I've known before
From the opera house to the grocery store
My love for them I cannot ignore
Like a human voice in a quiet morgue

But I don't wanna wear no dead man's suit
I don't wanna wear no dead man's suit
I don't wanna wait until the moon gets blue
I don't wanna wait until the moon turns blue

It's all just a fix, just one little hit
You'll hold it in

Sitting on a plane chewing Nicorette
Paradise lost, haven't found it yet
Will you talk me down if I get upset?
Be the cool washcloth to my fevered head

Because I don't wanna dream if it won't come true
I don't wanna dream if it don't come true
If there's something in me then I guess it's in you
If there's somewhere in me then I know it's in you

Well, it's all just a fix, just one little hit
You're holding in, you'll hold it in
You're holding in, you'll hold it in

Whatever happens to me it's going to happen to you

There's a lot of things I got left to do
Oh tomorrow, well I'll wait for you

It takes a while to realize where you're at

Slowly, so slowly
Slowly, so slowly
Slowly, it's slowly ending

The human race is in its second childhood
I never learned but I understood
Oh dementia, you better treat me good

Classical music plays from my radio
I sit real still, let my shadow grow
Yeah, sometimes I need a place to go

I hope someday that I can get it back

Conor Oberst,"Moses up on the mountainside, what a place to meet
He brought his pad and his pencil, poured himself some gypsy tea
And all the world's multiplicity, they turn his brain and his soul to stone
He drew his face on a tablet and carried it back home

Jesus off in the water, standing on His feet
Yeah, that's the thing about charisma it makes everyone believe
But there is nothing impossible
When I'm with you and when you're with me
I got a sad sinking feeling that, that can never be

But I'm going to do what I can for you, I will make a plea
To all the lights in the windows, the puddles in the streets
And all the lovers that you've been teasing from your balcony
May they carry you far from my memory

Solomon heard a protest from the lower court
Reached in his ear for a silver dollar just like he'd done before
He tossed it high, said that wisdom's fickle and chance is God's retort
And handed them a sentence, it was death by Trojan horse

Pharaoh woke from a bad dream splashed some water on his face
When it's a matter of nightmares you had better ask a slave
And he may tell you a famine's coming or he may look away
If he's kind then return it, let him lick your plate

But I'm gonna do what I can for you, I will make a plea
To all the birds in the chimneys, the whales up on the beach
And all the footsteps that you've been hearing like a timpani
May they carry you far from your enemies

I'm gonna do what I can for you, I will make a plea
To all the lights in the windows, the puddles in the streets
And all the hours that you've been sitting at your vanity
May they carry you far from your misery, may they carry you far

Jesus off in the water, standing on His feet
Yeah, that's the thing about charisma it makes everyone believe
That there is nothing impossible
When I'm with you and when you're with me

I got a sad sinking feeling that will never be

Leave it all behind

I can always find you like the sweet north star

If you're in trouble I'm in trouble too
I've fallen through a trap door into you

No bones, no ghosts, I threw my passport in the trash

To the grounds behind your eyes
You know I'm open to suggestion

Let it slip right out from under
Your breath and it rolled around my head
It was nothing I'd consider
I knew it had to happen then

Stood on the banks of the Potomac
We watched the water rushing by
You said we should live in the moment
Then I'd miss you all the time

And I know no one will believe me

To be an object of desire
If that means slipping through your hands
If I had tried to make you mine
You would have walked away

This world is full of missing persons
All of these unsolved mysteries

They're selling something certainly

To chase that fatalistic comet
Die young in the dark, that's poetry
But it was not to be, it was not for me

He's always sad but I've never seen him cry
When he comes to, sure he'll apologize
Find his car, assess the damage
Still drunk but he likes the challenge
Hold on to his mind just like a kite
But a good strong win can keep you honest
Fill you with some common knowledge
Things when we were young we never tried
Just figured we had time with such a long life

That he realized he wasn't feeling that well
And he took what she held looked like pieces of sky
And a garnet like teardrops from hell
She offered, him a necklace, and he wanted to accept it
But it would end up, too expensive, he could tell
Then she said:
""Why not, what have you got, to lose, to lose""

His friends searched the fair grounds for clues
But security guard the maniacal laugh
Said its always the leader you lose
And he finally turned up in the broad light of day
With a black eye as big as the moon

Was it real or, imagined
Why on earth had, he abandon them so soon

It took centuries to build these twisted cities
It took seconds to reduce them down to dust
And all the tour guide could say was
“Take your pictures folks it's late, try your best please to remember what was done.”

Don't you look so scared
Don't get so upset

Now I just wish I could get some sleep

Little explosions that set fire to my dreams

Sometimes I get mistaken for this actor
And I guess that I can see it from the side
Maybe no one really seems to be the person that they mean to be
I hope I am forgotten when I die

Don't contradict me
Don't make me cross the line
If you feel threatened
It's only 'cause I might

The bandshell got a band sounds like an arcade in Japan
Blew all my quarters trying to get that feeling back

Now any sucker can turn boredom into violence
A sociopath riding on a bus
His irises are black from his novelty contacts
He looks around but he can't see the rest of us

In my sunglasses don't mind the blinding light
Yeah it's getting dark bro, but I've always loved the night

But there are hundreds of ways
To get through the day
There are hundreds of ways
To get through the day
There are hundreds of ways
To get through the day
There are hundreds of ways
To get through the day
There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ways
To get through the day

Conor Oberst,"Kick you know you're still a kid
And your diets too full of additives
Passed out on a couch with ashes in your mouth
Dreaming that you're hopping a fence
This world must have it out for you
From the shores of Montaca to Malibu
The trappings of a name you never could escape
Because people want to live in the past
Some goal they mentioned they never had

I thought we lost that Camelot
I thought we lost that Camelot
It's a children's story we forgot
So long ago

Kick it's hard to find a friend
In a place that's so cruel and partisan
But you should go in style to Stockholm for a while
Live outside oblivion's lent
Someday you'll have a fine divorce
And a cemetery plot in Johannesburg
It's time you close your eyes
On a helicopter ride
I hope you see it isn't your fault
I hope you know it isn't your fault

I thought they shot that Camelot
I thought they shot that Camelot
Whoever shot this movie star he grows
And the show must go on

Laying in an office on an old chaise lounge
Listening to the doctor drone
No therapeutic feeling once the shock wears off
Answer every question no
Hiding in a hammock with the shades pulled down
Wondering if the stories broke
Tragedy is prophet once the word gets out
Tablets at the country store
Searching under tables once the bars closed down
Said somebody stole your phone
Now there's no one to talk to but these trust fund drunks
Should have brought a chaperon

Kick I'd love to help you but I just don't count
Friendship makes you paranoid
I don't believe in crescents
But I just might now we never really had a choice
Like all your broken toys

Kick you know this life is rich
But pleasures not the same as happiness
If you don't collide with the traffic in your mind
I think you'll find your way out of this
I hope you find your way out of this",Kick
Conor Oberst,"It's lonely at the top of the upside mountain
Watch the sunrise from a windowless room
If the Paramedics stall the soul goes on
Without them in a wicker basket tied to a balloon

There are no boundaries to love
The heart can't comprehend the panorama
I took it on the chin from some second hand feeling
Sorrow handed down to me it felt brand new

Tiny violins or some summer insects listening
Another season leaving us too soon
Freedom's the opposite of love
You'll never keep it through the paranoia

Standing on the edge of a million landscapes
Emptying and the water from the glacier fills my shoes
Laying in your bed my dreams are sex and violence
I chase the rapist chasing after you

There is no dignity in love
Trade every scrap to get some absolution
'Til then I'm walking out the door
'Til then I'm running through the airport
'Til then i'm waiting around for no one",Lonely at the Top
Conor Oberst,"Polished my shoes I bought a brand new hat
Moved to a town that time forgot
Where I don't have to shave or be approachable
No I can do just what I want

I want to walk in that howling wind
'til it scatters all my thoughts
Sit alone on that riverbank 'til I
Forget that I can talk
Just listen

They say everyone has a choice to make
To be loved or to be free
I told you once I felt invisible
And I'm sure by now you see

What I meant is I'm not all there
Until I finally leave
Some loneliness is acceptable
And some's just outright mean
It gets even

Ivy crawls up the garden wall
Builds a ladder towards the sky
Can't be climbed but whose gonna mind
If I claim it can be done
Illusion

And the sun goes down
And the stars come out
In the distance that I felt I can see it for myself now

Boarding a train to take my memories back
Make up for time that I have lost
I'll never know if I'm delusional
I just believe that I am not
I'm going to work for my sanity
Give it everything I got
Though so far I have cheated death
I know someday I'll get caught
Just living

So here we go man it's beautiful
Get your trumpet get your drum
Keep in time in a second line
It can make you feel so young

I know you say you'll go all the way
But that's not quite far enough
Someone told me that same thing
Some told me that same thing
Someone told me that exact same thing once",Time Forgot
Conor Oberst,"I remember the day you appeared on this earth
With eyes like the ocean, got blood on my shirt
From my camera angle it looked like it hurt
But your mama had a big old smile

We drove you home, saw your yellowing skin
Packed a few things and drove you back again
Stayed up all night worrying, wondering
What was gonna make it better

Broken bones heal when you set them right
Get your fine tooth comb from the barbicide
Our love's a protective poison
But you are your mother's child
But she'll keep you for a while
One someday you'll be grown and then you'll be on your own

Halloween costume, looking real cute
With your pillowcase full, in your astronaut suit
But your cousin the cowboy is eyeing your loot
Better watch your Snickers bar

Out on the diamond, now you're up to bat
Chewing your big league, adjusting your hat
Taking a swing and hearing it crack
Look at that apple fly

Tears will dry if you give them time
Life's a roller coaster, keep your arms inside
Fear that's a big emotion
But you are your mother's child
And she'll keep you for a while
But some day you'll be grown and then you'll be on your own

Posing for pictures, cap and a gown
Summer is coming, you're driving around town
Everyone's asking what you're gonna do now
I know you're gonna make a splash

And find you a sweetheart to treat you so kind
Take her to dinner and kiss her goodnight
What I couldn't teach you, you will realize
She's the only thing that matters

Although he's a bastard, make your papa proud
Your a fine young man and I got no doubt
That you're gonna do this better
'Cause you are your mother's child
She had you for a while
Now that you're grown, may you never be on your own
Now that you're grown, may you never feel this alone",You Are Your Mother's Child
Conor Oberst,"I'm blessed with a heart that doesn't stop
My minds a weathervane it spins around just like a top
Knows what the winds of fortune bring
In the season of the witch
Home is a perjury, a parlor trick, an urban myth

Oh how the circumstances change
This world of smoke and steel
Of compromise and meter-maids
I'm going to leave here before too long
Zigzagging toward the light
I'm off to sing my bounder's song

True love it hides like city stars
Nothing to gaze upon or contemplate
How near or far
If it comes, it comes quite unannounced
A momentary glance
Lit up by sun or moon
Or bonfire or ambulance

How the circumstances change
Feels unmistakable with no idea from where it came
But you will know it when it's gone
Zigzagging through the night
Half-dead you sing your bounder's song
Half-dead you sing, half-dead you sing

Sing for the bounder whose word is never kept
A bindle of flowers to state his mind
And bloom when he forgets

It's true that shadows tell the time
On sunny afternoons, on crowded sidewalks, passersby
I'm in a queue that stretches out
Far as the eye can see
It forms a figure eight and goes on for eternity

Oh how the circumstances change
I fly by interstate across a purple mountain range
I find a place to come undone
Zigzagging toward you now
I sing out loud my bounder's song",Zigzagging Toward the Light
Conrad Gozzo,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

I could live without love
Now I must admit,

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Who gave me good head while watching 'Good Morning America'
And good day, New York, have a good day in court
My niggaz drive around the hood looking for good yay' to snort

I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys

I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad and things will only get bad

So now I'm getting bad skin and I got that badge and
Tellin' me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin' a bad day

So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly [Incomprehensible]
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me, ""Don't touch me""

I went from pretty Willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thin's will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies

Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down
And bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down

Yeah, she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cuz she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home

So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin' scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulin Rouge on a too long cruise
She said, ""I ain't bonin' you with them two long shoes""

And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'ma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said, ""Ye' you don't love me?""
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly

Ayyo, good morning to Queens, the North side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life is when you're forced to make it ugly

Had a beautiful night 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and it's ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready to turn it up in these streets and make it ugly

Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these sisters that was ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly and lead a ball abruptly
But I took it all back 'cuz God don't like ugly

Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said, she had bad germs

The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and 'bout it
But the pussy smelled bad so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood

And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad, not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good when you leave with the good
It's all good in the hood, got called good 'cuz it's good

Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon' make me a good wife
So I'm good to go and I'm good where I go
Come on, man got good aim and that's a good thing to know

And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game so what's good with this paper?

Watch the hourglass drain itself, watch the smiles grow forced.
In retrospect, nothing turned out the way I thought; all is lost.

I guess I'm overly philosophical, but that's just my cross.
'Cause every time I stop to watch the present I see the corpse, decayed, of what once was.
Time's our guide on the path of life, and it's leading us astray as the blood turns cold.

[Chorus] 

All love lost

We all feed on expectation and dreams; damn whoever gets in the way.
The loved one today might be the scapegoat to be;
Fuck or get fucked-it's always been that way. 

[Chorus]

All is lost

Sweet promises whispered by lovers at night, given with passion before.
Say them again, look into my eyes and tell me- who's the whore? 

The deceiver will think himself deceived 
Forming a truth of his own, as they always do.
It's only a matter of what you want to believe,

Erratic lives, sporadic fights surround me in this human hive.

Staring out through eyes that have ceased to see.

It feels like my blood has turned to acid
Eating through my veins, seeping through my soul.
Every muscles aches with the adrenaline
And the world around me moves much too slow.

[Chorus]
I'm the ashes left from burning false beliefs.
I am the screaming, bleeding, raging hate that kills the weak.
I am retribution, retaliation, at any cost.

The rotten apple doesn't fall far from the rotten tree.
I can't be held responsible, I just do what the world has taught me.
A deviation I'll always be, so the world of false pretence
And hold no power over me. 

[Chorus]
So I shoulder the world rage, retribution is mine.
In the name of religion, politics, perversion I shall strike.
It's time to roll the dice with the stakes set high.

Get a grip, wake up you fucking puppets.
Never disputed, never disproved, never deceived and never
Fooled I stand, and the gun in my hand is my imagination.
Superior to all I cannot break nor fall.

Come and burn my weakness and my empathy,

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Conte Candoli,"Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side

But when you're gone

Conte Candoli,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Conte Candoli,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You
Conte Candoli,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

That you stole from the skies

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

Full of butterflies inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt

Now that we're cosy and clinging,

And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is

Well sir, all I can say is

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

If I were a bell

Conte Candoli,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

You are mine alone.

Continental Drifters,"Daddy was the eldest of ten
And my mama was an only child
She must've represented back then
The part of him that couldn't go wild
She was free
Something he could never be
'Cause daddy was the one
Who always took responsibility.

They met at a USO dance hall
At the start of the Second World War
She was gentle, kind and intelligent
Something daddy'd never known before
And they danced
Later on came the romance
'Cause daddy shipped out
Before he had the chance to ask for her hand.

But it all turned out all right
And he would lay in his hammock at night
Dreaming of a family and home
With the woman that he left behind
At night, his shipmates would go check out the bars
But daddy'd just stare at the stars
And dream of her
'Til he thought he might lose his mind.

They got married on V.E. Day
By the preacher from my mama's church
Mama'd always dreamed of a honeymoon
But daddy had to go back to work
He plowed those fields
Since the Navy never tought him a trade
Mama'd make his lunch
And they'd eat it out in the shade.


The boys were born in the fifties
Georgie, Herman and me
And we grew up wanting for nothing
'Til Georgie saw his first TV
It was the Christmas of 1959
There was a console in the living room
Well, mama and the boys watched variety shows
And daddy just stared out at the moon.

The drought hit hard in the sixties
And the irrigation couldn't control
Mama sighed when they sold the farm
But daddy lost a piece of his soul
He said ""Hard work is a virtue
And you should always work as hard as you can""
He said ""Hard work will never hurt you""
But he never said nothing about the land.

Yeah, but mama always told us boys
""You should follow the Golden Rule
Always look for the good in the other guy
But never be anyone's fool""
Then daddy'd laugh a little
Then he'd look out at his weather vane
Oh mama wants a rainbow
Daddy just wants it to rain.

They moved in with Herman's family
In the nice part of the city
Mama'd help Gina with the grandchildren
And tried to make the house look pretty
But daddy'd sit at his window
From when he got up 'til he went to bed
Just knowing that he'd failed his family
He couldn't get it out of his head.

It was the summer of 1978
When mama caught pneumonia and died
Daddy lost his will to live that fall
Now they're buried side by side
And in the midst of all our grief
Georgie said to our relief
""Well, mama got her rainbow
And it's starting to rain"".

He said ""Mama got her rainbow
And it's starting to rain"".

And it's starting to rain
It's starting to rain
It's starting to rain
It's starting to rain
It's starting to rain.

This heart needs a home
To keep it from stumbling
Out in the street
To keep it from suffering
A night without sleep
To keep it from dying.

Just a home with a room
To keep out the lightening
When it's thundering down
And the words grab the anger
And come dancing around
This shattered foundation.

When I close my eyes
I dream through the night
I dream I'm an angel just learning to fly
Brought up by the winds
And I'm taught by the clouds
When I open my eyes
I'm still on the ground.

This heart needs a home.

Hell, when I close my eyes
I dream through the night
I dream I'm an angel just learning to fly
Brought up by the winds
And I'm taught by the clouds
When I open my eyes
I'm still on the ground.

This heart needs a home
To keep it from stumbling
Out in the street
To keep it from suffering
A night without sleeping
To keep it from dying.

This heart needs a home
This home needs a heart
This heart needs a home
A home with some heart.

For most it does not come easily
For some it comes with pain
From a thought to a living sight
For some it's a life for some a game

Me da ganas de mear pero no se me abre la bragueta

Se sube con madre a la taberna

A ver si se la saben, espero
Que sí por que dice por ahí así...

Verse 1:

[Pato]
Un trío de mexicanos con machete en la mano 
Combinando todo el llano algo loco algo insano
[Fermín IV]
Venimos tronando el patrón
De barrio en barrio el rey Nuevo León
Que ha sido mi lado el más matón
No me digas cabrito porque soy un cabrón
[Pato]
Guadalupano hermano no lo sientas extraño
Conciencia reclamo sin llanto, sin daño 
why no lo sientas malsano porque soy mexicano
Levanto la mano, invoco al paisano
(Control Machete)

Control Machete... (x4)

Verse 2: Fermín IV
No es uno señor, somos 400
Si vieras por dentro verás lo que siento
No hay miedo a caer, vamos sacudiendo
Todo el alucine que sigue creciendo

Control Machete...

[Pato]
Cuenta las horas, comienza hermano
Derrama la flama del buen grin-gosano
Pues todo comienza como una canción
El crazy gringo why un poco de alcohol
[Fermín IV]
Ahora que el tequila se mete en la sangre
Crudo penetra hasta adormilarte
Dicen que un frasco puede emborracharte
Pero unos tragos pueden llegar a calmarte
[Pato]
Tan sólo una opción
Toma en cuenta una fuerte adicción
[Fermín IV]
Todo mi respeto para el loco gusano
Sigue en el fondo e ignoro su estado

Chorus: x2
       
Flota why flota el pinche gusano
(Y no va a parar)

Verse 2:

[Fermín IV]
Nada en la mente
(No estoy inconsciente)
Nada en el charco
(Y nada aguardiente)
Sombras why luces golpean de pronto
Giros why giros why si que estoy solo
[Pato]
Sostoron why no llevo prisa
Sostoron la llevo tranquila
[Fermín IV]
Se empaña el vidrio se pone caliente el ambiente 
aunque no haya gente consciente, sonriente

Me la paso flotando
Vivo ahogado en mi propio llanto

Sostoron acabo en saliva

Mexican curio no me vas a decir
Que no sabías que también somos humanos 
why nos llaman hermanos mexicanos
Te llevaste una sorpresa calmado
(No ves que está muy tranquila esta pinche fiesta)
La fusca es nuevecita why no pienso usarla
Hay que bendecirla por la sangre mexicana
Tirada en la calle de los güeros (En el río) 
Frente a la mirada de mi gente why de mis hijos
why si crees que es sencillo deshacerte de mí
No soy paciente why no respondo 
(Yo) por mis (reacciones)
Si te pones agresivo en la frente
Un sólo tiro paz (Si te pones muy al grito)
Si recuerdas yo desciendo
why tengo sangre de Pancho Villa
why a caballo why en la droga tengo mi puntería
(Cuando quieras echarle un porrazo
ya sabes compadre, que si nos vemos en algún lado
es para agarrarnos a chingazos)
Ja, ja, que vas a poner un muro (Sabemos taladrar)
Por seguro te damos duro za, za (Por tres)
Za, za (Por tres)
why no pienses que con eso tu me vas a detener
Ni de broma ni en serio tu podrás tener 
Los huevos que tenemos por marianos
Si recuerdas pinche güero
Porque tus leyes no me rigen en tu casa ni en la mía
(Pinche güero)
Voy a estar sentado como quiera en tu cocina
Fumándome un cigarro why tomándome tequila
Viendo tu tele why comiendo tu comida

¿Qué pasa, te sientes derrotado?
Que ya no puedes mantenerte de tu lado
Si observas, no existe diferencia

Como a las once, se madruga Lupita
Se va a embarcar en un bote de vapor...

Verse 1: Fermín IV

Pinche Lupita, te fuiste con Juanita
Nomás te gusta andar atras de puras señoritas
(Marimacha), tras las muchachas 
La mueven los colores rojos why unas buenas fachas
Labios pintados de color morado
Le gusta que la besen unos de color rosado
En el palo no la mueven
Le gustaba mejor el cero
why si está tapado mejor el agujero
(Flaca) cabrona pero nada la detiene
Sabe ser una putita cuando se lo propone
Arpone toda la raza está extrañada
Porque ella ahora se cree Marilupe Macha
Pinche Lupita ahora sí que me mareaste
Mareaste comadre, why me chantajeaste
Ahora si que vienes nomás porque te conviene
Por lana, comida, mi machete no te detiene

(Pinche Lupita, si no lloro nada más me acuerdo)

Chorus:

Pinche Lupita, pinche culera
Pinche Lupita, puta, ramera
Pinche Lupita, pinche lesbiana
Pinche Lupita, pinche marimacha

(Un cabro si veo que esta pinche vieja
se fue a la chingada why le valió madre)

Verse 2: Fermín IV

Después me contaron, que se la encontraron
En las piernas de una güera allá en el otro lado
Muy buena la güera, como la pantera
La mejor ruquita que había hecho mies vieja
Que se la toparon casi en cualquier antro
Este cuidado se roba el mandado
Le gusta la Josefa, de cualquier cosecha
Sea buena, sea negra ella si que se entrega
La entresega si le encanta en la merienda o en la cena
Para desayunar, solamente una botella
Dicen que la arma que carga su escopeta
Adonde se dirija ella entra por la puerta
Principal o la de atrás no importa que tenga llave
De seguro sabe abrirla ella sabe como le hare

Verse 3: Fermín IV

Un cada padre no las hacen como antes
Ahora hay lesbianas why hasta tienen sus aguantes
Anclan el rancho les llaman más churras
Marimachas quizás pero son más chorras
Se ponen pantalón why se salen a los bailes
A ver a quién atrapan a quien no le guste el sable
Pinche Lupita si fue que me rolabas
Como aquí padezco desde que la mataras
Por tu culpa los balazos se arman en cualquier parte 
Porque quieres a las viejas bajarles un faje
Viejas casadas, solteras o divorciadas
No te importa el estado mientras tengas tu bombache
Armas el desmadre pinche Lupita
Cuando le hechas humo a cualquier conchita
Si que te mamaste cuando me dejaste 
Por una pinche vieja que ni me presentaste

Verse 1: Fermín IV
Si crees que se le está acabando el vuelo, no
Esto está comenzando
El danzón ya empezó a tocar (pararara) 
why no ha terminado, no
El paso del tiempo va imponiendo el respeto
why la calidad va mano a mano con la cantidad, viene 
(Viene) viene marcando la pauta why el sentimiento
Mi vida empieza desde adentro
Siempre brota lo que siento
Es verdad lo digo why me comprometo
Responsable soy why lo lamento
Pero creo que es el crecimiento
Por ahora está en el mejor momento
El amanecer siempre aparece corrigiendo al anochecer
why las cosas que se ven nacer
Hay que verlas madurar why crecer

Verse 2: Pato
Viviendo por suerte why clandestinamente
Más no estaba muerto solamente ausente
Si paré de pronto, nunca indiferente
No acabó el danzón why sigue igual que siempre
Si continúa el corazón
Ritmos unidos sobre ilusión
Noche a noche se escucha la voz
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Ruben Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón
Songoro cosongo songe be
Songoro cosongo de mamey
Que se está bailando en cada rincón
Que está sonando en tu corazón

Verse 3: Fermín IV
Suena que suena las cartas sobre la mesa
No hay quien detenga esto nadie se mueva
Así es, todo tiene su tiempo why si estás dispuesto
A sembrar why cultivar hay que ver el fruto madurar
Hasta donde puede llegar sólo hay que desarrollar
Ampliar, solamente crear es inmenso el lugar
Espacio suficiente como para cohabitar
Escucha mi tierra hare eco
Entre las montañas se hare camino el concreto
Señales de humo que van creciendo cada día más
Tratando de comunicar
Exponiendo los adentros a la luz como van
Sin borrar nada sin tapar nada sin ocultar nada
Se presentan testimonios reales
El sentimiento no es más que puras verdades

Verse 4: Pato
Reuniendo por suerte why discretamente
Más no estaba lejos respectivamente
Si lo que se mueve proviene del vientre
No acabó el danzón why ha de seguir pa' siempre
Si se ha dado la ocasión
Ciertos sonidos de imaginación
Día a día que visita el sol
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Rubén Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón

Ayunar de color why sonido

Llovizna que aterriza, directo
Monte en la cara... perfecto

Olvidar lo que queda atrás, extendiéndome adelante

Dulce anhelo, melodioso celo
Calma impaciencia, iniciado nuevo

Abstractos términos lineales
Sol why lunas vicerales...

Actuemos una misma cosa, ahora todos
Como nunca, continúa why se acentúa
Pero no hay cosa segura

Apreciada es la vida, prosigo why la esfera
Sigue dando vueltas, completas, esperanza

No pereza si promesa, directo a la meta
Camino no vereda, día, certeza, no se paga renta
No,no, aquí es toda la vida completa, hecha
Cliente, al que tengo que mantener
Consciente, al que tengo que proteger
Tierra que se asoma por encima de la niebla

Verse 4: Pato
Desde el sueño torna tormenta en velo

Por querer hacemos, pues si duermo sueño
No podría callar, timar o desviar

Control Machete,"Por lo que está, por lo que venga, artillería pesada presenta

Conservo, conservo, conservo el aire, interrumpo y respiro
Vuelta tras vuelta reiniciando el giro
Cuando enciendo y me guío por la estela
Ese se arronda y la muerte me lleva
(Artillería pesada, controlada, artillería pesada, el machete)

Desatado, me enseñan, me animan, creen en mi como yo creo
Ejemplo, son mis ojos, son mis puños, puros cabrones
Hay fuerza, hay mente, hay
(Artillería pesada, controlada, artillería pesada, el machete)

Mucho mejor percibo el panorama
La noche llega y presenta a su dama
Libre, al fin fuera cualquier condena
Subo entre voces de adentro a afuera
(Artillería pesada, controlada, artillería pesada, el machete)

Contra corrientes, flojos, proveedores
Unos cuantos contadores de la vida
Corrigen corridas, alivian heridas
Ah hasta esas las que nunca se olvidan
(Puros mexicanos que controlan el machete)

Navego en calle, intercepto y olvido todo aquello que llevo conmigo
Cuando me cedo en total relevo donde el día retrasa el vuelo
(Artillería pesada, controlada, artillería pesada, el machete)

Continúo, lógicamente para arriba
Son mi coraje, son mi paciencia mi bandera y también arma secreta
¿No sabías? Artillería pesada presente
(Artillería pesada, controlada, artillería pesada, el machete)

Los moradores reciben el manto
Hay quienes creen, hay quien no cree tanto
Único en todos y en todos cualquiera
Expresión y código de guerra
(Artillería pesada, controlada, artillería pesada, el machete)

Sí, claro, hay extraterrestres locales, visitantes, todos importantes
Son mis manos, son mi gente, son el apoyo que falta en esos dos tristes
(Golpes doy, golpes recibo y sigo, por lo que se, por lo que vivo)
(Golpes doy, golpes recibo y sigo, por lo que soy, por lo que vivo)

Despego, despego, despego en grande, iniciando y prosigo
Solo un ser vivo de entrañas sentidos
Cuando lo que faltaba aparece hablando y escuchando ese
(Artillería pesada, controlada, artillería pesada, el machete)

Ahora sí son mi mente, mi corazón, son mi sangre
Respeto a toda la gente que está conmigo
En las buenas y en las malas, sin importar el motivo
(Artillería pesada, controlada, artillería pesada, el machete)

Luz y reflejos resaltan caminos
Sólo recuerdo al que está conmigo
Por lo que está, por lo que venga
De la esquina, a mi vida, en senda

Sobre este planeta tenemos nuestros pies todos

Independientes en nuestra forma de pensar

Que me lleva hasta allá directo al mar
Conduce hacia adentro navegar pensamientos razonamientos

Mira más, mira todo igual
No se voltea hasta el total

No estoy hablando de ningún problema
Es sólo una capacidad manantial de ideas
Aparecen las cuestiones a un lado de las soluciones
Correcciones que nos hacen volver a empezar 
Con los pies más firmes why ya no tropezar
why así es mirar apreciar why así realizar
Completar, uniones formar
Somos parte de una siembra que no puedes imaginar
Somos fruto de semillas del mismo lugar
Cultivadas con la misma mano

No sé por que me extraña

Hey, ¿qué es lo que pasa? Sabor

Siempre ando con son
En todo el día no hay ni un bajón
Siempre al tiro, arribo, a tiempo admiro
Todo el panorama que hay en un giro

Por que así son mís días, complejo
María, agarro el vuelo como si fuera mía
La mira está puesta sobre la mesa
La tarde se presta pa' andar con la mera artillera

Y responde con una mentira pa' salir del momento
Y encontrar la salida. completo
Termino, con cierta paciencia, así son mis días
Cuando piso la tierra  así son mis días
Y es que así son mis días

Como todo doy, mucho es lo que tengo
Homies, carnales, todos son mis maestros
Y es que nunca soy
Lo que prefirieron, soy lo que soy

No lo eligieron. pasa la vida, la sigo sin prisa
Simplemente observo lo que requería, pasa mi vida
Y no es tan vacía, siento que más necesitaría

Fué tan bueno hoy como después lo presiento
Fiesta con homies, barrio sin lamento
Esto no es bajón, es hasta el firmamento
Golpes y golpes y nunca reviento

Sombra de día, duro hasta arriba
Ando tranquilo, no hay melancolía
Mientras haya cuerdas, saco la espina
Sigo con la banda gastando la esquina
Así son mis días, y es que así son mis días

How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

No sun shines for me
Savage but gentle
The animal within
And I see it now

I had a weird dream
Watch but don’t touch
I had a weird dream
I’m taking it away

Put it in a bag, hide it in a tree

I want to steal your heart, your heart
With these eyes I cannot see
And this cold heart never bleeds, never

Sweet smell this poison, the colour you bring
Tongue swollen venoms, to touch, to love
I want to steal your heart, I want to eat your heart
I reach for the sky but never can touch

It seems so easy, easy to me
Still I cannot, will not take this thing
Hearsay, this heresy
A victim to sin

Eternal the torment, the answer lies within

I had a weird dream, I’m taking it away

Always feeling sorry for myself

My precipice of selfishness, I keep hitting a wall

Always falling off this beaten path, I'm tired of fading away

The gaping nothing has my soul in a vice
Can You take this death from me and then replace it with life?

There's nothing good here left for me on this earth
But a six-by-three, six feet down in the dirt

This one goes out to You
Solitude, at least that’s what I call it
Keeping those streets of gold on my mind
I don’t know why, as the years they pass me by
It gets harder just to take my time
No one to keep me from You
No one to stay my hand from seeking the truth
From reaching up for the only hope I ever knew
For every time I wasn't honest, kind, or true

I used to think I was lucky, but I've realized now I'm just blessed that I found some sort of home in a heart even though I lived so long in selfishness. Because I've learned you know my heart more than you know my routine and most nights it’s all I need to be able to fall asleep. Because I've learned running away from home is like finding strength in weakness, but I always come back around knowing that I can't continue to live like this. So thank you for your honesty, I've found that love has gone from just being sobering to being so refreshing. And even if pain doesn't go away, I just thank God you decided to stay. Because I know I have purpose when you purposefully tell me you that see something in me, even when I can't see myself.

If this hasn't been waiting in vain, I could consider this monogamy
Living devoted and betrothed to the One
Who believed in me and wouldn't give up
If the clock looks like it ticks too slow
Even when its given time to grow
I'll know for sure that it was my own impatience
That I'd feel better if my ego was vacant

In closing, I'd like to thank You for her
For every word she spoke to help me rest assured
That I'm not lonely, that I'm not falling away
For every time she reminds me of You and lives up to her name
Thank you for everything, thank you for having patience with me
Thank you for reminding me that God is all that I will ever need

The love we made has lead us both astray
I can’t help but keep losing sleep

Doomed to repetition of inconsistency
Chained to obligations staring back at me
Cowering under the weight of consequences
I shouldn’t be here, I need a second chance
I need forgiveness, I need a second chance
I need a way out of this mess I’ve made myself

You make me feel like myself
When everything fades to black
You pull me out of this hell
And bring the color back

The worst kind of self-deprecation
Almost at my end, internalized contempt
Let my sighs give way to this song of Your strength
Repeating to myself that You have a plan for me

The life we’re willing to face
Open heart
A risk we’re willing to take

You pull me out of this hell
You bring the color back",Shining
Conveyer,"We can’t change the outcome, the eventual end to everything we know
Powerless to stop the ebb and flow of the hardened rains we gathered
Human kind will reap what we have sewn
The depressing waltz we live by, our pallid history
Will result in what we've paid for; The wages of humanity
At the end of the line, bodies give up souls
Running out of time
This is coming to a close

Curtains close at the end of the road
Sins unatoned by the Love we didn't know
Give me the world for what it is
Or nothing at all
Unsheltered from the awful truth
We don't know what we think we do

The minds of foolish men closed up behind our narrow heads
Assuming we know everything there is
Never questioning the reason we exist
We'll never give up our swinging at the wind
Building up our altar to tear it down again
Open your eyes and disconnect your mind
From the powers who profit from feeding you these lies

Give me the world for what it is
Or nothing at all
Unsheltered from the awful truth
We don't know what we think we do
This world is wasting away
And it could happen today
This world is wasting away
And it will happen",Waste
Convulse,"We ring your bell or knock on the backdoor
We creep like thieves in the blackest night
Even shadows are missing so you can't resist
Fast open your door and truth hits like a fist

Just the moment of the sun until my clouds come again and bring the rain
One minute the feeling that everything is bright and then darkness steps in
Pretend to be oblivious but something still gnaws
Immortal life sin inherited of my deeds",Memories

Met a girl with a drink in her hand.

And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
