The Primitives,"I just want to sit here doing nothing
Everybody's talking saying nothing
Maybe I should move on somewhere else
Give up trying to be like someone else

Everybody's going crazy
I don't care
I'm so lazy

Quite content to let the world pass by
Living every moment with closed eyes
Draw the curtains tell the stars good night
Oh the dreams that wait for me tonight

This whole world's crazy
I don't care
I'm so lazy

I just want to sit here doing nothing
Everybody's talking saying nothing
Maybe I should move on somewhere else
Give up trying to be like someone else

Everybody's going crazy
I don't care
I'm so lazy

I think I'll go to sleep

The Primitives,"i see no feeling in your eyes
no love no meaning in your eyes
when i with you i don't know why
cant think straight i don't know why
and if its all the same to you i think ill take a walk
cuz your too loud and your really stupid
cant stand another second of your talk
cuz your too loud and your really stupid
stop your saying 
its really stupid

i'm sitting here listening to your voice
i'm losing myself in your voice
when i'm with you i've got no choice
found me loving with your voice
and if its all the same to you i think i'll stay outside

cuz your too loud and your really stupid
take a look around for a place to hid
cuz your too loud and your really stupid
stop your saying 
its really stupid

i see no feeling in your eyes
no luv no meaning in your eyes
i see no feeling in your eyes
cuz everything you say is lies
and if its all the same to you i think i'll take a walk

cuz your too loud and your really stupid
cant stand another second of your talk
cuz your too loud and your really stupid
stop your saying

No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

The Proclaimers,"Since I started being impressed
By the things that move me 
All the treasures that I missed
Came back to stand around me
And as I curse the wasted time

I lift my head to say
Thank you god you gave the strength
That helped me walk away

Still stays within my heart
And I can't recall the last time
I imagined they'd depart

But this is what I'm going to do
When they force me to doubt
I'll ask for what I know remains

To help me sing them out
As rays of sun shine through the clouds
To heat the soaking ground

We'll burn the theaters down

And he's lost his job as this years begun
And it broke my heart

Saw his wife who was fifty-two

That her single wage would just have to do
And it broke my heart

Talked about it with the family now
What began in sadness ended up a row
All the guys with the clever mouths
They were saying we should move south

And he's down already with a job to seek
And he's in Kings Cross and there's no-one speaking

The Proclaimers,"I'm not going to talk about doubts and confusion
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
I'd never been to Ayrshire
I hitched down one saturday
Sixty miles to Kilmarnock
To see Hibernian play
The day was bright and sunny
But the game I won't relay
And there was no Kilmarnock Bunnet
To make me want to stay

But I'm not going to talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
When I started walking at Wishaw
My eyes obscured my vision
After five miles on my way
I began to learn to listen

I walked through the country
I walked through the town
I held my head up
And I didn't look down

The answer's always ""aye""

Is where the land meets the sky.",The Joyful Kilmarnock Blues
The Proclaimers,"When you go will you send back
A letter from America?
Take a look up the rail track
From Miami to Canada

Broke off from my work the other day
I spent the evening thinking about
All the blood that flowed away
Across the ocean to the second chance

I wonder how it got on
When it reached the promised land?

I've looked at the ocean
Tried hard to imagine
The way you felt the day you sailed
From Wester Ross to Nova Scotia

We should have held you
We should have told you
But you know our sense of timing
We always wait too long

Lochaber no more
Sutherland no inure
Lewis no more
Skye no more

I wonder my blood
Will you ever return?
To help us kick the life back
To a dying mutual friend

Do we not love her?
Do we not say we love her?
Do we have to roam the world
To prove how much it hurts?

Bathgate no more
Linwood no more
Methil no more
Irvine no more

If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die

She visits my grave when the night winds wail

In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

is what we're fighting for just what we're wring for
these notes i write are more just line me behind a metaphor
scripting with a purpose the fire that's burning
yearning to show us the light in times that's uncertain
the struggles so fragile being reduced to gravel the built back again
a breathe of live refreshing a dead mannequin a new man
begins a new champion claims the win for the team
well versed in the lessons of hurt it's extreme insecurities
we have are written right on our sleeve likeâ€¦
tabs of acid name brands and badges and birth control
give in medicinal patches addiction is fashioned acceptable
actions from sociable addict
living this sickly image in this modern day Rome we murder our own
die by the cell phone and yet we can't can not connect that buying gem stones
does not reflect or make a good home
government judging the world by the way that we live and yet our parents are afraid of our kids
teachers would rather suspend in stead of listen to 'em
lost pursuing this American dream my father giving me a
song to sing to put my mind at ease ",Simple Song
The Procussions," hey.....the war is on outside
this ain't a soundclash turn it up high say hey.....
fists up toward the the night sky
and light it up with a battle cry
my people....you hear the rain coming
you gonna stand fast, or just keep running
hey....this life is a long fight
even when the lightening strikes

Stro
i've got my armor and artillery
hands on a weapon in fact that's ready to attack all enemies
living with a life given back to the creator
an out of shape soldier in a swamp full of gators
on the mission i've been given it's deep
i'm forgiven so i've got an innervision of peace
in the rhythm of life i breathe
i'm fighting with a fire inside that burns brighter
till the final bell rings

Mr J Medeiros
I was born in a violent storm in an endless fight between right and wrong
i write songs like letters from war
stuff a message in a bottle then i send it to shore
encouragement for the men and woman who lost steam
rebel music for my people who been swimming upstream
yo some things are not what they seem
who you thought was the peasant might just be the King

Hook

Rez
I'm learning total humility brought by humidity
frustration draining to the sides of my face
feel cry from your grace tears seep into my cheek
every crease in my face is a stroke of war paint
just battlefield journalist capturing a picture of this
combat mission from a complex prison
wage war on my inner that's riddled with imperfection
my sword swung high as the storm subsides

Mr J Medeiros
I was not made just so i could decay
these songs aren't played just so we can get paid
i walk in the Way and the Truth til the Light works through me
i ain't afraid to say the word beauty
i ain't afraid to be odd
i know the path is hard but somehow im getting closer to God
knowing by His scars i am healed i kneel in the storm

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

A suit to wear on mondays
And a coat a magazine
A heavy rain on holiday

A knife a fork and memories
A light to see it all

That I can understand
Hey I never meant that stuff
I want to turn you round

Dominoes a pack of cards
A picture of the queen
A dress to wear on sundays
And a handle for the door
A letter that I sent for you
A note you left for me
A wave a pack of cigarettes
A pocket full of beads

Hey I never meant that stuff
I want to turn you on

You didn't leave me anything
That I can understand
Hey I never meant that stuff
I want to turn you on

The sound of people getting drunk
A ceiling and a sky
A bank that's full of promises
A telephone that lies
A visit from your doctor
He crawls in through the door
A mirror you can look in
So that you know where you are

You didn't leave me anything
That I can understand
Hey I never meant that stuff
I want to turn you round
You didn't leave me anything
That I can understand
Now I'm left with all of this
A roomful of your trash",All of This and Nothing [#][*][Demo Version]
The Psychedelic Furs,"Mrs. Jones is 17 and 6 and 24 moderately pretty
She is all the girls you know
We are going far away, we're going for a ride
Mr. Jones has got a plan if you just come inside

So good, so far, slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on, I don't want to dance

Mr. Jones is beautiful, your eyes are made of glass
Looking through the window you can see the world go past
Here's another 9 o'clock and here's another day
Wonder how the weather is and what the people say

So good, so far, slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on, I don't want to dance

Mr. Jones can turn you on and turn you off again
Mr. Jones is all of you who live inside a plan
Put your head upon the pillow never put it down
That would only wake you up and turn your head around

So good, so far, slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on, I don't want to dance

The Psychedelic Furs,"Love is hiding in the city
Here in all of you
Put the place in cages
But don't label it a zoo

Get a girl inside your head
Get out of the way
Write yourself a postcard
When there's nothing left to say

There's danger, I believe it
Wake up, it's a fight
Love me now forever
War's on it's now or never

Mr. Clean Air just went past
Eating chewing gum
He doesn't want to see you
He gets sick when you come

Make yourself up once again
Kick out in a style
Ann don't let her sadness show
She paints on a smile

Danger, I believe it
Wake up, it's a fight
Love me now forever
The war's on, it's now or never

Always it is now
Love me, in the jail house
Pictures of the losers
Crying that's enough

Get a girl inside your head
Get out of the way
Write yourself a postcard
When there's nothing left to say

Love is hiding in the city
Hearing all of you
Put the plays in cages
But don't labor in a zoo

There's danger, I believe it
Wake up, it's a fight
Love me now forever
War's on, it's now or never
Now or never

There's emptiness behind their eyes
There's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all
And take us all apart

Where nothing is ever put straight

And loses herself in her
Dreaming and sleep, and her
Lovers walk through in their coats

Pretty in pink, isn't she?
Pretty in pink, isn't she?

Talk of her notes and the
Flowers that they never sent
And wasn't she easy, and
Isn't she pretty in pink?

First in the line is the
Last to remember her name
He's walking around in this
Dress that she wore
She is gone, but the
Joke's the same

I saw every time you fake
I held on the hand that takes
And you hate it when I break

What type of drugs do you do? 
And what do you do to get your hands on your shit mothafucka huh??!! 
What kind of dirty tricks you do to get yourself fixed? 
You're all sick; is it lack of love? or lack of your withdrawal? 
Drugs!! I need femine venoms in the system 
In order to function in the rhythm 

You get hook to the look of wild vomen 
And want to live in the land of the unforgiven 
Habits turn bad ones 
Individuals make 'em poison rituals 

Gotta have it a have it, a habit 
Welcome your traces of an addict 
God forgive me for my bad habits, 
Drug addict needle in my vein, I gotta have it 

To kill the pain, you silly rabbit 
I dig a hole under the sun to hide from the static 
Automatic pressure got to kill it 
Give some act-right juice so I could feel it 

Ah, now everything is all right 
The eye of the needle cries out to the dark side 
Looking inside through the outdoor knocking 
But society won't let me in so I grab my stocking 

Put over my head and get the dough 
'Cause the needle is my God and smack is my soul 
Parahernaila in my domain brings conclusion 
That I'm using but the question is, am I abusing 

Infested in the residence of pico union 
Drug intrusion, color fusion 
Invasion! of your senses maintain relapse 
Dilate eye lenses, my dependence on these chemical artificial dreams 
Is what makes my habit obscene 

[Chorus]
What type of drugs do you do? 
And what do you do to get your hands on your shit mothafucka huh??!! 
What kind of dirty tricks you do to get yourself fixed? 
You're all sick; is it lack of love? or lack of your withdrawal? 
Drugs!! I need femine venoms in the system 
In order to function in the rhythm 

Tinted like the darkest shadows, my mind is cloudly subliminal 
Commands will penetrate then I get rowdy conditions 
Drowsy, the sedative brings negative enemies 
I slump down and stay ahead of me 

Powerful like metamphetamines my state is altered 
This here's no lie hydroponic, chronic 
Got you feeling all erotic aphrodisiac, who's got it? 
Alvarado maniacs risk poison time buying dimes 

When you got the fix get in the mix 
There's no denving drug's the only factor 
Got me in the rapture making an addict out of you 
And proceed to capture you mind 

You're mine, choke hold to your whole skull, substance uncontrolled 
Who holds straight keys to locks and unlocks key holes 
The structure of my trip is unstoppable 
I'm 50 hits of the dot all powerful 

We go deranged and remain living the last days in the haze of purple micro 
I remember when I was a high school star 
Had the proom queen, scholarship, brand new car 
It's funny, you never know who your friends are 

'til you lose all your sensibilities to the act-right 
But I'm all wrong; no wonder my family 
Don't want to have nothing to do with me 
Humiliation, neglect, no respect 

The concept of rehabilitation has been swept 
I wish I was clean a far fetched dream 
But what other way am I going to blow of my steam 
Heaven's all in this bottle of juice making me feel high 

Making me feel loose, get nowhere turn to no one 
Trust me, I don't even trust myself",Confessions of a Drug Addict [Album Version]

Despite the rules I choose to be, 
One of the chosen few
Leavin' you confused, dazed 
And what got you all amazed
How the fuck we could be so blazed?
It takes one block to fill your life with terror
Think of all your bullet holes 
Embedded in your area
Bullet, bullet and in the end, 
Who gets shot by motherfuckers making hip hop?
We came here to get you high, 
Represent underdogs world-wide
On the hustle leading crooked lives
We don't die, we multiply; but we divide
So how are we gonna survive?
You got your role, I got mine; don't cross paths
Cause an intersection's just another form of Clash, we crash

Due to violent environments, 
Crimes terrorize rhyme events
I'm bringing the streets to the stage, 
Rockin' your front page
L.A., street families are crumblin' we legacies
There must be some type of way out of this pain
Said the joker chain smokin' weed train
Take aim stop random cappin', 
Shoot a hootah captain

We're raised by gunshots and low life in hip-hop
Do you rock or do you get locked 
In fights with glocks?
We come from psycho cities and blocks

Will spirits dancing in the flesh accept
when somebody changes the music 
And the tune is death
We don't dance around bonfires
We get stoned, tripped or wired
In memory of those expired
My people's exodus results in prejudice
You ask us why, in poverty, 
We become terrorists
Now let me tell you this
We don't choose to tote gats
And sellin' on the corner is to avoid tax
If you gun talk or hip-hop 
There's too much division
So find a new mission or it'll stop
We do our thing, talk slang, live on fast lanes
Some do it for money, and others for the fame
You're out playin games dangerous with high aim
How long will you maintain before you get slain?

Clearing the mind but my soul is mad

This jam right here is dedicated
To all you motherfucker that ain't right here
You're supposed to be right here with me, motherfucker
You know what I'm saying ?
You know what the fuck I'm saying
I'll catch up with you soon, homies
Ah ah, yeah, we'll catch up to you all
All of you motherfucker
And you know what I'm saying
cause at the end, at the end we all diiiie

[Jacken]
Sounds like Gods are crying tears of Malathion
Raining over your head to put out the fire
Who desires to die? besides, the suicidal tendencies
Can lead to the eternal sleep
So keep you eyes wide open and alive
Grab your snake and ride to the other side
If your intention is to defy death
I'll tell you now, even the best get laid to rest
We're on our way to the stone garden 
End of the road were everybody goes but not forgotten
Frames all rotten souls travel to unravel
Other worlds and big cloud castles
Why do we have these hassles, livin' cautious
Walking the street watching your back?
Your fear's collosus
We conquer souls while ganja rolls
Everybody here's high so the story unfolds
We're on another planet thought, thinking immortal
But the path we're on leads us straight to the portal

They're coming to claim us
Let it come as no surprise
I stare into the face of death
'Cause at the end of their time, everybody dies

[Mr Duke]
This is a time of pain
Warzone for your own gain
I roam the middle with the metal ?cause I'm insane
Break frames... catch a smoking
Is it gonna earn you a name?
Did you get slain?
Or fall victim to bald knuckle-heads and bad aim
It ends all the same
Every mothafucker right here gotta jump on soul train
Some go up, some go south
Some get stuck in a realm with no way out
Some get to hide, O.D. on drug hits,
Dying in your sleep, that's the shit
But lives get took violently
On the streets of a lost city

Chorus: [Duke & (Jacken)] X2

Let it come as no surprise
I stare into the face of death
'Cause at the end of their time, everybody dies

[B-Real]
In the stone garden, we keep all the heavenly gates packed
With fresh souls under control, no holdin' back
Look at all these names engraved in the stones
Even the unknown finds his path on his way home
Roam... where the spirits all lie
One of these fuckin' days, even I'm gonna die
And when I do, I'll be another memory
Hanging out with the ones who were there before me
Look out haaa... let me set your soul free
By the Buddha tree, open the gates to eternity
Everybody rise up, open up your eyes
We demise and we're trippin' to the other side

Yeah at the end, at the end
We'll catch up with you
You know what I'm saying, that's it
We all die then motherfucker
Yeah even if you take me out by now
One of my motherfucker's gonna take you up
And then you'll take him and back and forth and shit

The Psycho Realm,"Do you even know the reason for your blastin'? 
It's pointless. You grab your stainless, do your action he stay's motionless 
Because of your error, they label this era terror 
Drop the coke and the mirror keep your nose clearer 
The outcome of what you've done shook slums of rivals 
From other sides with guns, soldier, and knives 
You took one of their lives and finished it 
Now they decide they want to retaliate 
Find you ass and even shit 
In memory of lost souls, in honor of their homeboys 
Dying here in south los 
Now don't even decide you want to hide 
If they find whothey're looking for, they shoot whoever's inside 
Your little street family 
They drive by your block and shot randomly 
You thinks it's best to test 
Lead 'em on a quest not cease 
And in the end let one of your homeboys rest in peace 

I'm looking for you, I'm gonna get you back 
When I catch you on the street slippin' 
That ass is mine 
Crazily all up in my face with your set trippin' 
And that ass is mine 
Ahh sit murder clique jumping from behind the fence 
And that ass is mine 
The big payback I'm gonna get you muthafucka 
That ass is mine 
I'm living in southside, avoiding my death 
With cautious steps 
I might end up serving a point for someone's rep 
That's why a gun is kept I will employ its services 
If I need to stop their plot from being murderous 
Can't be a victim of fool who stick 'em 
They walk through life with the wicked smiles and piles of loot 
Don't hesitate to shoot in the quest for dead residents 
They're getting rich at the expense of dead presidents 
A lot of rascals causing deep fiascoes 

If you come across 'em avoid 'em; their mentality is 
Blast those who ain't down with me 
They got something I want and I'll take it 
If they resist it's permanent sleep 
Don't try to be brave; you'll end up in the grave 
It's quite impossible to reform thosewho misbehave 
Crooks who took will continue to take 
Leave shook with no question and then break 
No scene seems to break his trance of nice dreams 
For visine disguises the red so his eyes gleam 
Another situation will arise 
Until the instigator takes his turn to die 
In the south side 

I'm looking for you, I'm gonna get you back 
When I catch you on the street slippin' 
That ass is mine 
Crazily all up in my face with your set trippin'

[Mr. Duke] 

I told the tower of power we can work together 

But I guess they rather see wars and scars better 

Street veterans holding enemy bandera 

And then we're caught up in the web of the guerra 

We're all fightin' and fightin' and lose lives 

At the end everyone dies 

We're all cursed like that bu the maker

No Rolls we roll old-mobile 

More real than majority, we're docile but still 

Other sides get more peeled hit by street teams 

Big paybacks and police beatings 

I can't replace my home with peacefull silence 

But my roots are planted in this city of violence

Truth sparks revolution and is therefore labeled violent 

Condemned to the silent movement of rebels who are defiant 

Sick-ciders spreading our venoms like sick spiders 

We construct a web and catch all those who fight us 

Capture threads at your head 

Crash units switch to code red 

Find you in a ditch undercover dirt bed 

Who said they was untouchable but instead 

Catch the end of their ropes all hopes bled 

Out your village, pillage empires rank higher

Everybody wants a piece of your pie, do you qualify?

Let live in the land of the chaotic, abusive ""Lost Cities""

Situations escalate in the date of 2001
Revelation, or is it just my imagination?

And cashless systems

I was petrified 
Kept thinking I could never live 
without you by my side 
But I spent so many nights 
Just thinking how you did me wrong 
And I grew strong 
And I learned how to carry on 
and so you're back 
from outer space 
I just walked in to find you here 
with that sad look upon your face 
I should have changed my stupid lock 
I should have made you leave your key 
If I had known for just one second 
you'd be back to bother me 

Go on now go walk out the door 
just turn around now 
'cause you're not welcome anymore 
weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye 
you think I'd crumble 
you think I'd lay down and die 
Oh no, not I 
I will survive 
as long as i know how to love 
I know I will stay alive 
I've got all my life to live 
I've got all my love to give 
and I'll survive 
I will survive 

It took all the strength I had 
not to fall apart 
kept trying hard to mend 
the pieces of my broken heart 
and I spent oh so many nights 
just feeling sorry for myself 
I used to cry 
Now I hold my head up high 
and you see me 
somebody new 
I'm not that chained up little person 
still in love with you 
and so you felt like dropping in 
and just expect me to be free 
now I'm saving all my loving 
for someone who's loving me

While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song

Of people whose necks and backs are aching
Whose sight and hearing's fading

Speaking of hearing, I can't take too much loud music

I mean I like to play it, but I sure don't like the racket
Noise, but I can't hear anything
Just guitars screaming, screaming, screaming
Some guy screaming in a leather jacket

If you're seeing a friend
Two weeks later I was riding the same train

I saw her face and then I read the name
It said she'd been beaten pretty bad 
And there was a picture of her grief-stricken Mom and Dad
And I wondered what happened to her books and her things

With some whipped cream on it, that would taste so unreal

Or undercut with rage

Things out here can get a little crazy
People are aimless - not so smart - a bit lazy
Things in my neighbourhood can get a little rough
But that's where my room is, that's where I keep my stuff

Women around here don't fare all too well
There's usually a comment or a taunt from some loser who smells
The ones who get married or shack up don't last too long
Their men like to fight - sometimes with guns

Things out here can get a little crazy
People are aimless - not so smart - a bit lazy
Things in my neighbourhood can get a little rough
But that's where my room is, that's where I keep my stuff

Some of the old ones have lived here for years
They keep their places nice in spite of everything
Once they had a meal for the lonely and downtrodden
Now they lock their doors tight - those days are forgotten

At night there's a lot of yelling at each other and to themselves
I hope I never hear somebody's final cry for help
There's a lot of hate out there so I keep my head down
Past the 7-11, down my dark street till I get home

And the way that we talk turns our heasds around

But when you speak it gets watered down

I know I'm not very articulate
I can't express myself innocuously
But what I say - it comes from the heart

Before she finds another boy who will sit her by the fireplace
And sing her a song

In a world that's come apart
And the deafening sound of a bursting bubble
Wakes you up with a start
Is there nowhere that is safe

Why can't we change the rules so I win
All I need is an escape
A temporary place to hide
When she's coming in the door when she's walking out the door

Hard to tell which is worse
That false feeling of relief when she comes in
Or the empty feeling when she's gone
And every night on the streets the forces of darkness

Score another victory
And I stand with the timid waiting for the devil
To make a martyr of me

Fold up the tents and load up the trucks
'Cause it's time to move on
If we only knew where to go
I hope that we'd already be gone

And even when we're lying together, I make sure she falls asleep first
It seems when things are at their best, my mind starts to wander
To things at their worst

Or do I roll over and let her break the glass around my heart
And set off the alarm

But when it comes to matters of the heart I'll tell you right up front
I'm playing by the book

Baby, there is one thing I am saving just for you
Darling, I got one thing I ain't giving to nobody but you
Sometimes if she's not shy I like to steal a little kiss
A little kiss if she's willing and young

Sometimes she'll be a little too eager
(I hate it when they almost choke you with their tongue)
That's when I back off and try and catch my breath
And think of what I've got to lose

She might be pretty and witty and fun but between the two of you
I know who I'll chose

Sometimes I go too far - the girls just think I'm icky
They can see the boner in my pants
I know I should keep my hands to myself
But I can't -- I just can't

My skin gets creepy crawly and I'm so alcoholly
That I know it's time for me to leave

Laugh at my body but then turn off the light and put out

Cigarette dangles

Cigarette dangles

(Open up the bomb bay)
I want to ride that wave
Your cigarette dangles, my flesh is weak
Pedal to the metal darlin', 'cause I'm about to peak

Now sit up straight, hook your legs through the rocking chair
I want to find a new way to show you how I care
Cigarette dangles

Move your hair off your face so I can find your lips
Want to taste pepper on your mouth and on your fingertips
I hear the cats scratching at the door
You say, ""I'll feed them later, 
Get back on the floor""
Your cigarette dangles

How much is enough? Deciding that is kind of tough

I never would have done it if I hadn't got so stinking
Good thing I found out before I brought her home
But then forgot to get my change from the cab driver, oh no

She does not take
By night she dreams she's taken away
By rough boys who laugh as they prey

She's wild, Satan's beautiful child
And she giggles at the thought of being defiled
In her dreams, her toes spike the air
Her fingers running through long greasy hair

Boozy kisses and hard scratchy faces
Bruised and red from leather embraces
By day she does not offer
She does not take

There's a secret hiding in her heart
So black, man it tore us apart
It sends hate and passion coursing through her veins
But it only finds release in her dreams

The Pursuit of Happiness,"Well, as it happens, the talks have broken down
I don't know where her head's at, but her body's still around
It's tiptoe, egg shells, don't step on the cracks
When she walks out the door is she ever coming back

It gets so quiet, it gets so still
You wish she'd break something, but you know she never will
If it's true that the eyes are the mirror of the soul
Then hers is hard and cold and completely in control of yours

Hey, hey, that's the second time you've cried
Hey, hey, she leaves you terrified

So she slithers over you like a cool smooth snake
It's sound and fury, that ends without a kiss
And you know down deep you can't live without this

There's nothing for her, she gets you off and goes to work
Leaves you panting in bed, feeling like a jerk

And take a walk to the corner saloon (you buffoon)

All I want is your hand tonight
You are the heaven that I've chosen to believe in
Your face lights the light of hope inside of my heart
The miracle of when we're together
Lives inside of me through the times that we are apart
I don't want you to walk on the water
You don't have to prove yourself to me
I don't need you to catch the roof above me
All I want is your hand tonight

Doing things that any other person might do
Sometimes I wonder what makes you think of me

Well, she's never been hungry, she's never been poor
But when you tell her what it's like she seems to know a little more
Yelling through the bathroom door 'bout how to liberate the masses
While she's putting on her lipstick and curling her false eyelashes

[Chorus]

She'll won't wear a ring on her finger, no man can tie her down
But she wears one in her nose so he can pull her around
Sensitive and vulnerable, that's the kind she likes best
But he's got to have muscles, and a lot of hair on his chest

Sex is a weapon but only she's allowed to use it
She uses her whims to tell her what's wrong and right

Know how to give a thrill
So you do what you have to
Or some other woman will

You'll run your life away dancing and dreaming
But I could hear beneath the haze of
This hopeless lifeless daze his heart was screaming

Or could I just lay back and dream and think of summer

Oh, there'd be no one else around 
Just you and I and the sound of us breathing together
Stuck in this crumbling little town
We'd be happy just to lie down there forever

With some friends who were buried alive
And a man leaned over to tell her
That her luck had finally arrived
Said he drove a Cadillac
They could sneak out through the crack
And he'd never bring her back here again

Watched her finger twirl a circle in her drink
But if you think too much then you'll never decide
You end up like an ice cube sinking down to the bottom

Don't even own a paper sack
To carry the confidence that I lack... and my lies""

So she said ""you know I just can't believe this""
He said ""go ahead, just leave, I understand""
But instead she rested his head on her shoulder
But how could he love her with nothing to give her
But empty pockets and a crooked man?

Dream, I'm on the outside of a dream
Praying that you could salvage me
Thy will be done
No second chance
Was the last thing that you told me
And I was the fool who agreed

All the places that we went to
When the kisses flowed 
So easily from you to me

Praying that you could salvage me

On and on and on and on
The smallest hope is never gone
My optimism always is well fed
And if I die before I wake
I pray for all of goodness sake
That you are happy where you make your bed
So I went to search
And to find out that you're married
With a sweet little child on the way
Now I can let go of this
Tiny dream I carried
With me all these years
Through all my fights and all the tears
Dream, I'm on the outside of a dream
Praying that you could salvage me
Thy will be done
See, seeing the artificial lives
Something that you always denied
Now I'm the one
On and on and on and on
The smallest hope is never gone
My optimism always is well fed
And if I die before I wake
I pray for all of goodness sake
That you are happy where you make your bed

Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Sway me, take me
Thrill me, hold me
Bend me, ease me
You have a way with me

Sway with me

No happily never after, that just ain't for me

I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
I never needed pain, I never needed strain

I never needed you for judgments
I never needed you to question what I spent
I never asked for help, I take care of myself
I don't know why you think you gotta hold on me

There isn't anything for you to say
And my eyes
So look at me and listen to me
Because

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush hush, hush hush
There is no other way, I get the final say because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush hush, hush hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
Baby hush hush

I never needed your corrections
On everything from how I act to what I say
I never needed words, I never needed hurt
I never needed you to be there every day

I'm sorry for the way I let go
On everything I wanted when you came along
But I ain't never beatin', broken not defeated
I know next to you is not where I belong",Hush Hush

I know this is the part

I can't take it any longer

Slipping through our fingers

I just can't take your tears

Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me

I'll fight you to the end, baby

You've been hanging around boy
And you have started sinking in
Whoa baby you're way out of line now
Unaware how this all got started
Let me tell it to you one more time boy

I don't wanna fall in love no no
Love cuts just like a knife woo woo
You make the knife feel good, baby

I didn't want nobody else
And your scaring me to death now baby

Who you trying to impress
Think you better check your style
That might have worked before
But I ain't having it

Show me that you got the touch
Hear the words that I don't say

You gotta learn this song

'Cause I wanna be played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gotta find the groove
You know what to do to get to me
I wanna be played like a violin
Make the strings talk with your finger tips
Never go to fast
Gotta understand
The way I need too be played

It's not about the way you roll
Your making it too obvious
Try to be original
You gotta learn me
Don't be in such a rush

I can be your symphony
Listen to me all night long
If you give me what I need
I could be your favorite song

I wanna be played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gotta find the groove

I wanna be played like a violin

Never go to fast

You make it just like that
Come on do it again
We're going to get this right
Even if it takes all night

Do you feel me?
That's right
Take it nice and slow

Played like a slow jam in the dark

The Quality Kids,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky

I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

And all the weak I'm goin deep, and I can roll deeper than you
Half breed rock the mics to survive
And I might not make it out alive I'm spittin to save my life
Tryin a make it right welcome to the world that we live
And all that I did was crawl up out the stuff for my kids
So rest in peace to Little Eazy

Ride to the rythme of the nickel put the pen in the pack now
And I know you fear me, I done been there
Done that, run that, fun that covered around
And let me kill 'em with the venom we killin 'em with the sound
Every city, every little bitty town
Everybody want to break me down
Nobody gonna take me down East 99 has been abandoned

I'm sick of the drama, sick of havin beef with my momma
And beef with my sisters my brother got murdered
Over marijuana bless the bewilders
Strugglin, hustlin all of my life, watching my back
They already tried to murder me twice
I smoke the herb that I like, I never done coke in my life
We buy but I lie if I did it I'd tell entertainment tonight
Ain't no slackin in my rack it ain't no shame in the game
It ain't no slippin and the pimpin ain't no crack on the brain
You gotta be jealous of me and my fellas
Ain't that what they tell us sell us anything
We helpless give me a little bit faq and help us
We strugglin, jugglin, thugglin, hustlin, thuggin up in the club
No one to talk to, you step on his shoes
You really fucked up, poppa you was a roller
But his pockets are all swollen, you met the dope man
And now we on the block ask who told 'em
Sell 'em  some soap man that's for all the times you played me
Old man this is your son with a blunt and a gun
Check out my slow jam

The Raconteurs,"I'm not sure if there's a point to this story
But I'm going to tell it again
So many other people try to tell the tale
Not one of them knows the end

It was a junk-house in South Carolina
Held a boy the age of ten
Along with his older brother Billy
And a mother and her boyfriend
Who was a triple loser with some blue tattoos
That were given to him when he was young
And a drunk temper that was easy to lose
And thank god he didn't own a gun

Well, Billy woke up in the back of his truck
Took a minute to open his eyes
He took a peep into the back of the house
And found himself a big surprise
He didn't see his brother but there was his mother
With her red-headed head in her hands
While the boyfriend had his gloves wrapped around an old priest
Trying to choke the man

Ah Ah Ah

Billy looked up from the window to the truck
Threw up, and had to struggle to stand
He saw that red-necked bastard with a hammer
Turn the priest into a shell of a man
That priest was putting up the fight of his life
But he was old and he was bound to lose
The boyfriend hit as hard as he could
And knocked the priest right down to his shoes

Well, now Billy knew but never actually met
The preacher lying there in the room
He heard himself say, ""That must be my daddy""
Then he knew what he was gonna do
Billy got up enough courage, took it up
And grabbed the first blunt thing he could find
It was a cold, glass bottle of milk
That got delivered every morning at nine

Ah Ah Ah

Billy broke in and saw the blood on the floor, and
He turned around and put the lock on the door
He looked dead into the boyfriend's eye
His mother was a ghost, too upset to cry, then

He took a step toward the man on the ground
From his mouth trickled out a little audible sound
He heard the boyfriend shout, ""Get out!""
And Billy said, ""Not till I know what this is all about""
""Well, this preacher here was attacking your mama""

But Billy knew just who was starting the drama
So Billy took dead aim at his face
And smashed the bottle on the man who left his dad in disgrace, and
The white milk dripped down with the blood, and the
Boyfriend fell down dead for good
Right next to the preacher who was gasping for air
And Billy shouted, ""Daddy, why'd you have to come back here?""

His mama reached behind the sugar and honey, and
Pulled out an envelope filled with money
""Your daddy gave us this,"" she collapsed in tears
""He's been paying all the bills for years""
""Mama, let's put this body underneath the trees
And put Daddy in the truck and head to Tennessee""
Just then, his little brother came in
Holding the milk man's hat and a bottle of gin singing

The Rainmakers,"The girl said do you love me
The boy said I do
The girl said prove it
The boy said hoo dee hoo

I headed for the water tower straight to the top
With my spray paint can and I did not stop
I painted your name larger than life
About eight feet tall about twelve feet wide
I think that you believed me when I came back down
And for a couple of weeks we were the talk of the town

And the girls sang hoo dee hoo
And the boys sang hoo dee hoo
And everybody sang hoo dee hoo
Hoo dee hoo hoo hoo

Then I left town looking for the holy grail
You left the very next week with the jet set
Sailing for the Caribbean where the rich kids play
I missed you so much I fell down and prayed
I joined every church they claimed they knew my sin
They made me write the Lord?s Prayer on the head of a pin

(chorus)

Well one year it was the factory and one year the park
We heated with wood and the house caught fire
I reached for a figure through the smoke and the sparks
But which one did I save the girl or the guitar

Well I made a lot of money got a lot of good press
Writing paperback novels like a man possessed
Every name was changed every story was true
Every priest was me every stripper was you
And they danced like angels cast out for being lovers
I wrote their life story on a matchbook cover

(chorus)

I went home for Christmas to that little old town
I ate a big dinner and went walking around
I seen some other dumb kid had made that long hard climb
He wasted his paint wasted his time
But I know I?d do it all again if you asked me to
And I?ll take you with me this time singing hoo dee hoo

The Rainmakers,"You tell of man who took a hundred dollars
Spent it on lottery tickets and beer.
Won a couple of million, left his wife and children.
Lived himself to death in a couple of years.

Should have spent it on love.
Spend it on his children.
Spend it on the ones who need it the most. 
Take your little bundle put her in a basket. 
Leave her on the doorstep of her future home.

I hear of an army taken lots of money..
Spending it on guns and rows of barbed wire.
Blew it all away. 
There homeless and there hungry,
Had to bite the bullet. 
Taste the bloody war.

Spend it on the children.
Spend it on the ones who need it the most.

Leave her on the doorstep of her future home.

Swallowed by the music he played.
Don't I have the right, that camera through the eye. 
Of a phonograph needle someday.

I hear of a country. 
Where they say the city's all have purdy streets. 
That are paved with gold.
They may not be gold...
But they were built by people,
Paying heavy taxes for a dream they still hold.

Spend it on love.
Spend it on the children.
Spend it on the ones who need it the most. 
Take your little bundle put her in a basket. 
Leave her on the doorstep of her future home.

You get out for some peace
Still get home by our feet
See now your home,
Crashing out in your coat
Jet lagged from the night bus/bars?
Planning your escape

No point in trying to act all hard
As the kids take the piss when you walk past
No sane place left to go
Your mates aren't in the start and yes I'll grow

Now you're tearing up
Just need one night off
Get out of this in one peace
And come home for some sleep

Now you're home
Crash out in your coat
Jet lagged from the night bus
And plan your escape.",Leave the City and Come Home
The Rakes,"Don't talk rubbish to me
I use reason on my brain
It's those little superstitions
That get me through the stress and strain

I have made my contributions
And now and then I find
On the subject of my love life
I've been left behind

[Chorus: x2]
Let's make the most of it
The time we've got together
Quit all the secrets that are
Choking up your heart
And tearing all the light from the stars

I'm made some calculations
But will not put them to the test
It's those little superstitions
That cannot be laid to rest

Our bodies are reacting
We're heated dangerously
Leaving traces on each other
That the naked eye can't see

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, I say forever
And you just say whatever
But if you feel how I feel
Then we'd stay together

Yeah, I say forever
And you just say whatever
But if you feel how I feel
Then we'd stay together

The Rakes,"Oh God I'm running late again
I don't believe this

Another Wednesday morning on the train to work
And my weekend spread into the middle of the week
I'm boozing every night, 3 hours sleep
Check all the people then stare at my feet
Guy next to me pretend to read the Metro
Sort of bloke who calls everybody bro
But only met a black guy at Uni though
And the lady with the kid watches the guard meet the train

[Chorus]
Suspicous eyes
Looking for the end
Suspicous eyes
Looking for the end

A young Asian guy with a rucksack on his back
Jumps on the tube, is he ready to attack?
God just imagine it being all over, stuck in the tube with nowhere to go
All the smoke and confusion, stuck in this dark coffin
The man with the paper, he moves from his seat
Why did that kid stand so close to me?
I'm sick of them moaning that they're being picked on, 
When its them running round with the bombs
I'll grab the kids, leave London's town

Join a white flight to Surrey and beyond

[Chorus]

These people are assuming who I am, but they're wrong
Got a beard and a bag so they think I got a bomb
I saw everyone's reaction soon as I stepped through the door
All acting like they've never seen a brown person before
The guy infront of me, he should be reading his paper
I'm checking my watch cos there's an interview that I'm gonna be late for
Every time I step on the tube, there's a dude in his suit who ain't got no manners,
Doesn't he know staring is rude?
And if you're so scared, move! I've just stopped caring
I'm off at the next stop mate just keep staring

Clocks are ticking and we leave on time [Repeats]",Suspicious Eyes
The Rakes,"Tho I been thinking about it, I live with the idea
The way we where would last forever
Yeah it all seemed pretty clear.
But when the foundations shook
And the cracks started to appear
Saw the light in each others eyes
As the whole world disappeared.

[Chorus 1]
My history has come and gone
I'll drive late at night
The only car on empty streets
No welcome sun in sight

[Chorus 2]
If its trouble that you're looking for,
Its trouble that you'll find.
Sometimes trouble finds you no matter where you hide

We got back from the party on a comedown for a week
Where we out there making history? Or was it just a lack of sleep?
It seemed like we were waiting in the wings to take our bow...
The outsiders are whispering this is our moment now.

[Chorus 1: x2]

My history has come and gone
Sometimes I think I see
Your face in the rear view mirror, yeah,
Looking back at me

[Chorus 2: x2]

It was important to us
To do more than just survive
Surviving sometimes took up too much of our time

[Chorus 2]",Trouble
The Rakes,"We danced together on the roof at the party,
5 stories removed from the trouble on the street
The sun arose revealing goose bumps on your arm
A sign that we should move together somewhere warm.

[Chorus]
We danced together [Repeat]

We moved to the street where they tried to hold curfew
And ran among the debris as the bullets flew.
Helicopters circled overhead to get a better view
We found a doorway, fell in and I held you.

[Chorus]

We didn't have no where to go
Waiting for the daylight to begin
Singer, save our secular souls
How can you have hope with no God?

We didn't give a shit about what they would say...
And stayed up until the light turned our world/eyes grey.
We caned our money like it was our last day
Two fingers up at those who wont miss us when we pass away",We Danced Together

So we end up with nothing to lose, man

Who lives, dreams in Regent's park

I'm stuck like a half-smoked cigarette
Between mates and the chances of something happenin'
She's in a group, she might be leaving soon

For a club or just a taxi home
I'd like to be in a taxi by her
Take a chance, make my move
Could be knocked back and they would all see

My mates and hers, it will be ugly
Or maybe it'll work and this night would be
More than just jabber to my mates and me
She's just leaving holes in your memory

Swing test to a heart in her sleeve
Instead I'll be back at her under the sheets
With TV on and she would smell good
We'll wake up and go to work, the world would be alright for once

Keep calm, release the neutron napalm bomb on young hawks 

Splitting wigs like logs, cloudy visions like fogs

I risked a whoopin' every time I went
'Cause white boys weren't allowed on the colored side of town
But I was proud to call that old black man my friend

He had a pillow by the bed he used to pray on
And a beat up old guitar he let me play on
And I knew where my fingers went from his greasy fingerprints
Yeah, he was passin' on what was handed down to him

And it soaked up all the blood and sweat and teardrops
And the beers he missed in smoky little bars
And sometimes that old man he comes alive in my hands
I feel the beating of his sad old broken heart
Just like there's a ghost in this guitar, a ghost in this guitar

Well, the night before he died he made me take it
Well he said, ""You play it now, 'cause I gotta go""
And I can feel him in my fingers when I play it
'Cause sometimes I'm in control and sometimes I just sit back
And let him go, I sit back and let him go

And it soaked up all the blood and sweat and teardrops
And the beers he missed in smoky little bars

They're laughing as I drive away

Are they laughing at your old man or at me

Is the part when I get up and go away

Her mother chanced to meet me.
She caught her by the hair of the head
And down to the room she brought her
With the root of a hazel twig
She was the well beat daughter.

Will you marry me now or never?
Will you marry me you sildier lad?
Can't you see I'm done forever?
I can't marry you now my bonnie wee lass
Can't marry you my honey

And a gallon in the morning

And as my footsteps threw me closer I smell a sweet fragrance of flowers
That looked like a family reunion and my eyes not counted the tears
And the no man said by the graveside I haven't seen Mary in years
Hold my hand and leave me leave me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary I haven't seen Mary in years

When Mary and I were first married we had such plans for our child
But for no reason I started rambling and like the four winds I just ran wild
If I could just live my life over I would bring Mary such cheers
Now she's gone where she'll never need me I haven't seen Mary in years

Daddy brought the baby to the window sill
To see a bit of heaven shoot across the sky
The one and only time Daddy saw it fly

It came from the east just as bright as a torch
The neighbors had a party on their porch
Daddy rocked the baby, Mother said ""amen""
When Halley came to visit in nineteen ten

Now back then Jackson was a real small town
And it's not every night a comet comes around
It was almost eighty years since its last time through
So I bet your mother would've said ""amen"" too

As its tail stretched out like a stardust streak
The papers wrote about it every day for a week
They wondered where it's going and where it's been
When Halley came to Jackson in 1910

Now Daddy told the baby sleeping in his arms
To dream a little dream of a comet's charms
And he made a little wish as she slept so sound
In nineteen eighty-six that wish came 'round 

It came from the east, just as bright as a torch
She saw it in the sky from her daddy's porch
As heavenly sent as it was back then

With Mr. Shadow all the way from Colton to Seattle
And back to Pomona
Hoes to promote the corner
Hit me on my two-way Motorola
I got a whole lot of soldiers that love to throw boulders
It's all over, test the faith and bleed slower

Straight act a fool, got you making me loot
Got you standing on the corner and that ass look cute

It makes no sense to give in
To release you from my thoughts.

I promise to write you I'll always remember,
I promise to try to be back 'till December
I said I must go, I must face this disaster,
You said I would come after you ever after.

[Chorus]

If you just promise to keep your heart
Promise to keep your heart broken
If you just promise to keep your heart... 
Broken...broken.

For ever and after my life
Just promise to keep your heart broken...",Keep Your Heart Broken
The Rasmus,"We stopped and left the car
Last thing I can recall
A raging weave of light
Vaporized all this life

And we ran into the field
Incapable to breathe

[Chorus:]
Rest in peace is all over now
Its the end of salvation
Memories in the photographs
Of the last generation
Of the last generation

I see this in my dream
Petrified family
Pointing hands at me
Victims of the tragedy

And dust replaced their souls
Hearts turned into stone

And dust replaced their souls
Minds turned into stone

Behind those beautiful smiles, I've seen tragedy
The flawless skin hides the secrets within
Silent forces that secretly ignite your sins

Fly away 
Fly away 
From the torch of blame
They hunt you ÃƒÂ¢?? the Lucifer's angel
Never lived 
You never died 
Your life has been denied 
They call you 
The Lucifer's angel 

Beyond these clouds you can hide all your tears 
Beyond this world you'll be safe from their wicked fears
In their hearts they fear your demands 
And their minds 
Won't accept you, they'll never understand

On your own
I know you can make it
Truth or bone
I know you can shake it
Survive alone
I know you can take it

You lived your life like a sleeping swan,
Your time has come,
To go deeper

Girl,
Your final journey has just begun,
But destiny chose to leave her,

No fear,
Destination darkness
No fear,
Destination darkness

Like poisoned knives
With no mercy

Close your eyes for the one last time
Sleepless nights
From here to eternity

We had a dream, we had a plan

Fade away, the night is calling my name

In the dead of night
Right before for the fight
Clouds are gathering for the storm
Destiny decides who will live or die

I've been waiting for this moment
It's time for the battle
Even if I never make it
Take me home
I might never get my story
Carved in stone
But I will rise again
The fight is to the end

Pounding of the drums of war
Turns your tears to mud
Rivers turns to blood

If you live to see another day
Take another breathe
Make it life or death

I've been waiting for this moment
It's time for the battle
Even if I never make it
Take me home
I might never get my story

You got me backed against the wall
Caught in a web of your creation

You're the dangerous kind
Now look at what you've done to me
What you've done to me baby
You've gotta criminal mind
Your motive is to plant the seed
Now I'd kill for you baby

You gotta shady reputation
From bed to bed to man to man
Once you deliver your temptation
No one can stop your master plan
Don't try to lie about it
I don't believe a thing you say
The more you try to hide it
The more the lies show on your face

You're the dangerous kind
Now look at what you've done to me
What you've done to me baby
You've gotta criminal mind
Your motive is to plant the seed

Now I'm doing the time

Guess you took everything you could from me

Could be much better, it's true,
That didn't matter to you

Was I still sleeping
Lost in a dream

Beneath the northern stars
We cried from the laughter
And died in each others' arms

Remember and live forever
Remember to live for love

I got back my letters
Ages ago
Your address unknown
I passed a stranger
Who had your eyes
Or was it you?

We ran through the graveyard
To catch the midnight sun
We danced drunk and naked
Until the summer was gone

Remember to live for love
Remember to live for love...

To live for love",Live Forever

That it came to this,
You paralyzed my body
With a poison kiss
For forty days and nights
I was chained to your bed,
You thought that was
The end of the story
Something inside me
Called freedom came alive
Living in a world without you.

You told me my darling,
""Without me, you're nothing""
You taught me, to look in your eyes
And fed me your sweet lies!

Suddenly someone will stare
In the window.
Looking outside at the sky
That had never been blue...

Ahh!, there's a world without you
I see the light.
Living in a world without you.
Ahh!, there is hope to guide me
I will survive!
Living in a world without you.

That it came to this,
You paralyzed my body
With a poison kiss
For forty days and nights
I was chained to your bed,
You thought that was
The end of the story
Something inside me
Called freedom came alive
Living in a world without you.

You put me together
Then trashed me for pleasure
You used me again and again
Abused me, confused me!

Suddenly naked I run
Through your garden.
Right through the gates of the
Past and I'm finally free...

Ahh!, there's a world without you
I see the light.
Living in a world without you.
Ahh!, there is hope to guide me
I will survive!

Like something bad is coming
You've been living in the world of lies
Your see through walls are falling
It's getting hard to accept that I'm losing you

I watch as you sleep
Your nightmares break the silence
I can tell that you're in too deep
Got your mind down to a science
And every time that I touch you
I'm losing you

You're the eve of my destruction
In the garden of fears

Why am I devastated
You threw it all away
Now who's the one who's lost and lonely
I gotta break away from you
Who will pay for all the things you've done
I'm not the only one

You're out of control inside
I don't need x-ray vision
To see all the desperate signs
You made your heart a prison
I took it all out of fear of losing you

In the valley of deception
There is a river of tears

Why am I devastated
You through it all away
Now who's the one who's lost and lonely
I gotta break away from you
Who will pay for all the things you've done

So many days, too easy to erase

I will run to you
When my journey is over
Wait for me
Keep our love alive
I will dream of you
'Til I reach the sun
Then I'll turn around and run to you

If I stay with you and linger here
Another moment
I will fade into the scenery
You wouldn't even see me
I've got nothing left to offer you
It's not that I don't care
All I ask is that you think of me
I swear

I hate to see you cry
The way you look away

When your life's a boat in a bottle
You're surrounded, drifting alone

Don't leave me now
Stay another day
With me

[Chorus:]
When you're sad, and no one knows it
I'll send you black roses
When your heart's dark and frozen
I'll send you black roses

Far away we wait for each other
I'm still on that road to nowhere
Kiss yourself for me in the mirror
Tie a black rose into your hair

Don't lose your faith
Share another night
With me

And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

And there's sumpin' to drink,

The Rat Pack,"Lovers depend on moonlight for a love affair
Babies depend on mothers for their tender care
Flowers depend on sunshine and the morning dew
Each thing depends on something 
And I depend on you

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good, I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you

I can save money or spend it
Go right on living or end it
You're to blame baby, for what I do
I know that I can be a beggar, I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

Isn't it sweet to know dear 
You can help me on
Wouldn't it hurt to know dear 
All my hopes were gone
Wouldn't it make you proud dear
If I made a name
But if I failed to win dear
Would you want all the blame",It All Depends on You

Let me go
Let me go lover

Let me be, set me free from your spell
You made me weak, cut me deep, I can't sleep lover

The Rat Pack,"LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME
Billie Holiday
(Walter Donaldson / Gus Kahn)

This affair is killin' me
I can't stand uncertainly
Tell me now I've got to know
Whether you want me to stay or to go

Love me or leave me 
Or let me be lonely
You won't believe me, I love you only
I'd rather be lonely
Then happy with someone else

You might find the night time
The right time for kissin'
But night time is my time
For just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'
With somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love
But I don't want to borrow
To have it today to give it back tomorrow
For your love is my love
There's no love for nobody else
",Love Me or Leave Me
The Rat Pack,"Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you - speak my name
Softly, in my ear you - breathe a flame
Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel - with our bliss
When, two lips of coral - want to kiss

I say (that) the devil is in you, and to resists you - I try
But if you didn't continue - I would die
Lover, please be tender, when you're tender - fears depart
Lover, I surrender - to my heart",Lover

His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend

Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent, you are...

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me

So set 'em up Joe,
I've got a little story
I think you should know

We're drinking my friend,
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby, and one more
For the road

I've got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
I'm feeling so bad
Can't you make the music easy and sad
I could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby, and one more
For the road

You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
So when I'm gloomy, won't you listen to me
'Til it's talked away
Well, that's how it goes

And Joe I know you're getting anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
But this touch that I've found
Must be drowned or it soon might explode
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

It's so long
