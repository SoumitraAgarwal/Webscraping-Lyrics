Hubert-Félix Thiéfaine,"souvenir éphémère 
beauté blême et transfert 
dans tes jardins d'eden
solitude transparente
de ces longs jours d'attente
à te fixer les veines
tu reviens sur les lieux
où tu pleures quand il pleut
des serpents de neige
comme un arbre mort
au milieu du désert
juste une valse noire
dans le silence des pierres
nostalgie de ces jours
sans haine et sans amour
au fond des villes mortes
la folie dans les yeux
des monstres délicieux
qui traversaient ta porte
ils patrouillent dans ton crâne
ils contrôlent ton âme
& te servent d'escorte
comme un arbre mort
au milieu du désert
juste une valse noire
dans le silence des pierres
vibrations pathétiques
sur le tapis critique
où tu joues pair et noir
voyage au bout du rêve
& tu scelles tes lèvres
aux secrets d'un miroir
ta voix désincarnée
dans l'ombre surannée
& grise de ta mémoire
comme un arbre mort
au milieu du désert
juste une valse noire
dans le silence des pierres
visions subliminales
sur le cœur-terminal
de ta zone carnivore
chuchotement animal
dans la tour de cristal
où gît ton géant mort
comme un arbre mort
au milieu du désert
juste une valse noire
dans le silence des pierres",Juste une Valse Noire
Hubert-Félix Thiéfaine,"de chili en bloody mary 
le ciel est aussi rouge que t'es raide

vient mendier la fin de mon chewing gum

de cuervos en margaritas
de jack daniel's en texaco

après que j'eus décroché les groupies & les fans 
collés aux électrons de ma clôture haute-tension
joyeux comme des flippés qu'on vient d'électroniquer oh yé !
j'ai sorti mes poubelles - hélas au milieu desquelles
étaient en train de fouiller quelques personnalités
que nous connaîtrions
si nous avions la télévision
puis j'ai ouvert ma première bière en me demandant
si les morts s'amusaient autant que les vivants

à 13 heures c'est 1 heure après minuit d'l'après-midi
j'ai sorti mon browning & mon lüger de leurs étuis
j'ai commencé à tirer sur quelques rats bien cradingues
& m'suis fait une souris en 3 bastos dans le soustingue

croate en train d'rêver d'un week-end à sarajevo

si les morts s'amusaient autant que les vivants

à 16 heures 52 c'est l'heure des mamans / des bretzels
& c'est l'heure du champagne dans les hôtels porte-jarretelles
mais moi j'ai mis la gomme au volant d'mon ambulance
avec un critique-rock en camisole pour une urgence
à l'hosto les bonnes sœurs avaient des gueules de somnambules
& parlaient de fibromes / d'hémorroïdes & de fistules
alors j'ai raconté comment j'ai survécu sur mars
avec des roubles en skaï & la médaille du curé d'ars
puis j'ai vidé leur pharmacie en me demandant
si les morts s'amusaient autant que les vivants

à force de patienter vint enfin l'heure de l'apéro
t'as pris un golden cadillac moi un double zéro
puis on a joué au strip-poker avec une mamie bookmaker
qui avait réservé une table chez loiseau du malheur
le chef qui avait tenu le catering autrefois chez disney
nous fit cuire un crapaud avec des raclures de mickey
& on s'est régalé comme dans un film avec blanche neige
quand les 2 méchantes sœurs se font sauter sur le manège
puis j'ai fumé un des sept nains en me demandant
si les morts s'amusaient autant que les vivants

en guise de digestif j'ai lu le numéro de l'équipe
qui cause du fameux championnat de turlute en 15 pipes
puis j'ai minitélé en rose & j'ai d'mandé marlène
mais elle était partie faire sa nouille sur la première chaîne
là-dessus on s'est r'trouvé en boîte à mater les pigeons
en train d'se compisser dans l'froc sur leur dance à la con
à l'aube on était vermoulu / pressé comme le raisin
avec lequel les dieux fabriquent l'ambroisie-chambertin

Des amants sous les aulnes d'un hôtel flamand

Quand les chauves-souris flirtent avec les rossignols
Dans les ruines d'un royaume où mon crâne est mongol
Quand les syndicats brûlent nos rushes et nos démons
Pour en finir avec le jugement des salauds

Quelque juge emportant ma tête sur un plateau
Quand tu branches les hélices de ma mémoire astrale
Sur les capteurs-influx de ta flamme initiale
Je n'ai plus de mots assez durs
Pour te dire que je t'aime

Quand les traces de Rorschach sur la tôle ondulée
Servent aux maîtres à tester l'autochtone humilié
Quand sur la Moleskine des limousines en liesse
Ils en rient en fumant la mucho cojones

Dans l'encyclopédie des clameurs souterraines
Quand je rentre amoché / fatigué / dézingué
En rêvant de mourir sur ton ventre mouillé
Je n'ai plus de mots assez durs
Pour te dire que je t'aime

Quand dans la lumière sale d'un miroir tamisé
Tu croises l'œil éphémère d'une salamandre ailée
Quand dans les brumes étales de nos corps transparents
Tu réveilles mes volcans lumineux du néant
Quand mes pensées confuses s'éclairent au magnésium
Sur les écrans-secrets de ton Pandémonium
Quand mes bougainvillées se mêlent aux herbes folles
Dans ta chaleur biguine au crépuscule créole

Hubert-Félix Thiéfaine,"Ce matin le marchand de coco n'est pas passé 
Et au lieu de se rendre à l'école 
Tous les vieillards se sont amusés à casser des huîtres 
Sur le rebord du trottoir avec des démonte-pneus 
Sur ma porte j'ai marqué : absent pour la journée 
Dehors il fait mauvais, il pleut des chats et des chiens 
Les cinémas sont fermés c'est la grève des clowns 
Alors je reste à la fenêtre 
A regarder passer les camions militaires 
Puis je décroche le téléphone 
Et je regarde les postières par le trou de l'écouteur

Et moi je suis timide comme un enfant mort-né 
Oh timide, mort-né ! 
Dans X temps il se peut 
Que les lamelles de mes semelles se déconnectent 
Et que tu les prennes sur la gueule 
Je t'aime, je t'aime, je t'aime

Et je t'offre ma vie et je t'offre mon corps 
Mon casier judiciaire et mon béribéri, je t'aime ! 

Ce matin les enfants ont cassé leur vélo

Qui gagne un lavabo en porcelaine 
En sautant de mon lit j'ai compté les morceaux 
C'est alors que j'ai vu le regard inhumain 
De ton amant maudit qui me lorgnait comme une bête 
A travers les pâles du ventilateur 
Tout en te faisant l'amour dans une baignoire 
Remplie de choucroute garnie 

Tu as la splendeur d'un enterrement de première classe

J'étais sur un coup, sur un coup foireux 
J'étais entré dans un bar-tabac 
Et j'avais demandé un paquet de cigarettes filtre 
Et 3 timbres à 100 balles 
Pour poster des lettres à quelques amis 
Elle est entrée à ce moment précis 
Nos regards se sont touchés 
Intérieurement j'ai craqué, j'ai craqué, j'ai craqué

J'ai simplement prononcé ces quelques mots : 
Dis-moi qui tu suis, je te dirai qui je hais ! 
Elle m'a répondu :

Courant la gueuse dans les balluches

Tu peux bien rêver d'une greluche 
Chevauchant sa motocyclette

Il dérapa sur ses roupettes 
En entendant ce cri bizoire 

Les filles de La Rochelle 
Ont attrapé le scorbut 
Mignons finie la bagatelle 
La charentaise ne répond plus, oh gué ! 

Le pauv' gars bloqua son engin 
En se croyant halluciné 
Puis il tendit ses esgourdins 
Espérant bien s'être trompé

Qui semblait déchirer la nuit 
De toute son horreur sidérale

Eut droit à ce qu'il n'attendait pas ! Oh ?

qui voulaient que j'leur cause en mourant d'un soupir

attendu que j'suis lâche & que ton flingue est chargé
oh ma
sweet yéyéyé sweet lady
542 lunes & 7 jours environ
que je traîne ma carlingue dans ce siècle marron
542 lunes & 7 jours environ
& tu vois mon amour j'suis toujours aussi con

la geisha funéraire s'tape des rassis crémeux
chaque fois que j'raye un jour d'une croix sur mon pieu
pourtant j'contrôle mes viandes, je surveille mes systoles
& me tiens à l'écart des odeurs de formol
mais un jour faut partir & finir aux enchères
entre les gants stériles d'une sœur hospitalière
& je me vois déjà guignol au p'tit matin
traînant mon vieux flight-case dans le cimetière des chiens
oh meine kleine mutter
mehr licht !

Ondules avec leurs chevelures
Brûlant d'une féerie libertine
Leurs lèvres tremblent et se bousculent
Dans un grave et léger baiser
Tandis que leurs doigts manipulent
La soie de leurs seins dégrafé

Ne se perde au bout de leurs mots

Memories of how we once loved each other
And now we are saying good-bye.

On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder where she can be
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me.

I've cried I've cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear your name
My friends they also love you my darling
And they think that I am to blame.

I have to follow you my darling

By your side is my destination
The road is clear and that's where I'm bound.

A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Huecco,"Señales de humo te hago
Y la pipa de la paz yo me fumo
Pa' calmarme si no estás

Apache, un pelo negro de azabache
La luna, busca un hueco entre la espuma
De las nubes pa' alumbrarte

Y caminas entre las colinas, y me miras, me miras
Con tus ojos de cristal y como brillan, que brilla
La vela de tu sonrisa pues esconde tu sombra en la oscuridad
Y no te veo, pero te vuelvo a llamar

Señales de humo te hago
Y la pipa de la paz yo me fumo
Pa' calmarme si no estas

Me late, retumbo, me explota el corazón
Y Arde al segundo si esos ojos me vuelven a rozar
Los besos de la paz no se compran matando y matando

Apache, con tus pieles de mapache
Tus plumas, van devorando herraduras
De ese caballo salvaje

Te giras desde la colina y me miras, me miras
Con tus ojos de cristal y como brillan, que brilla
La vela de tu sonrisa pues esconde tu sombra en la oscuridad
Y no te veo, pero te vuelvo a llamar

Señales de humo te hago
Y la pipa de la paz yo me fumo
Pa' calmarme si no estas

Me late, retumbo, me explota el corazón
Y arde al segundo si esos ojos me vuelven a rozar
Los besos de la paz no se compran matando y matando

Y aunque el serif siga hablando a balazos
Zancadillas y tortazos yo te agarro del brazo
Y te saco a bailar en un planeta de borrachos

Vaqueros bien armados que nos cazan
Al lazo condenados a mirar
Y no te veo, pero te vuelvo a llamar

Señales de humo te hago
Y la pipa de la paz yo me fumo
Pa' calmarme si no estas

Me late, retumbo, me explota el corazón
Y arde al segundo si esos ojos me vuelven a rozar

Y saco el hacha de guerra por un beso de esos labios
Le declaro la guerra a un chulo cowboy tejano
Y pa' chula mi lengua que te escupe por bastardo

Los besos de la paz no se compran

",Apache
Huecco,"Es inútil, no vale la pena
En invierno el sol no calienta
Sino que se congela
Y cae a trozos sobre mí
Y me raja el alma

Que a grito mudo se queja
Toneladas de tristeza
Mi mochila de cemento
Y mi cabeza que no para de pensarte
Y, ¡cómo pesas!

Si no quieres escuchar, camínate
Si no me quieres mirar, písame
Aun puedo ser la acera donde tu perro juega
O aprovéchate

Cómo una limosna me entregas
Instantes de tu presencia
Que me arranca mil sonrisas ciegas
Un topo sé en tu indiferencia
Que me mata dentro

Y esos ojos ya no se tropiezan
Ni tiemblan cuando estoy cerca, no
Ahora bostezan y se van
No importa donde

Si no quieres escuchar, camínate
Si no me quieres mirar, písame
Aun puedo ser la perra que en tu olvido cojea
O aprovéchate

Aquí me ves quemando margaritas a tus pies
Con la lengua ardiendo
Y mi alma a la sombra de un ciprés

Y tú con tu boca en cualquier bar de copas
Regalando besos, bebiendo la copa
No ves mi derrota, mira, no ves mi derrota

Tu cariño sale ya sin fuerza
Como el cava en la botella
Que lleva una vida abierta
Y patético lo intenta
No juegue, no mienta

Nunca vi una mirada tan hueca
Tan vacía de ganas
Tan lejos cuando te acercas
Y aun te ríes cuando te sale mi tristeza

Y la vida te dará lo que me das
Desde el barro quizás me recordarás
Y te verás buceando, en tus podridos charcos
Y allí te ahogarás

Aquí me ves quemando margaritas a tus pies
Con la lengua ardiendo
Y mi alma a la sombra de un ciprés

Y tú con tu boca en cualquier bar de copas
Regalando besos, perdiendo la ropa
No ves mi derrota

Duele la pena, duele la pena
Me mata el veneno de esa viuda negra
Duele la pena, duele la pena
Y me está matando esa mujer

Aquí me ves quemando margaritas a tus pies
Con la lengua ardiendo
Y mi alma a la sombra de un ciprés

Y tú con tu boca en un bar de copas
Regalando besos, perdiendo la ropa
No ves mi derrota, idiota, no ves mi derrota
Idiota

Y aunque escondas la cara
Sé que algún día serás mía, mía

Un poquito de azúcar pa' esta boca amarga ah, ah
Me matas cuando estiras tus piernas caprochosas
Y te largas sin más, come on

Bebo tus sombras, mastico tu alma

Tus cuchillos me rozan al oído
Tus susurros me abrasan las entrañas
¿De qué te extrañas si me excito?

Son de hielo y se derrite
En esas conferencias yermas
Donde se tratan las paspas

Para ellos es que repiten
Sus errores no dimiten
Y permiten que fracase
La palabra una vez más

Que las balas justifiquen
Y que las palmas repiquen
Resuene otro aplauso
De la industria militar

Millones de ojos tenemos
Aunque nos callemos
El día que menos lo esperes
Nos levantaremos

Mi vida vale porque
Es una vida
Tu vida no vale
Más que la mía

Secundarios de esta prueba nuclear
Presidente, venga ya

Que usted no está presente en los planes de la Paz
Pero si puede en caliente y vuelve a contaminar
Sonriente, buscará un plato diferente

Para poder rebañar las sobras de los clientes
Que se han vuelto a confiar
Inocente, no tendrá la calma que te calma el alma
Dálmata, de la falsa farsa de la libertad

Y la tierra no levanta cabeza
A menudo vemos que se cabrea
Nuestras vidas te importan una mierda, si
El sabor del petróleo es goloso
Y tenías en un puro el tratado de Quioto

Y la tierra prepara una sorpresa
Consecuencia de política fieras
Uy, los vientos se tornan gran tormentas
Que se joden las ciudades enteras

",Mis Bichitos
Huecco,"Te coronaron en Hollywood como la reina de LA
Tú me alumbraste calles sin luz
Me hiciste sentir un rey
No tienes estrella en el 'Walk of Fame'

Pero en el cielo tienes más de 100
Suenan tus tacones y la peña te miran, te silba y
Te giras y tú correspondes
Con una sonrisa infinita y very rica

Mami, que tu eres la reina de los angelotes
Baila que te baila, toda la noche
Cuando tengas frio y no haya quien te arrope
Ven y acércame esos labios gordotes

Que tú eres la reina de los angelotes
Baila que te baila, toda la noche
Si alguien te hace daño le dar garrote
Ven y acércame esos labios gordotes

Llega a la playa de Malibu
Por la PCH
Donde el mar es eléctrico y azul
Y algunos besos robe

Y no tienes estrella en el 'Walk of Fame'
Pero en el cielo tienes ms de 100
Suenan tus tacones y la peña te mira, te silba
Y te giras y tú correspondes
Con una sonrisa infinitamente rica

Mami, que tu eres la reina de los angelotes
Baila que te baila, toda la noche
Cuando tengas frio y no haya quien te arrope
Ven y acércame esos labios gordotes

Que tú eres la reina de los angelotes
Baila que te baila, toda la noche
Si alguien te hace daño le daré garrote
Ven y acércame esos labios gordos

Alguien te vio por los Nuevayores
Y en Miami tomando los soles
Te bajaste hasta los Aragonés
Quizá en busca de algún amore

Si algún día la vida nos vuelve a cruzar
Si el destino quiere volver a jugar
Si intentamos darle tequila el azar
Quizás lo podamos emborrachar

Toma que toma que toma, toma

Mami, que tu eres la reina de los angelotes
Baila que te baila, toda la noche
Cuando tengas frio y no haya quien te arrope
Ven y acércame esos labios gordotes

Que tú eres la reina de los angelotes
Baila que te baila, toda la noche
Si alguien te hace daño le daré garrote
Ven y acércame esos labios gordotes

Echas los perros tus miedos pasados
Los fantasmas que te han destrozado
Dame niña tu mano y enséñame tus encantos
Que cuando doble la esquina puede salir corriendo tu vida
Que la llames a voces y no vuelvas a escuchar su risa

Qué guapa, que linda que cosa más bonita
Que mira que tomate algo que esta noche se te invita
Qué guapa que linda
Tomate algo y a vivir

Si me ayudas a volar, si me vuelves besar
Sabes que todas las penas lejos se irán
La tristeza ya no está me la tuve que cargar
Por las balas de tus besos en la oscuridad
Que el ataque junto a mí

Desde la ventana de torelabios

Pa los leones los tiempos malos
La llel de los ratos que te han amargado
Sóplame otro beso desde la ventana de tus labios

Y no te me canses la lengua
O en discusiones que te están mareando
U apaga tu fuego despacito y entre mis brazos

Qué guapa, que linda que cosa más bonita
Que mira que tomate algo que esta noche se te invita
Qué guapa, que linda

Que el tiempo se nos va, que la felicidad
Está echando, a llorar hoy quiero escuchar

Que te vas a quedar, que te vas a quedar

Si me ayudas a volar si me vuelves a besar
Sabes que todas las penas lejos se irán

Los tesoros imposibles que ha escondido tu sonrisa
Si lo nuestro fue mentira, tus cuartadas no respiran
Olvidaste pintalabios imprudente en bocas que no eran la mía
En bocas que no eran la mía

Duele, son cosas normales
Esto es lo que tiene ser princesa de los arrabales
Tu ya una clásica en los coches de la noches de Madrid con tus rituales
La soledad se está encargando en silencio
De curar despacio todos tus males, todos tus males
Todos tus males, todos tus males

Olvidaste pintalabios imprudente

Going through the struggle and what not
There's always something bad that could happen in the hood
Ya know, yeah

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

Waited too long, now it's a problem
You see what it is, how it go wrong
Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Man, this hook is too true to believe in
Where da hell is ya momma and daddy when you need 'em?
Born in the hood, so the hood's in ya heart
Though nothing's been good in the hood from the start

Either you was with ya momma or never had a daddy?
Or never had neitha and was raised wit' ya granny
It's a cold ass world fa the younga generation
In err hood somebody would, time to be facing

For a fucked up reason, a bad ass time
Then gave up, they don't think the sun still shine
Brush it against the wall, forced to do crime
Some say they'll die before they do time

'Cause jail ain't the place to be
Might be the place for you but ain't for me, yeah
You enjoying yo life, why? 'Cause your fists grip wood
But the kids doing bad 'cause nobody loves da hood

Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Man, the kids always getting lectured
But what do you expect when they have no direction
Father in jail, mother strung out
No curfew, late nights, hung out

Getting money on the zone, now it is a problem
'Cause they selling white rocks, carrying a revolver
Everybody gotta eat somehow, someway
Wishing they'll make it out somehow, someday

They can put the drugs down and pick up the books
There's only a few good cops 'cause most of them crooks
Supposed to protect and serve but now they got the nerve
To say they want criminals up off of the curb

It's a cold ass world, especially for male
They filling up more than half of all jails
The government got the world misunderstood
I dedicate this to the ones who love the hood

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

Waited too long, now it's a problem
You see what it is, how it go wrong
Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Stand strong all my lil' soldiers
Reject all negative words people done told ya
Grind how you gotta and make 'em out of believers
Give the middle fingers and tell 'em I don't need ya

Over come the bad and pray to the Lord
Soon to turn good 'cause the grace of the Lord
Now you could smile and say it's all good
I'm never gonna leave 'cause somebody love the hood

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is
Pop, lock, and drop it

But baby don't stop it, we can do it like Chris Brown girl and get it poppin'

The only female that could do what she please
But say it ain't tricking when I'm giving her g's
Car weather I'm hurt or I'm safe in the streets
I'll tell you mommy don't worry I'm safe with the heat
Now come a little closer move your waist to the beat
In the winter on the carpet for heat
When you sleep
There's no other couple that's fucking with we
The more I'm around gratify me to love you
There's one thing to know your next

[Chorus]

[Lloyd]
I've been all around the world before, but I know your the one for me
Just stay good you'll see
I don't want to have to run these streets no more
For now girl its ride or die
Baby I'm a get you right

[Chorus]

[Huey]
See I told you everything was going to be aight in here
We got to grind, we go to eat
That way I can take you on shopping sprees and all that good stuff
Uh
You understand what I'm saying right?
Stand by your boys side
Together, me and you can ride
It's when I hustle, lets go",When I Hustle

Huey Dunbar,"Lo mejor que me ha pasado desde el dia que fui
Es despertar a tu lado y verte
Yo vivia equivocado pero no me dabe cuenta
El amor es algo sabio, sabe esperar

Y ahora que te tengo entre mis brazos nuevamente
Me doy cuenta del error que he cometido
De lo mal que me he portado yo contigo, discúlpame
Ahora que no tengo a donde ir tu me recibes

Y me curas con tus labios las heridas
Que la vida me ha dejado en mi corazón, perdóname
Ahora que no tengo nada que ofrecerte
Tu me aceptas en tu vida nuevamente, amor de siempre

Huey Dunbar,"If you saw my baby by the flow of candlelight
You would see why I need to he with her every night
Nothing is like the sweetness that I've tasted on her lips 

Nothing drives me crazy like the motion of her hips
The way she moves, like fire dancing
I feel her burn we toss and turn 
A 'chiki chiki cha' on and on 

""Ella es candela"", she's got me burnin 
'Chiki chiki cha chiki cha cha cha'
The rhythm of our bodies, oh we just can't stop.
""Ella es candela"", she gives me fever

And in the morning I don't want to leave her 
'chiki chiki cha chiki cha cha' 
The rhythm of our bodies oh we just can't stop
She gives all her passion every time we're alone

And until the light of dawn we make music of our own
All my secret fantasies she already knows
I don't have to say a world that's just how she flows.",Chikicha

Es este mismo que a la cara te esta hablando
No reconoces ni si quiera ya mi voz
Why ahora me miras como si fuera un extrano

Parece ser que todo ya se te olvido
Que las promesas que salieron de tus labios
Se derritieron como el hielo abajo el sol
Why se apago ese resplandor de aqella noche de verano

Mas yo si me enamore
Por eso no te olvide
Why aunque ahora tu me nieges los besos de tus labios
Me muero por besarlos

No digas que fue un error
Jurarnos eterno amor
Si en mis brazos tu temblabas
Suplicando a puro grito no me dejes por favor

Parece ser que todo ya se te olvido
Que las promesas que salieron de tus labios
Se derritieron como el hielo abajo el sol

Yo si me enamore de ti
Why sin ti morire

Ya no te acuerdas del hombre que fui yo
Ese que un dia te enamoro
Te dio tanto amor why tu le pagaste con traicion

Yo si me enamore
Yo si me enamore de ti

Si no recuerdas mis besos
Porque antes te morias why temblas de emocion
Cuando no estaba junto a ti, uoo

Yo si me enamore

Se apagan los años
Y me olvido de lo bueno
Extrañándote, no dejo de llorar
Y aprendo a suplicar, por nuestro amor

Sé que sin tu cariño mis tristes ojitos
Yo me encontrare perdido
Asfixiándome, falta de tu piel
Y aroma de mujer
Lágrimas y el alma herida

A donde iré
Si en cada rostro de mujer te encontrare
En cada paso, en cada lluvia sentiré
Esa agonía por tu ausencia
Ese vació que no quiere verme vivo

A donde iré
Si en cada noche tu sabor lo probare
En cada risa y alimento te veré
En cada luna y sus estrellas

En cada espacio, en cada beso y pensamiento
Ven, cuando este dormido
Regálame un sueño, que me lleve al firmamento
Donde tú y yo volvamos a empezar
Sabiéndonos amar, sin lastimar y sin mentiras

A donde iré
Si en cada rostro de mujer te encontrare
En cada paso, en cada lluvia sentiré
Esa agonía por tu ausencia
Ese vació que no quiere verme vivo

A donde iré
Si en cada noche tu sabor lo probare
En cada risa y alimento te veré
En cada luna y sus estrellas
En cada espacio, en cada beso y pensamiento

Aquella noche junto a ti
Yo no me pude imaginar
Que iba acabar loco por ti

Es un pensamiento que me quema
Why se adueña de mi mente

Fuerte, te siento aqui muy fuerte
Mi corazon suplica
Why se muere por tenerte
Por poder besarte, por poder llenarte
Lo que siento es fuerte

Quiero repetir
La sension que me dejo
Tu piel ardiendo sobre mi
Todos tus besos tu pasion

No tienen compasin

Que estan llenas de recuerdos

De caricias y morales
De promesas que se hicieron
Hace tiempo
Una noche como hoy

Son noches para llorar
Son noches para sufrir
Son noches para olvidar

Que se le pasa hablando de ti
Que todavia guarda la esperanza
Que vuelvas aqui

Las palabras de mama,
Pero como la queria,
Nunca la quise escuchar.

Que no confiara en ti
Que tu amor no era sincero

Con tu visa de paseo

A skill I needed to have to be a survivor

Is this the 50's, or 1999

Plays guitar, sounds like a chainsaw buzzing
In the crowd, I see his mom and dad
I said ""Hey, hey Uncle, man your son is bad""

But sometimes, sometimes bad is bad
Cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad.

Across the street, a neon sign
All you can eat for a dollar ninety nine
Aww, that old stew is the baddest in the land
But one dollar's worth was all that I could stand

But sometimes, sometimes bad is bad
Cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad.

Back uptown to see Marie
Nobody home, I opened the door with my key
""I love you, Huey"" was the note I read
But there's a strange pair of shoes underneath the bed

All the birds have been blue
They don't know what to do 
Ever since you said goodbye to me
And the flowers in their gloom, have just refused to bloom

'Cause we all want you back, you see
And even Mister Moon
Is left without a tune
And his shadow's lost the harmony

So don't waste any time
Come back and change your mind
Everything will work out
Naturally

You know that love is a struggle 
And only the strong survive
So it's up to me and you
To do what we've got to do

To keep our love alive
And now bees have been gone
And they know that something's wrong
'Cause they don't feel like buzzing at all

And the starts up in the sky, all they do it cry
And that's why the rain must fall
And the early morning sun
He knows that you're the one

And we both miss your company

So don't waste any time
Come back and change your mind
Everything will work out naturally

You know that love, love is a struggle 
And only the strong survive

So it's up to me and you
To do what we've got to do
To keep our love alive

So don't waste any time
Come back and change your mind
We'll be singing harmonies
With the birds and bees

If only you'll be mine
Things will work out fine

Huey Lewis,"He was always the toughest kid 
But he never meant no harm 
But looking back I could see his fate 
Was tattooed on his arm 
Walking through the courtyard 
Always there to be seen 
He and little Janie 
Together they were the king and queen 

He was the only one, who ever really knew 
He was the only one, what can we do 
He was the only one, he always showed us how 
He was the only one, where is he now 

Three years later at the bus stop 
I know I'll never forget 
He looked smaller in real ways 
As he bummed a cigarette 
And I asked him what he'd been doing 
And how's little Janie anyway 
Seems he was drunk 
They had a fight 
Janie got hurt and they took him away 

He was the only one, who ever really knew 
He was the only one, what can we do 
He was the only one, he always showed us how 
He was the only one, where is he now 

I can still see him standing there 
Just like yesterday 
Leaning on a '56 
Giving his secrets away 
Is it any wonder 
I feel a little lonely 
He's not just the only one 
He's the one and only 

I heard about the accident 
There's not much left to say 
He wandered out in the middle of the freeway 
It must have happened right away 
And I though about what a shame it was 
Now that it's all said and done 
And it may sound strange 
But even now 
He's still the only one 

He was the only one, who ever really knew 
He was the only one, what can we do 
He was the only one, he always showed us how 
He was the only one, where is he now",The Only One

And we've had our ins and outs, but that's the way it's supposed to be
We thought about giving up, but we could never stay away
Thought about breaking up, but now we know it's much too late
And it's no great mystery

Because I can tell what's going on

I'm working out most everyday and watching what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me, but I don't even car
I know that it's crazy
I know that it's nowhere
But there is no denying that
It's hip to be square

It's not too hard to figure out, you see it everyday
And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway, It don't look like a lot of fun

to love one another for eternity
I've got a good job but James says no one understands him he's an artist
He needs time to find out what that means
He answers to a higher calling the moon and the sun and the stars are
falling through his time and his space and I'm lucky to be part of it all
He is bigger than life he sees things he knows things he is not like you and
me
James finally found a steady job and now we're gonna settle down

to take to find the life he thought would just happen to him like the

And rattled the bug on it's vein x2
Around the world five times x5

Hugh Cornwell,"The other night I chanced upon an irate caterpillar
He was irate he had a darting face
Crinkled with old forms
Appendage arms spread out fanlike glancing
His string noise boxes
The rest were a howling wolf
Afraid to be left upright against sleeping forte
Calling to the caterpillar
Throughout the time span
Wanting to be fed wanting attention
Wanting waiting full of tension
They don't crowd the spiderlike object
They didn't object at least not many
Just waiting for the next creak
From his aching limbs to reach their brains through
Cup-like objects stuck on the sides of their heads
No-one joked no-one spoke
They became embarrassed and planted contempt
Under their haunches
When the caterpillar rested
His appendages ummed
His appendages arred
But not connecting with
The string noise boxes
And...
They...all just gazed

The other night I chanced upon an irate caterpillar (repeat)

Shakespeare holds no secret still
Watch the coin is tossed to the air
When it lands the winner's found
Declares and mocks the tail
Who can say what good becomes of

Win or lose amongst the breathing trees
They will not follow they will not
Time enough to grow into some

Finding creatures awesome yet

Losers win the chance to drift amongst

Until your voice goes hoarse

You reach high when she's way down below
Her feet smell her nose runs
She can sniff an Indian at fifty guns
She's so soft she makes it hard
And what's more she's built the wrong way round

Never wears a hat outside her face
Shields the sun from her gaze
Starts at the end in a maze - amazing!
She's built the wrong way round
Wakes you up puts you to sleep
Closes her eyes just to take a peep
Little Bo peep follows her sheep
Wears a big woolen jersey
Makes her flesh get up and creep

There's one or two uptight women on this brand new plane
Been held up in the frost in Moscow and I'm getting out fast
Been deiced from my tail to my mast
Five miles high and heading for you x 2

It seems that the longer you go for the crazier I get
It always seems to happen and I've not been wrong yet
My tank is overfull and my course has been set
It's what you could call a maiden flight with no safety net
Five miles high and heading for you x 2

I'm up front surrounded by the chinese eyes
But I'm holding out until I feel the thunder thighs
First thing I get to do when I get to see to your lively mind
Is get upstairs in the hirise horse race and I'll be betting blind
Five miles high x 3

Heading for you

Getting more exotic every minute that we fly east
Feeling kinda seasick at the very least
There's lots of water flowed by since you've been gone
There ain't no-one to touch you know where you belong
Five miles high and heading for you x 2

Hugh Cornwell,"When we met I thought that you'd take off and try to fly
Then a man with giant lips began to catch your eye
You were caught on a hook
It was straight from a book
Didn't listen to advice and started telling tales
On the runway low on gas your engine starts to fail
If you tried you could win
Extra time take a spin
Hot head I hear you're coming through
Your ears are burning that's nothing new
Hot head you're wearing no parachute!
Knowing one or two up in the blue prepared me good

Still in flight with her man

Hugh Cornwell,"A dirty broom an empty room you'll never find a better tomb
The passing of a lasting chill a night a day and time stands still
The walls just stand their stories cold they watch a history unfold
The sink is dry the fat don't fry and still the reasons pass you by
When will the troubled soul descend and make amends?
When will some laughter come alive?
And walk inside walk inside walk inside
A house of sorrow is a halfway house
A house of sorrow is a halfway house

The doors don't shut the pipes just froze the roof is cracked without a cause
You feel the sadness everywhere you hear a creaking on the stair
And just to liven up your day the spirit walks decides to stay
She wakes inside your living room and suffocates you with her gloom
When will the troubled soul descend and make amends?
When will some laughter come alive
And walk inside

In the desert getting well

Please will you show us how to live
It's just a step away
When you got nothing left to give

Seven horses not enough to
Even fill the tank with gas
Monty's outside he wasn't inside
But he knows all things must pass
Bucking broncos we're all cowboys
Hanging from another age
Getting sauced that's just how the film goes

Hugh Cornwell,"Blue is the colour soon arriving
When all the darkness of the mood just drifts away
Red has a habit of surviving
Can justice breathe some life into her guilty day
When purple leaves begin their falling
They mirror all the confidence that's gone
With orange lights illuminating
Familiar patterns calm the fears that make you run

I see all the colours of the rainbow

Indigo calls and beckons slowly
The consolation of a void in which to fall
And yellow ochre humbles lowly
A constellation flickers bright along the hall
Can green remain as fresh as dawning?
The vivid space suggested never to return
As bronze arrives after the morning
He silent as a tree lives falls and has to burn

Better in black and white and chrome I have to say Now the big sleep
You play the hero and the villain every day
Equally charming in an unassuming way
See the girls weep
And now you've said goodbye a million hearts are sad
We were there with you Bob so were my mum and dad
Now the big sleep

Suits and swimming trunks and clergy you don't care
Every one of them is scary we beware
I like Cape Fear
You're out of place in some but you lift them from the mire
Better in the heat to watch your pecs perspire
Then there was Angel Face
And when you leave a scene a thousand footsteps fall
Can't wait to see you back and walking very tall
Before the big sleep

Now sleep ...

No-one around like you and Jimmy stuart anymore
I'd like to don my suit and even up the score
And try to take over
Painted ladies ain't so glamorous today
Please take me back to 1941 today

You have to laugh a lot to stay ahead of the game

I feel so far from home
My blood is never warm
My skin can feel the storm
The lights they flicker bright
As we approach the night knowing

I watch the guitars play
I feel the drumbeat sway
I smell the singers sweat
The song ain't got there yet
The crowd is feeling good
I know from where I'm stood it's growing
You'll find me on the dark side of the room

The road it never ends
The heart that never mends
Will you be scared tonight
Will the birds all take flight
And you might see the moon
From this side of the room glowing

You'll find me on the dark side of the room
Just look and you might find me there

Hugh Cornwell,"I met a man without a face
With knowledge of the human race
He smelt and felt and dealt with grace
Stupid enough to think that he'd seen it all

I saw his eyes as he saw mine
An optimism quite sublime
He furnished words to touch your heart
At least it seemed at the very start

Lay back on me pal I'm here
You won't have nothing to fear

Thought I'd seen those locks before
Tap tapping on a creaking door
I'd let him in at times of war
To take my mind off senseless misery

And as the recognition hit
Mugshots I'd seen began to fit
I said to him you worthless shit
He laughed and cried in a soliloquy

Se ató dos alas la ambición de mi suburbio.
Con este tango nació el tango y como un grito
Salió del sórdido barrial buscando el cielo.
Conjuro extraño de un amor hecho cadencia
Que abrió caminos sin más ley que su esperanza,
Mezcla de rabia, de dolor, de fe, de ausencia
Llorando en la inocencia de un ritmo juguetón.

Nacieron sin pensarlo las paicas y las grelas,
Luna en los charcos, canyengue en las caderas
Y un ansia fiera en la manera de querer

Those devil lips that know so well the art of lying
And though I see the danger, still the flame grows higher

I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away

We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Hugh Masekela,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,

How it would brag about its days of glory when it almost became a happy home

I just came back in town to sign the papers the house is sold now it's no longer mine
And since the place I built for you once meant so much to me
Thought I'd drop by and see it one more time
I parked the car got out and looked it over
The unkept lawn now seemed so strange to me
That rambling rose that I'd set out with tender care had died
And weeds grow now where flowers used to be
I walked up close looked through the picture window
The past was oh so clear as I looked through
I listened close and almost heard those tender words of love

yo canto pa' no llorar.

nunca dijiste por que.
Yo me consuelo pensando
que fue traición de mujer.

tal vez no lo puedas creer,
tal vez te provoque risa

Es facil pegar un tajo
pa' cobrar una traición
o jugar en una daga

Pero no es facil cortarse
los tientos de un metejon
cuando estan bien amarrados
al palo del corazón.

why te vayas con el sol.
Pa' decirte que si, a veces,
o pa' gritarte que no.

Cuando rajes los tamangos
Buscando ese mango
Que te haga morfar

Que es sordo y es mudo

Verás que todo es mentira
Verás que nada es amor
Que al mundo nada le importa

Aunque te muerda un dolor
No esperes nunca una ayuda

Buscando un pecho fraterno
Para morir abrazao

Después de cinchar
Lo mismo que a mí

Se prueban la ropa
Que vas a dejar

Te acordarás de este otario
Que un día, cansado
Se puso a ladrar

Verás que todo es mentira
Verás que nada es amor
Que al mundo nada le importa
Yira, yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Aunque te muerda un dolor
No esperes nunca una ayuda
Ni una mano, ni un favor

Aunque te quiebres la vida
Yira, yira
Ya verás que en la vida todo es mentira
No sufras siempre vente yira yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Yira, yira
Te criticaran, te adularan y te enviaran
No hagas caso lo que digan

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Yira, yira
De arriba abajo te miran
Hay que gente engreída y atrevida

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Yira, yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Aunque te muerda un dolor
No esperes nunca una ayuda
Ni una mano, ni un favor

Hugo Diaz,"San Juan y boedo antigua  y todo el cielo
Pompeya y más allá la inundación
Tu melena de novia en el recuerdo
Y tu nombre florando en el adiós

La esquina del herrero, barro y pampa
Tu casa, tu vereda y el zanjón
Y un perfume de yuyos y de alfalfa
Que me llena de nuevo el corazón

Sur, paredón y después
Sur, una luz de almacén
Ya nunca me verás cómo me vieras
Recostado en la vidriera y esperándote

Ya nunca alumbraré con las estrellas
Nuestra marcha sin querellas
Por las noches de Pompeya

Las calles y las lunas suburbanas
Y mi amor y tu ventana
Todo ha muerto, ya lo sé

San Juan y boedo antiguo, cielo perdido
Pompeya y al llegar al terraplén
Tus veinte años temblando de cariño
Bajo el beso que entonces te robé

Nostalgias de las cosas que han pasado
Arena que la vida se llevó
Pesadumbre de barrios que han cambiado
Y amargura del sueño que murió

Este amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim

 Eu mesmo mentindo Devo argumentar
 Que isto é bossa nova Que isto é muito natural

 O que você não sabe nem sequer pressente
 é que os desafinados também têm um coração

 Fotografei você na minha Rolleyflex
 Revelou-se a sua enorme ingratidão
 Só não poderá falar assim do meu amor

 também bate um coração",Desafinado

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Hugo Montenegro,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Hugo Winterhalter,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you

Human Drama,"When your bag of secrets opened up and spilled
That radiant glow just disappeared
You rained down from the clouds you were in

Sometimes we can be so blind
But how does pain so bad not bleed
You push, you push, sometimes you don't expect to fall
But it's the violent turning of the golden rule
A lifetime of hell for every minute of heaven

I know your heart is breaking here in the waiting hour
And I know it will never heal here in the waiting hour

So cross your fingers, or your heart
Your idle wish commands no more
The mirror you hate reveals all in this world you control
Just empty out that bag of tricks
Cause in this limbo they don't exist
Just like your vanity, your hopes, your prayers, your dreams
Now did you hear the thunder when you realized
Your very own hands reached in and tore your heart out

I know your heart is breaking here in the waiting hour
And I know it can never heal here in the waiting hour

I know your heart is breaking
I know your heart is breaking
And I know how it feels the first time
In the waiting hour

I know your heart is breaking
I know your heart is breaking
I know your heart is breaking

Human Drama,"When routine bites hard and ambitions are low

And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow

And we're changing our ways taking different roads
And love
Love will tear us apart again

Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through all our lives

We were one and the same

That innocence would never end
Although memories will fade no, no

We had our share of smiles and tears

In your heart friends will still remain

Let the good times bring you back again

Would never end

Tall stem roses saying baby let's run away

The actors gone the empty page
The tears between the lines
Save me from these wild imaginings
Try to stop my heart remembering
Acting like there's someone else, when there's only me

Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.

all that's left is an unhappy ending.

Que tu vivieras
Que tus ojitos jamas se hubieran
Cerrado nunca y estar mirándolos
Amor Eterno,
E inolvidable
Tarde o temprano estaré contigo
Para seguir, amándonos

Yo he sufrido tanto por tu ausencia
Desde ese día hasta hoy, no soy feliz
aunque tengo tranquila mi conciencia
Se que pude haber yo hecho mas por ti
Oscura soledad estoy viviendo
La misma soledad de tu sepulcro
Tu eres el amor de cual yo tengo
El mas triste recuerdo de Acapulco.

Como quisiera, ay
Que tu vivieras
Que tus ojitos jamas se hubieran
Cerrado nunca y estar mirándolos
Amor Eterno,
E inolvidable
Tarde o temprano estaré contigo
Para seguir, amándonos

Humberto Ramírez,"Casi todos sabemos querer 
Pero pocos sabemos amar
Es que amar y querer no es igual
Amar es sufrir querer es gozar
El que ama pretende seguir,el que 
Ama su vida la da
Y el que quiere pretende vivir y  
Nunca sufrir y nunca sufrir
El que ama no puede pensar todo lo da 
Todo lo da, el que quiere pretende 
Olvidar y nunca llorar y nunca llorar 
El querer pronto puede acabar, el amor 
No conoce el final,es que todos sabemos 
Querer pero pocos sabemos amar 

El amar es el cielo y la luz, el amar 
Es total plenitud, es el mar que no  
Tiene final es la gloria y la paz
Es la gloria y la paz, el querer es la 
Carne y la flor es buscar el obscuro 
Rincón, es morder arañar y besar  
Es deseo fugaz, es deseo fugaz 

El que ama no puede pensar todo lo da 
Todo lo da, el que quiere pretende 
Olvidar y nunca llorar y nunca llorar

Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet your my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

Not if you care for me

Humble Gods,"This freedom song, goes out to anybody, who's ever been judged, harassed,
Or thrown in jail for smoking the plant marijuana.

Fuck it, now why you gotta judge me, who the fuck are you?
Trying to run up in my life, and tell me what to do
You need to arrest your son, because he's selling pounds of weed
He's getting over on you, and you're stupid enough not to see

You ask, how much money have I spent buying weed?
Not at much as I spend on important legal fees
You wouldn't believe how much it costs to be free
A couple of G's every time they find a roach on me
Shit, I never learn, the lesson they teach
Do the robot (??) When they pull the gun and say ""freeze""
Get off these, you're the one being thieves
Take away my rights and detach my salaries

Yo, I'mma keep baling, fuck the police
Alcohol is legal need to legalize weed
I know they know, so what's the problem?
You got the gun, I got the plant that's how we solve em

You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
Take's me to plant my seeds all across the land, across the land
Mr. Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Freedom of the plant, as we came to take a stand, take a stand

why'know I never understand them nigga stands on the plant
While it grows on a branch, holding a gun in yo' hand?
Cause more people on the earth, but illegal it's absurd
What's more evil a weapon or some herb?

Yo, relax and kick back, worry about real crimes
Smoking a plant? You're out your fuckin' mind
Gimme a break, yo ass fake as fake
Faker then the people putting food on your plate

Stop that, drop that, give me that mic
Rough me, cuff me, read me my rights
No work higher, born and bred, black boots, billy clubs on my head
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck that shit
Legalize freedom celebrate gods gift

You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, rahhhhh!
Mr. Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Protect and serve, slap my face that must be illegal sir
Fingers in my cavity? It struck a nerve
Now I'm on Apollo (?) street now I'm saved
(No Idea what he says here, just random yelling me thinks)
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, rahhhh!
Swear to god, smoke on one with the law but it was mad
Never thought that he had it, but he used mace (?)
Hit me with his billy club it's just a plant

Humble Pie,"Red light mama looking for a ride
There's fire in your loins but you're cold inside
Quiet to the world, that your nights are free
At 50 cents a time understandably, it don't make it

Now, I don't expect you to take my advice
But you can make it easy, just review the price
'Cause you're looking awful pretty
And twice as nice to know, let's get it on, peel it off

Now, where's your cousin ruby with her jet hot lips
She got lifesaver boobs and 42"" hips, some kind of monster
Those alligator slippers and thigh high boots
She works from east to west and deals in blue veined flutes
It's boogity boogity

We know that she's a hustler and she's built like a tank
Wears hairnets in her armpits and her breath is rank
She gotta swelled belly and there's money in her bank

Red light mama, red hot!
Can't you see what you've got?
Red light mama, red hot!
Don't you know what you've got?
Get it off

I heard about your sister down in Tennessee
In between the sheets she's making history and don't we want her
Your mother's still in Memphis on a cocaine farm
There's no place left to shoot it in that thing she calls an arm

There ain't no backing out when you're born to lose
You take it as you find it and you pay your dues
She could've made her fortune if she'd stayed and played the blues

Don't you know what you've got?

I make my bed below the sky

'Cause they'll never ever find me 'neath the coconut tree.

I left home because of my nagging wife
Man oh man it was a terrible life
She took all my money and she left me with none
So I packed my bags and decided to run.

My wife and family are looking for me

We'll see the start of a brand new day
Heaven help us when it arrives
One more day with tears in our eyes
For the only one, lonely one
Lonely one, where can she be?

The figure stands at the windowpane
Up to the hill he looks again
Thinking back, he knows he was wrong
How could he leave his home for so long
And he's back to find no change of mind
He was blind, where can she be?

Why does he stand just outside the door
It does no good, he's stood there before
And just waved his hand, I don't understand
There's no one there, so who can explain?

Got the pedal pecked hard
And the Mustang drive

But it makes me feel good
Like sneakin' out late
Tellin' white lies
Stealin' one more kiss tonight

I try my best to behave
And I can't help feelin' this way
It's not my fault so don't blame me
'Cause love makes me
And is it some kind of fiction?
Or the sweetest addiction?
So what if I'm crazy
'Cause love makes me do it
Love makes me do it
Yes it does

Well it don't take much
I'm a sucker for the little things
Like the touch on my hand
And the sweet way she leans into me
Yeah, it makes me feel good
Yeah, it's a buzz how much I'm into this
No I can't get enough
Gotta have more than just one kiss

'Cause it feels so good

Gotta have a little faith to fall back on
And then all that you've got left is being strong,
Gotta find a little faith to fall back on

I didn't treat my girl like she was mine
Yeah, I thought I didn't need her at the time
But I changed my way of thinkin' when she left
Yeah, I finally learned my lesson, but I learned it by myself

But, then the answers that you know just prove you wrong,
Gotta have a little faith to fall back on
And then all that you've got left is being strong,
Gotta find a little faith to fall back on

These days I'm not sure if I know
What I'm doing here or where I'll go
But, every night I say the same old prayer:

“God, I don't have to see you. I know that you're there
'Cause there were times I thought I wouldn't make it home
But I kept a little faith to fall back on.
Yeah, and I've learned to put my trust where it belongs
And I've gotta little faith to fall back on.”

I'd paint you a picture, write you a song
And I'd do it all over if I did it all wrong

Well, curse the man who made the sweet perfume that cast the spell
And curse the night that made us kiss beneath the star that fell.
And curse the man before me
Didn't warn me when he could.

You were standin' arms wide open right in front of me.
The closer I moved toward you, the further away you stood.
I woke up and I whispered, ""I loved you more than I should.""

I may look crazy in mama's eyes, but I don't mind

It could be a dead end road
And I could be chasing down a broken dream
But I don't even know
Just to where this thing is gonna lead
It's a mystery

No it don't get better than this

Oh now

She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress hotter than the heat in July
With her wind blown hair it just wasn't fair the way she was blowing my mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane gets it's name from a girl like this
She's the cat fight kind keeps you up at night hanging on to the edge of a kiss
She's a beautiful mess, yeah the kind you love to love
But what happens next,
I got a feeling when the sun comes up

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up, little leap-way, little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels somewhere between going and gone
You get so lost that you can't turn it off, you give in and you just turn it on
She's a harp on a reign red lips like a flame, she's the girl from your favorite song
What a beautiful mess,
A one part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
The kind of flood you'll never forget

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

Let yours beat out so loudly
That everyone can hear it
Yeah, I promise you don't need to hide it anymore

Maybe some other time but gives me some peace of mind
If that was the end of the ride, I'm getting back in line

'Cause I'm telling you
There's nothing like starting over,
There's nothing like shedding a heartache,
Writing a new page to say what you wanna say
There's nothing like a heart wide open,

You can let go and take the weight off your shoulders
There's nothing like starting over,
There's nothing like starting over

Love's got a way of letting you know
When the time to hold on or time to let go, tells you so
It's the cold in the kiss, of looking away,
The say what you mean, well do you mean what you say?
I don't really know
It's time to reset, rethink, reposition,
There's nothing wrong with me, it's just a condition
It's the science of love, fly when we fall, through it all,
We turn with the tide, 'cause we're free on the other side

But who's going to hold these hands that shake
Who's going to mend these bones that break
Who'll wipe these eyes that never see

You can find me in tha a bay bay
Buckin' full of cry-stale V.I.Ped up
Goin' hard in body tap where they throw that cheese up
I been about my paper niggas know about my stack
You don't like that dirty money send yo girl to wipe me down
Million dollars on my neck and wrist shine for a mile
She wanna see it up close then she gotta walk it out
I'm tha king of this rap shit what the fuck they talkin' bout
Niggas cant sell records so they blame it on tha South
I be all through Shreve-port Louisiana ballin'
Like who the fuck said ain't no choppers in New Orleans
My rims so clean they spinnin' like a world-wind
Pull up at the club bitches textin' they girlfriends

Pull up at the light my shit so bright

Tell my label to cut the check I'ma gone spend it up
On the Bentley painted yellow like a baby school bus

And my pants sag low like I was rockin a pull-up
When I stop and I pull up I'ma be already full of Vodka
I keep that in my cup a bay bay on make me bussa
And if you try to take my chain ima snatch yo face off
I got diamonds in my ear the same size as baseballs
Where they at they lost I don't thank they on my level
Lil mama thank I'ma bite her with this alligator sweater
A bay bay was just the beginning im finna run tha game
Whoever feel different can holla at Hurricane
Wanna be talkin' but heavy artillery break up yo chest if you runnin' yo mouth
And every since I dropped that a bay bay I been runnin' the South

Hurricane Chris,"Beat In My Trunk

[Chorus]
15's in the trunk, 4-12's in the trunk, 4-10's in the trunk, 6x9's in the dash
License plates rattlin', bumper keep draggin', trunk straight blastin'
Yea I got that, I got that , I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that , I got that, I got that
And it sound like
I got that, I got that , I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that
And it sound like
I got that beat up in my trunk I got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk yea yea
I got that beat up in my trunk I got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk yea yea
I got that beat up in my trunk I got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk yea yea
License plates rattlin', bumper keep draggin', trunk straight blastin'
Yeah

Boom boom blam blam thats what you hear when I'm comin'
4 15's in the trunk got the license plates hummin'
And you should hear the regal with them tweeters when I'm comin'
Take a look at the speakers thats exactly how I'm stuntin'

Ostrich on my seats and ferocious beat in the trunk
Knockin' pictures off the wall and I got sixes on my duck
I don't think these boys ready they don't think I really be wet
And my Chevy shine stupid like I sprayed it with baguettes

You gotta get on my level lil' daddy step up your game
I got speakers all in the grill of my car like im insane
Feel like I got music surgically implanted in my brain
I just chunk the deuce and hit the drank cause I cant hear a thing

The other day I got a ticket listenin' to that hurricane
Soon as the police got out my sight I turned back up the bang
So much vibration in my trunk that my car wont stay in one lane
White people be lookin' at my car like honey thats insane

[Chorus]

I got some speakers in my trunk that I know you aint never seen
The fiber glass box and amps I got 3
Lil' mama say she like big cars that hit hard
I pulled up at her house it was her and about six broads

I hopped outta the truck with me and my six boys
Me and my sick clique them boys they hit hard
Speakin' of hittin' hard the trunk makin' some noise
Neighbors callin' the laws cause I done knocked they windows off

When I pull up on the block I'm shakin' the whole ground
If the baby touch my car the baby will fall down
But the trunk hit harder than Tyson in the first round
I got that amazin' base and I wont turn it down

Before you pull up on me boy you better get your head right
Let me show you what I do to haters who wont play it right
Pull up on them boys who be stuntin' at the red light
Open up my trunk on em and see who got they bread right

[Chorus: x 2]",Beat in My Trunk

My mama cooked a meal for me, but I
Cant eat. Its too much shit on my mind,

My daddy jus' got home, but they jus' came and got my nigga, poor
Victor Feelin got caught up wit two choppas and a pistol
And I'm beginning to hate these rap niggas real fast
Put my name on a track im gon come where you at and blast 
Just the other day I almost had to do a nigga
He thought I was go fight him, but I wus gon shoot a nigga
Now I know that sound fucked up, but I aint got no time
Soon as you whip a nigga he jus' gon go get his iron, his nine, or his rugle, howeva he wanna do ya 
I ain't thinkin', I ain't talkin', I ain't boxing, ima shoot ya
His nine or his rugle, howeva he wanna do ya

Subject of how these hataz wish me death,

Left
So I keep the ""K"" off in the trunk, I'm heated when I step, 
Cause beefin' ain't beefin' until
You stop somebody breath

I remember one Sunday we hit the scene, it was packed, sittin' on 22's wit the paint wet black
Me an my nigga he got my back, I got his back
Dem hoes standing on top of the car shakin' cat
We finna do a show, so we pull the truck to the back
But when I hit the door, them niggas
Ain't know how to act
Dem hoes grabbin on my chain, pullin on my plaits
Dey want me to take

But when we got outside, them pussy niggas was hatin', actin'
Like he wanna do me something but he fakin'

One false move ima leave you shakin on the pavement

Why don't you criticize me for actin' like I act if I ain't never had a thang
My daddy got locked when I was 12 my whole life changed
My momma hustled hard and then had to get the bills paid
While you probably ridin' round the in yo Escalade
But now that I got money I went and bought me 2 mansions
Just to stunt on them niggas who told me I never had it
I walk out the door the other day and my momma told me you got a lot to learn
She told me just because we got all these money to burn don't think I can't be a turned
To go bigger to the streets
So I stay back with some heat
24 hours 7 days of the week cause they free
24 hours 7 days of the week I'm a beast

I'm 18 years old and I done seen more drama than a lil' bit
And don't advise you to talk about it unless you lived it

Tryin' to ball like me
And these is for my niggas who used to roll gold d poppin the trunk on them swangers Hopping out in tall tees so all my niggas that ballin' and feel like me from the struggle and gutta to makin' a live g
Keep my head up remember who got me right where I'm at today as long as I got money I give a damn what a hater say

Fightin', ain't wit it, don't like it, don't do it, not likely

Get outta my bed, get outta my room, get outta my house,
Get outta my life And you can't come back and holla when you get your mind right, 
'cause as far as I'm concerned you ain't got nothing I like
Need to keep on kickin' and walkin' the other way
Please stay outta my face, 
I ain't got nothing to say, but Ay Bay Bay I say that in every phrase
This supposed to be a sad song, but I said Ay Bay Bay
And I can't stand the way you act when people hang up in your face, what that got to do with me, that's your phone anyway
Why in the hell would I give them your number to catch myself up in my game, 
I am not lame, I got game, H-U double R - I to the Cane

Get the hell up outta my sight, lil' mama you think I'm lien, here some money
For a cab hope you have a nice ride

One who would not deny lovers?

Hush,"I take a deep breath and unload every thought 
Everything I've ever known anything I was taught 
When I think I'm on a roll I have to slow down 
Cuz my words get ahead of myself I know how 
To make you feel how I feel my words are so vivid 
See how I live it all I got to give is 
My pain my stress one blade and one knife 
Ends with one slice my name and my life 
All rests with my sons so they can do better 
I need to be here so we can be together 
But life is so hard seeing through these eyes 
A world with no heart believing these lies 
Can you be strong before your times up 
Looking to find what you've made your mind up 
There has to be a change so my seeds can reach 
Anything they can grasp anything to teach 

CHORUS 
I got 24 hours to live my whole fate 
All I have left in my heart is one take 
One breath one sigh one death and one try 
One more reason to ask God why? 
It's my life it ends when I say 
So until my time is up on that day 
I'll do what I gotta do live how I wanna live 
Be who I wanna be prove what I gotta prove 

Verse 2 
It's not so funny how we live each day 
Wake up go to work come home in replay 
We say we love life inside it's untrue 
Unless you got dollars aside it's not you 
I used to wake up call in or just quit 
Cuz I couldn't stand a boss in my face for dumb shit 
You know what I mean that boss with no life 
No sense no friends no kids and no wife 
Career motivated on an hourly wage 
Me well see I'm on a whole other page 
I gotta make money man fuck I got kids 
Whose father and uncles in time have done bids 
Iced out homies only preserve thugs 
To get what's deserved or they deserve slugs 
If murder was the case that they gave me 
Dear God I wonder can you save me 

CHORUS 

Verse 3 
What if in one blink you could end all the pressure 
Built up inside no one bares to measure 
To pain to hide inside with no stress 
No tears to be cried outside and no less 
Make it all wash away with one scream 
One shot one bullet one love and one dream 
Gone to a place where mouths never speak 
But thoughts convey words peep the technique 
My time is coming watch me when I shine 
I strive for something watch me when I rhyme 
Thoughts race through my head like track stars 
A hudred miles an hour inside like fast cars 
I can't slow down if I do it's all gone 
Everything I've done up 'til now and this song 
Ends right here my life and no fear 
My fight and my struggle to die with no tears 

CHORUS

Verse 1
I walk this planet the most rugged
Most can only see this heat but don't touch it
Cuz' you might get 'em burned
When I come through it's my turn
Never get in my way or you're getting' rolled over
Like Rover cuz' my fist's a bulldozer
I throw these dogs in the street to melodys
Like a heartbeat playing against piano keys
It's a breeze 365 degrees
Turn around and you might catch these so justt freeze
A riddle with no clues I'm a walking nightmare
Anywhere anytime boy I don't fight fair
A day in my shoes is a day with no fear
So walk barefooted and save your whole year
And I wear a mouthpiece cuz' I grit my teeth
So just bite your tongue before you get your ass beat?

My crew is all fired up
Y'all better just wise up

In the club to a beat
In the street wit' a beef in the heat
EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!
If it's black or it's white
If it's wrong or it's right day or night
EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!
Don't matter if you win or you lose
Only one thing to do
EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!
Put it down every town every city
If you feel me and you wit' me
EVERYBODY GET FIRED UP!!!

Verse 2
I'm an S.O.B.
That's a son of a bitch homie you don't know me
I was put here to slap you silly and clap Billy
And clap everything in the track like Mac Milly's
And that's just the half really
You don't wanna see the other side I suggest you act quickly
And ran swiftly and get outta my way before the gats empty
(C'MON!!!) and just tempt me?

My crew is all fired up
Y'all better just wise up
Everybody gettin' sized up
Before we all rise up
Start runnin' your times up
Cuz' when my crew ride up
The sky gon' light up

Hush,"I'm the next new kid not on the block
But I will knock your block off quick not with a glock
But two guns and knuckles that bring pain
It's a shame you couldn't spit venom on my name

Is it worth all the fame and money it's no joke
I done came from nothing to something it's so funny
How you could just start at the bottom so hot
Til they see you at spot when you got no product

And the crowds do flock to see you
And the shot you got and it's hot to be you
And shocked to see through all the squat they feed you
You did not squeeze through in a plot they need you

The dude calling shots at the top could be you
Unless you get got and the rest it rings true
It's just the beginning of pain and my glory
Starts when I finish the end of this story

Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)

We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
We put 'em down, put 'em down put 'em down now
We put 'em down, uh!

See I float like a butterfly, you could fly like a bee
With a sting but could never fight me
Call it Bulletproof, Teflon with a voice
And track that hard just to put it through

'Cuz it's a banger comin' in showin' the middle finger
Once I begin to flow you'll know anger
One dagger sharp with the tongue, I walk with a swagger
You seem to stagger

One slip of the jaw and Hush I'm Quick Draw McGraw
'Cuz me I see all see y'all fallout
Ballout on the streets and seize all
And beef I breath for

Try me lyrically I'll bully and squeeze off 'til fully
See y'all I'll risk it
When your dogs to limp for bizkits call for this shit

Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now

I'm here, you've been waiting for me
You've been waiting to see, now that I'm here
I'll be right on the top of things, no you don't want it now
'Cuz we be poppin' thangs, no you don't want it
I said, ""No you don't want it now""

When I'm to hot you're lovin' it
When I'm not you're just not into the plot with no slug in it
Just not shot with a glock or Tupac in it
Must not be in a squad with no thug in it

'Cuz I'm a breakthrough where I take you
Now I will shake you up like a quake and make it so painful
Pistols ain't playful it's the way crews act they erase you
If I'm to face you I'll replace you quick

When I spit shit that's so graceful Mase will embrace you
So you better pray Jesu sways your way just to save you
Me I will never die, but I will live on in any song long as forever I
Live for the agony and defeat whatever it is I meet with no tragedy

Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now
Shake the ground
(Everybody move to the sound! Get up!)
We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now

We put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down now

Hustle Gang,"Ay, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She want to hang with us, we want one thing
Just penetrating that throat dog
She choke on it like Smoke Dog
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefa'
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can pay to put a ""69""
And I know what time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
""Why you always give your ass up?
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up.""
She said, ""Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
Then never call back, I still fuck""
And that's fucked up, she's so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds till' it goes down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name because she married now

She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kick it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watching just to see if the police coming
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was going back and forth with these flights
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her ""hurry up, meet me at the room""
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
And my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant""
And you can almost bet she kept it
That's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested, damn!

With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 3-0-5 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv'
But no freestyle I never do
You looking for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlooking every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like about to break a levee

Tried to make some time, ho!

Hutchy,"""Get Away""
(feat. Jermaine Dupri and Krayzie Bone)

[Jermaine Dupri:] Uh-huh, uh uh uh
Whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do
When they come for you, come for you, huh?
Whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do
When they come for you, come for you, what?

[TQ:] No, ain't nowhere to run
And no, ain't nowhere to hide
When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do
But close your eyes and ride, and hope you get away

[TQ:] (No) People always talk about my lifestyle
Tell me nothin' good could come of it
But I always used to figure it was worth my while
That's why I had to hit this lick
11:30, a 6-4, ridin' dirty
I got the goods, but I think they heard me
Lord help me, can I get away?
Stashing stuff away
'cause the boys are comin' to get me
All my people say...

[Chorus]
[TQ:] No, ain't nowhere to run
And no, ain't nowhere to hide
When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do
But close your eyes and ride, and hope you get away
No, ain't nowhere to run
And no, ain't nowhere to hide
When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do
But close your eyes and ride, and hope you get away

[Krayzie:] Now tell me whatcha gonna do (buck buck)
When they come for you
When the murderers hit the curve, and suddenly red rum
I gotta respect, refuse to be the dead one
Will it be this bustin' ass ?, got on vests but we duck, gotta protect our head
It ain't no tellin' when niggas start actin' stupid
'Til they roll up on your block, wit glocks, scheme ass could start shootin'
You want to know what I'm doin'
Keepin' a weapon at all times
'cause shit, the broke niggas ain't got, they runnin' up lookin' around
And I think they really want it
But who want to come to get it
want to pay that unexpected visit to my crib for the riches
I tell 'em to bring it on
A nigga done worked to hard for this shit
Plus I'm a man and a captain goin' down with his ship
Let's do this, AK 47 spittin' it
When the situation get heated, we gon' be there
With the proper tools and equipment, never be slippin'
Ask me what I'm gon' do when the mob get to jumpin'
And gotta fight 'til it's over
If I don't make it, then I'll go down like a soldier
 
[TQ:] Let me hear you say...

No, ain't nowhere to run
And no, ain't nowhere to hide
When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do
But close your eyes and ride, and hope you get away

[TQ:] What you gonna do when they come for you?
Even if they catch me homie, I gotta say somethin'
I won't live another day, and have nothin'
Just believe that I'll be back around in a year or two
Catch me if you can baby
I got a plan baby
Got to get away
Let me hear you say...

Remembering the beloved above all
My heart is beating pit-a-pat

On my good bay horse’s head

On my sweetheart’s braid

Such is the pace of the arched dun horse
Always coming when evening falls
Such is the habit of my young love

Trotting clip-clop clip-clop
It is the trot of my dark-bay horse
Always smiling softly
Such is the habit of my sweet friend

The silver bridle on my horse’s head
Is it enviable, brother-in-law?
Your lambkin staying with me
Is she desirable, brother-in-law?

The golden saddle, rein, and bit
Are they enviable, brother-in-law?
Your precious staying with me
