I stick 'em for the cream, check it

Just how deep can shit get?
Get deeper than your fists
And brothers is mad

Now ya totally crossed out and Kriss kross

Mindy McCready,"She wrote, ""I feel just like that painting collecting dust on the wall
And every day you walk right by me and don't know I'm there at all
And I can't think of one single reason why I should be hanging around""
She signed it, ""I hope that you'll miss me"", and she drove herself out of town

Maybe he'll notice her now, maybe he'll open his eyes
Sometimes it takes somebody leaving for a man to realize
Maybe he'll tell her she's the only thing that he can't live without
Now that she's gone maybe he'll notice her now

When he came home late that evening, he called her name down the hall
He saw the outline of the painting that used to hang there on the wall
And in its place on the nail was a letter, he read it out loud to himself
And the loneliness began to take over and for once he knew just how she felt

Maybe he'll notice her now, maybe he'll open his eyes
Sometimes it takes somebody leaving, for a man to realize
Maybe he'll tell her she's the only thing that he can't live without
Now that she's gone maybe he'll notice her now

He called her up, he said I have been such a fool
She said I will come back and boy I still love you

Mindy McCready,"Bobby got down on his knees, said ""Becky would you marry me""
He slipped that ring up on her hand
She ran home to show her mom, said ""Look here what I've got on""
That diamond sparkled on the band
She looked her daughter in the eye, said ""Girl you are so young
I just pray that in your heart you know that he's the one

Five years down a rocky road, Bobby had some doubts you know
He said ""I'm not sure I feel the same""
She packed up her old suit case, note said ""Bobby, here's your space
I can't stay if your heart's really changed""
He found the ring beside the pen and tears illed up his eyes

Mindy McCready,"Moonlight streaks across a picture of a Marilyn Monroe
While the corn stocks rattle outside her bedroom window
A strong Nebraska wind laying those prairie fields flat
She reads those Bible stories to her calico cat

She stares into the mirror at the cross around her neck
And hears her daddy's sermons echo through her head
Then she closes her eyes and drifts into a dream
Sees her name on a marquis sign beside James Dean

It's the cross against the moon
A restless girl in a pink bedroom
Sweet seventeen and the silver screen
Yellow brick road and technicolor dreams

Nothings black and white
Nothings wrong or right
Just questions that she hopes to answer soon
It's the cross against the moon

Woo-oh, cross against the moon
Oh, yeah 

Her daddy said Sundays spent in Gospel tents
Would keep the stars from stealing her innocence
She wants to live her life without these doubts and fears
But the sound of brimstone burning whispers in her ears

So she fights the battle of what she wants to be
Trying hard to find the courage to chase her dreams
She looks up to Marilyn says your looking good
She puts her Bible in her suitcase, pens off to Hollywood

Took a sweeter smell in those soulful eyes
You see into mine where I hide
I lost in you, it gets lonely sometimes
You really messed me up
You play with my mind
You keep me guessing most of the time

But baby you shake me
You know how to take me 
To all those places that make me crazy

And I hated myself for what I never felt
I couldn't love him
And I had fire in the midnight
Passion that brought tears to my eyes
It was like a joke I couldn't get enough
But he didn't love me

Someone that soothes my heart, burns my soul
Something that I can trust but can't control
All I need is someone who brings me thunder and roses

In a beautiful storm
With somebody who shakes me
And knows how to take me away from this world

A man that loves me and knows how to touch me everywhere

Just keeps me going
All the things I never had
Just keeps me wanting it more
Fighting for it all

I know I'm not that pretty

In the mist of the doubting

Stand up and shout this feelin

And a happy inside running through the sand heavy mind

Hiding away his tears

Tuesday I am fading
And By Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
Cause you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody and messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care

When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, its your mission
And you won't stop till I'm there.

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know?
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away
Yea

On a Monday I am waiting
By Tuesday I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe

Wish I could say the save the world, like I was super girl
The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me

Felt like a symbol with every situation
Any one tour already overcrowded
Project nation, more inflation

Better your damn situation

If you have no occupation?

That you were meant for me

As you go 
Down, down, down, down

When she was asleep, you'd watch her face 
Taken in sleep to a more peaceful place 
You'd stand by the door, cause you were her guard 
And you'd love her in silence, and it wasn't that hard. 

Cause she was the sun, sun, sun 
And you were the moon 
And the light of the sun 
Eclipses the moon 

Oh you loved her anyway 
And she tried to love you

I could fall if you don't call 
a sick safety net appears when I'm with you 

Oh, I climb, so high waiting to fall 
And then I cry, like a child, on a neverending ride 

How does it go down, when you're the biggest kid in your own playground 
And how do you see me, how do I fit in your hierarchy? 
Oh you tell the girls line up in single file, just gotta rearrange my denial 
So I can play with you, and now I see, all the shit that isn't me 
I'm too relieved to be mad, relieved and sad 

I misplaced my mind, thought it was lost 
But now I find, you were just very, very unkind 

You know I always found, that my feet were dangling looking for solid ground 
Is it maybe worth closing down the Ivory Tower 
And coming back down to earth?

Last time you fell in love
Was the first time

Love has a shape, you feel it swallowed down into your head
And surface in your heart
In the late summer night as bending of time
In a million years seems to last all night
She tells you, you're the only one

Last time you fell in love
Was the first time
Last time you fell in love
Was the first time

Oh, it gives you something to talk about
Something to hold on to forever

You said goodbye, half way through the window of a car
And tail lights drowned her out

Minnie Driver,"Court the darkness like she's your lover
Girl you nailed one time and can't get over
Feverish and sleepless at night
It's only because you cannot tear your eyes from her

If love is the answer you seek
You're askin' the wrong kind of question
The wrong kind of question will keep
You askin' me, askin' me for love

And all the stars and satellites give you nothing
'Cause all the satellites died

And all the satellites in your atmosphere
They burn for you but you're cold as mars
I know you see the light in the sky like I do
But for you they're just dying stars

If love is the answer you seek
You're askin' the wrong kind of question
The wrong kind of question will keep
You askin' me, askin' me for love

And all the stars and satellites give you nothing
'Cause all the satellites died

I guess there's poetry in a day less life
And profit to be made from your pain
I hope you call me up if you ever get old
I would like to see your face again

If love is the answer you seek
You're askin' the wrong kind of questions
The wrong kind of questions will keep
You askin' me, askin' me for love

You askin' me, askin' me for love
You askin' me, askin' me for love
You askin' me, askin' me for love

You're asking the wrong kind of questions

Minnie Riperton,"Blowing softly through a meadow 
Laughing like a baby, breeze tapping 
lightly at the treetops, whispering among the leaves 

You hear the magic song, that ancient poets sing 
It's sweet as morning dew and sounds a lot like springtime 
When you close your eyes 
You feel your heat go there 
So close your eyes and you may find that 
Fireflies were as bright as stars; 
Close your eyes and remember 
Summertime lingered on and on 
Close your eyes and remember 
Your first love made the world stand still 
Close your eyes and remember 
Close your eyes and remembers when 
The moon was made of cheese 

Racing swiftly through the mountains 
Bubbling along the stream 
Sighing sweetly through the hollow 
Gentle as an infant's dream",Close Your Eyes and Remember
Minnie Riperton,"(c. stepney)

Sail out of the dawn glide past the day
Drift into the mist float far away
Lift up the latch
Squeaks of the past, dull lighted patch
Sail sideways to morning backwards till noon

Climb into your head, look where you dare
Sit on every snowflake kissing air
Roam deep in the canyons beyond time
Reach through every curtain clouding mind

Greet each blinking dot before your eyes
Weep with tender rose petals sighs
Slip under the crack beneath your door
Stepl over the line where sky meets shore

Only in the time it takes to tell you
For not to tell, but to know is wrong
Only in the time it takes to want you
I've known it all by myself to long
Only in the time it takes to tease you
Don't be dismayed by my subtle ways
Only in the time it takes to kiss you
I've wasted so may precious days
I've known too long
This can't go on

Wherever we choose to be
A barren land becomes a paradise,

Never, ever say you don't love me truly
Whenever, however, wherever
For as long as you live be faithful to me

The ripples run into the sun
And your smile blends with the clouds that flutter by me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? what do I see?

I see the children playing in the sun
And there is love enough for each and everyone
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Things that might be, if we look we just might see
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring

Merry-go-round without a sound
I hear your song in the breeze that rock-a-byes me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? what do I see?

I see the lord inside of everyone
Can it be my dream will really come
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Things that might be, if we look we just might see
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring

The reasons for my life are in a million faces
Like aching promises I feel them in my bones
Slipping through my fingers to dance upon the road
The reasons for my life are more than I can hold
But oh, the sweet delight to sing with all my might
To spark the inner light of wonder burning bright
You're not alone
You're not alone

The reasons for my life are buried in deep places
Words once could awaken them
These seeds that I have sown
Ringing through the madness to crash against the cold
The reasons for my life cannot be bought or sold

The reasons for my life are filling all my spaces
Like rushing waters flow, they carry me along
Twisting through my memory to pull free from the load
The reasons for my life are more than I was told

Minnie Riperton,"Will somebody wear me to the fair? 
Will a lady pin me in her hair? 
Will a child find me by a stream? 
Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream. 

For all of these simple things and much more a flower was born 
It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn 

Inside every man lives the seed of a flower 
If he looks within he finds beauty and power 

Ring all the bells sing and tell the people that be everywhere that the flower has come 
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone 
Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born",Les Fleur
Minnie Riperton,"First we learn how to care 
Magical dreams, midnight summer air 
Wouldn't it be nice to find that someone, warm, to share 
What I care 
Maybe someone to love for a lifetime 
Oooh, I have love supreme 
Mystical movements making me flow free 
Slippin' in between the stars we find that shine all the time 
Now they're yours 
Now they're mine 
Now there's someone to love for a life time 
Ohh, can you feel what I'm saying 
Touching you, touching, touching me 
Can you feel what I'm saying

Minnie Tee,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee
Minnie Tee,"Of things I should be thankful for I've had a goodly share 
And as I sit here in the comfort of my cozy chair 
My fancy takes me to a humble eastside tenement 
Three flights up in the rear to where my childhood days were spent 
It wasn't much like Paradise but 'mid the dirt and all 
There sat the sweetest angel, one that I fondly call 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles 
Oh I know that I owe what I am today 
To that dear little lady so old and gray 
To that wonderful yiddishe momme of mine

I hate to see that evening sun go down

If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

That thrills and delights me, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

The other me, the one you're about to release

And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same

And you don't need a reason to lie
'Cause if we lay down tonight
It won't justify throwin' love aside

This feelin' is strong and we know it
But we gotta see past the moment
There's too much to loose if we blow it
This is no lie

Still here we are close together
With promises made that we'd never
Yet feelin' it now more than ever
I can't deny

I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie

And what kind of girl would you be

Can we talk, there's something weighing on my mind
I've been thinking, 'bout you and me baby, gettin' it on
We should do it, promise I'll hold you all night long

[Chorus:]
Touch that body, touch that body baby [Repeat x 4]

Can I take you home, promise there'll be not telephone
Just you and me, take care of you from A to Z
You know I got your back, treat you like a queen, wouldn't know how to act
You know I'm all you need, girl I'm here to please

Tell me, who can you trust these days
'Cause people don't be about it like they say
Gotta be watching your back night and day
Who can you trust
Tell me, who can you trust or not
The ones that be trying' to get what you got
Just listen to these words whatever you do
The only one you trust is you

People these days ain't it a shame the way they be
Please don't be fooled it's not the ones that you would think
There's things that's going on that you can't always see
This world is filled with jealousy and envy

Just like them people that be all up in your grill
Saying about claiming to know just how you feel
But, the very second that your back is turned
They draggin' your shit through the dirt.

[Chorus]

For every day I start to doubt the things that people be about
I guess that's just the way it is (it is)
Sometimes it's lame you know the way people put on a show
Just to get up in your biz

Just watch your back, 'cause sometimes people act like bats
Creepy and low
You may not belive, but I bet you will not see me on

Mint Condition,"Gotta tell you girl, what's been on my mind
Been such a big influence, influence in my life.
I know u called on me and I said I had no time,
I was frontin' on you I musta' been blind

Cause I wanna make it clear, that all my fears are gone.

I'm ready for the thangs
(that you've been talkin' bout')
I'm ready won't chu shine

I'm ready for the way

I'm ready for what happens
(after in the sack)
I'm ready to quit playin'
(cause I've had enough)
I'm ready for this boy and girl to rise in love

Playa playa man, I was in my zone
In my freaky world, anything was on
But then I met you girl you were like a mirror
Only you made me see, things deeper and much clearer
About the man inside, who always tried to hide,
From real intimacy in his life
Now all my fears are gone.

People always said to me¥
(that when I meet her, I'll know)
Cause when you look in her eyes and touch her hand
(you won't let, her go)
You'd be a fool to look away
(i better act like, I know)
So my days of foolin' round are gone
(now that I've found her that's for sure!!!!!)

I'm ready for this boy and girl to rise in love

I'm ready for the time you tell me not tonite
Cause now it's about us not just me it's alright
I'm ready for the time when I'm miles away
When temptation's round but instead I pray
Ready for a bundle standin' one foot five
And see that bundle have your same beautiful eyes
Can't say enough that I'm ready girl,
In every way, everyday, everyday, everyway
Everyday I thank god for you

We can't do this 
We just can't 
Listen 
Verse: 
You say you feel disenchanted 
Cause lately he takes you for granted 
Still faithful and true you've remain to hurt so have I 
You pour out your heart and I listen 
And we catch a vibe reminising 
Temptation so strong not to meantion the yearning inside 
Chorus: 
But what kind of man would I be 
If I lived unfaithfully 
And what kind of girl would you be 
If you did the same 
Cause I don't want to see her cry 
And you don't need a reason to lie 
Cause if we lay down tonight 
It won't justify through a lover's sigh 
Verse:
The feeling is strong and we know it 
But we gotta see past the moment 
There's too much to lose if we blow it 
This is no lie 
Still here we are both together 
With promises made that we'd never 
Yet feeling it now more than ever 
I can't deny

Give up for my lil? baby boy, the only one that brings me joy,
Me and him ride like were best friends, Me & my lil? man till the end
1st Verse
It was so crazy what I came through, the headaches and drama were not cool,
I always thought, that having a baby would change everything yeah.
Don?t know why I was in and out of courtrooms, cause I was more than responsible I came through.
If I had to rewind it?all I would not change anything?

Some lie and cheat and some are true, just ask yourself which one are you.
2nd Verse
My baby loves me unconditional, but the love from a stranger has come and gone?
Gotta do what?s right, make sure that they come first over everything yeah?
How do you look in a kids eyes, they look just like you but you still deny?
You?re gonna regret it, missing the first breath, first steps, you can?t get em? back
If I was low, if I couldn?t cope, If I was broke, yeah?
You?d be right there beside me helping me up you would not deny me?

Mint Condition,"The words so strong
At least at the beginning
Who would've thought
There'd ever be an ending
We had it all
But it's like we've run into a wall

Now we try to talk
But just end up fighting
Try making up
But there's just no denying
Jus' ain't the same no more
What are we putting ourselves through all this for

You talk and hear me
But you can't communicate
Cause you're not lis'ning
Know these are two different things
Now I see what it means to have been
Blinded by the one you love so deeply
Cause,

The very things that make me love you
Are the things pushing me away (now)
In tears we stand here
With nothing left to say

And all I could do for you
I should've done before (now)
In tears we stand here
There's nothing left to say

You touch'd my heart
And were so givin'
Spirit so free
You threw me in it
I fell so deep
I could not see my life
Without you in it

A lot of attention
Somehow the feeling turned
Into crazy possessive
It was always there

And you had your pain
So deep inside you
Wanted to have your say
Irritated, frustrated and hurt
This is so confusing

Listen

I'm trying to man up see whats really good with you
Gentleman's approach, not bring it hood to you
Same things that you hear everyday like
""Hey ma, hey boo, baby whats your name""
Please pull up a seat, I'm so glad you came
My mother call me Thomas you can do the same
Damn its so refreshing when you calling out my name
Been Pooh for so long it doesn't sound the same
My occupation rap and I make a little change
I see you not impressed with what this life brings
Finished school, got a job, girl do your thing
It's a lot of independent women wanna be claimed
Marry into money or marry into fame, or at least give birth to a check
With all due respect lets two-step in the name of like
Who says we gotta do the waltz all day and all night, it's like

Right here next to me
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you

We can go to the movies
I'll take you to the park and promise to have you home before the lights go out
Steady asking you questions what your life about
Oh and me, mine's everything I scribe about
No doubt this my life and
Dedicated to this witting sacrificing everything for it
Wasted time I can't afford
So if it ain't you/then you know I'm cooped up to the record

I'll scoop you up in me Porsche, sike
You know I got a Nissan
That I'm still paying for, still got a lease on
But it don't matter 'cause that ain't my aim to get you
I got fame, but you know that just ain't the issue
Because you're looking like a woman of virtue
So well-rounded, no wonder your're in my circle
And normally you probably wouldn't give me the time of day
'Cause Tay got rhymes, but no he ain't got time to waste

[Chorus]

Sometimes I think I'm from another world (preach)
When I'm tryin'a tell a woman just exactly where I stand that (aight)
I want a girl, when I want a girl
And when I don't want a girl, I want a girl who understands that
And that's some hard shit to explain
To a woman that's in love with you, it's a pitiful thing
Until I had to figure
That I don't wanna play around, but I don't wanna settle down
And that's a man's dilemma, 'cause every man remembers
How his daddy and his uncles did it
'Cause more than likely that's the way they're gonna do it
I know it sound f**ked up and most wont admit it
But yo, I gotta face it 'cause I know I'm living through it
'Cause when the party stops and niggas get old
And the chain and the cars and the houses get sold, and that
Other side of the bed gets cold, you don't wanna be alone
So girl I'm tryin'a hold you

À un moment je ne sais plus

Prendre le temps de souffler

On peut encore se retourner
C'est pas fini
On peut encore se réparer

Beaucoup plus vite que prévu

 The frivolous rap song he rap about

 No passion, then I guess they be cashin' out. 
 I keep my eyes on things and 
 I keep my shine on BLING!

Like a symphony of love

Showing me that you care
It's a feeling I won't replace

And everything's still the same
I turn to the guy who stayed last night
And ask him, ""What's your name?""

Each new one I meet makes my heart beat fast
When I see them so strong and tall

So many men, so little time
How can I lose?
So many men, so little time
How can I choose?

They tell me I'm up to no good
I should just settle down
But I don't wanna stay with just one man
I wanna sell for what's around
Feels like heaven every night
Being here with someone new
A physical thrill, a beautiful smile
And wonderful muscles, too

So many men, so little time
How can I lose?
So many men, so little time
How can I choose?

So really, who cares about love?
Who wants to feel taken away?
For fifty-two weeks of every year
There's a new man every day
It's too hard a choice to make up my mind
So many men can turn on my light
Don't want true love, don't want friends
Just give me the bodies tonight

Impressive reasons fill the caverns of my mind
No celebration for the people that I didn't know
Connected even though there's nothing left to find

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me

And lost my destiny

But still I wonder why

Chaotic voices in the darkness call your name
You turn away from me whenever I remind you
Of the day the sun saw through the lies exposing all the pain

1982, I'm playing atari
In my living room
I am learning how to play breakout

Use my paddle, use my joystick
I am winning against the odds of hand eye coordination
I am winning against my brother

Frogger! Remember that game?
I'm a frog crossing the street
And many cars are trying to run me over

Frogger! I'm a frog

You're a dog for trying to run me over

We are in a sailboat and
The wind is picking us up
And putting us down
In another town

We are in a sailboat and
This other town is still
The storm has blown over
It's over

We are in a sailboat and
There's nothing left to do
But wait and wait
And wait

Floating here (floating here)
Floating there (floating there)

We are in a sailboat and
The water is so still
We can see the animals down there

We are in a sailboat and
The animals look up to say
It's time to go home
They're sending us home

We are in a sailboat and
The moon comes up to shine

If I'd read the newspaper
If I'd seen the tv
If I'd listened to the radio
I'd know

Maybe I know better
If it's cold put on another sweater
I wish I knew about the weather

Sometimes I think my whole face is gonna blow
I listen to my blood, it makes me cry
It scares me just to know that I'm alive
It scares me just to know that I'm alive

The storm blew in all over me
Maybe it's just minor injury
But my fingers and my head are rather tired

The travel, the trav...(going under)
The speed, oh, the spee...(it's supernatural)
The loss of, the loss...(of gravity's pull)

I'm looking up through the telescope lens
I'm wondering where does the universe end
I'll take my clothes off for meteor showers
I'll take my clothes off and climb into bed

But all the stars that shoot in the sky
They're falling in love with the sun
They're falling in love with the sun

You're terribly happy that I came home early
I've fallen asleep in the afternoon
Get under the covers I'll give you some kisses
And we'll lie on the roof and stare up at the moon

But all the dumb cats in my neighborhood
I know they'll get me soon
They'll find a way into my room

Oh tell me a secret and tell me a story
Lets make up plans that will never come true
This is delicious, hey thanks for the dinner
I hear footsteps approaching, I'm hoping it's you

But all the blankets on the bed
They're tangled in heaps around you
I can't get my arms around you
They're tangled in heaps around you

Beneath an Argentina sky
And I expected there to dry

Upon the rooftop here so high
Beneath the Argentina sky
The storm did call me to its side

Between the firecrackers cackling and the taxis in the street

Before this Argentina sky
Now I just tend my wounded pride

Mientras el sol le quemaba la espalda,
Ella intentaba fregar el sudor de su desconsuelo,

Bajó desde el delta un viento poderoso
Why las nubes se cargaron a lo largo del cielo
¡Rápido, adentro, cerrad las ventanas, viene una tormenta! 
Sacá tu ropa de la soga.

So many tears could make me blind
Beneath this Argentina sky
But still my love for you I can't deny

My father he came in, 
I was nine years old. 
And he stood so tall above me, 
His blue eyes they were shining 
And his voice was very cold. 
He said, ""I've had a vision 
And you know I'm strong and holy, 
I must do what I've been told."" 
So he started up the mountain, 
I was running, he was walking, 
And his axe was made of gold. 
Well, the trees they got much smaller, 
The lake a lady's mirror, 
We stopped to drink some wine. 
Then he threw the bottle over. 
Broke a minute later 
And he put his hand on mine. 
Thought I saw an eagle 
But it might have been a vulture, 
I never could decide. 
Then my father built an altar, 
He looked once behind his shoulder, 
He knew I would not hide. 

You who build these altars now 
To sacrifice these children, 
You must not do it anymore. 
A scheme is not a vision 
And you never have been tempted 
By a demon or a god. 
You who stand above them now, 
Your hatchets blunt and bloody, 
You were not there before, 
When I lay upon a mountain 
And my father's hand was trembling 
With the beauty of the word. 

And if you call me brother now, 
Forgive me if I inquire,

Mirah,"When we went off away from the forest, 
We did travel far to get a taste of so much more.
We dug up the roots of all the stories, put 'em in a pot 
And brought them to a fiery road.
We fed on these things without a worry, 
Never gave a thought to the coming of the winter storm.
Gone away, gone away, what was yesterday. 
Make a meal, make a bed, tuck your feet in.
Rested elbows twice on a table can be nice,
But the comforts they can be deceiving

(Short instrumental break)

The seasons are not what they once seemed.
The berries all are green, though summer's at a fine high crest.
We lifted our shirts up in a hurry, 
Reaching for the belly hollow from the long cold rest. 
We slept up all the fat but there'd be no more of that,
Cause there must be some disease 'neath the canopies.
Swinging tails from trees we could gather what we need.
Give away what we had our first share of,
But now the forks and knives with the sacrifice. 
We could bare only some can believe in.

(Instrumental break)

When we in turn, we find all the leaves had died.
Had we all gone away for such a long time. 
We are alike, so sweet and enough to eat, 
But now it's all just bones and a long way away from home.

Mirah,"Remember we held you
Our bodies pressed against you
We required nothing more
Than what you'd provided for

The rings they tell me
How sickness befell thee
And all the wrongs we've dealt thee
In spite of your generosity

It was all of my energy
More than I wanted to give
I am empty
I won't give more

Am I still invited to stay
I've worn my welcome
There was more before I came

We've eaten unrestrained but now
These green fruits will remain sour
These clouds we've made cannot make rain

I gave you all of my energy
And you took it without thanks
You once showed such promise
But now I won't give more

I won't give / We just want more
",Generosity
Mirah,"Skies went dark, got hard to see my body all stretched out.
Territory to touch and make a path to lead you down.
If I could hold the wildest winds from blasting through my house,
Then I could shine a beacon whether floats, fine, yes, or drowns.

But there was no heat, it all had been extinguished,
Snuffed right out.
That was not the way I meant to disappoint the crowd.
If you want my center, please don't slice so much around.
And if you won't be having me, watch the sorrow shake my mouth.

And you don't want to hurt me,
But you don't want to need me,
So how can you receive me?

Take a seat, don't grieving be, let's settle this all out,
Then one by one I'll take these from the caverns of my mouth.
The teeth who mash and teeth who make my tender muscles shout
A last goodbye to lose what once I'd never known without.

And in my mind, the river runs a straight line through the town,
Never bending, only sending stuff from north to south.
Under bridges, fishes wear the currents like a gown.
And I will swallow crookedness, not let it drag me down.

Afraid that if I cut you loose,
You'd never again want me to
Embrace you in your solitude.

Now in our eyes, we both still find the perfect place to rest.
We'll unfold wings and fly a while, before the next caress.
The atmosphere will hold us dear and teach us how it's best
To both feel free and satisfied, our two souls will be blessed.

Before my eyes, the fireflies they make the night sky low.
Captured by the sounds of all the horns that the frogs blow.
Through tears so thick, like glue they drip and build a castle slow.
I can see you saved for me the sweetness that still glows.

And though you're still my Hercules,
Neptune's the one who's taken me.
Come on, lay that strength upon my sea.

Steady the string and snap it down the dust gets in my face.
A borderline to not cross, mind our manners, keep in place.
Still, I recall you once extended me with handsome haste,
A rope to climb, to call all mine, to ascend you with grace.

Now we will burn the fog away, our hearts are like the sun.
We moved it now, that's a way down and though the change was rough,
We'll find our lives are kinder without complications of
The fear in me that had taken seed and crowded out the love.

I want you and I let you go
Though we can still walk on the same road.
If we don't try it, we'll never know.
",The River
Mirah,"You learned how to be a diver,
Put on the mask and believe.
Gather a dinner of shells for me.
Take the tank down so you can breathe below.
Move in slow,
You are an island.
All the secrets until then
Pried open, I held them.
Until they were still,
Until they were still,
Until they were still.
",Shells
Mirah,"Let's take the time to walk together while we have the sun
You never know when temperamental weather's gonna come
And if you want to face the death you're never that far from
Just take a breath and sing to it when all the day is done

So sorry about all the sorrow in your life you'll know
It's true that all the ones you love will someday have to go
And every time you say goodbye you'll hear the trumpets blow
A serenade to the soul, all surrounded by the glow

If you feel all broken 'cause i left you there too soon
Just know that it's not up to you to make the flowers wilt or bloom
And if you think you're lonely then just listen for the tune
Of all the stars i left for you in the chest of the moon

If you want to shake whatever separates you from
The holiness you want to make your life on earth become
Live your life with a compassion you can be proud of
Then let your last breath fade away with dignity and love

Let's take the time to walk together while we have the sun
You never know when temperamental weather's gonna come
And if you want to face the death you're never that far from
Just take a breath and sing to it when all the day is done",While We Have the Sun
Mirah,"You sent me off without a warning
Wasn't just a threat and man, that was no joke
Did you know you'd struck the final blow
To my faithful oxen hope?

We thought we knew we wanted what we had
But you busted your side of the yoke
So I left with almost nothing but a gaping hole
Yes, I did really went for broke 

No matter how much I weigh, like a boxer I train
Seems like the future is always gonna have its way
Knocking me down, should I fold or spread
My fortune hand on this hard rock bed?

And I don't question, no, I don't doubt
Now that I've tried living with and without 
That was a hard, hard muscle to grow
And harder still to let go

We'd both commandeered a ship or two
We'd had our fun, yeah, we had a few
And wheels spun around and water flowed
In here deep before we felt the cold

And the ride we rode had danger in
We thought we could last while we were real strong swimmers
But we got flooded, yes, we got rolled
And we both went down soon as you cut the rope

I've been wondering lately if ever I'd find 
Someone to hold me like he wanted mine
Should I give up or should I keep on trying?
Should I move on or should I keep on lying to myself

By saying it's all better this way
But all the life is gone, I want to stay
Now I've ruined it, you sound ages old
And I can feel that bearing down a part of my shoulders",Oxen Hope

Lleno mi panza de palabras 
Que no te diría jamás

Tu despreocupación por mi
Nunca comprendo porque me tratas así
Esta vez te diré, recapacitaré
Voy a buscarte en mi silencio

Cuando íbamos a hacer el amor

Después de que te vi bailar
Me acosté pensando en tus ojos
Soñé lo mas bello que pude soñar
Nos vimos solo un par de veces 
Y entraste en mis sueños igual
No sé lo que pienses de esto
Yo siento que comienzo a enamorarme de ti
Me endulzas cuando hablas
Me muero si te hago reír
Es así

Tu modo me mata si te quiero invitar a salir
Dame solamente una chance
Déjame intentar conquistarte 
Pasemos un rato
Cenemos
Vamos a caminar
Podriamos llevarnos bien
No sé como haré para verte
Le he preguntado a mi amiga por ti
Me dijo que estabas saliendo 
Hace poco tiempo con alguien
Recuerdo cuando lo nombraste
Recuerdo que hablaste de él

Si aún no te has enamorado 
Quizás sea el momento de probarme a mí
Ven aquí
Yo quiero que sepas que eres la más bella mujer
Que yo ví
Juguemos un poco juntos
No ves mis ojos brillando por ti
Dame solamente una chance
Déjame intentar conquistarte 
Pasemos un rato
Cenemos
Vamos a caminar

Podriamos llevarnos bien
Qué daría yo por que me des 
Tu número de teléfono y tal vez 
Te llamaría nervioso 
Por esta ilusión de tenerte
Tu pelo, tus manos, tu forma de hablar
Tus dientes y tu sonrisa, la ropa que usás
Lo que conozco de ti me gusta todo
Quisiera ver más

En un rincón de mi cuerpo 
He guardado millones de besos de que saltan
Que quieren salir
Te los daré y llenaremos la cama de flore

Miranda,"Busco más decir 
Algo nuevo de mí 
Alguna frases que conforman en una historia 
Que se graba en tu memoria 
Como te grabaste tú
En mí

Tu presencia ya vez
Condiciona mi actuar 
Acelerando mis latidos y mis pasos 
Reprimiendo los abrazos 
Que otra veces yo te di 
A tí

Preferiría ser un poco más
Poco mas duro para soportar
Tener que verte así como si nada
Después de haberte dicho que ya te he olvidado 
Que eres parte de un pasado 
Al cual no quiero recurrir
Nunca más

Se que no lo crees
O tal vez no has podido verlo 
Pero también he sufrido mucho al dejarte 
Me he sentido miserable 
Peros e que fue mejor
Así

Nada tuvo que ver
El haber conocido a alguien 
Porque tu luz en mi 
Ya no se reflejaba 
Y en tus ojos no encontraba 
Lo que a mí me enamoró
De tí

Preferiría ser un poco más
Poco mas duro para soportar
Tener que verte así como si nada
Después de haberte dicho que ya te he olvidado 
Que eres parte de un pasado 
Al cual no quiero recurrir
Nunca más

Sin embargo 
Te veo y me provocas 
Ganas de escaparme 
Ahora contigo 
Y estar juntos 
Una vez mas
Llévame esta noche como antes 
Olvidemosnos de lo que ayer 
Nos separó

Puede ver que lo que estás pidiendo 
Es exácta la cosa que yo quiero hacer 
Puede ser que este encuentro casual 
Nos lleve a dormir juntos por ultima vez

Cuando tus palabras me alcanzan 
Y entonces mis pies se levantan 
No me cuido y me ilusionare otra vez",Casualidad

Fuiste la primera en hacer cosas como estas
Me has hecho sentir, realmente mal

Casi podríamos llevarnos bien 
Como si fuera una necesidad
En el momento justo en que te abres 
Como a propósito no quiero entrar 
Y cuando me abro yo 
Te comportas horrible

Que sera, que sera 
Sera lo que dios disponga 
Para mí, para vos, por los dos 
Que el cielo nos corresponda

Es tan evidente que te gusta que te atiendan
Es tan increíblemente aguda tu destreza
Eso que te lleva a ser el alma de la fiesta 
Deber ser la búsqueda de afecto

Ahora déjame decirte que
En ese campo yo me puedo dar
Pero ante todo deberás saber 
Que si me atacas me lastimaras 
Fue tan extraño lo que nos paso 
Y sin embargo ahora estamos aquí 
Reclamándonos que 
Poniendo a prueba

Que sera, que sera

Que caminarle de contra a tu viento

And time keeps on passing so slowly
The old man sittin' next to me is fallin' asleep
On a greyhound bound for nowhere

The sun's goin' down on my misery
Another day gone by with broken dreams
That cell phone I hear ringing
I keep wishing it was you
On a greyhound bound for nowhere

And that ring your wearing
Don't mean everything
And the way you stood staring
As you watched me roll away
She loves you and you need me
And there's some things we can't share
I'm on a greyhound bound for nowhere

Bright lights of a city shining up ahead
My heart's analyzing every word you said
Did you take me for a fool
Or did you really care
I'm on a greyhound bound for nowhere

And that ring your wearing
Don't mean everything
And the way you stood staring
As you watched me roll away
She loves you and you need me
And there's some things we can't share
I'm on a greyhound bound for nowhere

I'm gonna find someplace I can ease my mind
And try to heal my wounded pride

Everyday at noon like a chapel bell
Find her, Jesus, keep her well
Help her do more right than wrong, at the end of the day

50 watts and Johnny Cash

Miranda Lambert,"Me and Charlie boy used to go walking,
Sittin' in the woods behind my house
When being lovers meant a stolen kiss
And holding hands with nobody else around
Charlie said he wanted to get married
But we were only ten so we'd have to wait
He said we'd never let our love run dry like so many do these days

So we treat our love like a firefly,
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off
Oh promises we made when we'd go walking
That's just me and Charlie talking

Charlie always said he'd like to leave here,
So he turned eighteen and he left our sleepy town
Letters came and went and I kept waiting
For Charlie to come back and bring the life he'd found
It's funny how time and distance change you
The road you take don't always lead you home
You can start a love with good intentions
Then you look up and it's gone

So you treat your love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off
Oh the promises we made when we'd go walking
That's just me and Charlie talking

Now and then I sometimes think of Charlie
How we thought we new it all back then
Now I'd give anything to feel love from a child's heart again

So you treat your love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top
And run like hell to show it off
Oh,  promises we made when we'd go walking

Take me far away from Amarillo
I bet this car will go real fast

The Texas sky is the biggest one I've seen
But it still ain't big enough for you and me
All the things that make you mad,
All the baggage in your past
Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be
So I'll fill her up with hope and worn-out dreams

And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
I'll drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get to far on a tank of gas and an empty heart
But I got everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings

Mama said I never should have done it
I should have ended us before we ever started
Daddy knew about my pride so he stood there and he smiled inside,
I pretended that I didn't notice
A little tear that fell when I said I was going

And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
And drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get to far on a tank of gas and an empty heart

Down underneath where I usual leave her
Just last night I felt a cold comin' on.""

Well, baby, who needs their faces in a magazine?
Me and you we've been stars of the town since we were seventeen

Let's go on down to the quick stop
Wear your yellow shades, and I'll put on my tight jeans
And we'll just spend the weekend burnin' rubber
And we'll let 'em point and stare in disbelief

'Cause every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend maybe knows it just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey, word's gonna get around

She don't have too much to say when she gets mad
She understands, she don't let go of anything

And somehow you made me smile when I was sad
You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart

Lived just like a gypsy
Break her heart and roll out of town
Cause gypsies never get tied down

Sometimes I wish I lived on a mountain
Drank from a stream
Instead of a fountain
I'd stay there, on top of the world
But I was born a red dirt girl

Unbridled, or tethered in tide
Safety of the fence
Or the danger of the ride
I'll always be unsatisfied

Sometimes I wish I lived by a pier
In a lighthouse with a chandelier
I'd watch everybody's ships come in
And then I'd sail away with them

Unanchored in a storm
Or save me on the shore
If this is all I need
Why do I want more

Sometimes I wish I lived in Airstream homemade curtains
Live just like a gypsy",Airstream Song

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up girl it's, just a break up run an'
Hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady 'cause I
Raised you better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart,
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

I wish I could be just a little less dramatic like a,
Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up girl it's, just a break up run an'
Hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady 'cause I
Raised you better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart,
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your I's and never let 'em see you cry

And I'll find my place at the bar
One more down, so I buy one more round
And I'll try to drown out my heart

He'll walk in and make every head turn
And he'll always be dressed to kill
Day I left is my only regret
And now it's become his biggest thrill

All my friends'll say, ""Hey don't you know him?""
And I'll try to play it off cool
When they ask I'll just say, ""He's nobody""
And me well I'm nobody's fool

Won't take long and he'll find him someone
And then pull them out for a dance
Every no tells me that's all she wrote
And reminds me how I missed my chance

When he's done he'll have a little more fun
And he'll let her act like she's smooth
As they walk out, while I'm learning about
What it is to have nothing to lose

And all my friends will say, ""Hey don't you know him?""

Five hundred year, five hundred thousand miles

A feather could have knocked me to the floor
A missing piece was found I was finally alive

There ain't no good-bye, with your hand in mine

But I'm not going to ever get over you

Living alone here in this place
I think of you, and I'm not afraid

I know you didn't mean to give them to me

Together in the weather, shiny on the other side
Polished and changed for the better

With you I'm safe

I'll follow you just like a shadow only closer in
If you get tired and bound
I'll find a way to free your hand
I'll wash them clean of everything but me

Just like the ice in your glass I'll rattle when you need a drink
You'll never run dry of love or anything

I'll keep you safe

I keep a locket on my neck that holds your face
I'll spend forever making sure I can erase
Every tear you ever thought about crying

You make me feel like I'm the only girl in the whole wide world
I wanna hold you like a handful of diamonds and pearls

Well your mama's gonna cry her eyes
There ain't gonna be no wedding day
What's she gonna say?
When I tell her how I had no choice
The same old you couldn't even raise your voice
And ask me to stay
I wouldn't anyway

So you can keep your ring

You're just a shiver looking for a spine
You can have your way but you can't have mine

If I had one wish you'd go away
I haven't slept yet but I'm on the brink of it
I'm not as dumb as the look on your face
You'll never be half the man your momma is

Overloaded by the way you talk
A hairpin trigger that I can't stop
Empty words taking up my time
And you can have your way but you can't have mine

Cause every time baby it feels like a resurrection
I'm looking for affection at the bottom of a bottle again
You show up and it starts another chain reaction
Oh, but I can't tell if it's you or the drink

Watching sun tea in the window

Just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be

Doing it all by hand, 'cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in

Back before everything became automatic

If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later

And girls would turn them down

We're still fighting like I'm sixteen

And how to clean the bathroom sink

I'm lookin' forward to the girl I wanna be
But regret has a way of starin' me right in the face

It was one of those girls and one of those guys who didn’t know quite what to do
We were going along with what was going on saying I think I love you
And I think about us now every time that I go out, smokin’ and drinkin’

Smokin’ and drinkin’ on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin’ and drinkin’ got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here’s to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin’ and drinkin’

We be lighting up saying this town sucks so we painted on the bridge

If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me, darling
You don't want a heart

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart",Tin Man
Miranda Lambert,"To love her is to learn her
And see her at her worst
Dance with her when she's drinking
Hold her when she hurts
She'll be happy, you'll be sorry
Well, that's just how it works

To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn

You'll meet her momma
You'll love her daddy
You'll know how much she's worth
You'll have thanksgiving dinners
And Sunday morning church
You'll be true and you'll be tride
But the tables always turn

To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn

It's a lesson
It's a blessing
You don't know everything
If you take her
You might hate her
And be left with just a ray

To love her is to lose her

Miranda Lambert,"Tomboy, Hail Mary
Never needs a dress to make her pretty
She's a killjoy, such a let down
Daddy tried to raise a southern belle
Well, he got a tomboy

Tomboy in between
Dirt in her nails and holes in her jeans
She'll destroy all your dreams
And ride out like a rodeo queen
Know what I mean
She's a tomboy

Tangled hair and bruises on her knees
She wears her scars outside her sleeves
Always has a way of saying 'no way'
Some people don't get her, but that's okay

Move along boy
She's a tomboy

Barfly, bad betty
Band of brothers that got her back
She's unlady like, like a scout fire
Got her own constellation in the zodiac
Well, who can say that 
A tomboy

Tangled hair and bruises on her knees
She's hard to love and hard to please
Always has a way of saying 'no way'
Some people don't get her, but that's okay

Move along boy
She's a tomboy

She's got a softer side she'll never let you see
With tears in her eyes she'd rather be caught dead
Sweet contradiction with no gaurantees
She is what she is
You get what you get

Move along boy
She's a tomboy
Or go along with it boy
You got a tomboy",Tomboy
Miranda Lambert,"I don't remember when the liquor started kicking in
It's been a while since I been off the stuff
I really hate to say I'm turning into a cliché
I'm hoping that nobody brings it up
I left my car behind the bar again last Sunday night
I did the Monday morning drive ashamed
And last night's clothes they smell like smoke
But I don't know how I got home
But I do know my head'll hurt all day

But I still go and stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeos and Juliets
Have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on

Well everybody's got a spark
It's easy hiding in the dark
In a crowded room with pockets full of rings
I sit and watch the whiskey pour
The merriment, the exidor
The beginning of another matchbook flame
And I don't try to justify
The reason I'm not living right
I wear my sadness like a souvenir
I drink too much to fall apart that's how I fight this broken heart
So what, if I feel comfortable in here

'Cause I still go and stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeos and Juliets
Have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone

If your heart's as empty as your diesel tank

If you borrow dresses like you borrow time
If you dream all day and drink all night
If you're looking for love but willing to fight
Over men and momma's and Miller Lite, well then

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I read the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

If you like acting like you're the boss
If everything your daddy says
Is something you can put stock in, well then

Acerca de mis costumbres
El saber que te intereso

O seras de las del tipo
No te entiendo yo me voy

Acercate que puede
Interesarte lo que te contare

Quiero decirte que
No puedo detener
El arsenal de mi pasion
Avanzas sobre mi

Omnubilandome
Agitando mi corazon
No es nada personal
Si me olvide de que

Habiamos quedado en vernos
En mi modo de tenernos
No defino tu lugar

En el banco de acusados
Todos estaban de acuerdo en
Esa sala menos yo

Y te pregunto si serias
Tan valiente y me querrias tanto
Como para defenderme
En cualquier situacion

Con mis idas y vueltas, te canse con mi cámara lenta
y aunque trato, nunca puedo, apurar mi decisión

En el preciso momento en que todo va cambiando para mi
En ese instante te aseguro que alguna señal te di
Pero no me escuchaste tal vez sin intención de tu parte
Puede serte un poco débil el sonido de mi voz

Oh! Una mañana te veré llegar
y descubriré que yo, solo ya no estoy mejor
y te pediré que me acompañes
A donde en verdad no sé, dime que si, miénteme

Podría ser que al final, rompiste el cristal en mi
Podría pasar, que me hagas hablar
Yo creo que tienes el don de curar este mal

Siento que debo encontrarte, sin embargo
Paso el tiempo yéndome
Hacia mi mismo, a mi centro, que jamas encontraré
Yo quisiera tenerte, y tratarte de modo decente
Pero ves que ya no puedo despegar de mi papel

Deberé tranquilizarme y jugar al juego que me propones
Bajo la guardia, te recibo y me abrigo de tu piel
El destino me ha dado, corazones desequilibrados
Tu palabra, me nivela y detiene mi caer

Oh! Una mañana te veré llegar
y descubriré que yo, solo ya no estoy mejor
y te pediré que me acompañes
A donde en verdad no se, dime que si, miénteme

Podría ser que al final, rompiste el cristal en mi
Podría pasar, que me hagas hablar
Yo creo que tienes el don de curar este mal

Es un solo, es la guitarra de Lolo

Podría ser que al final, rompiste el cristal en mi
Abriste mi piel que estaba tan mal
Quebraste el silencio que me hizo alejar
Quizás seas tu quien me hará regresar
Intuyo que sabes la forma mejor
y tienes el don que requiere curar este mal",Don
Miranda!,"Algo debió pasar
Para que mi fascinación se terminara
Algo que no debí 
Siento que no te conocí
Y que no te importaba
Sé, que es algo normal 
Que el encantamiento del principio no dure
Pero crece el amor
Y en este caso corazón 
No hay nada que te ayude
Hoy, me parece lo mejor 
Darle fin a la actuación 
Creo que lo mas sensato es terminar

No me vas a dejar-creo que si
Jamas perdóname
Para que me hiciste ilusionar 
Yo se-que sabes
Te descuide, encerrándote en mi mundo 

Sé, que vas a pensar 
Que estar contigo fue solamente un capricho 
Que poco conoces
Acerca de mis sentimientos 
Tal vez te vueles con el viento
Hoy, mi paciencia terminó 
Mi deseo se murió 
Ya no siento nada que me una a ti
Todo lo que prometí
Al comienzo lo sentí
Deberás creerme por que ha sido así

No me vas a dejar-creo que si 
Jamas perdóname
Para que me hiciste ilusionar 
Yo se que sabes
Te descuide, encerrándote en mi mundo

Por mas que me ruegues ya me decidí
Hoy voy a dejarte, depende de mi

No me vas a dejar creo que si

Mentira, lo que convino decir
Afuera tu beso vuela 
Y te lleva a la vidriera del rock
Es cierto 
Que el complacerte no fue más 
Que perder mi tiempo

Que caminarle de contra a tu viento
No veo me he vuelto ciego
Y tengo cero noticias de tí
Pregunto y es todo en vano
Es claro te has alejado de mí
Resulta que yo pensé que mi sola presencia bastaba
Para tenerte tan enamorada

Así no puedo prometerte mas
Así no puedo hacerme cargo de ti
Así sospecho me conviene mentirte 
A decirte la verdad
No ves que ya no tengo reacción
No ves que soy inmune a tu control
No ves que en realidad no me importa 

Si te vas va a ser mejor
Confundo a todo el mundo
Despisto con este modo de actuar
No creas que me consuela
Me altera cuando te acercas a mí
Y ahora 
Que estoy en baja y que vos no me das ni 
La hora he decido esperar en silencio

Regálame algo de soledad.

Hoy es el día en que todo mal,
No quería pero navidad llegó why nada
Me deprime más

Es como si algo de mí
Cierre la puerta que ayer abrí.
Aunque golpees nunca estaré
Estoy hundido en mi jardín.

Va a ser mejor que dejemos unos días
Yo quiero pensar un poco
Lo que tengo que hacer.
Why justo hoy mejor no decidir nada
Podría arruinarlo todo si no tengo noción.

Es algo mucho más fuerte que yo
No puedo hacerme entrar en razón,
Sabes que esto no me hare feliz. (aunque lo entiendas así)

Hay una voz dentro de mí
Que me recuerda que te mentí
Suena peor en la canción:
No es para tanto pero igual si.

Va a ser mejor que dejemos unos días
Yo quiero pensar un poco
Lo que tengo que hacer.
Why justo hoy mejor no decidir nada
Podría arruinarlo todo si no tengo noción.

Que fuiste tu a quien he sentido mía
La que perfumo mi vida
Con un sueño de flor
Yo se que soy, digamos algo inmaduro
Pero es la manera en yo entiendo el amor.

Tengo memoria de tenerte así
Acurrucada why tierna sobre mí
Desvaneciendote en mis brazos

Que, no ves
Que si te llamo es porque te extrañé
Si me desmayo cuando respondes
No es nada grave why es humano.

cae la noche why estoy solo otra vez
Lanzo miradas al espejo why no me ves
Escribo frases en un trozo de papel
Quiero olvidarte why al contrario
Tu recuerdo se hare carne en mí

no cierres el telón
No cortes la función
No vas a acobardarte ahora que viene la acción
Mi parlamento es
Probemos otra vez
Yo sigo extrañándote

creo que
Perdí mi orgullo cuando perdoné
Abrí mis alas why te cobijé
Cuando podría haber volado

nunca nadie me había tratado como tú
Presumo que hasta has afectado mi salud
Veo que no fue suficiente perdonar
Sigues mostrándote distante
Que demonios pretendes de mí

no cierres el telón
No cortes la función
No vas a acobardarte ahora que viene la acción

No pude descubrir
El amor a primera vista no funciona en mí
Después de amarte comprendí

Que no estaría tan mal
Probar tu otra mitad
No me importó si arruinaríamos nuestra amistad
No me importó ya que mas da

Éramos tan buenos amigos hasta hoy
Que yo probé tu desempeño en el amor
Me aproveché de que habíamos tomando tanto
Te fuiste dejando y te agarré

A pesar de saber que estaba todo mal
Lo continuamos hasta juntos terminar
Cuando caímos en lo que estaba pasando
Te seguí besando y fue

Solo tu no necesito mas
Te adoraría lo que dure la eternidad
Debes ser perfecta para
Perfecto para, perfecta para mi
Mi amor

Como fue
Que de papel cambié
Eres mi amiga y ahora eres mi mujer
Debes ser perfectamente, exactamente
Lo que yo siempre soñé

El tiempo que paso
Resulto aun mejor
Nos conocíamos
Pero antes si sabíamos
Lo que queríamos los dos

Entonces el amor
Nos tiene de rehén
Seré tu eterna enamorada
Y te aseguro que
Todas las noches te amaré

Me arrepentí y es verdad que terminó
Pero yo sé que en fondo te amaré
Entonces no pienses mal, no pienses mal de mí

Los celos que opacaron tu ilusión
No dejan ver lo esencial entre los dos
Estoy aquí y te juro se acabó
Entonces olvídalo, perdóname y pasó

Es que soy prisionero de un error
Un tonto arrepentido que por hoy
Ha preferido invocar al olvido
Y suplicar de rodillas perdón

Esta historia es pasado ya fue
Pero nos ha marcado lo sé
Da por seguro, mi amor te lo juro
Nadie va a amarte como yo lo haré

Estuve mal, sé que lloraste por mí
Me apabullé y cobarde te mentí
Quiero aliviar esta cruz que me cargué
Al menos no pienses mal sólo me equivoqué

A veces me quedo solo a la pregunta no le busco solución 
Y no le encuentro explicación a odiarte tanto 
Y estar loco por tu amor

La caravana que me trajo hasta ti 
Se espantara cuando te fijes en mi 
Y cuando el viento revoleaba tu pelo 
Te atreviste y me morí

Cuando te propongo que avancemos dos casilleros mas 
Es un paralelo el amor y el juego y yo siempre quiero ganar 
Pero no aprovecho el que tengas servida la oportunidad 
A veces me desoriento entre la gente y pierdo la velocidad

No me afectara el vicio del drama

No veo por qué
Me disuelvo en agua
No veo por qué
Debo yo comprender

Acaso serán
Tan sólo palabras
Echadas al aire
Surgidas del mar
Hazme el favor de callar

Cuando me notes algo vulnerable
Debo cuidarme de mí
Tal vez así, me sostenga

Constantemente quieren convencerme
De algo que haré sin querer

Entraînés par la foule qui s´élance
Et qui danse

Nos deux mains restent soudées
Et parfois soulevés
Nos deux corps enlacés s´envolent
Et retombent tous deux
Épanouis, enivrés et heureux.

Et la joie éclaboussée par son sourire
Me transperce et rejaillit au fond de moi
Mais soudain je pousse un cri parmi les rires
Quand la foule vient l´arracher d´entre mes bras.

Emportés par la foule qui nous traîne
Nous entraîne
Nous éloigne l´un de l´autre
Je lutte et je me débats
Mais le son de sa voix
S´étouffe dans les rires des autres
Et je crie de douleur, de fureur et de rage
Et je pleure.

Entraînée par la foule qui s´élance
Et qui danse
Une folle farandole
Je suis emportée au loin
Et je crispe mes poings, maudissant la foule qui me vole
L´homme qu´elle m´avait donné
Et que je n´ai jamais retrouvé.",La Foule
Mireille Mathieu,"Jezebel, Jezebel.
Ce démon qui brûlait mon cœur
Cet ange qui séchait mes pleurs
C´était toi, Jezebel, c´était toi.
Ces larmes transpercées de joie,
Jezebel, c´était toi, Jezebel, c´était toi.

Mais l´amour s´est anéanti.
Tout s´est écroulé sur ma vie,
Écrasant, piétinant, emportant mon cœur,
Jezebel, mais pour toi,
Je ferais le tour de la terre,
J´irais jusqu´au fond des enfers.
Où es-tu, Jezebel, où es-tu?

Les souvenirs que l´on croit fanés
Sont des êtres vivants
Avec des yeux de morts vibrants encore de passé
Mais mon cœur est crevé d´obsession.
Il bat en répétant
Tout au fond de moi-même
Ce mot que j´aime,
Ton nom
Jezebel, Jezebel.

Mais l´amour s´est anéanti.
Tout s´est écroulé sur ma vie,
Écrasant, piétinant, emportant mon cœur

Elle est née d´aujourd´hui
Dans le cœur d´un garçon
Sous le ciel de Paris
Marchent des amoureux
Hum hum
Leur bonheur se construit
Sur un air fait pour eux

Sous le pont de Bercy
Un philosophe assis
Deux musiciens quelques badauds
Puis les gens par milliers
Sous le ciel de Paris
Jusqu´au soir vont chanter
Hum hum
L´hymne d´un peuple épris
De sa vieille cité

Près de Notre Dame
Parfois couve un drame
Oui mais à Paname
Tout peut s´arranger
Quelques rayons
Du ciel d´été
L´accordéon
D´un marinier
L´espoir fleurit
Au ciel de Paris

Sous le ciel de Paris
Coule un fleuve joyeux
Hum hum
Il endort dans la nuit
Les clochards et les gueux
Sous le ciel de Paris
Les oiseaux du Bon Dieu
Hum hum
Viennent du monde entier
Pour bavarder entre eux

Et le ciel de Paris
A son secret pour lui
Depuis vingt siècles il est épris
De notre Île Saint Louis
Quand elle lui sourit
Il met son habit bleu
Hum hum
Quand il pleut sur Paris
C´est qu´il est malheureux
Quand il est trop jaloux
De ses millions d´amants
Hum hum
Il fait gronder sur nous
Son tonnerre éclatant
Mais le ciel de Paris
N´est pas longtemps cruel
Hum hum
Pour se faire pardonner
Il offre un arc en ciel",Sous le Ciel de Paris

Ensemble cette valse, 
Nous l'avons dansée pour toujours.

On s'est aimé longtemps toujours plus fort
Nos joies nos peines avaient le même accord
Et puis un jour j'ai vu changer tes yeux
Tu as brisé mon cœur en disant adieu.

Par-dessus les têtes
Par-dessus les toits
Il danse sur le monde

Au-dessus du vide, au-dessus de mon cœur

Qu´ils allaient courir la mer, tous les deux
N´ayant que les nuages
Pour guider leurs voyages
Et les étoiles dans les cieux

À cache-cache au creux des vagues

Regardaient naître ces matins
À l´heure où mouraient les étoiles

Tout semble facile et fou

Mireille Mathieu,"Le jeu de la vie nous dessine un chemin 
Une partition libre et sans fin
Il faut apprendre à lire sans avoir peur
Entre les lignes, le pire et le meilleur

C'est en moi comme un ordre une voix
Un devoir de veiller sur toi

Pense à moi quand le doute envahit ta vie
Pense à moi prisonnier de ton souvenir
Pense à moi quand tu n'as plus de courage
Pense à moi encore d avantage

Ce que je te donne me revient toujours
Un sérum qui nourrit notre amour
Ca m'aide à comprendre à quoi servent les blessures
L'envie de réapprendre


Comme une mélodie qui ne laisse jamais
De répit au fil de ma vie


Tu attises le feu étouffé par l'orage
Il revit et redonne la rage

Pense à moi quand le ciel bleu devient gris
Pense à moi quand tu n'as plus un seul ami

Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Long stiff limbs
Them eyes are black pits
Of a place where I've been
Her hair is long
Still smells like mud
She answered to my kiss
With a rotten tongue
No death can
Tear us apart
Her body is cold
Well its gonna get colder
But my love will ignite
What was left to smoulder
I move my hips
In her I am home
I'll keep on loving
Till the marrow dries from her bones
No death
Can tear us apart
All day
I stay by her side
But death has a claim
And a right to my bride
I shut the doors
Pull the curtains and hide
I heard something moving
Somewhere outside
No death can
Tear us apart
But death comes a sneaking in
Trough the keyholes
He's clever and he knows
What's beneath the floorboards
Death comes to feast
Like a greedy hungry beast
He wants it all
And here he crawls
And here he crawls

Cut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
Cause I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood

And tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose

You see when she places the violin
Under her chin and begins
A melody breezes through the atmosphere
Like angel's wind

Her harmony feels right like when angels bend
When she strikes a chord, my Lord
She impacts the earth
Like Mr. Bojangles tappin' in Timbs

With her, no, my flow can't be down, I scribe of fountains
'Cause she makes me feel like I can climb mountains

She was just a friend

I know I've made mistakes
Times before did ignore
The pain in your voice
There was writing on the wall

And it don't take a fool to see
You were right for me
Meant to be in the beginning
Why we had to take this fall

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

Girl, I never meant to hurt you
Didn't really mean to hurt you
Tried my best to show I love you
And it all turned out so wrong

I'll be sitting waiting for you
'Cause I know patience is a virtue
Gonna do just what I got to
Girl, I love you

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I had some time to think about this
She's your friend and not our friend
That was a problem from the beginning
I care for you and I trust you too without guessing
But intentions of some folks, I had to question

I tried my best to show you I loved you
I never thought you'd hurt my emotions
If she was just a friend then why does it hurt so?
If there's nothing going on, honey, I will stay with you

It's like a plan gone wrong since you've been gone
Nights alone, my worlds gone cold
It's like I'm hiding from my soul

I had to meditate and concentrate
On doing with disappointing me
Honey, I want to come home

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I never thought you'd hurt my emotions

Miri Ben-Ari,"I spent my years isolated
Couldn't live with myself
I was trouble as a young kid
My tears didn't help
Very depressing and it was evident
I'd fade to the deep
All alone like these four walls came at me
Barricaded cause my mind state
I just wanted to die
Never happiness
Just sad time living a lie
Rater leave me
I was suicidal
Slittin' my wrist
Mamma thinking I was crazy
Like use some sense
And on them days I was feeling
I was paining inside
It wasn't me
It was my inner feeling coming alive
I remember waking up like I was going to school
Left me standing in the hospital
Locked in this room
Put away
I was a troubled kid losing my mind
Fallin' short
Of what they expected from me every time
So don't fault me if you meet me
And I look to be strange
I'm just mad that the sunshine dies in the rain

[Chorus]
Sunshine to the rain
When it comes it goes again
Even when the story ends
Just turn the page and begin again
Sunshine on cloudy days
Don't hate me I'll never change
Thankful I was made this way
Your sunshine for cloudy days

Now I was raised in a neighborhood
With half of a dime
If you was real it was understood
It showed in your eyes
Every corner had a different hustle
Sprawled on your face
Drug wars
Growin' up raw cause violence the case
Had to move along
Quiet it's kept
Spoken words got you dealt with
So ride with yourself
I'm a juvenile
They telling me get down for they wealth
No getting high
Cause when you gettin' high
You needing some help
As far as help
Mine was middle though
You know how that go
Psychologically
I deal with demons talkin' in codes
Hopefully, I'll get to meet Jesus
Somewhere on this road
Sick of hearing people screaming in my head saying no
Better of if I was dead
Cause they killing me slow
All in all it's just a part of my life
Watching the show
Ain't nothing never came to niggaz sleep
Except for a dream
It's like a movie with the ending credits etched in the screen

[Chorus]

I prayed my last days of sunshine
Just die in the rain
Kinda selfish
But I know that dying
Eases the pain
Heartfelt words
Spoken hurt
Provided the frame
For the picture I done painted for the master to explain
So I leave behind my testimony
Witness to give
Far from holy
But this matrimony provided the script
To live on
And live by
Grow up and grow on
Get on and get by
So forth and so on
And this here's the last days
I can hear the horns singin'
I can see the red sky
I can hear the drum beating
I seen the dead die
How long will they mourn Jesus
At least I'm saved by my scriptural warn readings
And while leaving you here
Believe what you believe in
But you don't want to not believe
Believe in seeing
Don't take this here too personal
Cause I'm just speaking
This is my family on my mind

It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

There was no place to go
I would feel so empty deep inside
Life was such a bore
But one day you came along
It's here where you belong
I can't believe the change you brought in me

You put your arms around me
Just swept me off my feet

The love I dreamt to meet
Since then it's been so fine
Knowing that you're mine
I can't believe the luck that's come to me
I can't believe the hope you've given me

Oh baby,
You give me energy
When you get close to me
Showing me liberty
You set my feelings free
You give me energy
It's so plain to see
Bringing me clarity
Cause you're my energy

We speak a universal tongue
Your spirit close to mine
Us two together gives me pride
That I could never find
That's why I'm telling you

You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free

And my eyes got hooked

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better

Some are dead and some are living

The only time he's satisfied 
Is when he's on a drunk 

He'll fill his glasses to the brim 
He passes them around 
And the only pleasure he gets out of life 
Is bumming from town to town 

Go tell my baby sister, 
Never do what I have done 
To shun that house in New Orleans

It's one foot on the platform 
And the other one on the train

And left a new day
Nothing seems to move everything is still
It's just a perfect day

The shadows and light
That move with the wind
Hidden violets grow splashed with summer spray

Fear is nature's warning
Hunger here is never far away

And all of this world
Is for children who play
Days that never end always should remain

Want to know how you feel inside

She's so nasty.

Goes a little something like this

Looked into my eyes as she passed me by.

Standing over there, haven't got a clue about style or flair.
Watching my hair, don't go there.

And I said, Monday to Friday the work takes its toll
Here comes the weekend 'cause we make mad dough
Another dolla let me holler, let me grow
'cause in life what you reaps, what you sow

And roll on
It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
But let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
But let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

Roll on, roll, roll on, roll on, roll on
So grab your boo and get your roll on
Roll on, roll, roll on, roll on, roll on
So turn your speakers up and roll on

Mis-Teeq,"There's something we gotta tell ya - we're not like other girls,
Shape the light and away we go.
Midnight dim the light-gonna be a full moon tonight (hey)
Gonna cause a lot of rage alright
(alright)
I can see a lot of prey inside, knock knock check the locks
Better stay inside 'cause we can't be stoped (cant be stoped)
Tick tock better watch the clock, hearts racing 'cause we're feeling hot

We're creatures of the night, so don't be fooled by our shape or size
We're coming after you so hide
And if you have any other plans you'd better forget about it

[chorus]
A body, needs more and more, can't sleep, till I get it all,
The streets ain't safe any more don't speak, can't hear you call
So sweat, but dangerous you'll see if your curious
Better believe the secrets of the night
Better believe, better belive

On track creeping up (creeping up)
Think your ready but I bet your not (bet your not)
Gonna give you an electric shock. gonna hit you with a million watts
MC:i'm gonna hit you full blow that's a fact 
I'm gonna get you with a full contact like a bat out of hell its a natural
Fact, the mystery of mis-teeq be wary of that.

The mystery is our disguse look deep into our eyes you'll find a big 
Surprise,there's no way out before sunrise
And if you have any other plans forget about it

[chorus]

[RAP:] now I'd be the movement in the night
You never thought that real beings come alive
But I proved that we can rock it frome the dark side
And when I'm hungry it's time for me to take a bite
For those who know but try not to believe
I'm coming round the cornor don't stop or breathe
'cause if I ever smell the blood running through your veins
You'll never ever ever live to see another day

Just bring it down, Sing for me now

[Asher D]
You just wishing you hype this
Jealousy and the hate is what forced me to write this
And you still want to spite this
Mis-Teeq and So Solid, you know that I like this
People know that I write quick
On the road with my flows they describe how my life is
I won't say who my wife is, I'll let her spit for herself
And you know she will hype this
You just wishin' you'd done this
There was never no fight if there was then I won this
I'm caught up in this fun bliss
These people have taken what I have accomplished
The same people they will run quick
Disguised as a friend and pretending to bump fists
How many times have I done this
I got flows in abundance, the raver will bun dis

[Chorus: x2]
They don't know the places we've been
Ain't seen the things that we've seen
We're sitting down reminiscing dreams
(They'll never know)
They'll never know 'bout the things that we do
They'll never know 'bout the strength of our crew
Ride to the rhythm as we're passing 'through

[Alesha]
The masters of simplicity go back from Shaolin
Teachers turn preachers they carve discipline
In a royal affair we reign from within
Let the journey begin
It's working on my lyrical tone
Day unfolds like a story done told
Feed your mind like a gun reload
With my lyrical flow feel I'm gonna reload
Jet with the set You know I'm high spent
Back in the days when I couldn't pay rent, yo
Struggling, juggling, hustling
People said I never meant this thing
So listen up as the story begins
Give me the mic let me ride, let me bling
Entrepreneur let me ride, let me sing

Oh, just bring it down sing it to me now
As we do with the micro rude and proper
Get up on the mic as we come correct

I came through and gave you a gift
So you can relive, So stop watching this
Because I'm living in bliss

I worked hard for this now now I'm sippin' the cris
Are you feeling my drift
Could it be that I'm top of list
Could it be the way I uplift
Or the could it be that my style and my flow it is too hot for you
So you can't control it
Or could it be that the clips in my whips
Are going into sticks and they're already loaded
Could it be we turn tunes to hits
Mis-Teeq in the whips now you love us to bits, Yo
Could it be we blew the rave scene
Without speaking keen if you know what I mean seen
I make dough, when I happened to be on a mission
Back in the day I switched it to another vision
Now I wrote flows - Use my MC intuition
High like a kite though people want to stop and listen
We make tunes now people really want to listen
We make cream now people really want to glisten
It's alright though, listen to my Harveyism
And if you don't know, talking about my religion
I make dough when I happened to be on a mission
Back in the day I switched it to another vision
Now I write flows, Use my MC intuition
High like a kite though people want to stop and listen

I'm a lady and I'm gonna do this now
To the ladies living so cris, wow
Up on the mic, I'm a lyrical entertain
Making money was my aim before the fame
Me crack Alesha you know you're insane
Make hits you know I'm gonna maintain
On the mic I'm a lyrical viber
Here I go I'm gonna get you hyper

'Cause Su-Elise, Alesha, Sabrina bring the rhyme

This is how we do it, it's Friday night

The party's here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver turn the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Guys in the street say, ""Girls, yo we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight

You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava (This is how we do it)
So flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G, the guys see I got the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all

If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '6 4

Tell me if you're gonna stay
If you feel you can resist my ways
Say what you gotta say
Let's get forward, as we cut the chase
Tonight we go all the way
Do you wanna get busy
And You know I'm feeling jiggy
'cause tonight we gonna play

No point in waiting for you to call
Two hours straight no word at all
Time to get down for the physical
Been so long can't wait no more
Don't be shy - we can get it on
So give it up 'cause the night is young
Can't be tripping when I feel this strong, yeah
You can't deny that you dream of me everyday

Gotta keep it going
So we get hot
Forget about the clock
So we don't stop
You gotta keep it coming
Be a man and make a stand
Lose control
I know you think you're ready
But I think not
So come a little closer
And guess what?
I'm gonna tell you when you hit
The spot
Tonight it's on

So coming into my house it's okay
Tell if you're gonna stay
If you think you miss my way
Say what you gotta say
Let's get forward, let's get on the chase
Tonight we can walk away
To you wanna get busy
You know I'm get jiggy
'cause tonight we gonna play

How's it feel tell me what's the deal
No need for lies gotta keep it real
Took so long why you hesitate
That's why we're hooking up so late
If I didn't bother to step to you
You'd be out first base won't have a clue
I bet you're glad that we be getting it on

When we met I was a shy kinda girl
I had no worries, not a care in the world
You take me places I would never have dreamed
And now I'm loosing all control so it seems
I'm so glad I found you

Chorus
I can hardly get to sleep
You're in my head it's getting deep
That frist stage clue, I'm crazy for you
When my feelings start to show
When my body tells me so, I know it's true
It's beginning to feel like, beginning to feels like love
Like the sun on my skin on a hot summers day
Like a song in my head that won't go away
Like the smile on my face 'cause you make me happy
Ohhhh

Verse 2,
Everyday feels so special just like the first
You caught me by surprise I thought love would hurt
I'm ready for whatever you got to give
And I'm not looking back no more I wanna live
And I'm so glad I found you

Chorus

Bridge,
Baby now I'm loving you (I love)
I know what I gotta do
There ain't no life here without you
I'll build my whole world around you
So now I make you a promise
Stay true be fithful and honest
Let's take this journey together
For worse or for better

Mis-Teeq,"Its a brand new song, JD, Mis-Teeq are coming back strong
Are you ready for a brand new track?
Its a brand new day, so make way for the ladies - ha

Verse 1
So where you been where you gone?
Since July I've been round the world 50 times,
So tell me where's the action?
I'm feeling Miami, cruising down Ocean Drive,
So tell me what have you learnt?
I've learnt to just keep my cool and let it ride,
So tell me when's it your turn?
2003 we're gonna blow the spot

[Bridge]
Mis-Teeq's gonna show ya, got something for ya,
Coming to destroy ya,
We got a little something gonna blow ya mind,
We ain't gonna bore, coming back on tour,
Lots of funky melodies you're gonna like for sure

[Chorus]
Newsflash, newsflash, We're back, we're back,
Mis-Teeq with another hot track,
Put on ya seat belt, green light, go, Accelerate blow like Nitro,
New rhymes, new rhymes,
New times, new times and we're still lickin' on both sides,
Put on ya seat belt, green light, go, accelerate blow like Nitro

[Verse 2]
So what's's next on your cards?
Back to the UK gonna rip up the charts,
They didn't think it would last!
No media hype's gonna fear me and my girls apart,
Did the fame change your heart?
I remained the same grounded from the start,
You're coming back with a blast!
2003 we're gonna blow the spot

[Bridge, Chorus]
Rap
I think you will find that we are one of a kind,
We are the missus divine, we're gonna tickle ya spine
Like freud resurrected play with ya mind
We feed you the nourishment your body can't find,
Mis-Teeq's back with the flow,
Are you ready for the sound that we bring say so,
Ready for the songs that we've wrote say yo,
Ready for the launch of a brand new flow!
1,2,3,4 we're bringing flavours that you've never heard before,
3 women MCs ya know we're breaking down ya doors,
Be in the studio from dusk till dawn and when the sun rises,
Straight to the moon the children be singing,
The Mis-Teeq songs then the damage is done,
We're feeling good you know we're second to none, yo,
We're gonna bring ya some new action

[Chorus x2]
You'll see you're in for a treat,
JD and Mis-Teeq bringing you some brand new flavours

Mis-Teeq,"Remember the time when we used to play yeah yeah
Knock down ginger and we braid hair
Drunk slush puppies every day and
Now you're not around
A trip to the sweet shop oh was a treat
When your mama gave us 50p
What happened to those good old days
You ain't here with me

So how you been?
I know I haven't seen you
I heard you were working
Not as much as you do
Just keep trying
Maybe I'll come and see you
You know I'm gonna be here

[Chorus]
I know it's taken time, you felt I left behind
My ordinary life but it's the path I had to find
To get some peace of mind I had to leave you for a while
I felt empty deep inside withut my best friends by my side

La la la la la la la la [Repeat: x 4]

remember the time when we took the train yah yeah
Got home late my mum had grey hairs
Sleepovers on Saturdays yeah
Girl I miss those days
remember when Bobby Brown was the craze
We used to sing along like everyday
What happened to the pact we made
To never separate

What you doin' at 8?
Coming round to see you
Don't be late
There's so much that we should do
Just like old days
Got everything to tell you
Good friendships don't come easy

[Chorus: x 2]

Wherever we've been along the road
You've always been a friend to me I know
I'll stick with ou till the end
Through thick and thin
You'll always be my best friend

[Chorus repeat to end]",Best Friends
Mis-Teeq,"Gotta the city pon lock

DJ take back this track, hit them again the reaction is phat
Hit them again are you feeling that?
Music is life it's a natural fact
The people with the power they make you feel poor
I want to see the people on the dance floor
So here I come again with a lyric hardcore
I know I'm still raw but finding rhymes on deadline is law
Taste entertainment you know you want more
With the vibing galore upon the dancefloor
The people go mad they make you explore
Different ways to reach an applause

Just move-a ya body, that's what it is for
Move-a ya body, the crowd's wanting more

Seeing is believing as I'm riding on this track

Mis-Teeq,"[Verse 1]
 Seems like the more the days go by
 The less I miss you by my side
 Lately you've been carrying on
 I've never seen you act this way
 All this cause i came home late
 I thought you had more faith in us
 Faith in this
 
 [Bridge 1]
 If you had just talked to me
 Then you would know how much I care
 Instead you chose to be
 Insecure and complicated
 
 [Chorus]
 How could you do me like
 Had your back when things got twisted
 No you ain't got it like that
 With me, cause I'm a queen
 And if you don't recognise
 I'm the most high
 And if you don't realise
 I'm the most high
 
 [Verse 2]
 No matter how much I did for you
 You would never notice me
 You never took me out for dinner
 You were always too busy
 I warned you that someone
 Could take your time and space
 But your ego kept tripping
 Now your baby girls slipping
 
 [Bridge 1]
 
 [Chorus x 2]
 So you cause me fever
 Stan' up on the corner and a chat to Leana
 'Dem de type of summin de we say we na inner, 
 Inner hit the road
 Me a go tell you, you won't make it along
 Me love how, me love how, me love how you flow
 You never did know we run the show
 You've got me pacing like I've nowhere to go
 You got me caving like a man on death row
 What makes you think that I will settle for anything less
 Never wanted much from you, only the truth
 I gave you my best and that's all I can do
 So starting from now
 I'm breaking these vows
 And taking some time out for me
 
 [Chorus x 4]",Do Me Like That
Mis-Teeq,"Ooh, take a walk in the park under the stars
Baby take my hand the night is ours
I never knew what loving you could do
I'm feeling like I want to follow through

[Bridge]
You look into my eyes and
You make my temperature rise and
You keep me fantasizing baby

[Chorus A]
You can take me home tonight
I'm not making promises
Don't make it more than what it is
You can take me home tonight
Take it slow boy we can chill
And if I'm feeling it I will

[Chorus B]
Maybe, would you let a thug give you a hug
Maybe maybe stroke your back till you fall in love
Maybe, If it's cool can I kiss you please
Maybe, love you down till we fall asleep

Ooh, now you got me where you want me to be
But I won't give in too easily
I look at you and I can't help my self
My mind says wait my body's saying yes

[Bridge]

[Chorus A]

[Chorus B]	

My hearts racing, my body's aching
From dreams of making love all night
It won't take much, I'm weak one touch
Just might do this, if it's wrong or it's right

[Chorus A]

[Chorus B]	

[Chorus A to fade]",Home Tonight
