Hot Snakes,"His embrace a fortress
Carries me, and places
A skeleton of trust
Right beneath us
Bone by bone
Rock by rock

If you ask yourself patiently
Who is it, who is it, who is it ?

Who is it
That never lets you down?
Who is it
That gave you back your crown?
The ornaments are
They're goin' around
And they're handin' it over, handin' it over

Who is it
That never lets you down?
Who is it
That gave you back your crown?
The ornaments are
They're goin' around
And they're handin' it over, handin' it over

We all have been to the still place [???]
We all have learned the lightness
I carry my pain on my right
But I carry my joy on my left

If you ask yourself patiently
Who is it , who is it , who is it ?

Who is it
That never lets you down?
Who is it
That gave you back your crown?
The ornaments are
They're goin around
And they're handin' it over, handin' it over

Who is it
That never lets you down?
Who is it
That gave you back your crown?
The ornaments are
They're goin around
And they're handin' it over, handin' it over, handin' it over",Braintrust
Hot Soup,"Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

It's a lesson too late for the learnin'
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

You've got reasons a-plenty for goin'
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

As I lie in my bed in the mornin'
Without you, without you
Each song in my breast lies a burnin'
Without you, without you

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well, I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
That was the last thing on my mind

Hot Soup,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Hot Stove Jimmy,"I've got sunshine on a cloudy day

Hot Strings,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

Hot Strings,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Hot Strings,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Nothing would ever, ever come to woe;
But that's all gone now and I don't worry;
What's the future for me and my friends;
Well, I just don't know.
Cause living is with us until it is gone;
Once it has left us, the believers don't know;
But I'm still alive now and I don't worry;
When I go down, don't let me go slow!
If love was a word that no one could follow;
It was a message that was written in air;
I'd rather be lost now, than following nothing;
Than feeling and thinking, unable to care.",Ode for Billy Dean

Falling down like summer rain;
We see each other in confusion;
Wonder why we came today.

In our less uncommon way.
Through your hair across my eyes,
The twilight shafts in soft surprise;
Reminds me once again how nice,
It is to be with you.",Sea Child

Why did I leave her alone tonight?

Stole her away from the angry sea.

Among those kings I thought were grand,
Till time had opened up my eyes

Was empty as a nest in winter light.
Strolling in the garden,
Sunshine on a California day,
With you by my side.
The tears we've cried have dried and gone away.
The darkness of the northland,
In wintertime, has all began to run
Through the deltas of a passing sorrow,
Now that you and I are really one.
Now we're flying down the way
Where all our hopes have time to stay,
And we can marvel at the time
That floats us in it's path.

Sleeps a nervous dream.

Whiles away the passing hours;
Not being what he seems.
Then he creeps into the light;
Speeding up like fire flight,
Now he moves across the forest floor.
Send away the pace of time;
Leave behind the lonely mine,
And the diamond brilliant on the floor.

Diamond remains, brilliant in its cavern;

Through all this time, how have I returned?

Hot Water Music,"I could waist away with politics,
Or drown myself with wine.
Confine myself to solitude,
And inject poison into my mind.
Meanwhile outside, everything still grows,
Wild like fire and fury, while I wish alone.

You know that I could feel the poison in my mind.
You know that I could feel the venom deep inside.

I feel like I am in an endless night,
Like I am falling through the restless sky.

You can't erase them. 
Every lie you've told.
For then they'd leave you, 
And haunt you nevermore.

I could find myself in paradise.
Walk on endless shores.
Cut my feet so drastically before I beg for more.
Meanwhile, in front of me, under every stone,
Lies a thousand reasons with a thousand rhymes.

You can't erase them. 
Every lie you've told.
For then they'd leave you, 
And haunt you nevermore.

Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red

(She lives like russian roulette. Barrel up to the head. Where every sweet young move is belonging to a sickness.) Now enter special things to detour all the pain, like a brand new, solid mess. But nothing seems to last... It strikes when you've thought you won. It's self destruction. It strikes when you've thought you won. And the delicate balance won't survive the turbulence. Now, enter the escape from everything you've made. Cause something wrong inside won't let you live your life. It strikes when you've thought you won. It's self destruction. It strikes when you've thought you won. And down you will go, with a tail of flames stretched out behind you. The cold wind will blind you. And in all that you can't see. The simplicity is beautiful.

Of watching the clocks go round
Worked myself through somedays

Hey world, are you listening?
Listen to me!

He keeps on moving on this lonely road from hell
Asking for forgiveness underneath Christchurch bells

As the time goes by, go by

Sunsets over the city, clouds are rising
And you can see clear up to the night time sky
And if you're feeling precious, you want to do well
Think of others, ask for a prayer underneath Christchurch bells

And when I met her at the station I was blind

She wore white linen, she had a pearly white smile

Her feet, they were worn from walking long miles
She helped people that no one else helped saying
Get up, stand up and be your own self
You've got the helping healing feeling of love coming on you

We will end another people
If we keep taking from the ground

You'll see it in the symbols
And the songs with ancient sounds
You'll find it all connected
If you take the time to look around
Look around

There's a gathering of races
And a gathering of soul
There'll be a choosing of directions
And a distribution of roles

Earth is Turtle Island
And air is Isle of Green
Water is in India
And fire is Aborigine

Hothouse Flowers,"He has been living through the pages of our time
Known as a true man, pure and sublime
Comes from the earth and out of the skies
From the four corners of the compass and into our lives

He is followed, he who is true
To what there is to be believed in, to the spirit of you
Comes from the day and out of the night
It's in all things natural, it's in all things right

Oh sometimes, it's just not that easy
Oh sometimes, I got to call you, call you

Stand beside me, God, stand beside me
Stand before me and behind me
So I can follow in love

And it all sails so smoothly with a prayer at each hand
We all carry our stones, our good books
On the Holy ground, we stand true to the day, true to the night
It's got to be natural, it's got to be right

Oh sometimes, it's still not that easy
No, sometimes, I'm not the man I think I am
Feel I am, hope I am, know I am

Stand beside me, stand beside me
Stand before me and behind me
So I can be true, so I can be true to my word

Stand beside me, stand beside me
Stand before me, stand beside me

Hothouse Flowers,"You sang so softly
I closed my eyes
Like snowfall on the water
I, the only child

You had been walking
And your skin was cold
You took the night with you

And I was enthralled
By the power of the light
And the sound of the changing tide of your nature

And it was evening, I saw my breath
I was needing to hear your tenderness
I was blinded by the sight
The power of the changing tide of your nature

Stay singing softly
You take me home
Like a slow boat on the water
Like an old stone

I was blinded by the sight
And the power of the changing tide
Blinded by the night
The sweet sound of the changing tide of your nature

My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

Oh yeah yeah, at last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known, oh yeah yeah

You smiled, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

Hothouse Flowers,"Is it a garden waiting to grow
Is it a secret that nobody knows
Is it a poison or is it a cure
Contaminated when you think that it's pure
Born live on the air
At a tv station with the whole world there
Born holding your hand
Spinning the big wheel with the studio band
Will you be true or will you be false
Is it an omen or is it a curse
Will it be early or will it be late
Is it a dead end or is there a gate
Born live on the air...
Will you be here or some place else
Will you be tired or will I have to dance
Will you be sexy will you lie on the floor
Or will you forget completely what I came here for
Born live on the air...
Have you been drinking or is it your scent
There's so many bottles is your money all spent
Is there a corner to put all this mess
You'd think you were lazy, please undress
Born live on the air...
",Born
Hothouse Flowers,"You know the way I could never say no
To anything at all
You know the way you just got to let go
Before you take the fall
You came out of the smoke before me I had to take you in
Then right there you spoke and told me you're ready to begin
So I'll find the time, take all day
Find a smile and find the way
Took the time went for a stroll somewhere I'd never been
Kick the ball let it roll and watch it spin
I know that we can bring this through
All we got to do is start
Take a positive step forward to the scary part of the heart
And find the time take all day
Find a smile and find the way
Woke up late last night, never felt so good
Went outside for a walk, went tripping through the wood
Back to bed to think of you, babe I'll see you soon
But instead of you I'll send my kisses straight up to the moon
And find the time, find the day
Find a smile and find the day......
Oh baby baby baby baby, find a smile and find the way

Hothouse Flowers,"I'm sitting on my own by the fire again
And the healing is turned on
I've been just out drinking and I feel my mind is gone
And the flames are dancing like a ballerina
Reminding me of you
And the night that we fell through the mist
And we made one out of two yeah

And I think I'm going to go out and buy a diamond
And I think I'm going to dress you up in white
Forever more forever more forever more forever more
I like a drink that takes some time to settle
It's worth the wait and it tastes just like a dream
And my soul is full of gold and precious metals
And my heart is singing a song that's never been
And I think I'm going to go out and buy a diamond
And I think I'm going to dress you up in white

Forever more forever more forever more forever more
And the first night that we made love was so wrong
And the night that we got drunk to write this song

This big rolling ball, tore us apart
This is for the record I never meant the pain
Spitting volcano, waiting to explode
That's how it is, that's where we are
Yes it was good, but it went too far
It's hard to let go, when no one can talk
Two years on, we're learning to walk
Sometimes when I sleep, if I ever sleep at all
I dream of you, standing in the cold
Most of the time, I'm too tired to talk
Too scared to reveal, to show you it all
That's how it is, that's where we are
Yes it was good, but it went too far
It's hard to let go, when no one can talk
Two years on, we're learning to walk
I'm reading a page, cobwebs of rage
I'm building a cage for you to embrace
Forever the fool, forgetting my lines
I'm lost in sublime, healing in time
That's how it is...

Hothouse Flowers,"You introduced me to all of your friends
I saw your kindness
And what it said was that the lie would end
It's where you'll find us
If you're suspicious then just read the guide
The drum is leading
She'll bring you deep inside your troubled mind
To what you're feeling
Can I watch you fly, when I cry
Just carry on what you're doing
Don't ignore me keep doing it
And if I die, make sure your mind is in this song
See all the images are up ahead, go easy sister
The universe cries out to be your friend, you might have kissed her
Oh come alive in visible heart, spinning like a sparkler wheel
Some people jive when they hear music start
Oters just kneel
See all the images up ahead, go easy sister
The universe waits to be duly fed
You might have kissed her
Come alive invisible heart, spinning like a sparkler wheel
Some people jive when they hear it start
Others just kneel

The more we mean to each other

Yet still we walk strong, we'll remember we're free

Though still I find barriers, yet still I would fall

House of Fools,"Everyday
She sits and she waits for the one
That she loves to come for her
To take her out, get her out of that house
Where her demons lie down before her

I heard that she says
She's better off dead than with someone else
And she'll find, yeah, she'll find no greater love

Everyday
In the morning he waits up
To find his way to forget her
Too worried to rhyme, too fucked up to fight
Too afraid what's to come in the future

Despite what she says
He's there every single chance he gets
And he doesn't
No, he doesn't wanna be like them

And it's so hard for them to see each other now
That it's all said and done
You never know how much you love a person
Until that day they're gone
But it's not over 'til it's over
Over 'til it's over

Hey, hey, hey
",Until It's Over
House of Fools,"[Verse 1:]
In a world that seems so fake, artificial everything;
Oh I just want be real,
I gotta say how I feel, can't wait.

Always looking at myself,
Never liking what I see;
I never gave me the chance,
Never knew what I really could be.

[Chorus 1:]
(Better than living a lie),
(it's better than wearing a disguise);
Take a chance on you,
(You just be you),
(take a chance on you).

[Verse 2:]
I can't say the world has changed,
They still judge by what they see.
Though I can't help what they say,
I know who's inside of me.

It's okay to take that chance,
Try your possibilities (possibilities);
No one can do what you do,
Or stop all the things you can be
(they can't even stop what you're gonna be).

[Chorus 2:]
(Better than living a lie) living a lie,
(it's better than wearing a disguise);
Take a chance on you,
(You just be you),
(take a chance on you, on you).

[Bridge:]
The grass is always green on the other side,
It's when you're looking through your insecure eyes.
And it's better than living a lie (living a lie),
So much better than wearing a disguise,
(take a chance on you) You just be you,
(You just be you, You just be you).

[Ending:]
It's better (better)
Than living a lie (living a lie),
So much better than wearing a disguise;
(take a chance on you),
(take a chance on you),

It's hard to know what I've known,
So much pain, and so few innocent.

Yeah, but nothing's free,

By the 380 colt mustang in my pocket
I had a few drinks already, don't make me cock it
Cause if I have to cock it, well then it's gettin' shot
And if it's gettin' shot, well, yo, you're gettin' bucked down
I don't fuck around, I ain't got time for punks
But I got time to smoke all the skunk philly blunts
Stunts gather round, check out the sound
And let's get down to do the nasty, freaky, funky
Stinky, junky, let's bump uglies in the nighttime
Between the sheets
Cause I rock fly rhymes over funky beats
The Celtic ruin, the legion of doom
Now gimme the track, or with the fat back doom
Now gimme some room, and I'll explode
Cock back my hammer, then squeeze off my load
So hit the road, Jack, and don't come back no more
Or I'll be moppin' up the floor with your crew of soft core
Punk pussy bitches, jail house snitches
On stage, I get wrecked and I collect my riches
I get the funky style, and like Gomer Pile
You'll be 'Surprise surprise surprise!' as I
Rise to the top, fuck a punk cop

So you better quit, zit

Blastin' with the Soul Assassins

Bringin' the West Coast back to the East Coast

Is causin' pain, and feelin' pain
So feel it

Feel it
Just feel it
c'mon y'all, feel it

Back to the rhyme, I'm always on time
A lime to a lemon, yo, a lemon to a lime
I rock the old school style and it's futile
To step up, cause you'll get swept up
Like dust, or I just might bust and unload my clip
Unless you're a punk, then I'll just pop you in the lip
And show you the deal, now how did that feel
You know I'm killin' any pig that squeels
I'm fillin' up reels of tape with my fly rhymes
And I've got a subsciption to High Times
Son Dooby's in the back, the Mexican Ralph Emms is on the track
My DJ Lethal, he's on the cut
When I bust a dope rhyme, it's like bustin' a nut
So let me jerk off on the mic and get it sticky
When I drink a brew it's either Guinness or mickeys
I'll put your head out just like a fuckin' Malboro
Don't fuck with me, punk, you know that I'm thorough
Bred like a race horse, right-in-your-face force
Feedin' you beats, straight off the streets
So catch me catch me, if you can
You know I'm the man like Chewbacca knows Han
Solo, bolos are what I'll be throwin'
When I be flowin', I get the job done
Cause I'm number one, the Prodigal Son
I left and I came back, but not with the same rap
And not with the same style, I'm known to get buckwild

Fire up the grill and crack the kegs
Nobody fear, the party's here

To get me locked up, or get yourself knocked up

I don't rock fronts, but I stuff stunts

I kick the willy drag, let my pants sag
Don't give up the booty, cause I ain't no fag
Checkin' out checkit, I'm prone to wreck shit
If ya dig this joint, check the next shit
I'm Everlast and it's a natural fact
That the white man is back

I'll eat you up like some butter cups from Reese's
I come in peace, but you'll leave in pieces
That's how I'm livin', that's how it goes
Everyday I'm sleepin', every night I'm doin' shows
Always gettin' hoes when there's hoes to get got
Always wear my hat so I never need a shot
Always drink a beer before I write a rhyme
And if I have to drive I avoid the one time
Stay between the lines and I won't get pulled over
I don't need luck cause I got a four leaf clover
Yea I'm Irish, word to the motherland
But on the otherhand
I love America, apple pie, mom and all that

Play me close and you catch a mean dose
Of my fist, homeboy you get dissed

House of Pain,"I'm a wood peckin' peckerwood
Take me out, ya never could
Act up in my neighbourhood
You better not, my aim is good
The House Of Pain is not a gang
Just a funky Irish name
A Celtic savage makin' cabbage
With corn beef on the side
Irish pride is what I got
I got a lot so don't dispute it
Constantly I'm zooted
If ya got a gun then shoot it
Pick any beat I rock it
I'm always in the pocket
You try to ill, I grab my gat
And now you see me cock it
Next I pull the trigger
I don't care if you're bigger
You try to con yourself you're bulletproof
But how ya figure?
The caps that I'll be poppin'
They'll have your body droppin'
You thought you knew the deal
But now you feel your heartbeat stoppin'
I'm moppin' up the comp
That's short for compitition
I write my lyrics like
The Irish mob in Hell's Kitchen

Chorus
The House Of Pain in effect, y'all
I say the House Of Pain is in effect
You know the House Of Pain is in effect y'all
And anyone that steps up in gettin' wrecked

I'm a beer drinkin' fighter
The bike in Easy Rider
I only roll my spliffs
With the extra easy riders
Papers to vapours
Is what you'll all be catchin'
Meanwhile I'll be snatchin'
Up your hoes and all your dough
The styles that I'll be kickin'
You know they're finger lickin'
Good, the peckerwood never could play the victim
Only the offender
I go out on a bender
Drink a case of brew
And then disgrace the crew
But only if it's Mickey's
I never wear no dickeys
Only wear the Levi's
My whole family cries

Chorus",House of Pain Anthem
House of Pain,"Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk you better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (c'mon!) c'mon throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump across the ceiling
Muggs lifts a funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's hoe
Feelin, funkin, amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (17X)

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel, to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to Kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (17X)

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzanegger
Try to play me out like, as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
it up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (33X)

Yo, this is dedicated.. to Joe.. DeBerg.. Dakota!
Grab your bozack, punk!",Jump Around
House of Pain,"Remember when the shit hit the fan and the man wanted to know
which way you ran?
(Life goes on) (4x)

Back it up, smack it up, pop your corn
I got more style than Son Dooby's got horn
Top o the morn, rise and shine
LA swine, got no spine
Drop that stick, pig, my crew's real thick
Drop your gun, pig, and get a real dick
I got my gat cause I don't trust ya
Play me close and make me nervous, I'll bust ya
LA's no joke, the cops don't care
They'll beat ya down till there's just a fuckin' hair
Of life left in ya, then they'll pin ya
Way out in Wayside, watch your backside
White and black crime is what goes on
And life goes on

Chorus
And life goes on (13x)

And on and on till the break of dawn
And on to the next day, ay yo, by the way
Did you know about the science of creation
About the Masons, about their nation
Of disarm, this arm, a lega lega or a head
To the thirty-third degree, you know that's me
Ease back, so ease off or I'll squeeze off
My clip, please don't trip, or we's gonna flip
The House Of Pain makes clouds a rains
On parades, I wear shades when it's sunny
Sometimes I rock funny, I ain't in it for the money
But I get mine before the show goes on
And life goes on

Chorus",Life Goes On
House of Pain,"Huh!  Check it out!  Everybody in the house, check it out!
The House Of Pain is in full effect
Call me the corn fed, peckerwood, redneck cracker
White bread, shit kickin' Irish beat jacker
Comin' with the style of a Celtic rebel
Those who ain't on my level call me the blue eyed devil
But that's just because they don't know what I know
And that's just because they can't flow like I flow
I rip shit, dip shit, so what you gotta say
Why you want to play, I fuck you up with no delay
And knock your motherfucking fronts out
Smoke my philly blunts out, my buddha never runs out
I turn the little scunts out
And I got the hookers callin' me pops
Once their cherry pops, Everlast gets all the props
I'm hittin' skins from here to Copenhagen
I bed the wenches cause you know I'm a pagan
The House Of Pain, that's the name of my crew
You don't like it, tough luck, what the fuck you gonna do
Nothin', you ain't sayin' nothin'
You need to start puffin' and relax
Or you'll wind up gettin' taxed
For your money, for your jewels, for your car, for your ho
My crew, they start trippin' while I'm rippin' up the show

Chorus

Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house
I said Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house
One for the road, this is one for the road
For my man Matt Champy, this is one for the road
Tura lura lura, tura lura li
Tura lura lura, that's an Irish lullaby
No need to act fly, you'll be sayin' nighty-night
The place you're in is right if you're lookin' for a fight
Step up, your blood, I spill it
Put on the beat, I kill it
I'll burn ya like some bacon that's been fryin' in my skillet
Move over Sizzlean, my favorite color's green
But I'll beat ya black and blue, cause I'm always with my crew

Chorus 2X",One for the Road
House of Pain,"Yea, check it out now
Everybody check it out now
Yo, I got the corn beef
I got the moz
I got the shotty
Ay yo, I got the buck shot
Ay yo, I got the burgers
I got the grill
If you're steppin' up next
Ya better flex that skill
The House Of Pain is in full effect
Everybody in the place give full respect
If your girl's in the house keep the ho in check
And if I'm bustin' off caps, you better hit the deck
Steppin' on stage with the fly routines
I'm hemmin' up suckers like bell bottom jeans
I always switch trains in Jamaica, Queens
When I go to by the street to see my Aunt Ilene
Danny Boy's comin' with the Irish style
The money back guarantee, I make it worth your while
I'm layin' out fools like kitchen tile
You come around with a frown, and ya leave in a pile
Step back man, I ain't a black man
But everytime I grab the mike I rock a phat jam
Without the Slimfast, and if I skim past
You know I step up and get a ho with gym blast
I give her what she wants, even if she fronts
The Hill is down with the House, they got the philly blunts
Ya know we roll 'em up, and then we light 'em up
And then we puff them up and pass them
So Danny Boy blasts 'em
I got the shell-toe Adidas, with the fat strings
The Celtic crosses and the Claddagh rings
The straight edges razor and the marther pump
You heard me shit clickin', now it's time to jump
Jump around just like a frog on a log
Fuck the Dukes because I like Boss Hogg
I'm hittin' home runs like my man Wade Boggs
And if you try to act stupid, I'm droppin' the dogs
Everytime I go to town
People start kickin' my dog around
It makes no difference if my dog's a hound (hound)
You better stop kickin' my dog around

Chorus
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit (4x)

Now I've droppin' records since the age of seventeen
First I came solo, but I now I got a team
It's the four man crew, with the Irish stew
You catch us puffin' on a blunt, and sippin' a brew
What's up with that brew, man, hurry up and finish
Now grab the bar maid and order me another Guinness
You can drink the Guinness while I'm sippin' on the mickeys
When it comes to hookers, yo, the Everlast is picky
Always got my hat in case I come across a quicky
And when I do my shows I get the hoes all hot and sticky
The House Of Pain is in full effect, yea
I say the House Of Pain is in full effect
You know the House Of Pain is in full effect, yea
And anyone who steps up is gettin' wrecked

Chorus 2X

Check it out now!  Owww!
I said the House Of Pain!
We out",Put on Your Shit Kickers
House of Pain,"I rip shit like a bow when I flow
And I score points with the joints that I throw
Cause I flow deadly
I'm no punk see
I break backs, make tracks and get funky
There's no one to run to cause nobody cares
MC's drop to your knees, say your prayers
The luck of the Irish is about to kick in
Prepare to die and notify your next of kin
I'm goin' all out, buck, duck and call out
That's how I'm livin, punk you better stall out
This is the House of Pain
To come inside is insane

Chorus
I'll put your head out (4x)
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
I'll put your head out
Put put your head out
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
Hey what up punk?
I'll put your head out

Who steps the booze
When the hoods want to take a cruise
They're feelin' the effects of the booze
Ain't no clues to hold with them fools
Who got smoked even though they scrat crews
You got bruise but I got the booma
Trigger to blast ya askin the bull
Take my life shit, I'll take you to school
In the do what's the difference if your think of droppin Jews
Carbon copy think you're so cool
Stop dreamin' and hallucinatin'
You're caught up in a piece of pain
Click click, punk, now you're thinkin' oh shit
Quit while you're ahead before I fill you full of lead

Chorus

Blessed with the gift, and gifts with the rhyme
I never say quit when I'm out to get mine
It's live and let die, sit back and get high
Smokin' a fat blunt, waitin' for some punk
To act up like he's got somethin' in him
Then I grab the mike and start spittin' out venom
Coughin' up headstones, blowin' out headphones
Steppin' to me, you'll wind up in the Dead Zone
It's nothin' personal, that's how it goes, G
Step up with beef, and you'll wind up losin' teeth
Cause I don't give up the mike that easy
Step back, this ain't government cheese, G
You can stand in line, but you ain't gettin' it
Talk all the shit you want, but I ain't sweatin' it

Chorus",Put Your Head Out
House of Pain,"Yo, the time has come 
For everyone to clean up their own backyard
Before they go knocking on their neighbor's door

The House of Pain is cleaning up, sweeping up, clocking up
Check it, check yourself before you check another
It's the House of Pain, Pain, Pain..",Salutations
House of Pain,"I kicks the flava, like Steven King writes horror
If I was a Jew then I'd light a menorah
I got rhymes for ya, excuse me senora
Are you a whore or are you a lady?
Is it Erica Boyare or Marcia Brady?
Let me know hon, the deed'll get done
Just assume the position, I'll take my rod
And then I'll go fishin', I'll get your river flowin'
When it comes to givin' pleasure, I'm every woman's treasure
I came to work your body, so let me do my job
I've never been laid off, my rhymin' skill paid off
'Cause now I'm makin' records, now I'm makin' tapes
Steady bustin' suckers in bunches like grapes
Makin' all the papes, scoopin' up the loot
Puttin' suckers on the run, pull my gun and then I shoot
I never been a front, I never a fraud
I gotta natural skill, for that I thank the Lord
'Cause I feel blessed, I'm casually dressed
I always got my gun, but I never wear a vest

My unique rhyme style's my claim to fame
The House Of Pain's the name of my clip
You can't be down, punk, get off my dick
You make me sick, like strawberry Quik
Your style is wack, you ain't the mac
So yo step back, get off the crack

House of Pain,"""She won't come, just when you want it..""

[Everlast]
Ya see I'm Irish, but I'm not a leprechaun
You want to fight, then step up and we'll get it on
You'll get a right to the grill, I'm white and I ill
A descendant of Dublin with titanic skill
I ducked and I swing, next thing your jaw's broken
Punk I ain't jokin, you can bet you'll be chokin
on a fist full of nuttin, meanwhile I'll be puffin
on a fat blunt, what punk?  You don't know the half
Tryin to talk shit, man, please don't make me laugh
These Irish eyes are smilin, I'm buckwhylin
The House of Pain is pumpin, start jumpin
Freak it, funk it, back seat trunk it
If you can't get with it, you'll wind up sweatin it
Then you'll get a beatin just like an egg
It's so hard to run when you got a broken leg
But we can have a run off, the House of Pain'll come off
We got the cake that you're tryin to get a crumb off
The Irish stylee, the Celtic jazz
No one has it, just us that's it
If you try to take it, I got a big shileighly
I don't have dreads cause I shave my head daily
You call me a skinhead, I call you a pin head
Yo, where you been man, just like the Tin Man
you got no heart, here comes the good part
I pick 'em, buck 'em, cut 'em up, and buck 'em down
No fuckin around, homeboy ya get clowned like Krusty
Trust me, you shouldn't play.. and by the way

Chorus: Everlast + ""Cheech and Chong"" scratches

Top o' the mornin to ya.. ""What's the hassle man?"" 
Top o' the mornin to ya.. ""What's the hassle man?""

Top o' the mornin to ya..
""Hey, are you givin us a hassle man?""

Greetings, salutations
Peace to the Nations of Zulu and Islam
Crack the bottle, rev the throttle
Put the gear in, now you're steerin
like Mario Andretti, so let me kick it
cause I can make a wicked - noise like a cricket
Rubbin his legs, my rhymes are like eggs
Allah'll keep layin em, I'll keep sayin em
This is the House of Pain, we're far from plain
But we're not fancy, Ron and Nancy
So ""Just Say No,"" but I say go
straight to Hell, I kiss and tell
So if you're a hoe, all my friends know
What you gotta say?  Let's hit the hay
And have no delay, and yo, by the way..

[Everlast]
Extra extra, read all about it
How could ya doubt it?  Now scream and shout it!
The House of Pain, soon will reign
over the Hip-Hop scene in white gold and green

[Danny Boy]
I rip shit and backflip like a Jedi
I roll with the groove and I'm smooth and you can bet I
Come correct and get respect when I'm flowin
Collectin my dough, I got you're girlfriend hoein
And how do I know that she's sprung?
I know she's sprung cause yo, the T's hung.. like a
Shetland pony, gettin paid like Sony
So never ever try to play me out like a phony
Cause I can get real thick like a bowl of Malt-O-Meal
And by the way..

House of Pain,"I'm sick, demented
I came to represent it
I rose from the grave
I had a close shave
The cops tried to lock me down
'cause the gloc they found
was stolen
that's how I'm rollin'
Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
So I don't like Marky
or the monarchy
don't start me up like a rolling stone
or I'll leave ya sulkin like Maculay Culkin in Home Alone

So get a grip like Steven Tyler
I used to trip with the divine styler
back in the days there were Irish ways
and Irish laws, stand up for the cause

(chorus)
When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man

(Danny Boy)
Well it's the D to the A, double N why BO
why, cause I rock shit like I run it in you
It's a black day, avenge quick run get the vest ?
I'm down with the Hill cause I still got the skill
To turn the party out
Its all about the skyscraper
Your girl caught the vapors
so I might videotape her
I make a lot of papers so I don't have to scrape the
bottom of the barrel
I rock fly apparel
Now I could pull your car
stating up the Harley David - son
I got the gun, so the drama, you could save it

Well it's the mad bum rushin'
funky with percussion
from LA to Flushing
I get your girlie blushin'
I'll cutcha like a butcher,
Well it ain't Joe the writer (?)
the old rock a loop cause I'm super like Schneider

(chorus)

I'm ill, retarded
so don't get me started
I might lose my cool
ya lose if we do
cause I can stomp a hole in the soul of a monk
with the rhymes in my head and the beats in my trunk
I got skill kid
and I run the mill kid
for all its worth, I'm gettin mines on Earth
so step to the next head
or like Sadat X said
'He's gone and that's how it flows to be
Don't stand so close to me!'

(chorus)",On Point
House of Pain,"I'll in them clothes all the gray
I'll stay if you go away
Concrete, tall as the sky
Movement passing me by

And you blush, what a rush
Reminisce, cold crush
Next door, ear to the wind
All the tension made for the core

I wish, I wish
I wish it was all that easy
I wish, I wish
I wish it was all that easy",All That
House of Pain,"Straight out the casket, risin' up
Open up your eyes, can't you see me?
What the fuck is this? Madness, pick up my bones
Erase my name from off the tombstones
Alive and kickin', breathing the air
Call out my name, punk, and I'll be there
No question, my suggestions of the action
Caught smack dab in the middle of the blastin'
Messin' with me, you're messin' with the best
Blaow, you're takin' two shots to your chest

'Cause I'm back from the dead.
Everlast comin' back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freakin' hole in your head

Back from the dead, back from the dead

You can't disrespect it, I'm the resurrected
Back from the dead just to mess with your head
I'll stress what I said, but I won't repeat it
If you've got a cold starve it, if you've got a fever feed it
And if you can't feed it then why not blow
You may be positive and not even know
I rock the hardcore from the floor to the ceiling
I give sexual healing, I'll get your girl squealin' like a pig
My grave's something you can never dig
I'll rock a mausoleum, back yard or Colosseum

'Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast's comin' back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead

Skip the autopsy 'cause I never O.D.'d
I only puff boom kid, I never get skeed
I don't sniff or shoot up, riff I'll stick my boot up
Your ass quick fast, Everlast don't jive
Just like Pearl Jam I'm still alive
(Look at all these rumors)
Spreadin' like tumors, gossip and lies
Exaggerated reports of my demise
And if you believed 'em, well then you got gassed
The media deceived 'em just like in the past

'Cause I'm, back from the dead
Everlast's comin' back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freakin' hole in your head

Back from the dead, back from the dead

Like Steven Seagal I'm hard to kill
Like GiGi Allen I'm crazy ill
I'll beat you down with my mic, kick your ass with my Nike
Bust you in the eye if you tell another lie
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Thinkin' I'm dead you must be smokin' dust
Come see me bust in the flesh it's a must

To the next level
The graphic devils
Gettin' funky like the Nevilles
Brothers from the bayou,
So why you want to trip
Just play the sideline kid
And wait for me to trip
'Cause I can feel it in the air tonight
But yo I'm not Phil Collins
I'm more like Henry Rollins
'Cause I search and destroy
Retoy with the plot
Tryin' to get what I got
Ya might get shot
Hot damn I'm a slam ya like ONYX
Then teach ya how to write a rhyme
Like hooked on Phonics
Mother Goose ain't got shit on me
'Cause I get loose at the jam and wreck the whole party
I make em' jump and mosh
Oh my gosh
There slamin in the pit
When I'm kickin my shot
They're buggin at the eyes
'Cause I got mad styles
And ain't a damn thing funny
I get money in piles
Some people thought I died
That's just a rumor though
Others thought I fell off
But now I'm numero uno
Dos not cuatro
word to cool Kieth
I'm a break up your teeth
When I die (die)
Bury me (me)
Hang my balls from a cherry tree (tree)
Let them get ripe and take a bite
And if they don't taste right then don't blame D (D)
You need to quit swingin
The styles that I'm bringin
The funk knuckle dragon
The kids on the wagon
I'm not the 12 stepper
Don't play me like a lepper
My mic sounds nice
But it's not Salt-n-Pepa
Well it's the man with the plan
To get all your skins
The tip of my dick is where the line begins
So hoe's form a line
Take off that swine
Strip your ass butt naked
Let's see if you can take it
'Cause I'll make you feel...
LIKE A NATURAL WOMEN!
'Cause I keep it comin'
I'm the Everlastin'
Free style assassin
My soul and my goal is to bring a little passion
To your girl's life like the Daily Sun
Throw her down on the bed
And tie her up wit ropes
I'm just another rager with a Dairy Face
Punk motherfuckers beef and rhyme my race
You need to step back kid and give me some space
So I can cold spark the party when I'm rockin the place
Danny Boy's arrivin'
I Stand six five and a half, don't laugh kid
The outlaw biker with my big shit kicker
On a highway to hell
'Cause I never tell
Well it's the funk back breaker
We heat it up like Jamaica
Don't bring your woman to the party cause I'll take her
Hit the deck 'cause I'm down with the Hoolis
I got a trunk full of funk like the groovy doolies
I'm not the man but I'll asked who was he
Quick's hot the hair do just like Ruth Buzzy
Runnin' 'round town like ya been to jail son
But ya hit the swap meet to get your hair and your nail done
Get off my sack

House of Pain,"Verse One: Everlast

Johnny was a bad boy, he was juvenile delinquent
He had his picture on the wall of every precinct
He had a rep of hanging out with his homies
Puffin on the blunts and sippin on the forties
But when he spoke, nobody would listen
And when he was home, yo, his parents they would diss him
They called him a bum a worthless piece of shit, so over this he had a fit
And now he grabs his bag and heads for the door
And walks to the neighborhood liquor store
Pulls out a gun tells the old man ""Hit the floor!""
Then breaks open the register drawer
Pulls out the money stuffs it in his pocket
Points his pistol then he starts to cock it
The man panics and gun goes off
Stupid old fool made Johnny blow his head off
But he don't care cause Johnny was thought
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught

Chorus: Everlast

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught (repeat 3X)
That's how it is homie like it or not

Verse Two: Evelast

Now coming out store Johnny shot two Haisidic Jews
And when he got home his face was on the news
His mom freaked out told him get the fuck out
That when the pigs rolls up, so yo he ducked out
He hit the backdoor like his name was Carl Lewis
Skipped to the payphone to find out where his crew is
He called up his homeboy Jose, ""Word up!""
""Can I come over my man?"", he said, ""No way 
a cop was here he was looking all over for you
but I told the pig that I didn't know you""
He said, ""Cool meet me up at the school
I need a ride cause I'm wanted for homicide""
Johnny got a gun and now he's on the run
But he don't care to him this shits fun
Now that he's an outlaw sorta like Robin Hood
The hard rock hero of the whole neighborhood
If they catch him he'll wind up in court
But it ain't a crime if you don't get caught

Chorus

New Chorus: Everlast

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
It ain't a sale if it don't get bought
It ain't a show if I don't get paid

Back in the hub we used to drop madel
Contemplate in hell
The stories I could tell would
Freak your mind
And wreck your brain
The thoughts I would have
would drive most insane
The band playin' Rain
Gettin' Down wit' Jimmy
Hendrix, and Page
Make up the rage
Back in the Huddle
McLou's back yard
Me and D was starvin'
And times were hard
Danny used to roll through
Schemin' on the hustle
Credit cards and slang
M..MC bangin'
Lethal used to come with his reel to reel
We didn't have no deal
But that wasn't the point, we'd...
Rock a funky joint
Then we'd rock another
The only thing to eat
Was some bread, and peanut butter
Back to all the females that beded me
In case you ever wondered
They didn't forget me
These are the times that I always think of
And this is dedicated to the ones I love

That's where I'm from
Where're you goin' if you don't look back
What's the use of havin ends
If you lose all your friends X4

Paintin' on the wall
Ten years gone by
Playin on the stereo
With the volume kinda low
Scheme Team's comin'
Bring me along
We gonna throw a hut party
Till' the break of dawn
With the Soul poppin', that's Soul Poetry
Chameleon playin' bringin' wit' that team
Bring a tab and a 40 and a bag of weed
That's all I need G
'Cause I ain't Freaky
Trippin' for days
Runnin' the maze
Goin' down to Venice
Sippin' on the Guinness
These are the times that I always think of
And this is dedicated to the ones I love

[CHORUS]

Now times have change
And I'm on tour
And I don't see my friend every day no more
And 'cause they don't see me
They think I've changed
But I'm the same motherfucker no doubt
What's it all about
I thought we was people
I'm tryin' to get mine
I thought you had my back
Man, I can't understand
They used to slap my hand
Ask me for a grand
And run wit' your man
Behind my back and diss me
If you want to fuck me
first ya gotta kiss me

[CHORUS] X3",Where I'm From
House of Pain,"I used to kick it with the thugs, pushin' drugs in the park
Makin' every mark that was out after dark
Stick 'em for their loot, cut em up then I'd dash
And when I had to shoot, I'd nutted up for the cash
Ran down the block with my 45 glock
Capped off a round, everybody hit the ground
The next thing I heard was a siren
Couldn't turn around, money grip kept firin'
Runnin' for the ride, I can't go inside
I'd rather that I died, I got too much pride
I guess it's just somethin' that you can't understand
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?

Chorus (x4)

Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?

I used to sell yayo back in the day-o
Ran with the gang, had all the homie's slang
Grams to the quarters, I'm takin' all the orders
Makin' all the runs, Rakin' in the funds
I always got my gun, it's the old six-shooter
King of the neighborhood, crazy white peckerwood
Now people thinkin' Danny lost his mind
It must've been from all the wine man and all the hardtimes
Like chillin' in the park in the dark with the crew
I'm always gettin' high, I saw my man die
Now I got the work and the dough, 25 grand and a 5 keys of blow
I gotta' relocate and start all over
But watch it blow up like a supernova
I keep my game in tight and follow the plan
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?

Chorus (x4)

I got myself locked down in the pen
I ain't got a friend, so here I go again
I gotta' get my props up and earn my respect
Gotta' shake someone up or throw 'em off the top deck
My time's runnin' out, I gotta' spill some blood
If I don't do it quick, shit, my name'll be mud
So I pick out a hardrock and rush him in his cell
Beat his ass down and then say that he fell
And if I gotta' do him, scrw him, the convict's dead
I'll stab him in the chest just to let the rest
Of the cell block know that I'm nobody's ho
My shanks in my hand so tell me who's the man?

Rocks the sky from the gutter

I do things the way I like 'cause this mic is controlled

Well then ya get Vic
'Cause your knowledge is a trip

I'm punchin suckers in the mouth like a root canal
Ya get me started then I'm hard to stop
I got forty five calibers ready to pop
And when I pop off
Ya drop off
Ya get blown out the frame

House of Pain,"If I was to sit down and actually write out a list 
Of the MCs that missed it would be the constitution 
They play their caps backwards still saying whack words 
No power to (durhust) just a few yes men 
Raising the question of who gave you a contract 
They should be fired you're officially retired 

I see you make a little cash and start showing your ass 
You get laced up with jewels your crews acting like fools 
Playing hard rock surrounded by body guards 
Hoping no one pulls your cord you got me laughing pretty hard 
Thinking you're the white hot man of the hour 
But you just can't figure how your flavor went sour 
Back in 89 PE fought the power and in 86 Big Daddy Kane was raw 

And I was right there on the first floor of the Palladium 
You never played a venue local college or a stadium 
A young boys (fiddin' pad) fad is now a grown mans profession 
To earn this is a blessing 
This skills have me guessing learn cause I'm testing 
Follow this down no question 

No doubt check it out 
You be either rhyming in code or on some gangster node 
You all clockwork apocalypse you about to implode 
Collapsing on yourself cause your whole foundation is 
Built on lies don't apologize 
Cause once they watch you rise they want to watch you fall 
And they'll all take a piece just like the Berlin wall 
And place it on their mantle like a souvenir 
And what they call a knick-knack is really your career 

You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress 
Still there be people that would die for less 
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow 
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow 
You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress 
Still there be people that would die for less 
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow 
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow 

When its time to rise Ill open the archives 
When you be in dreams you got 85s 
Chrome down with the leather package 
You got a home of your own 
you're holding acres 
I got it made 
Season tickets to the Knickers and the Lakers 
Playing both coasts closed and European festivals 
Crowd scream decibels x2 
In your ear you want to make rapping your career 

From Arkansas to Minnesota I sell out the quota 
I be the wet dream making cream for promoters 
We keep the shit right we don't be starting no fights 
And he won't hold out my dough cause I'm a put out his lights 
And once the crew hits the stage the crowd gets involved 
We show love they show it back all problems solved 
You can boom shalock and jump to the sounds I pump 
But I ain't quitting 'til I'm shitting on Donald Trump 

So take heed to the verses and styles and versions 
When you socialize with other MCs 
And boast your rhymes to company enemies 
And in any cases that feel is what you want 
??? 
You want to make money money and take every honey 
Rap charges ain't funny but it boost your career 
Your penile style is now hanging from a tier 
Now you want to know fear to impress your peers 
Now your ass outta here the rap game goes on",Heart Full of Sorrow
House of Pain,"Chorus:
Killa Rhyme Klik keeps the function live
Heads treat my lovely on the 1-2-5
I might socialize if I dip and dive
'Cause it's the daily routine on which I thrive

I got platoons, I got regiments, I got battalions
I got ponies, I got mares, and I got stallions
I got planets, I got moons, and I got stars
I got jewelry, I got loot, plus I got cars
I got family, I got foes, I got an ally
It's the E man, you got priests and a rabbi
I got knowledge, I got wisdom, I got overstandin'
I got culture, freedom, you got a weakly meat
You have bless, you have blood, you have a sacrifice
You have guilt, you have shame, you got your soul on ice

Verse 1 (Everlast)
I say yes yes y'all, to the right beat
Get up everybody's 'bout to leap their feet
Get down everybody's 'bout to loose their seat
I be huntin' down crews like Pacino in Heat
Putting psychology in your biology, no scientology dianetic anaesthetic
You took bad advice, kid i'm mad precise
When it's time to get nice, i heat it up like spice

Verse 2 (Everlast)
Come on, let's be real, you only think you can deal
That's why i'm holdin' the steal, i rock shit to make you feel like
Damn that looks easy, maybe i can do it
So you take a fat beat and put your wack rhymes to it
And God only knows what can make you pursue it
For those who can't dance and clap your hands to it

(Chorus)

Verse 3 (Everlast)
You tell me you're the baddest and you get the most cream
But tell me what's the status of your self-esteem
Your frontin' on your jewels and your benz and your lex
All the bodies that you caught and all the females you sex
Yes yes y'all, true indeed, the sight of the world keeps me high on weed
Makes my eyeballs bleed but i must proceed
Yo that chick 's good lookin' but she's hooked on speed
Buy your first-row ticket, watch the vultures feed
Get your culture free from the lust and greed.

I can't hide the fact I want to ride ya
Body up and down and then back and forth 
Kind of like Aaliyah, girl, I want to see ya
Oh, you look good, honey bun, I can't fake it 
And word is bond I just got to get you naked 
And once you're naked I'm a lick your skin 
Then touch you in spots that ain't nobody else been
I'll kiss you down there when you're bare 
And I swear that I'll do it right 
I'll make it last all night

Poppin junk out your punk mouth makin bets

Makin' every mark that was out after dark 
Stick 'em for their loot  cut em up then I'd dash 
And when I had to shoot  I'd nutted up for the cash 
Ran down the block with my 45 glock 
Capped off a round  everybody hit the ground 
The next thing I heard was a siren 
Couldn't turn around  money grip kept firin' 
Runnin' for the ride  I can't go inside 
I'd rather that I died, I got too much pride 
I guess it's just somethin' that you can't understand 
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?

Ran with the gang, had all the homie's slang 
Grams to the quarters, I'm takin' all the orders 
Makin' all the runs, Rakin' in the funds 
I always got my gun, it's the old six-shooter 
King of the neighborhood, crazy white peckerwood 
Now people thinkin' Danny lost his mind 
It must've been from all the wine man and all the hardtimes 
Like chillin' in the park in the dark with the crew 
I'm always gettin' high, I saw my man die 
Now I got the work and the dough, 25 grand and a 5 keys of blow 
I gotta' relocate and start all over 
But watch it blow up like a supernova 
I keep my game in tight and follow the plan 
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?

I got myself locked down in the pen 
I ain't got a friend, so here I go again 
I gotta' get my props up and earn my respect 
Gotta' shake someone up or throw 'em off the top deck 
My time's runnin' out, I gotta' spill some blood 
If I don't do it quick, shit, my name'll be mud 
So I pick out a hardrock and rush him in his cell 
Beat his ass down and then say that he fell 
And if I gotta' do him, screw him, the convict's dead 
I'll stab him in the chest just to let the rest 
Of the cell block know that I'm nobody's ho 
My shanks in my hand so tell me who's the man?

And she said mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA

Well the note said Mrs Johnson you're wearin' your dresses way too high
And it's reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a bringin' up your little girl this way

Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
Well when you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Payton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

Houston,"Yeah, she said, ""You don't wanna do right"", yeah

Now I done stayed out all night
And now I'm walkin' in at four
She had a sign out on the front porch
Tellin' me that I don't live here no more

We had an argument, a fight now I was tryin' to work it out
Now I'm just a man not tryin' catch a case
So I do what a mans gotta do

She said, ""Maybe we should married
You should buy a ring
And I told her I can't make no promises today""
And you love me, love me not she driving me so crazy
I'm not ready to go that far

She said, ""Bye, bye, love""
She said, ""You don't live here no more
Unless you change your mind
You can pack them bags walk out the door
'cause you ain't livin' here no more, boy""

She said, ""Bye, bye, love""
She said, ""You don't live here no more
Unless you change your mind
You can pack them bags walk out the door
'cause you ain't livin' here no more, boy""

We been together now almost a year
And I tried my best to raise his son like he was my own kid
See, every time I turn around and look up it's gettin' weird
I don't wanna commit to her but I don't wanna let it go

She don't care nothing about my dreams she says there hobbies
And I should work a job and I should be content
I can't commit to her 'til she commits to herself
There ain't no appealin' I can hear her say, whoa

She said, ""Bye, bye, love""
She said, ""You don't live here no more
Unless you change your mind
(Change your mind)
You can pack them bags walk out the door

",Bye Bye Love
Houston,"Yeah, Its all good, I'm doing better without you (nooo)
Anyway, But its funny, we look just alike (just like you)

Verse 1:
Everyday that I look in the mirror
A reflection of someone I don't remember
But I heard that he was something special
To someone that I hold so dear to me (momma)
(She said he was a singer) Oh he could sing yeeaah
But he used it to abuse a lot of women
Now your seed was a he and that seed is now me
And I love my son (forever) and my son loves me (me)
And I know that its painful but I wish you could see

Chorus:
That a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways
Cause a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways

Bridge:
Was never there for me (no no)
How could you betray me
Broke up the family tree
What about me
What about me

Verse 2:
Now I hear that you wanna see me
But I can't let it go not that easy
See a man only knows what he feels
And I feel that I can't trust you
Keep it real, I don't need you
And I can't think that you would think I would ever be like you
Cause its sad that you're my dad
And I don't know you
Even when I see you
And to my son, I could never leave you

Chorus:
That a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways
Cause a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways

Breakdown:
You was never there
Probably didn't care
That you had a son
While you on the run
Never thought that twice of being in my life
Cause you broke a happy home
Why you leaving us aloneneva
Never gave a damn to find out who I am
Its to late for you to communicate
You was never there
Probably didn't care
That you had a son
While you on the run

Chorus:
That a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me on her all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways
Cause a man is what I am, Tho you didn't give a damn
When you left her on her own to raise me on her all alone
Its hard for me to hate ya when she says that I'm just like ya
So I'm praying everyday that God will change my ways

Don't make me, don't make me, don't make me
Turn out like him
Ohhhhh, never gonna be like you
Never gonna walk, talk like you noo

(And to all my sisters, I love ya'll!)

Houston Davis Jones,"I don?t know why
Or how we got this way
Just forget the things I said
Cause today?s a brand new day

Months move by slow
Autumn winds blow through the chimes
How can a second spent without you
Feel to me like a lifetime

I?ll be with you 
In good time

No tongue can tell
How we?ll fare this year through
If so much can change in hours and days
Who?s to say if I?ll know you?

But I?ll brave what comes
Though I?m sure we?ll stretch the ties
That forever stay connected to you
That are anchored in your eyes

We?ll see things through
In good time

I hope you hear this song
And that wherever you are
Know that I am always singing it for you
From the cliffs of this cold shore

And if you ever want to come
I?ll send a quarter note your way
You can ride it here and stay for a while
Or just visit for the day

In time we?ll see
Our hearts set free
And you won?t need me
In good time
",In Good Time
Houston Davis Jones,"We always think, 
We're more mature than that.
This time won't be like the others.
Then when it's time for us to get back
We always seem to have a setback or two

Why do we always feel compelled to return to this state
That we've been in before many a time'
Are our lives really that much better when we're together
Is it really worth the pain we put ourselves through

Or da da da da da da da

In my heart I'll always hold you as a closest friend
Who I will be always be for up until the end
And I know that this probably sounds cliche
But like so many other things what else can I say

Houston Jones,"I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Howard Alden,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Sie gehen auseinander
Statt einen Weg zu finden
Sie suchen nach Liebe und haben sie schon
Sie gehen dann vorüber
Statt einen Weg zu suchen

Wo gehe ich hin
Was mache ich dann?
Ob du wohl jetzt zuhause bist
Und nachdenkst
So wie ich

Was ist geblieben von deinem mich lieben
Von hundert Mal Ti Amo sagest du das nur so
Weil es dazu gehört Worte sind billig
Sind manchmal so billig

Man redet sich selber ein alles das muss so sein
Hast das auch du getan
Sinnliche Spiele und falsche Gefühle
Und nun willst du wieder ein neues Ziel finden
Willst dich nicht mehr an mich binden
Stehst da gepackt ist dein Koffer
Was gewesen ist gewesen

Dein Ti Amo dein schönes Ti Amo war nur Begleitmusik
für Sommertage mehr kam nicht in Frage
Und ich hab geglaubt das mit uns geht so weiter
Jetzt bin ich leider gescheiter
Aber ich kann nicht bestreiten
Dass es schön war ja so schön war

So geh den Weg du hast ihn selbst gewählt
Wenn dich hier nichts mehr hält
Ich werde leben auch ohne dich leben
Und werden die Tage für mich noch so schwer sein
Werden die Nächte auch leer sein
Irgendwann werd ich vergessen
Es wird Schluss sein denn es muss sein

Howard Fishman,"There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to in our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever from the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty but it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
Now you rush right through me and I start to drown

And there's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret that gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And that's the edge of sanity, I've never been this close
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost

Unknowing captor, you never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free?
I'm forever under lock and key as you pass through me

Now I see your face before me, I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free, the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch, I am no worse than most
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost",A Ghost
Howard Gospel Choir of Howard University,"1. There´s a battle cry being sounded near
By the royal army of the Lord.
Soldiers march to the rhythm of the Lord´s commands,
And this promise that is written in His word.

CHORUS:
We shall overcome, we shall triumph.
We shall stand in the victory as one.
Calvary´s hill´s been conquered by the Lord and King
So the victory is already won.

2. There are times so often in the battle´s rage
When the fighting will light the darkened sky.
That´s the time I focus on the Word of God
And can clearly read the final battle cry.

And much too long since love's been here

Now I know there's many questions runnin' through your mind
You're wondering have you felt true love this time
Have you found the one who cares, who will always be right there
I wrote this song just to ease your mind

And when I look into your eyes and say I love you, girl
That's how I feel, I'm for real {I'm for real}, hoo

They say in life you take a chance
And in love there's no guarantees
But the sweetest satisfaction comes from sharing our lives
And tearing down walls of mystery

What we share is special, it's mystical
There's magic when I look in your eyes
Oh, but this is no illusion, I never want to lose you
Say you'll be with me for the rest of my life, oh, girl

You're the fastest runner but you're not allowed to win
Some break the rules, and let you cut the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost

And you want her, and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can see the summit but you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle but you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured but you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain

And you want her, and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

Howard Jones,"And they made the secret pact
His knowledge would be tapped
The link was based on a respect
On their lives they would reflect
A perfect state of non-attachment
Was striven for and claimed as fact
The younger grew and learnt his lesson well
All his ideals were intact

Why look for the key in another
The answer lay in his own heart
Won't find yourself in some other
It always was there right at the start
But power it corrupted
That's where attachment starts
The power had erupted
The spell will crack
As each mental bond was broken
Strength grew in the young man's heart
What began as love not passion
Had left a seed in his heart

Why look for the key in another ...
",Why Look for the Key
Howard Jones,"I was walking down the street
With my old friend luke
And the strangest thing we saw
There was a flash like dynamite
And we fell down to the floor
And as we looked up this weird dude stood
I guess he was standing about four feet five
With a nonchalance and a joie de vivre
His face was grinning from side to side

Chorus
Well he said button up and tighten your lip
Keep a check on what you say
Those crazy words you fling from your mouth
Are going to bounce back on you some day

Now several years pass
I thought nothing more
It was down to a nine to five grind
I was shuffling round to my old friend's house
I had party on my mind
While chatting this chick
A guerilla muscled in
A brace of henchmen right behind
My blood boiled hard
I'll give you a piece of my mind
And this guy appeared by my side
Don't you know what he said

Chorus

I was walking down the street with my old friend luke
We were getting into a bit of a heavy scene
He say yes and I say no
He say what do you mean
I pulled my piece and he pulled his
We stared each other right in the eye
There was a flash like dynamite
And this guy appeared by our side

You are a specialty

Can't you like being you

Don't need to be a juror

Nobody ever seems to get it right
Even between friends there is a long gap
One of them makes a mistake, there is a fight

So we can end the rule of the division

'cause a few simple actions were not taken
There will be a time, time for the next world
Can't let the feelings be left unsaid

Chorus
Will you still be there when the night comes
The glory's over and the chill comes
When the night comes, will you still be there
Will you still be there when the night comes
Will you still be there?

When the world seems to fall apart for us
When all the hope has turned to desperation
How can we torture, torture the ones that we Love
Can't let the feelings be left unsaid

How many hearts have been broken
How many have been broken in two
'cause a few simple words had not been spoken
Not been spoken, no, no, no
There's a need to know that we're wanted
That we're wanted yeah, yeah, yeah
There's a need to know you care
Need to know who cares for you yes we do

Love like crazy juliet and romeo
Living only to consume
Bruising hearts collecting gloom
Seems no place to hide away
From the hammer and caress
Dress with passion
Fashion for the parking lot
Make some action
Pushing time out of the clock
Take away identity
Parcel up what's left of me
Water down the youthful drop
Call the sane insanity

All I want is to live with you
All I want is to cry with you

Dance til sunrise
Reggae til the cows come home
Fight the bigot
Champion you're not alone

Juggling the fear and doubt
Even when it's watertight

Whirling faster than the wind

We found as much as we wanted to find

Work in someone's scheme
Let a person find themselves not be part
Of a machine that worships power and wealth

Their due respect

Howard Jones,"There was a time when there was nothing at al
Nothing at all, just a distant hum
There was a being and he lived on his own
He had no one to talk to, and nothing to do
He drew up the plans, 
learnt to work with his hands
A million years passed by and his work was done
And his words were these...

Hope you find it in everything, 
everything that you see
Hope you find it in everything, 
everything that you see
Hope you find it, hope you find it
Hope you find me in you

So she had built her elaborate home
With it's ups and it's downs, 
its rains and its sun
She decided that her work was done, 
time to have fun
and she found a game to play

Then as part of the game
She completely forgot where she'd hidden herself
And she spent the rest of her time
Trying to find the parts

Hope you find it in everything, 
everything that you see
Hope you find it in everything,

Hope you find it, hope you find it

He tried to get the people to the safety of the door
There was no fire the voices were telling him what to do
You could see from his face he needs someone
To help pull him through

The voices are back they're telling him what to do
The voices are back they're telling him what to do

Ripping through the fabric between his world and the real
He's trying to protect you but
The knife will know that your flesh meets steel
Took him to an institution
And they helped the voices go away
But he didn't have the right set of papers
So they put this boy in jail

The voices are back they're telling him what to do
The voices are back they're telling him what to do

He was locked up for twenty-three hours a day
The warden found him in his cell
His only crime was that he was ill

Nowhere to handshake, nowhere to smile

Howard Jones,"He wasn't looking for a pretty face
She wasn't searching for the latest style
He didn't want someone who walked straight off the TV
She needed someone with an interior smile

She wasn't looking for a cuddle in the back seat
He wasn't looking for a five minute thrill
She wasn't thinking of tomorrow or of next week
This vacancy he meant to permanently fill

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Back in the world of disposable emotion
In the climate of temporary dreams
He wasn't looking for a notch on his bedpost
A love to push, pull and burst at the seams

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

This is love worth waiting for
Something special, something pure

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

This is love worth waiting for
Bitterness will die for sure
Something special, something pure
This is love worth waiting for

This is love worth waiting for
Bitterness will die for sure
Something special, something pure
This is love worth waiting for

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love",Everlasting Love
Howard Jones,"The old man said to me
Said don't always take life so seriously
Play the flute
And dance and sing your song

Try and enjoy the here and now
The future will take care of itself somehow
The grass is never greener over there
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone

Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away
Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away

The old man said to me
Said you can't change the world single handedly
Raise a glass enjoy the scenery
Pretend the water is champagne
And fill my glass again and again
While the wolves are gathering round your door
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone

Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away
Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away

The old man said to me
Said don't always take life so seriously
Play the flute
And dance and sing your song

Try and enjoy the here and now
The future will take care of itself somehow
The grass is never greener over there
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone

I tried to live my life in one day
Don't go speed your time away

I bit off more than I can chew
Only so much you can do

Wolves are gathering round my door
Ask them in and invite some more

I tried to live my life in one day
Don't go speed your time away

Don't try to live your life in one day",Life in One Day

People want to talk about the future
Don't want to linger on the past
Just want to reach to the real you inside
Forget cold glances and rejections
Leave the things that separate
Build on a trust that we can stand on

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well

So we can be one
We can be one together

Finding all are insecure
Opening the same door
Leaving out a stubborn pride
Seeing from another side

Howard Jones,"I've been waiting for so long
To come here now and sing this song
Don't be fooled by what you see
Don't be fooled by what you hear 

This is a song to all my friends
They take the challenge to their hearts
Challenging preconceived ideas
Saying goodbye to long standing fears

Don't crack up, bend your brain, see both sides
Throw off your mental chains

I don't want to play by the rules 
Not under the thumb of the cynical few
Or laden down by the doom crew",New Song

Been there all the time and he almost knew
And the fear goes on shadows
And the tear flows on for nothing
Under his nose was a dream come true 
Thoughts of people in misfortune stopped him doing things well
His duty was to use it  left his pearl in the shell

Howard Jones,"You have watched me, safe in your anonymity
I have dreamed you, held in your security
Some people believe a photograph traps your mortal soul

And you captured me
I need you to take control
I am a prisoner of no confidence
You've entered me now make me whole

Every place I go I feel your lenses trained on me
This distant concentration takes away my energy
Your image burns it's negative
Behind my waking eyes
Then the night comes and you stalk your prize
And you captured me
I need you to take control

We weathered rough storms together
Couldn't conceive of the end
When I heard of your leavin'
It came as a shock and surprise
Like the deepest kinds of love
Lost on the inside
Locked right on the inside

What is the greatest expression of love,
To let go and wish well
But all these finer feelings 
have left me with tears to tell

I couldn't be the one to hold you stop you go
It is like stripping the soul
Letting all the finest pieces go
You know these feelings between us
Could not be expressed
You will never know my old secrets
They are so deeply felt they are so deeply felt

What is the greatest expression of love
To let go and wish well
But all these finer feelings have left me
What is the greatest expression of love,
To let go and wish well

I've seen you change
I've seen it coming slowly, these changes

What are the things important to you?
Can't be the money
Well I got news for you

Two souls (should be two souls together)
Two souls (in the life that we planned)
But you're working obsession is squeezing me

I'd rather live in a doll's house in a small street
Where it always rains
You kid yourself you're working all for me
But older kids play with bigger trains

It's not too late to turn 'round

Howard Jones,"You got the socket and I got the plug
I am the floor and you are the rug
I got the rhythm you got the beat
We feel it shake us from our souls to our feet

And you know I Love you
You know I Love you...don't you

You got the metal and I got the die
We make a structure that no one can deny
I need you and you need me
I need your honey like a flower needs a bee

You know I Love you
You know I Love you...don't you

No one is an island on that you can depend
A person on his own is a sinking ship
It will be that way til the time will end

Now don't you worry when things get tough
We'll stick together through the smooth and the rough
Your the steam engine and I am the tracks
Roll over me I'll be rolling right back 'cause




",You Know I Love You...Don't You?
Howard Jones,"Some people I know have given up on their lives
Drowning their sorrows, and mumblin', and forgot the fight
We can tip the balance we can break those barriers down
Little things count as much as the big and turn it all around

And it's oh, don't always look at the rain
No, don't look at the rain

Some people I know have lost their feel for mystery
They say everything has got to be proved, this isn't a nursery
And joseph who's five years old, stops fights in his playground yard
No more fights and bigotry, oh is it so hard

And it's oh, don't always look at the rain
No, don't always look at the rain
Ha, don't always look at the rain

And tell me, is it a crime to have an ideal or two
Evolving takes it's time, we can't do it all in one go
Doesn't have to drive us all mad, we can only do our best
Let the mind shut up, and the heart do the rest

If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find

You find a love like this once in your life
A diamond in your hand not a piece of glass
Picture you
Looking back on what you've
Done to lose all this time

If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go
If the sea should turn dry don't let him fly don't say goodbye
If the planets collide don't run and hide change his mind

Howard Jones,"Soon the warm night breezes roll on in
A steamy blanket for the shore
This is streetlight time
You said you were mine
So the fool believes
What the night conceives

The light of love is in your eyes
Is in your smile again
Is in your life again

Was a time when love grew cold for you
Turned your back on memories

I was there for you
I will see you through
Darkest hours fade
The promises we made
Were not the kind to fade away
We'll face another day
We'll face another day
When that was yesterday

Will the ocean rollers bring you home
Or will they take you out to sea
This is real-time
And you are still mine
The fool that loves his dreams
Breaks the cruelest schemes

The light of love is in your eyes
Is in your smile again
Is in your life again
Back in your smile again
Back in your life again

If you love
You know you're gonna feel the hurt
See the flowers
Growin' from the muddy earth

You never see the sun
You're never gonna feel the rain
With your life under glass
In the middle lane
You'll never feel the joy
Never feel the pain

Chorus

Try to build a house on top of the highest tree
It's dangerous and a bit risky
But what about the view
See the clouds and the mountains too

Chorus

Get your hands dirty
Get a little insane
Come out and play with me
Barefoot in the rain

If you love
You know you're gonna feel the hurt
(feel the joy, feel the pain)
See the flowers
Growin' from the muddy earth
(you see the sun and then you see the rain)

You never see the sun
You're never gonna feel the rain
With your life under glass
In the middle lane
You'll never feel the joy
Never feel the pain

If you love
You know you're gonna feel the hurt

See the flowers
Growin' from the muddy earth

Howard Jones,"If you find a time when things just seem to fall apart
And there's no way to keep a cheery face
When the sight of your own reflection only breaks your heart
And all your dreams have given up the chase

Pick up the telephone
You know I'm always home
Any old time of night or day
Let me be the first to know
Let me be the first to know
Let me be the first to know

If you find a time when you just have to walk away
Because of a call to pastures new
You're in need of some fresh words to wish you on your way
You need to fly on up and touch the moon

Sharing this temporary weight
No time to hesitate
I will be everything you need
Let me be the first to know
Let me be the first to know
Let me be the first to know
Let me be the first ...

We're water breaking on an endless wave
Potential bursting from the sea
Compassion is what sets our minds apart
Be cheerful when you break
The chains of morality

Howard Jones,"Bring me down to earth
Take this weight from tired shoulders
Kiss me tenderly
Let me drown in waves of your love

You part the trees so I
Can cherish things that matter
Your single voice sounds through
A room of din and chatter
Oh take me home
When the streetlights shine above

Safe in your arms
So simple to me
Safe in your arms
Oh so temporary
Safe in you arms
Oh so tenderly
Not one of the lonely tonight

Flying hectically
Through a cloud of buts and maybes
Passing frantically
Over nights and days unended

You turn my head and laugh
When my world turns sour
You give me strength to pass
Through my darkest hour
Oh take me home
When the streetlights shine above

What steals the force from your life

They can be broken

The greatest faults can be beaten
The grandest problems defeated
Impossible choices completed
Infinite pain will be treated
Only fear can stand

We make our space and time
We make the weather

Hell is not somewhere but a state of mind I choose to be
When my faith in life has gone
Cruelty rebounds to hurt itself puts shackles on the free
Vicious circle carries on
Hold the sky, feet on the floor

We make our sun to shine
We make our space and time
We make the weather
We make it change
We make the weather
We make it change

Time to judge the act don't judge the actor of the circumstance
Time to free compassion's world

Needing this freedom today
On the night when lovers confess

Chilling winds will blow through this heart
And won't let me rest
Matchwood bridges are doin' their best

Love that was sent to me
In the land of troubles and peace

What's his philosophy?

You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary

So who am I so nervous and shy
To be brilliant and talented
It's the light not the dark that frightens us most
And the power lies in our head
You playin' small doesn't help at all
The world need the things you give
Switch yourself on, turn the pressure on

There are times when I think there's plenty in this world

I still have your letter, I know every line
I hope this ain't coming from way out of the blue

Howard Jones,"I love you whether or not you love me
I love you even if you think that i don't
Sometimes i find you doubt my love for you, but i don't mind
Why should i mind, why should i mind

What is love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway

Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why i don't mind you doubting

And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
The door always must be left unlocked
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
And not to spend the time just doubting",What Is Love? [Trouser Enthusiasts Club Mix]
Howard Jones,"Put that finger back to my lips
Will I taste of sugar of cold wet stone?
Hope the shell will break on a paper dinner plate
Ooh, not a headstone

How long does it take to change the man?
How much sun to melt a frozen life?
How long will it take for the mask to slip
And find a way to mend this broken heart?

I’ve said too much, I’ve opened up
I’ve spilled my guts
I can’t go back, no I won’t go back
No I shouldn’t ever go back to you

Push your finger into my ribs
Am I made of honey? Am I made of bone?
Scrape your nails over my skin
To find how many layers I’m wrapped in

How long does it take to change the man?
How much sun to melt a frozen life?
How long will it take for the mask to slip

A strange new alchemy produces the gold
A local warming of a frozen ghost
A homeless entity returned to the host

Howard Jones,"I’ve known you since you were a girl
When things just didn’t work out for you
I said don’t crack up and see both sides
But you kept on blaming the world for everything

I tried to tell you that you were in control
But you didn’t seem to listen to a word I say
But I’m never giving up, giving up on you
I try to help you see the world in a different way

Hey, yeah, just look at you now
Riding on a silver wave
That keeps on going

Through the sun and through the rain
Through the good and the bad times
Through the joy and through the pain
Hey, look at you now
See what you’ve become

Now look me in the eye, now and tell me straight
Did you find it hard to tell me everything
I said things can only get better dear
But they won’t if you don’t lift a finger to help me

What’s the point in taking this human form
If we can’t understand the point of living here
Who would ever want to live alone
Without sharing this world with everyone and everything

Just look at you now
Riding on a silver wave
That keeps on going

Through the sun and through the rain
Through the good and the bad times
Through the joy and through the pain

It's another day, I've got to find a better way
Won't you help me?

Failing that

I just wanna change my world but from the inside
I just wanna live my life

Here in the cold light of day, this vision
Paints a different world, a world of the heart
And I want to live there

I've been on the run from all the people I've become
I want to shed this skin and start it all again
I want to draw a line in the sand for one last time

When you cross that line, there's no turning back
When you cross that line, don't come knocking at my door

Everyone has got to take some responsibility
The grass is rarely bluer, but you wouldn't take it from me
Finding out the hard way can be an endless affair
I'd stop you if I could, but then again, I wouldn't dare

I'm telling you when I say these words, that
They're not spoken in bitterness
That destructive emotion has long ago left
And these tears that cleanse the soul and let me
Start afresh

When you cross that line, we are no more
We are no more

But you know that pathways must be followed to near destruction
There are those who move clouds

Heard it murmured in a far off crowd
Those who move clouds

There are those who will patronise and compromise your position
They can't feel the forceful hand of
Predetermined destination
There are those who move clouds

Heard it murmured in a far off crowd
Those who move clouds

I can feel the forceful hand
And it won't let me change direction no
And there's this hunger inside of me
And it won't and it won't no it won't stop it's aching
And I can feel it inside of my head the forceful hand

O come, let us adore him

Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning

Now in flesh appearing
O come

Howard Lawrence,"Helpless is all I can feel
There's a plate in my head of reinforced steel
Have patience they said
We've done all we can this time
I know it's wrong to hang your hat on a rack that don't belong
But I was too young to realize the world wasn't mine
When will the fog clear?
To feel alive again I'll say goodbye and disappear
How do these things happen?
Maybe I'm just color blind

They tried in vain to save his tender ego
But she found a way to punish him with bullets and arrows
They traded for the standard replacement
Then left him in shock in the basement
His hair in disarray

They told me things they knew were false
And never tried to fight the impulse
Spent many days and nights behind the curtain
Paralyzed with fear as they made their moves
The pain's still sharp-it lingers on
They left me with nothing but things to prove

Too stoned to find the door
So he curls up frightened on the floor
Winter passes while he's away
The doctors and nurses have nothing to say

Take back my soul now
All I see is red
When I'm lost I'm found
Back in bed
Researchers can chart my decline
I wanna be brave
And take a dive off the coast to test the waves
When I'm too far from the shore would you throw me a line?
Put my trust in science
That's the honest way back to self-reliance
The lights have changed
This man's no longer color blind

He opened up the drawer to find the letter
It said she had to get away for something better
Their program enhanced his understanding

Howard Lawrence,"Never was groomed to ride like a cowboy
Much more at home in a cyberspace lab
For fifteen minutes of fame and fortune
I'd blow my cover
What choice would I have?

But look at me now I'm a real disaster
Catch me on Twitter-the clues are there
Nothing we build is sacred here
The more we suffer the less they care

Plant the seed and then withdraw
Let it learn-then exploit the flaws
And when the kids log on on the weekend
They'll be part of this cause
Better warn your people, better watch your back
My shadow just coughed up this digital scream attack

Year after year this addiction grows
One day I'll be on my knees
Crawling through holes is my new purpose
Crack the code the firewall bleeds

Scan your drives...your fragmented folders
Encrypt your sensitive information
I'll just double down and recruit more soldiers
Protégés from the next generation

The black seed wants to grow from within
Cat, mouse. who's gonna win?
And when the laptops grind to a halt
You'll never find what the cat brought in
Pull the servers offline so we don't get tracked
My shadow just coughed up this digital scream attack

Pop my pills in the shower
A green one every hour

Download that streaming video
Pass around your audio clips
Spread my germ to your home network
Kiss the girl with tainted lips

My iPhone buzzed 7:30 this morning
They shot me a message I couldn't ignore
This might sound like deranged paranoia
But no one could explain what the app was for

You're locked out now-it won't let you in
The cat can only watch as the mouse plays gin
And when the kids log on on the weekend
You'll never know where they've been
Didn't warn your people
now they're not coming back

Mistakes were buried in the yard
You rode me way too hard
All the way down",Digital Scream Attack
Howard Lawrence,"Someone let you down
Dealt you a hand you couldn't play out
Made you afraid of life
Gave you a reason for raising your knife
But something brought you here
You don't know what it is or whether it's real
Like hourglass sand you're falling through space
Searching for clues so you know what to chase

Don't look around for a four leaf clover
Don't get attached to your fortune cookie
Nothing can save you from drowning your faith
Or hatching a plot for the ultimate escape
But everything you need is there staring back at you
Once you let go of the enemy inside
Everyone's waiting, we're all here to catch you
So give yourself a gift-let go of the enemy inside

Swimming against the tide
You put your thumb out and got taken for a ride
Lost all your dignity
The audience laughed at your pleas for humanity
Sometimes it helps to eat dirt
With a newborn's perspective you'll rarely get hurt
Just keep one eye open in case of attack
'Cause even your friends can put a gun to your back

Don't be surprised when the storm flies over
Don't burn the leaves on your neighbor's timetable
Nothing can keep you from losing your touch
Dark chocolate everyday?
Hmmm, that's a bit too much!
When all you need is me in there staring back at you
You can let go of the enemy inside
Don't keep us waiting for you to decide
Listen to your heart-let go of the enemy inside

Haven't you made a big fool of yourself?
Even a blind man can see you need help

Remind me to book the next date
So you can rediscover what's been left on your plate
Show you the rhythm machine
If you get up and dance there's a chance you'll be seen
Leave your computer alone
It's a crutch and you know it-your chair ain't a throne
How long has it been?
Such a long time to waste
Put the glass to your lips-all you need is one taste",The Enemy Inside
Howard Lawrence,"Bless the mind of a quiet child
Give him a reason to crack a smile
He may not be a happy boy
But there are moments he may enjoy

Winter clothes from the discount bin
A weary face shows where he's been
The teachers miss his pleas for help
He wishes he were someone else

That's why he's so far from heaven
Already three steps behind
Too many lonely boys learn things the hard way
You can't rule the playground on your own terms
Every miscalculation costs you one turn

Goes to work with hopeful eyes
Wants to get noticed, that's no surprise
Enters the meeting with fresh ideas
Makes it look easy outgunning his peers

He feels resentment as the group walks by
They laugh at him but who knows why?
Eats his lunch alone in the park
The little girl stares and it breaks his heart

That's why he's so far from heaven
Can't leave his odd ways behind
Some people dig trenches, they always learn the hard way
You can't win them over on your own terms
But that's the only way to go if you've got the nerve

He runs upstairs to see who's there but never in time
The telephone rings till he picks up—another dead line
Kicks the wall and grits his teeth then pours some more red wine
Deal with it! 

Friday night he hits the clubs
With cash in his pockets lookin for love
Scans the room for a friendly face
A chance to show off his style and taste

Stands aloof at the end of the bar
Nervously jangling the keys to his car
A beautiful woman glances his way
He wants to move in but has nothing to say

That's why he's so far from heaven
Couldn't solve the mystery girl again
So many lonely men gotta learn the hard way
You can't crash the party on your own terms

Howard Lawrence,"Give yourself a glimpse of the new world order
Come in then lock the gates
I'm the fat cat in charge
Who lets the inmates date the guards

This may not be a pleasant thing to watch
Never thought I'd find religion here
But got hooked on single malt Scotch

How do we survive?
We haven't found the secret yet
Chasing friends online is all we know
And to really get creative we beat ourselves senseless
Why don't we just pack our bags and go?

Gotta get to the airport
22 miles to catch that plane
If the shadow jumps that wall again
I might just go insane
The end of what I love is near
Who can fly this bird with broken wings?
Across the pond they're betting against
The next savant that we crowned king

Dark circles frame his eyes
Uploads the database that tracks his known failures
When friends arrive he polishes his act
The change is subtle—otherwise he cracks
He swears he's safe but shrinks from reality
Why won't he expose his self-loathing malady?

We're running in place here
Wasting all these gifts to make ends meet
No wonder we're lost
This brilliant master plan was never even our idea
But we subsidize it's cost

You can bring your dog to see me
But don't expect to rid him of his fleas
We buff the patient's chart here
His treatment just might trigger a new disease

Whaddawe expect them to do?

Here's my wish list-you'll notice it's ten pages long

My world is a sacred place
My views are in focus and highly evolved
So what makes you think I'm for sale?

You can drop the pop psychology

Who can believe all this straightjacket logic?
When people say they're schizophrenic
Aren't they neurologic?

Searching for clarity
Focusing on inner sounds

What's the fighting all about?

Blame the ugly side effects on all this medication
I know I'm only schizophrenic
But who needs such aggravation?

Freedom is something none of us has
So we lie to ourselves
Have you ever noticed?
They keep me in a lab conducting the most invasive tests
My behavior makes them nervous
Maybe they've got things to hide?
My plan is to check myself out involuntarily
Her smile will light my path
See, I've done all the higher math…

Needing just to be with her without raising expectations
One wet kiss would be enough to energize my sensations
But then I remember who I really am

I'll do my best to make him stay.

And in a little while, he'll take my hand

I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'

I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream

That you'll make love to me

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,

Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Howard McGillin,"Now the parking lot is empty
Everyone's gone someplace
I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed
A cooler and a 2-day suitcase
Cause there's a place we like to drive
Way out in the country
Five miles out of the city limit we're singing
And your hand's upon my knee

So we're okay
We're fine
Baby I'm here to stop your crying

Chase all the ghosts from your head
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart
Adding up the total of a love that's true
Multiply life by the power of two

You know the things that I am afraid of
I'm not afraid to tell
And if we ever leave a legacy
It's that we loved each other well
'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people
Trying on the treasures of youth
But a road that fancy and fast ends
Ends in a fatal crash
And I'm glad we got off
To tell you the truth

'Cause we're okay
We're fine
Baby I'm here to stop your crying
Chase all the ghosts from your head
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart
Adding up the total of a love that's true
Multiply life by the power of two

All the shiny little trinkets of temptation
(Make new friends)
Something new instead of something old
(But keep the old)
All you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface
(But remember what is gold)
And it's fools gold
(What is gold)
Fools gold
(What is gold)
Fools gold

Now we're talking about a difficult thing
And your eyes are getting wet
I took us for better and I took us for worse
Don't you ever forget it
Now the steel bars between me and a promise
Suddenly bend with ease
The closer I'm bound in love to you
The closer I am to free

So we're okay
We're fine
Baby I'm here to stop your crying
Chase all the ghosts from your head
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart

Multiply life by the power of two",Power of Two
Howard Morrison,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

It don't take good vision, huh, to see what any fool could see

That I just need your body, I just need your f-f-face 
Right where it counts - no, not in another place

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Howard Roberts,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves

Thank you for all the joy and pain.
Picture shows, second balcony was the place we'd meet,
Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet.

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen,
Thank you for funny cards from Spain.
I recall Central Park in fall how you tore you dress,
What a mess, I confess that's not all.

Danke schoen, darling danke schoen,
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane.
I can see hearts carved on a tree
Letters intertwined for all time.
Yours and mine, that was fine.

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

With nothing fancy
Nothing much

People in the cemetery, them are all alone
Some turn to dust, and some have bone
I'd rather be dead, six feet in my grave
Than to live lonely, each and every day
She came home this morning, I asked her where had she been?
She said don't ask me no question daddy, because I'll be leaving again

That's why, that's why I've got to find me, Lord I've go to find me a part time love

I sit at home and wonder why
Ever since you said goodbye
I felt so all alone
Every time it rains
And summer showers soak the ground
I watch the rain come pouring down

I hang my head and want to die
And I don't seem to care that 
I'm just not making it on my own
Every time it rains

Sometimes late at night
I close my eyes
And pretend that you're here with me 
But every time it rains
I realize just how lonely my life is going to be

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above

And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in forty-seven
A twister came and stripped them clean

He lost the farm and lost his family
He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found a family Bible

And he came to work the land
He came to ease my Daddy's burden
And he came to be my friend

Howie Day,"The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find
You and I collide

I'm quiet you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find
You and I collide

Don't stop here
I've lost my place
I'm close behind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find
You and I collide

You finally find
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide",Collide

Calling you from a northern sky

Howie Day,"There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup

While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and reliefHey now, hey now

Howie Day,"Lately after dark
I've been wandering through the park
With the angry words you said
Wandering through my head

There's nothing I can do
To keep from feeling like I blew
The only chance I had to make it better

The shadow on the wall
Is looking down from 10 feet tall
And I wonder what it sees
As I stumble through the streets

To never feel alone
It seemed written down in stone
But now it's all I can do
To try and forget her

40 hours and counting
I could shut my eyes
And sleep here

Warning comes and goes
And I'm tangled in the throes
In the stillness of my room
And the bandage on my wound

My heart becomes a bird
She said freely, just a word
And now I'm wishing
That I had never met her

40 hours and counting
I could shut my eyes
And sleep here

People rushing by
Out the corner of my eye
A kaleidoscope of bloom
A mirror broke in two

A thousand little stars
And a million little wars
Scattered out upon the open desert

40 hours and counting
I shut my eyes
And sleep here

A world is set ablaze
By a never ending haze
And you're closer than a tear
I see you ever clear

The rush is in the veins
And there's nothing else to blame
But every minute
Every hour, every second

40 hours and counting
I shut my eyes
And sleep here
Shut my eyes and sleep to dream

Lately after dark
I've been wandering through the park
With the angry words you said
Wandering through my head

There's nothing I can do
To keep from feeling like I blew
The only chance I had to make it better",40 Hours
Howie Day,"When the morning came I was up before first light,
And Your bed was made you must have cut out sometime lastnight,
My heart beat started pounding out riddle in my brain,
Voice from deep inside said got to be insane,
Everyone knows how this old story goes,
Got in my taxi and drank my conscience away,

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight,
Start livin, out with the old, I'm on the up,
Must be the good life

I went to your friends house begged you to open the door,
With Your hands on your hips you spoke while I sat down on the floor,
Two dishes in the kitchen sink, the way you treat me when you drink,
You don't look so superior when you give your opion,
Don't think I don't know how you act on your own,
Just who are those names on your cell phone anyway,

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight,
Start livin, out with the old, I'm on the up,
Must be the good life,

Its the cool breeze on the setting sun,
The New Year's , The 4th, wrapped into one,
You make me want to be someone that you could look up too,

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight,
Start livin, out with the old, I'm on the up,
Must be the good life,

Come on get love,
Come on and try,
Come on now what are you waiting for?

(repeat 4x)

Come on...

Howie Day,"Is it dark, where you are?
Can you count the stars where you are?
Do you feel like you are a thousand miles from home?

Are you lost, where you are?
Can you find your way when you're so far?
Do you fear, where you are?
A thousand nights alone

So here we are set into motion
We'll steal a car and crash in the ocean
You and I, caught in a fading light
On the longest night

It's enough, just to find love
It's the only thing to be sure of
So hard, to let go of
A thousand times or more
I was close to a fault line
Heaven knows, you showed up in time 
Was it real?
Now I feel, like I'm never coming down

So here we are, set into motion
Steal a car, crash in the ocean
You and I, caught in a fading light
On the longest night

I recall when we were together
Even now it seems like forever
So alive caught in a fading light
On the longest night

Can we go too far to find, what is waiting here?
A little fall from grace
On the longest night

Did we go too far to find, what is waiting here?
We'll take a little time, to open again

Is it dark where you are?
Can you count the stars where you are?",Longest Night
Howie Day,"We had it all we were, young lovers, we were full of trust and faith 
We were dead set on makin' it last forever, forever and a day. 
I recall it was fall last year when, it started to die. 
You standing still as the temperature kills, the summer's thrills that were keeping it alive. 
The days got colder so I held you closer, in an effort to save us from time, 
Almost like a wind came and ruined the spark and left us in the dark. 

But hey, I coulda told you that I loved you and stayed, 
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late, 
On my return and now you've lost all faith. 
And I am the liar, 
I'm no longer what you require. 

I still feel you at night, turning in the sheets when I turn out the light 
That's how it goes, the ghost of your first love wont ever leave you til the day that you die 
I wont ever live down leaving her behind even if the choice was the right one 
It was a good thing staring me right in the face but I turned and ran away. 

Hey, I coulda told you that I loved you and stayed, 
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late 
On my return and now you've lost all faith. 
And I am the liar, 
I'm no longer what you require. 

Back then the days were so much faster, 
We were young, stubborn, and in love with disaster. 
You know you can't go back even if you try, 
You better just forget her won't you close the door on me 
Cause it'll never be the same 
It'll never be the way it was before 

Well hey, I coulda told you that I loved you and stayed, 
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late, 
On my return and so you've lost all faith. 
And I am the liar, 
Oh hey- I woulda told you that I loved you and stayed 
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late

Let the ink scream along

I need you right now
I want you right now
I need you right now.

And I hate the way I write.

Sometimes its better to stay out all night.

Howlin Rain,"Goodbye, Ruby, watch you winding
Down these snake trails that roll like rain drops in the dust
Windy woman, blown my cover
I sit here all alone but I would never sing this kind of song

Wicked dreams
Down drowning streams
Of blood and other wild schemes
That play like mold for the rust

Swallow's wings
And other old and tattered things
The dull and fade of wedding rings
Now this song is one of those

There's fire in these hills, closer every day
The wind calls the hangman to my name
My father said the ocean would beat upon my grave
And that on that day I would long for my home
And it's family stone

Here I am waiting in watercolor gray
I'll wait for you or Jesus or any other technicolor day
Howling dogs at the dust cloud walls
Snapping at the heels of death
To share with them a piece of the catch

I long to see the Banyan trees or any other place
Where the waves are made of thunder
And the seabirds clean the blood from off my feet

Oh, wicked ocean made my heart a beggar
The crabs that ride the jet streams
Are picking out the eyes of my dreams

The fire in these hills gets closer every day
The wind calls the hangman to my name
My brother said the wild world would feed upon my skin
And that on that day I would long for the farm
And an honest simple faith

The majesty of insect wings
And the brittle of their bones
Reminds me of a tropic wind
Blowing through the skull of our home

Ruby, I chased your laughter with elephant wings
You left me for the law
Left me bones for the grave

Childish beauty, Sunday charm
All has made a ghost of me, spirit dead, shackled arms
As I hung the wind whipped your wild name
And pierced the heart of a fading ghost
For seabirds only death upon the plain

The blood that beats this heart is blood upon the floor
Ruby you lead the hangman to my door
My mother said a woman would be the death of me
And that on that day no god would hear
An outlaw's dying prayer

",Goodbye Ruby
Howlin Rain,"I caught a glimpse of your body by the river
I was alone and the sky went forever
I was the one that killed your father in the first world war
I once vowed to love your sister for a lifetime
Took her to the altar and left her like a wind chime
That was the dawning of the age of the cannibal world

Lord have mercy on my soul, have mercy Lord
Mama, have mercy on my soul

I took your wild peacocks down to the sawmill
And ground their bones into dust and blood meal
A rainbow of feathers and shame fell upon my wicked hand
Lucy, my love, get inside my Grand Torino
I tell you little girl don't go into the jungle
There's a million hungry insects there
And man, they're going to eat you alive, yes, they will

Lord have mercy on my soul, have mercy Lord
Mama, have mercy on my soul

Cold dead moon don't stare at me
With your bony judgmental eye
Only the peacocks and earthly things
Can judge me as they pass by
Can judge me as they pass through this world
Judge me as they pass by
Lord, he has my number under the thunder in his hand

",Lord Have Mercy
Howlin Rain,"Carry me back into the sand
Into the sand with the flowers and the fern
Old Mr. Centipede climbing tobacco leaves
Looking for livers and hearts for to eat

Cold and gray clouds staining the sounds
Straining the weight of a sorrowful sky
Wool on the trees, dust on the eves
The bark on the pines is worse than its bite

All of the lines have been lies this far
There is a feeling I must keep from you

The hills of nomads, we envy their lives
A picture we love, hills have eyes
This old motel song you dig when you're stoned
But sounds like a cheap shot
When you're sober and cold

But if you are
As stoned as a ghost in the snow
Your eyes will be blue flames

These lines are crawling snakes up your open legs
You wear them pale and fine
This is the line I'll give you true as the dawn
While the furious eye on the sun is upon us

The way your breasts dance while we're making love
Now that is a line penned by a divinely guided hand

Tailwind carry the birds to the coast
To watch the clouds roll along
Pollen and pitch whisper the scripture
Of kings in a tongue only spoken by ghosts

",Nomads
Howlin Rain,"Did you fall in love with the cannon's fire?
And the smell of a smoldering world
In the bloody sand where lead flies like insects through the air
This is just a moment of confusion, birds like a lattice to the sun
You calculate the simple execution by the silent run
Of the numbers in our blood

You don't have to go through any more changes, it's all done now
You don't have to break the wild horses that run you and run you down
You don't have to untangle the bells that jingle and chime and charm you
You don't have to change, you don't have to hold onto your past
You don't have to carry it down this path, it's all part of the deal

In the pitch of the night is a stranger, strange as the shadow by your side
It calls to your mind a face you haven't called upon for years
Once you were a magnificent fiend, eyes like electric eels
An executioner of the highest degree
Here you are family sweet torturer in the arms of the secret world
A piano plays to the vague erosion of the day

You don't have to go through any more changes, it's all done now
You don't have to break the wild horses that run you and run you down
You don't have to untangle the bells that jingle and chime and charm you
You don't have to change, you don't have to hold onto your past
You don't have to carry it down this path, it's all part of the deal

",El Rey
Howlin Rain,"These are not thieves come to take your ruby ring
They are not ghosts with tales too long
It's the sound of dancing of many legged things
That gather your tears from off the ground

Our home is a feast love moving from the land
We're swaying swamp reeds in the sand
It's a cold feeling that hangs about our bones
When we ride the death's head waters like leaves

Take my arrow, the last one I got
Wait for the wind to take your shot
Maybe tomorrow you'll leave another tombstone
Made of sand and moss

Here's my teeth, mama, do you want them back
To tear the woven web and wires that bind you?
I killed a man and I'd kill a country full
To keep the rusted boat beneath your feet

Our days are numbered too but not outnumbered yet
While I see you laughing at the sun
The stars lay on your naked skin, the moon was on your breast
When a hail of arrows fell upon us

Take my shell of buckshot the last one I got
Wait for the wind and take your shot
Maybe tomorrow we'll leave two sunken tombstones
With the silt and moss

Can you take aim at my enemies?
I can't see them anymore
I will fire blindly into the trees and hope I hit someone's god
Or three of some kind of ghost

These are our times, mama, made of blood and bone
Furious misfortune is upon us
We had a run of luck and ran it to the ground
It calls our lives from the darkness

I see you with burning eyes, burning with my tears
I hate, I hate to see your fear
I'll leave a hundred bodies rotting in the sun
And when my final bullet flies I'll be gone
I'll be with my love upon the Styx river

",Riverboat
Howlin' Wilf,"By Mary McCreary

I've been working so hard,
Just came home from my job.
Looked down in my wallet,
Good God, I've been robbed.


Now where can my money be,
All my hard-earned pay?
What am I going to do now?
I got my bills to pay.


You got me singin' the blues,
And I'm paying all my dues.
You got me singin' the blues,
Ain't got nothing to lose.


I got to tell you I got the blues down in my pockets.
People, what did I say?
Bills are gonna rob me tomorrow,
Why I need my ten dollars today.


Chorus

Ain't no way to get even
Because, you know what I mean,
Every time I make me some money
Somebody's going to take it from me.

'Cause somethin' wrong
In your home

Well, if ya call her on the telephone
And she answers awful slow
Grab the first train smokin'
If you have to hobo

That's evil
Evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' ya brother
You better watch your happy home

If you make it to your house
Knock on the front door
Run around to the back
You'll catch him just before he go

That's evil
Evil is goin' on
I am warnin' ya brother
You better watch your happy home

She cussed and cried and said I'd lied, and wished that I was dead.
Lay that pistol down, babe, lay that pistol down,
Pistol-packin' mama, lay that pistol down.

I was raisin' cane in a cabaret, dancin' with a blond,
'Till one night she shot out the light, and Bang! that blond was gone.
Lay that pistol down, babe, lay that pistol down,
Pistol-packin' mama, lay that pistol down.

I'll see you every night babe, I'll love you every day,
I'll be your regular daddy, just put that gun away.
Lay that pistol down, babe, lay that pistol down,
Pistol-packin' mama, lay that pistol down.

Well the moral of this story is, if you wanna have some fun,
Make sure your sweet mama, don't have a loaded gun.
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe, lay that pistol down,
Pistol-packin' mama, lay that pistol down.
Lay that pistol down, babe, lay that pistol down,

Hoyt Axton,"She was three days late, two dollars short
And her eyes were red and blinkin'
Betty La Rue took a downer or two
And then she started drinkin'

Reverend Lee he was down on his knees
He was prayin' while she was sinkin'
Betty La Rue had a bottle or two
Just to ease the pain of thinkin'

I was out back by the railroad track
When I heard the preacher sayin'
""Betty La Rue, you know, the trouble with you
Is you never spent enough time prayin'""

[Chorus]
And she said, ""Back off, man
Don't you understand?
I'm oh, so tired of cryin',
Lost my child and my man's in jail
And I'd just as soon be dyin'""

Oh, the Preacher called for Doctor Hall
And the good man he came flyin'
He looked in her eyes and he held her hand
And he said, ""This poor girl's dying.""

Betty La Rue had a guilt or two
And she know she was in danger
When a light in the skies hit her right in they eyes
And she saw a shining stranger

[Chorus]

The shining man seemed to understand
And his eyes were clear and steady
He held his hand, like a natural man
He said, ""We'll go when you're ready""

Betty La Rue didn't know what to do
And her heart was filled with sorrow
But, she took his hand to the promised land
Where she found a bright tomorrow

The Doctor sighed and said, ""She's died!""
But, we did our best to save her
There's no one to blame, it's a crying shame
The raw deal that life gave her.""

That she brings me water.

Down in Mexicali.
And if you don't have water
Boy, you'd better not go.

Across that desert.

Is drivin' me insane.
Knowin' she's waitin',
And I can't get there.
God only knows that I wracked my brain
To try and find a way
To reach that woman
In old Mexico.

And I met a kind man
He guarded the border
He said, ""You don't need papers,
I'll let you go,
I can tell that you love her
By the look in your eyes, now"".

Take a trip on ship this time

Takes her dog and my truck and rolls across the land

She turns to you softly you turn on the light
You use her and abuse her and you know it ain't right
To treat one who loves you so badly
When she's doing the best that she can
You know she's doing the best that she can.

Do you believe in dreams oh do you believe in dreamers

Still he just won't give his neighbors a thing
His day will come, I'll make a bet
He'll get to heaven and here's what he'll get

A rusty old halo skinny white cloud second hand wings full of patches
A rusty old halo skinny white cloud robe that's so wooly and it scratches

Some people have them big shiny cars
Swimming pools fur coats and diamonds in jars
Real silver gates real golden doors
They'll get up to heaven and trade them all for

Brighten up the corner wherever you are

Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful

With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean

Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
Bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

Jarring of judgement and reasons defeat

I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door",From Eden
Hozier,"I have never known peace
Like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger
Like these insects that feast on me

A thousand teeth
And yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased
Our heartbeats becoming slow

We lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found
To freeze or to thaw
So long we become the flowers
Two corpses we were
Two corpses I saw

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you

I have never known sleep
Like the slumber that creeps to me
I have never known color
Like this morning reveals to me

And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold

We lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand
So still and discreet
So long we become the flowers
We'd feed well the land
And worry the sheep

And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you

They'd find us in a week (Lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long we become the flowers)
They'd find us in a week (Lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle shows fear (So long we become the flowers)

And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had its say

I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you",In a Week

No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight

Laughing away through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather to be tonight
Lord she found me just in time

I need to be youthfully felt, 'cause God I never felt young

She's gonna save me call me baby run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily, but yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives, ride round pickin' up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson, 'raise em on rhythm and blues

Lord it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
Sit back and watch the world go by

Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust

About that night

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I knew that look dear

Was there in someone

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through

Your dreams come true",When You Wish Upon a Star
Hubert Nuss,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know
Hubert Powell,"I believe for every drop of rain that falls 
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone that goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
I believe
I believe
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer
Will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf
Or see the sky
Then I know why I believe

Et la queue dans le vent

Dans ses rades et ses rues
Réservés au pingouins

A la marée sans lune

Peut-être par courtoisie

mais quand j't'ai vu marcher à côté de tes rangers
en pleine éclipse mentale & mouillant tes pampers

Tu m'as répondu d'un regard :
