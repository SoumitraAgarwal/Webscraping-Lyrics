New Found Glory,"Where do you go when you have nowhere to turn
The roads connect to the bridges you burn to preach me and
You?ve been calling in situverb and finding excuses to be by yourelf
There?s more to life
You know

It takes you to open up your eyes
To see the right it?s all around you
It?s all around you

You?ve been sleeping your problems away
Being reclusive you?re losing yourself
It?s time to change
You know

[Chorus:]

Sleep building up now
Closing in on you now
Greaving turn your neck now
Telling you don?t leave it all behind

[Chorus:]

New Found Glory,"Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss

But traditions I can trace against the child in your face

Oh, you're wasting my time, you're just, just, just wasting time

Ah, take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away (Throw it away...Throw it away...)

I made a fire and watching it burn (yeah) Thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last
No, no, no, have you no ambitions,
My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air
And dreaming I'm a doctor
It's hard to be man when there's a gun in your hand

New Found Glory,"And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
'Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies

Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

Why can't I let myself enjoy 
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful
Places I've been
My eyes are on the future
I can't think about the past

Always exceed my grasp

You've got to reach a little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey woa - oh you got to grow
You've got to reach a little bit higher
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul and you'll never grow old

When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
You may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you

Mingling in the joy
For Mary saw the future
And the sadness it would bring
And that's when Mary started crying
When she heard the angels sing

Let's make a baby king
Let's make him lord of all
Let's give him everything
Let's make a baby king

Now, you remember little king David
He's the little baby's kin
He's cousin to the man named John
And I know you all remember him

And John said, ""let's get ready!""
The herald angels sing
‘cause this old world needs to know
The good news that I bring

Let's make a baby king
Let's make him lord of all
Let's give him everything

The world is turned upside down
We need a new direction
We've got to turn this whole thing around
And we need a lord to guide us
Teach us wrong and right
And we need a lamb to lead us
Into the land of light

By only doin' when it comes your turn
Everything comes around so be ready if you can
Prepare your heart like the farmer turns his land

And you plant your fields when the spring is tender
When the summer beats down, you pray for rain
You hope for the harvest and the long cold winter
And then you plant your fields again

Well he spoke right to my restless soul
Still wild and hungry and beyond control
For all that you dream there's a time and a place
But you won't know it till it comes your way

And you plant your fields when the spring is tender
When the summer beats down, you pray for rain
You hope for the harvest and the long cold winter
And then you plant your fields again

We're the DJ cuttin' records
Straight across face
We'll leave you party people all stuck in a daze
We're fresh new and you know it's true
So let me introduce you to the rest of the crew

J Skee's first he's the master of mix
There ain't no rhyme that he can't fix
Spinster's next he's the king of the spin
And if you wanna battle you ain't gonna win
Then there's Popeye, but we call him Jord
The kid is so fresh that you'll never be bored
Next is Jon, his word is true, 
But party people know him as the one GQ
I'm Dexter P, the whiz of the word
I'm the greatest DJ that you ever heard
And now you know we're a gang 
And you know we don't play
We're the New Kids on the Block
And we're here to stay!

New Kids on the Block,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, jack frost nipping at your nose.
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks dressed up like eskimos.
Everybody knows, a turkey and some mistletoe help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that santa's on his way.
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.
And every mother's child is gonna spy to see if reindeer really know how to fly.
And so I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from 1 to 92

Lost more than a mil on a gambling bet
So here's the Chuck-wagon for the dog in you,
Here's the kennel ration and the Alpo too

Blow the horn like little Jack Horner

The fast cars they call'em kittens

Save the sap rap for the handicapped

Fall for the trimmed trap.

Can't do nothing at all

I was givin' up and you walked into my life
I never knew anything about love
In the world that I know
Lovers come and go
Nobody anywhere, talk like you do
Saying dreams can come true
Then you made me feel just like a man should feel

Ever since you walked into my life
All at once, I feel so strong inside
Anything you ask of me
I'll do it faithfully
Since you walked into my life (into my life)

Anything you ask of me
I'll do it faithfully
Since you walked into my life (into my life)

I am learning that the touch of love is magic
Feel it once, and you will see your world so differently
Nothing stays the way that it was
Everything begins again

Come on!

Do you remember,
Or should I rewind,
To that summer when you caught my eye,
I played it cool,
The weather was hot,
You had the beauty and the beach on lock.

With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt,
Walkin' on the beach, so pretty,
You wasn't lookin' for a man,
When you saw me in the sand,
But you fell for the boy from the city.

I was like, ""hey, girl, can I get your number?""
I remember what you told me too,
""Don't call after ten""
But you know that I did,
'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you.

I think about you in the summertime,
(Oh oh)
And all the good times we had, baby,
Been a few years and I can't deny,
(Oh oh)
The thought of you still makes me crazy,
I think about you in the summertime,
(Oh oh)
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.
You're my, my summertime.

Do you remember,
I'll never forget,
Touchin' your body all soakin' wet,
The water was cool,
The feelin' was hot,
Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked.

In your strapless sundress,
Kickin' back, no stress,
As long as we was together,
'Cause we were feelin' young love,
And we couldn't get enough.
Baby, I could reminisce forever.

And now I'm like,
Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it,
And I wonder if you miss it too,
Never thought it would end 'till it did,
Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you.

I think about you in the summertime,

And all the good times we had, baby,
Been a few years and I can't deny,

'Cause these are the days of the times of our life,
And we’re gonna crash into it tonight
We’re gone at the music and our bodies collide,
Get ready to blast off, 'cause we’re gonna crash
To the moon and the stars in the sky
We’re gonna crash into it tonight
Into the music and outta of your mind,
Get ready to blast off, and we’re gonna crash

Don’t make me hit the brakes, girl, I like the way you drive
Two hundred miles an hour, let the moment take you over
Fast lane, get you there in no time,
I can’t describe the feeling that I’m feeling as I crash into you

You been trying it all night.

Those eyes that saw every detail of the world so clear
And we bided our time impatiently until the hunger really burned
And the softest sweetest kisses were lost amidst the thunder in our hearts

And there's that strange queasy feeling 
Every time someone holds a door open for you
Such sweetness, such kindness - while they manoeuvre you into position
And we all know how hard it is to bite the hand that feeds you
Remember all those old films we used to watch every Friday night on TV
However fast you run, however slow the Mummy walks
It always catches you in the end

To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear

That my life would depend on the morning sun

From the past until completion, they'll turn away no more
And still I find it so hard to say what I need to say

New Order,"It was January, nineteen-sixty-three
When Johnny came home with a gift for me
He said I bought it for you because I love you
And I bought it for you 'cause it's your birthday, too
He was so very nice, he was so very kind
To think of me at this point in time
I used to think of him, he used think of me
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw tears were in his eyes
He never meant to hurt me
Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
Johnny, don't point that gun at me
Can I save my life at any price?
For God's sake won't you listen to me?

And though he was ashamed that he had took a life
Johnny came home with another wife
And I often remembered how it used to be
Before that special occasion, nineteen-sixty-three
There was too many ways that you could kill someone
Like in a love affair, when the love has gone
He used to think of her, she used to think of him
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw tears were in his eyes
He never meant to hurt me
Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
Johnny, you keep on using me
Can I change my life for any price?
Oh, Johnny, won't you listen to me?

I just wanted to make her smile
And make it last for a while
Do all the things you can do at home
Maybe once in a while get away somewhere special
Create a memory that would last forever
In those days we spent together

They say the secret of our happiness is unconditional love
And brotherhood and trying to be good and trying not to drink
But I can't stop drinking, it's in my blood
In and out of trouble, while keeping yourself alive
Not giving cold down in the wastes of the grim and mire
In the dark and the sun of the mire

Not getting wasted, not being a cheat, a killer or a liar
Not getting pulled down in the wastes of the mire
In the darkness of the mire, in the darkness of the mire
I'd rather be a lover than a liar
I'd rather be a lover than a supplier

If the secret of happiness is unconditional love
Why don't you miss me?
Well, sometimes I do, like when you're away
And I feel a need for you
I feel it like the day we met all those years ago
Those times were hard to hold on to
But nothing stays the same
We are forever moving, like the dancing of the flame
Life is so unstable, always changing, it never stays the same
Like the atom and that bomb that causes so much pain
So I came in from the cold with nowhere left to go
And I gave away my freedom and the calling of the wild
So that I could be with you, I chose to be with you
So I came in from the cold and I chose to be with you
I chose

Do you ever listen to what I have to say?
As life unfolded that one short day

However you want it, it's my desire
Girl you've got me hanging like a bird down on a wire
We are so different, yet we're the same
Things that I remember, that I wish I could change

I feel deserted, I feel unwell
But it's not your fault, no not at all
I was the reason for our downfall
Sometimes I wake up when I'm alone
As angry as hell because you're gone

Rozanda was her real name 
But Cherry was her chosen one 
Everybody said that she'd soon be dead 
But Cherry replied ""At least I had some fun"" (Oh yes) 

Her eyes were like a pool of 24 karat diamonds 
I was the last in a long line of foolish men who dived in 

CHORUS: 
Cherry, Cherry 
I think about you every rising sun 
Whoa Cherry, Cherry 
Wherever you are, I hope you're havin' fun (Oh yes) 

Tuesday was my big game 
North vs. Central in basketball 
Underneath their long coats 
Cherry and the girls wore camisoles 
Every time North would run the hoop 
Cherry would flash 'em and they would fall 
But not as hard as I fell 
When Cherry gave me her number and told me 2 call (U should call me) 

Using all the money her boyfriend Wilbur gave her, she'd buy 
Anything I wanted, that's why my baby's so fly 

CHORUS 

(Do do do do do) 
Me and Cherry got married 
And tried our best 2 keep it on the down low, the down low 

I was combing her hair 
The day that Wilbur called and cussed her on the phone 
He beat her up real bad and figured I was gonna leave her 
Instead I bought a 45 and set out 2 relieve her (Take him out) 
If he was taken out then he could never harm another 
No sooner than I got there, I was met by Cherry's mother cryin' 

Cherry, Cherry 
Every night I ask the Lord why? Oh why?

Another victim of a suicide (Why oh why?) 
Why?

Whoa Cherry, Cherry

With so much money on me, I figured I oughta hit Jannell's house 
I knocked on her door, right? 
(Mmm, oh) 
I don't know what she was doin' 
(Oh, ooh) 
But I couldn't get no answer? 
She was doin' some wrong shit 
""Jannell"" I shouted, still no answer 
(Mmm, oh, oh) 
I figured she was on the telephone or somethin' 
(Oh) 
So I walked around 2 the bathroom window 
Pushed it up, climbed inside 
Soon as I got inside, it hit me {gasp} 
Damn! 
I don't know what it was but it hit me hard 
""Uh"" 
Jannell's a Rican, you know? 
And them beans and rice is a habit at Jannell's house, you know? 
I grab my mouth, my nose and I just screamed 
And then I ran 
But Jannell's house is real messy and I hit somethin' and I fell 
That somethin' was Jannell 
(Get off!) 
I stepped on her bruised booty she got from stage diving 
And it made her real mad so we went 2 rounds 
Jannell can bob 
She kicked my ass 
Damn! 
""Oh God""

It's always gotta be the same.

Always beat the boys up,

Made my money by cutting grass,
Got fired by fried chicken ass,

And think to myself,
Where do I belong forever,
In whose arms, the time and place?

I may switch off and go in a daydream,

Washin' my hair in the shower,
It always takes five hours to make it straight,
So I'll braid it in a zillion braids,

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one

This year's for me and you

They've got rivers of gold

You were handsome
You were pretty

They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging,
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner

Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot

If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual it happens every day no matter what you say

You'll find it happens all the time
Love will never do what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine?

It's not unusual to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
It's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you",It's Not Unusual

But I can never now be true
So I say

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

I'm here so please explain
Why you're opening up a healing wound again
I'm a little more careful perhaps it shows
But if I lose the highs at least I'm spared the lows

To feel my spirit calm

Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was

A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon
It will be morning

I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Another day is dawning...

All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun...

But this pain in my chest,
It's keeping me awake,
And every breath I take,
Feels like it's my last
I want to be fine,I want to be sure
I want to be a lot of things,
And none of them include you.
I keep telling myself,
I'm not miserable
I keep telling myself,
I'm better off without you

I believed that you meant
Everything you said,
Goodbye,and thanks for the memories
For the pain and the lies
Every time I had to cry
Goodbye,and thanks for the memories

I don't understand,
Cause it doesn't make sense
The way you broke it off,
Took away my heart,
Took away all of my friends
I want to go out
And get out of this house
Bet to begin again 
Is gonna take more than
I think I'd ever have to give.
I keep telling myself,
I'm not miserable
I keep telling myself,
I'm better off without you

I believed that you meant
Everything you said,
Goodbye,and thanks for the memories
For the pain and the lies
Every time I had to cry
Goodbye,and thanks for the memories
I believed that I was
So cleverly deceived,
By good looks,some charm and 
A brilliant lie.
All the time that was spent,
Being used,I should have said,
Goodbye and thanks for the memories.

I want to know why,
You're such an idiot,
I want to know how
You can even live with it.
I wanna know why,
I should even give a damn
About you missing me so terribly.

I'm starting to sleep,
A little easier now.
Now that I'm over this
And I've made up my mind 
To never fall in love again,
With someone like you
Someone so confused
I just wish I would have
Realized that a long 
Time before I had.

Every time I had to cry.

New York City Fire Department,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

New York Dolls,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Ain't Got No Home/Dizzy Miss Lizzy

Lookin' like she'd love to give all things form
Started gettin' glad that I was born

Said, ""Hey boy, what ya doin' here?""
""Just shoppin' for my sister, it's her birthday soon.""

Kissed me like I'd never been kissed before
Made a face so sweet and mean
I went down like a submarine

It's always raining here
Heart's in pain, crying in the rain
Here comes that rain again
Exacerbation's, excruciations
That's the tears of things
Exacerbation's, excruciations
Well, that's the tears of things

Waiting in a railway station
In some godforsaken neighborhood
It's as if my blood was dreaming
And resolved itself into melody

Making rain, here comes the rain
Hearts in pain, it's always raining here
Creating rain, here comes the train
Making rain, it's always raining here
Yeah, making rain, making rain
It's always raining here
Making rain, yeah rain

Yeah rain, yeah rain

New York Dolls,"I was pretty vanquished when you came along
I was only singing lonesome funeral songs
Trying to find out, was there life after death?
And if there really was, is this really it?

You got to be my world
You're beautiful
So beautiful
You got to be my world

Yeah I was complete, a long long time ago
Got all wasted, buried in the snow
You're my reflection, one of the divine
Careful what you give me, the other half is mine

You got to be my world
You're beautiful
So beautiful
You got to be my world

Your eternal nature, lead me to the self
If I don't check that dude out, I wouldn't know nothing else
From entering the domain, feeling that delight
Holding my position of what I know is right

Cosmic energies of love, don't leave my ass behind
Wisdom of the body, ravaged by the mind
Live by wretched knowledge, far more than belief
You may never steal, but you are a thief

You got to be my world
You're beautiful
So beautiful
You got to be my world

So beautiful
You's got to be my world
It's got to be my world
So beautiful

Hi everybody! I'm David Jo and the Dolls!
We're from New York City!
And we like our Philly soul Chicago-style!
Check it out!

Invested with virtues no other band possess
Retreating here, advancing there
Encircling this earthly mess

Nobody got no bizness
Bizness like we do
Come on baby, won't you watch our style
It's kickin' like a mule
Who's got the noise 
When you gotta move
Gotta be a rock and roll band 
That's really in the groove

Bizness, bizness
Nobody's got no bizness

Replacing defunct religions
And the earthly caress
Offering the modern crowd an absolute
Worthy of its nothingness
We like to shingaling
And Latin boogaloo
Everybody swaggerjackin' us
Cause you can't learn this at school

Nobody got no bizness
Bizness like we do
It don't matter what you're putting down
You could do it too
Whose love is radical
When you've gotta move
Gotta be a rock and roll band
That's really in the groove, yeah!

Bizness, bizness (that's right)
Nobody's got no bizness
Bizness, bizness (give me some bizness)
Nobody's got no bizness (ah yeah yeah yeah)

Let's get radiant, uh-huh
You in with the in part of the out crowd, now

Ain't nobody got no bizness
Bizness like we do
Come on baby, just watch our style
It's kickin' like a mule
Who's got the chaos 
When you gotta move

Drive a busted dinosaur of a car
If I didn't love my honey
I woulda never ever woulda got this far
I woulda stayed in bed, pulled the covers over my head
And slept until there's no more war
How did it come to this?
This is ridiculous!

This is getting too funky
A man of my stature can't live like this
When I talk about some money
All I ever do is reminisce
I guess it's too austere, I just wanna disappear
And come back when the joint starts to swing
How did it come to this?
This is ridiculous!

Won't pay a nickel on morphine
Really I don't need that much help

I can do it perfect all by myself

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

People everywhere just wanna be free
Listen, please listen, that's the way it should be
Peace in the valley, people got to be free

You should see, what a lovely, lovely world this would be
If everyone learned to live together
It seems to me  such an easy, easy thing this would be
Why can't you and me learn to love one another

New York Ska Jazz Ensemble,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked

And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Newell Oler,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Planted on their columns now that bind me

And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can

And now that she is older there are things she wants to know
She said, ""Please Daddy tell me 'bout my mother 'cause I miss her.""
I said, ""Get pen and paper and I'll help your draw her picture.""
I said, ""First draw a heart so big there's room for little else
Then write a million for the things that she denied herself
Draw a rose the kind of which there'll never be another
And when you finish you will have a picture of your mother
""If you want to make the picture even more complete
You could draw a little cottage, draw it nice and neat
Draw a bright and shining sun up in the sky above
But then again I guess its pretty hard to draw my love

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

You're always stealing the joy in me
You love to whisper my name

You've got me living like a bug
Crawling in fear
It's been a very long year

I dream of growing some wings
I think I'm flying away
Then you point and you spray

All my hidden secrets
Crave the light of forgiveness
You pull the shades
You accuse and you blame

Dear Shame
You're oh so eager to toy with me
You're always stealing the joy in me
You love to whisper my name

I fled the light just to live in your shadow
I needed mercy and you offered me blame

It's jammin' your brain like a too tight wig
Stuff this new religious phase
Your home is here in the yellow haze

Oi boy, what are you doin'?
Wearing your faith like a new tattoo
When friends and formers don't approve this
(Steelo pads will not remove this)

I cannot get you, I do not want
You out of my system
I cannot get you, I do not want you
Out of my head

Oi boy, what are you on?
We'd try to help you but you're too far gone
First we thought you'd be rejecting us
Now we're scared you'll start infecting us

Oi boy, come again
Someday soon it'll all sink in
As all your efforts to inspire us
Spread like some computer virus

I cannot get you, I do not want
You out of my system
I cannot get you, I do not want you
Out of my head

Always stalled by hidden fears
Always stuck in neutral gears
Until I gave the driver's seat away
Take my life and make it real

Turn the key and take the wheel
Push the throttle through the floor

Rattling his cage with every ounce
Of resolve he never had

For a better suit and an escort and a winning lottery ticket

First we waited for miracles
Then we needed a sign
Now we're here to confess
We've wasted the time

But I know, I know
I know, I know this

Every blade will wither and fade
As the old man dies again
Season pass, we're clinging to grass
'Cause we've lost the sky again

Like a woman trying to give birth
She strains, she labors
She's not sure if it's worth the suffering
And she wonders, how long?

When I first heard the rumor you were coming back
I confess my impatience, I guess I lost track of what
I'm to persevere for of the reason you put me here for

Back then it was any day now
Never dreamed we were wrong
Now we're shaking our heads
Wondering, how long?

But I know, I know
I know, I know that

Every blade will wither and fade
As the old man dies again
Season pass, we're clinging to grass
'Cause we've lost the sky again

I catch a glimmer of your sweet grace
But it only makes me long for the day

Next life, could you kindly refrain 
From throwing yourself at the mercy of a train?

To the cries of the storm-tossed

Every whispered secret, every muffled sigh 
Every half-truth that was added to a lie

You promised you would 
Silence that evil with good 

Shame feeds guilt, guilt needs release 
You took it to god 
You made your peace 
And swore that you would 
Overcome evil with good

If they needed blood, I'd have gladly given mine 
A child of the kingdom; still an invalid 
Forgive her, please father

You flooded her room
With a fearsome mercy
Torn from the devils grip
From the clutches of fear
I can hear her dead heart beating

If you wait 'til noon to eat.""

Every Monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft.
Oh, none of us knew his checkout time would come so soon,
But before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune:

And all the milk has turned,
And Captain Crunch is waving farewell,
When the Big One finds you,
May this song remind you
That they don't serve breakfast in hell.

This is...my God 
And there's no use explaining 
What can't be contained 

Bridge:

How we gonna work this out? 
To fabricate a God like this no doubt
We'd end up worshipping a Christ
Of our own design 
But Jesus doesn't fit that profile
His ways aren't mine

Chorus
",Who?
Newsboys,"request the honor of your presence
the tear gas has blown away
put down your crumpets and your coffee now
so unfashionably late 
little brother, little sister
underwater we go
out of our ordinary selves
stepping out
to where the people sing

woohoooooooooo
-and the people sing
-and the times are good

you say i'm acting like a beggar
i call it killing the fool
you carry more baggage
than a momma's boy
on your first day of school

let go the light of the t.v.
drop the hands
the chains that bind me
turn it all around
stop, lift you up 'n die to self
in a time when the left and the right's the same
when it's all blurred vision in a crazy haze
send out the invitations!

you say I'm acting like a beggar
i call it killing the fool
to save your life you gotta lose it
so the people sing",Woohoo
Newsboys,"Dull as dirt,
You can't assert
The kinda light that might persuade
A strict dictator to retire

Fire the army,
Teach the poor origami.
The truth is in,
The proof is when you hear your heart start asking

What's my motivation?
And try as you may
There is no way
To explain the kinda change

That'd make an eskimo renounce fur
That'd make a vegetarian barbeque hamster
Unless you can trace this about-face to a certain Sign

Shine.
Make'em wonder whatcha got.
Make'em wish that they were not
On the outside looking bored.

Shine.
Let it shine before all men.
Let em see good works and then
Let em glorify the lord.

Out of the shaker and onto the plate,
It isn't karma it sure ain't fate
That would make a deadhead sell his van
That would make a schizophrenic turn in his crayons

Oprah freaks
And science geeks
A rationale that shall excuse this strange behavior
when you let it Shine

You will inspire the kind of entire turnaround
That would make a bouncer take ballet
Even bouncers who are unhappy
But out of the glare

With nowhere to turn
You ain't gonna learn it on ""What's my Line?""

Shine.
Make'em wonder whatcha got.
Make'em wish that they were not
On the outside looking bored.

Shine.
Let it shine before all men.
Let em see good works and then
Let em glorify the lord.

Down here in the valley
Every shadow You see
Has its own story
Down here in the valley
Every puddle of mud
Comes from tears and blood
And it's so hard just to get warm
That the chill turns into despair

Will You lift me up with tender care?
Will You wash me clean in the palm of Your hand?
Will You hold me close so I can thrive?
When You touch me, that's when I know I'm alive

Down here in the valley
Nothing's able to grow
'Cause the light's too low
Folks spend their days
Digging 'round for diamonds and gold
'Til they just get old
And they don't know anything else
They don't know they're breathing bad air
But I'm tired of living like this
And my soul cries out, ""If You're there...

Call me up to Your side
Draw me up to Your light
Let it blind me

Wrapped in rags like we are 
And with barely open eyes 
He takes my finger And He won't let go 
And He won't let go 
It's nothing like I knew before 
And it's all I need to know

Come, let us adore Him 
He has come down to the world we live in 
And all I have to give Him Is adoration

God is with us here Our Emmanuel 
God is with us here Our Emmanuel

O come let us adore Him 
O come let us adore Him 
Jesus, our Emmanuel 
Is with us here and 
He won't let go",Adoration
Newsboys,"Will You take what we have
A sacrifice unto You
Then create clean hands
And, Lord, make our spirits new

Father, blessed Father
Lead and guide us for Your name's sake
And keep us in the shelter of Your presence
Till we see your face

Let us hear what You say
Let us know Your voice and all of Your ways
Take our hands, lead us home
To the refuge that we find in You alone

Father, blessed Father
Lead and guide us for Your name's sake
And keep us in the shelter of Your presence
Till we see your face

All adoration
To our Lord Redeemer
To our Shepherd
Who carries us forevermore

Father, blessed Father
Lead and guide us for Your name's sake
And keep us in the shelter of Your presence
Till we see your face

Father, blessed Father
Lead and guide us for Your name's sake
And keep us in the shelter of Your presence
Till we see your face

Newsboys,"It's the song of the redeemed
Rising from the African plain
It's the song of the forgiven
Drowning out the Amazon rain

The song of Asian believers
Filled with God's holy fire
It's every tribe, every tongue, every nation
A love song born of a grateful choir

It's all God's children singing
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He reigns, He reigns
It's all God's children singing
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He reigns, He reigns

Let it rise about the four winds
Caught up in the heavenly sound
Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals
To the faithful gathered underground

Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation
Some were meant to persist
Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples
None rings truer than this

And all the powers of darkness
Tremble at what they've just heard
â??Cause all the powers of darkness
Can't drown out a single word

When all God's children sing out
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He reigns, He reigns
All God's people singing
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He reigns, He reigns",He Reigns
