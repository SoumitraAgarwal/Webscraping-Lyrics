Keith Ingham,"The night was filled with sweet surrender
I had a million things to say
We shared the moon in all it's splender
You pressed your lips to mine, and by the way
 
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am living for you alone?
Did I remember to say ""I'm lost without you""
And just how mad about you I've grown?
You were in my arms and that was all I knew
We were alone, we two, what did I say to you?
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forever more you are mine?
 
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am living for you alone?
Did I remember to say ""I'm lost without you""
And just how mad about you I've grown?
You were in my arms and that was all I knew
We were alone, we two, what did I say to you?
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forever more you are mine?",Did I Remember
Keith Ingham,"If there is someone lovelier than you
Then I am blind, a man without a mind
If there is someone lovelier than you

But no, I'm not blind
My eyes have traveled everywhere
In hopes that I might find, a creature half so fair

If there is someone lovelier than you
By all that's beautiful
Such beauty can't be true

If there is someone lovelier than you
By all that's beautiful
Such beauty can't be true",If There Is Someone Lovelier Than You
Keith Ingham,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
",In a Little Spanish Town
Keith Ingham,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine
Keith Ingham,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Keith Ingham,"Listen, big boy
Now that you got me made
Goodness, but I'm afraid
Somethin's gonna happen to you

Listen, big boy
You gotta be hooked, and how
I would die if I should lose you now

Button up your overcoat
When the wind is free
Take good care of yourself

Get to bed by three
Oh, take good care of yourself

Be careful crossing streets, ooh, ooh
Cut out sweets, ooh, ooh

Beware of frozen funds, ooh, ooh
Stocks and bonds, ooh, ooh
Dockside thugs, ooh, ooh

Or on nails, ooh, ooh

Keith Ingham,"Sue wants a barbecue,
Sam wants to boil a ham,
Grace votes for Bouillabaisse stew.
Jake wants a weeny bake,
Steak and a layer cake,
He'll get a tummy ache too.
We'll rent a tent or tepee.
Let the town crier cry.
And if it's RSVP
This is what I'll reply

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Better save a chair
When the party's gettin' a glow on
And singin' fills the air
In the shank of the night
When the doin's are right
You can tell 'em I'll be there

""Whee"" said the bumblebee,""
""Let's have a jubilee""
""When?"" said the prairie hen, ""Soon?""
""Shore"" said the dinosaur.
""Where?"" said the grizzly bear,
""Under the light of the moon?""
""How `bout ya, brother jackass?""
Ev'ryone gaily cried,
""You comin' to the fracas?""
Over his specs he sighed

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Slickum on my hair.
When the party's gettin' a glow on
And singin' fills the air
If I ain't in the clink,
And there's sumpin' to drink,
You can tell 'em I'll be there",The Cool Cool Cool of the Evening
Keith Ingham,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Keith Ingham,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Keith Ingham,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Keith Ingham,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear,

It's, it's de-lovely"".",It's De-Lovely
Keith Jacobs,"Since you been gone
I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there you are baby once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you

Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you

Here comes the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me darlin'
Only takes one note, I tell ya,
From that radio
It's just
Another
Lonely
Love Song.",Another Sad Love Song
Keith James,"Hey there lover
Damn I miss you
It's been crazy
I'll paint this picture
Dropped my pancakes on my mattress
Tried to pull off, tires flattening
Lost my celly
In my coffee
Then got yelled at
By miss bossy

If my luck doesn't change
I'll be out of my brain by tonight
When your head's out of place
You're behind in the race of life

Oh just not my day, not my day (not my day)
Not my day, naw
It's just not my day
Not my day, not my day (not my day)
Not my day, naw, it's just not my day

Jammed my finger in the stapler
Knocked my taco off the table
Had a ticket
When I left work
Then got caught up on, the social network

If my luck doesn't change
I'll be out of my brain by tonight
When your head's out of place
You're behind in the race of life

Sometimes it's just not my day, not my day

Folks will hurt, and down your worth

Keith Jarrett,"I heard a voice callin' out to me
Might've been a vision might've been a dream
It said some things will come and some will go
We're only here a moment don't you know

I don't claim to have all the answers
And I've got my share of questions
But if I don't follow blindly
It doesn't mean I've lost my way

I'm still on the journey
Headed down the road less traveled
I guess we're all gonna get there
In our own time and way

there's a bridge that leads to the other side
You'll know you've crossed when you arrive
Everyone will have a tale to tell
I'm gonna quench my thirst when I drink from that well",Vision

Keith Jarrett,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Keith Jarrett,"The song a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
The murmur of a brook at eventide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide

That's Stella by Starlight and not a dream

She's everything on earth to me

When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.

Keith Jarrett,"If I should write a book for you
That brought me fame and fortune too,
That book would be,
Like my heart and me,

And if I should paint a picture too
That showed the loveliness of you,
My art would be,
Like my heart and me,
Dedicated to you.

To you,
Because your love is the beacon that lights up my way.
To you,
Because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day.

Keith Jarrett,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You
Keith Jarrett,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Keith Jarrett,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings
Keith Jarrett,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

My true love was true
I, I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied,"" oh no

They said, ""Someday you'll find
All who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, boo hoo
So I smile and say

I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Keith Jarrett,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Keith Jarrett,"I was created for one man alone
It wasn't easy to find 
Now that I've found him, I wonder just how 
I could have lived right up to now

Now I am something completed by you
I am no one, just part of two

Don't ever leave me now that you're here
Here is where you belong
Everything seems so right when you're near
When you're away it's all wrong

I'm so dependent when I need comfort
I always run to you
Don't ever leave me cause if you do
I'll have no one to run to

Keith Jarrett,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Keith Jarrett,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?
Keith Jarrett,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be

Keith Jarrett,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell

Keith Jarrett,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive

To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me

Keith Jarrett,"The little girl standing in the rain 
On the corner of 42nd street 
And she's all alone on the bad side of town 
'Cause there was a little boy 

That she loved with all her heart 
But he's far away with another girl 
Now she's searching for a friend 
Just to hold her when she cries 

In her lonely nights, lonely nights 
Where no one seems to care 
In her lonely nights, lonely nights 
You better beware 

But baby you try and you try 
But it seems that it doesn't work 
'Cause love is a game that they play 
So baby hold on to your heart

Takes what he wants 
But she's searching for a friend 
Just hold her when she cries

Where no one seems to care

There's a little cry 
A girl who says 
Hey I want to die 

There's no one here who really cares 
But if there's someone here who understands 
Just someone here who'll try to lend a hand 
And bring her home tonight, tonight

Where no one seems to care 
In her lonely nights, lonely nights 
You better beware

Keith Jarrett,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Of love and youth and spring,

I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me
You took advantage of me",You Took Advantage of Me
Keith Jarrett,"They ask me how I knew
My true love was true
I, I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied,"" oh no

They said, ""Someday you'll find
All who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, boo hoo
So I smile and say
""When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes""",Intro - Smoke Gets In Your Eyes

She just did the laundry and brushed off the dirt
She cooked all the meals and scrubbed all the floors
And she mowed that front yard with that old push mower

She held us together with those delicate hands

Set ten thousand supper tables

All the tears she's dried and bedtime stories she's told
I'd buy back the years back from old father time

When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.

I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

I need somebody to be my baby
Someone to tell my troubles to

'Cause I'm just passing through

I travel around from town to lonely town
I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
Now I find fortune and fame, lots of people know my name

I got to be somewhere tomorrow

How does it happen, that two can be tender
And one be the lender of love and emotion
That covered the ocean of sadness that kept them together

Love will start with you, it is easy to measure it
Bury a treasure in it it's not an adventure
It's more to be certain that it had to be shared together

Love when it's growing is full of surprises
Its temperature rises from higher to higher
And then turns into fire which has to be shared together

Keith Moon,"Old lady lost in the city
In the middle of a cold  cold night
It was fourteen below and the wind start to blow
There wasn't a boy scout in sight
Pull down the shades cause he's comin'
Turn out the lights cause he's here
Runnin' hard down the street
Through the snow and the sleet
On the coldest night of the year

[Chorus]
Beware  beware  beware of the Naked Man

Old lady head up toward Broad Street
Shufflin' uptown against the wind
She had started to cry-wiped a tear from her eye
And looked back to see where she had been

Old lady stand on the corner
With a purse in her hand
She does not know but in a minute or so
She will be robbed by a naked man

[Chorus]

Old lady lean against a lamppost
Starin' down at the ground on which she stand
She look up and scream
For the lamplight's beam
There stood the famous Naked Man

He say, ""They found out about my sister
And kicked me out of the Navy,
They would have strung me up if they could.
I tried to explain that we were both of us lazy
And were doing the best we could.""

He faked to the left and he faked to the right
And he snatched the purse from your hand
""Someone stop me,"" he cried,
As he faded from sight,
""Won't nobody help a naked man?""
""Won't nobody help a naked man?""

I hope your mail always fails to reach you
Until you want to hear from me
I hope your wristwatch goes berserk

But I'm not angry, I'm just hurt
I hope your phone will never ring & you can never sing
I hope your car doesn't start, cannot move
Until you want to be with me

I hope your brand new dress gets torn
But I'm not angry, just forlorn
I'll make a voodoo dance to fit with bats & owls
We'll haunt your house on rattle chains
We'll hang around until you call my name

And tell me that you want me back again
I hope your records always break, your shoes make your feet ache
I hope your luck will get stuck on black cats
Until you want a kiss from me

I hope your TV's always bad

There's nothing to keep them together.

How does it happen that two can be tender
And one be the lender of love and emotion
That covered the ocean of sadness that kept them together?

Love when it started was easy to measure:
Each day was a pleasure, each night an adventure,
Each morning was something that had to be shared together.

Love when it's growing is full of surprises
As temperature rises from higher to higher,
Then turns into fire that has to be shared together.

Then came the sadness which follows the laughter
And shortly thereafter the dream had exploded,
A promise was broken, now few words are spoken together.

Verse 1:
Keith Murray is this mic phychosis
I break your best rappers off thousands of pieces
I'm on some other shit splittin' wigs with my penmanship
Kick flows harder then the music so feel in your head and chest
And pass it to the next
They gave me 5 mic checks and all due respect
So please fill it up and check the anitfreeze
Cause this nigga Keith drop mad degrees
I launch tomahawk missles when I talk with permiscuesus
Intelligence like Mr. Romp
From New York unto the world over
I walk MC's like Jesus walked on water
As my airy frequency reigns through the galaxy
I easily gets busy and takes 3
I'm the nicest MC on this side of the peninsula
Stuck in the perimeter like a ninja

The Def Squad MC's is shittin' on your new transmitters
Not quiters now forgetters

My delivers, which is, givin' crews the shivers
I'm like a mad scientist with this son
I concock some shit that'll bust the sun
I got the stunky funky illest funk flow 
For the glamorous scandalous world of radio
So how you want? Headcreads or ceelo?
I gets root deep like cavity cretes
Rockin' motherfuckers directly to sleep
A tybarrious rebel without a pause for the cause
And no claws the style is the son of noise
Peace to the hardcore the outlaw raw
Bug youngblood thugs, strong as ? 64 ounce jugs
In the realms of the danger

Verse 3:
Bust the contrast and how I forecast
Supersonic hyperphonic goin' on that ass paragraph
With the million dollar bionic metaphoric lyrical math
Generating off the chronic
By cooling in the dark path and the drug rath of the ath
And the ill shit that I craft
It's labeled as sick logic to the critics of the didicks
But they don't know the half of the half
The apperatus status of a maddisist
I conqure up a new style puffin' ganja, over the hook 
Causin' more trama with my mouth then the stealth bomber
Killing every style in the book
Like it's goin' outta style tomorrow 
My style is coming from down south and cross yonder
I drop the dope shit for masses and non-believers
Like spiral passes to butter finger wide receivers
As my photo type sound gays leis and hoes my style probe
To the farthest reaches of the globe

High as a motherfucker 
Zonin on cloud nineteen as the Def Squad takes you 
on another eerie place... of a dark side 
Yesssss!!! 

I escape from the world 
To show niggaz that my style is superb 
For what it's worth I'm gettin off planet Earth 
but I gotta redefine gravity first 
So I figure  I get my guns and I bust the biggest cap 
from the demand of the trigger 
I'm equipped to dip with a knapsack 
and a survival kit, with blunts n shit (word!) 
I'm in all black, ?with a face? money 
want to double to NASA, to hijack a space shuttle 
More ages than curiosity 
I enter the backdoor with animosity (""Yeah, here's Murray!"") 
Searchin for the astronauts, checkin my watch 
Determined the time I had to be out 
I saw my prey without a second delay 
Suited up, strapped down, straight and on my way 
For five seconds to liftoff I was in the Hell 
when I escaped from the world 

I escaped from the world (4X) 

So far
I went through a Milky Way of stars 
And landed on my destination, which was Mars (whoa, shit!) 
This planet was foreign and new 
As I'm puffin on a blunt, observin the view 
To my surprise, a spaceship arrived 
Out came a Martian, with six fingers and three eyes 
He spoke a bleeky type of dialect (""Bleek, bleek bleek bleek bleek bleek"") 
but understood my form of intellect 
I said, ""I'm Keith Murray from the planet Earth 
Boy I'm psychosomatic and homicidal with a verse"" 
My hypercritical form of words busts his brains 
and then the whole atmosphere changed (""What the fuck?"") 

rrarahrhagharhar rharhagahgahrahgh 

I was surrounded by some Martians in the hut about to front 
I used my last resort, and pulled out the Blunts 
Lit it, got the whole Martian crew blitted 
So now's my chance to try to get acquitted 
I said, ""I escaped from the planet Earth 
to let my mind untwirl because I'm mad at the world 
And the murder wasn't premeditated 
My language was just mis-interpretated"" 
One acknowledge I'm right and pulled out the peace pipe 
Aight? About to set the vibes right 
He lit it with his finger, I smelled the Martian Buddha linger 
I felt good cause I released some anger 
No sooner than the cease of the herb ignite 
I was headed back to Earth at the speed of light 
Upon my return niggaz thought I was in jail 
Nah kids, I escaped from the world 

As we zone, on the cosmic type of funk 
(escapism y'all) 
We drop mad flows, for the 1990's 
(escapism y'all, escapism y'all) 
The Funk Doctor Spock signin off live 
(escapism y'all, escapism y'all, escapism y'all)

Like infrared correspond with heat

That thrives off of battery acid, word 'em up
I rhyme like I'm hungry over funk beats

Always actin' wild and stupid like truckers
Goin' against the grain, barbecuin' niggaz
In the Purple Rain as my wild brain child style goin' insane

And I'm wild with the usage of a harsh word
My style of speak is mentally disturbed
I drug the head more than hallucinogenics with rhymes like these
On the mic I'm catchy like herpes

Covalent ionically with the mic I combine
And gain more strength, than a molecule enzymes
E crack the sticks while I get in the mix
And kick some fix after prefix after predicates

I take a trip down memory lane
And kick some shit, that'll bust your brain

Niggas down to swirls and twirls
I'm runnin' them off the ball like Earl and Pearl (uh)
This is a basic general classic situation
Can't nobody see me in God's creation
I steps it up from inspiring expectation with funk illustrations
You can thunk justifications 
Perhaps you would like me to make the biscuit callap (pow!)
And make your lungs collapse
You represent he represent I represent
The sick bizarre twist is that I torment in my performance (uh)
Kickin' brain twitchin' (yeah) 
My yobic topics, niggas be like ""Stop it, you got the illiotics!"" (yeah",Sychosymatic
Keith Murray,"You better recognize what. 
Snatchh your fuckin' head from your neck.

Strickly murder. 
Legion of Doom 94. 
Word 'em up this is how we do that shit. 
Techs to your record son. Shit. 
Fuck that shit. 
Word 'em up that how we're always been.

Yo check it, I feel the vibe like Shanet
Collaborate on niggas brains and bend you ass like a Sinse'
My death sentense is danger
I black out like Joe Ripken niggas hittin' the floor like the chamber
The sick authorist transmits for no repent
And activate the plan the Pentagon inelligents
So listen close like musical chairs
The L.O.D. is deep then the niggas Under The Stairs
I crack million dollar script like an archetict
And execute like the chair when I inflict death
I got the creepiest slang in this galaxy
And wreck the industry so mysteriously
Coming with the funk from beneath I creep straight for juggelars
And twist rap caps for all you motherfuckers
Walk the bloody streets with 19 shots in the lueger
Niggas be scared to face 50 Grand like Medusa
The shit I produce is like gin and juice when it blend
Scenes from Toni Braxton you'll Never Breath Again
I rhyme without ability to reason, niggas is guilty of treason
Who's to blame but the Legion to the Doom

With punk niggas we got beef so
(L.O.D. about to take it to the streets)
On the mic we definatly got beats so
(L.O.D. about to take it to the streets)

Roy Jay go the wickedest mystic magestic flow
From a homicidal clique, Yo E make that psycopathic mix
I hits for the hecks or the shit that causes conflict in the script
Beeotch my style set on fire to touch Venus
My soul seeks the universe while I'm sleepin'
I'm creepin' makin' myself develop with the chronic
Electronic Million Dollar Man the mic bionic
So you can feel it in your nerves when I blast off into the suburbs
Conduct like ? with electrofying words
I freak to them suicidal tracks break backs
Niggas scarred fakin' fuckin' heart atttacks
Oooh when I'm comin' through the crowd
Niggas want static yo I got the gun pazoow, wizoow, word up

Is instantaniously with my vocabulation accumulation
Trust me as I bust thee, lyrical homicidal shit from Keith Murray
If I had twenty four hours to live and one wish
I wouldn't wish for no damn lifesavers
I'd start going wild like Larry Davis
The funk speach vigalante from the L.O.D.
Gets funky freakly and freaky fluently
And deep as Greek mythology on level Z
Theres six million ways to die
And eight million stories in the naked city and all them shits are lies
So I keep my wittiest ironist hidious
Psychosis bloodiest flow decitious
Comin' from out this orbit deep space 9's wiggle my shit
Meltin' crew down like synthetic acid
Come half steppin' fession' through a section
And get the midsection of your brain drain
With mad man expression, no quesion and no second guessin'

Obsesssed with my success will make me crack your treasure chest (yes)
Hot tales of terror slip from my lip clearer
Slip up the L.O.D. will be behind you in the mirror

Mo murder, mo murder
Make no mistake, baby L.O.D. traditional
Don`t make me have to come lookin for you

[Chorus: x 2]
Call my name and I`ll come runnin, gunnin
All ya`ll bummin niggaz will get done in
My Squad comes in all shapes, sizes and colors

All you niggaz seem to hate us but your baby`s mothers love us
I`m the grand royal, hard to wear and tear
Rap specimen, pissin on all you mere peasants

With virtuality, poetry I successfully
Bring crews agony in virtual reality
See, first I puzzle your brain like The Riddler
Then, I catch you in the gut like Jack the Ripper

I`m the hot mustard dipper, money getter, mic gripper
Wack MC get rid of nigga
I take it to the extreme, and overkill like Dramamine
Y`all niggaz is sweet like jellybeans

Plus I knew your punk ass was soft
I see you in the street, you try to talk my fuckin ear off
I`m the high wrecka, mic checka
Wilin out like Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Chorus]

I got def-ly breath control, with sick vocabulary making MC`s nervous.
Boy I`ll do you plenty
Which MC is in my category, if any, not many
See you thought like Nellie, now you shit like jelly

After the surgeon is finished stitchin' up that belly
Niggas want to get ill, I`ll take it to stainless steel
And show em how it feel
You laugin' at Keith? You`re crying at yourself

'Cause beef with Keith is bad for your health

Continuously, yeah
Who's that crazy nigga
Drinkin crazy pussy out of crazy straw
Kicking crazy hardcore, crazy metaphors
When I rap competitions perform disappearing acts
Niggas ask why the Squad be on it like that
Cause we stay with the lethal dosage
Click on the Mic MC's run like roaches
Truthfully I think them niggas is gay
Always havin a party with no DJ
I had to hold my head in disbelief
Them short winded niggas tried to smoke the chief
Of the frontal leaf Keith
Knowing damn well they can't win
My style is rougher than army gear and old timb
The east coast say ill
The west coast say ill
My squad is def they don't give a fuck
They say kill
Cause we can all sing together
That's why I pack the black gat up under the leather
And keep it hot

It's 96 degrees in the shade, 1000 degrees

I got nuts like Almond Joy, like Mounds you don't
I say and do a lot of things some fake rappers won't
Now I'm the show shocker plus the show stopper
Down with makin G's and all the block clockers
Down with L.O.D., the motherf-ing cop droppers
Down with Def Squad flying through your hood in choppers
Yeah we done been in more shit in the past year
Than the bloods and crips care to hear
Ear to ear, glock to hand, Mic to mouth, resuscitation
Psychosomatic creation
Killing off the nation of perpetration
Player hating, bringin confrontation
I'll shoot your hips up and make you bogle like Jamaicans
I'm doing my thing, if you feel me do your thing
y'all niggas know my style
I smoke weed on trains and planes
Murderous material submerging from my brain
Chumpin top dollar niggas into small change
And make it hot

It's 96 degrees in the shade, 1000 degrees

I'm the unfuckwitable incredible lyrical individual
Boy your not suitable
I work wonders over the beats
It's no wonder phony MC's pee the bed
Relax your head
accommodations and compliments of the infrared
Theoretically, hypothetically, practically
Actually ain't nobody fucking with me
I'll sell your stupid ass the Brooklyn Bridge
If you think an MC in your camp can fuck with the kid
I want the sun not to shine for six months, to see who fronts
While the Squad light up the sky with blunts
If you catch a nigger dreaming
Thinking he can fuck with my enterprise
Wake him up, smack em, make him apologize
Cause we be on their lemonade type shit
I ain't no faggot but you derelicts can suck my dick
I make it hot

Keith Murray,"Intro: 
If heads only knew!

Verse 1:
I Make music of murder and mayhhem for all of them
And murder ballads for sweet chariots
My second return like a unstoppable bullet
With wings my ears ring your name when you speak of me in vein
Enter the center like a big bread winner
So L.O.D. can eat that ass up for dinner
I come with high potent deadly quotin'
Avenue corrodin' street life shit to get you open
Niggas pullin' stunts like Jackie Chan
Not knowin' that they fuckin' with the demolition man
I'm seen on screens and magazines
Pump, pump (don't sleep) but peace to Queens
I hollar Allah you Akhbar my peeps hold me down
In the roughest pair of Timbs that ever touched the ground
Huhh how's about a broken jaw
It's Keith Murray and I'm comin' in with the raw metaphors

Hook:
When I'm alone in my room
Sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind
I hear my conscience call
Keith Murray 

Redman:
Rock, rock on

Keith Murray:
Original rules, original rules, original rules X2

Verse 2:
Now heere we go again soundin' crazy but it's contagious
The sickest entertainer puttin' your brain though strainers
We smokes the choc', don't be afraid of the dark
Mentals get hit brain cells spark
Pappers swear they got the dopest jam on the shelf
But they don't believe that shit they own goddamn self
Last year I was underrated but I stay dedicated
I'm so dedicated I close my eyes I'm incarerated
Niggas was amazed at the shit you was kickin'
But all you did was adobo the chicken
I""m taking over like the psychic network
I got the drop on all you niggas out there claimin' that you do dirt
But the truth hurts and it kills you to listen
Like the sound of hollow point tip bullets whistlin'
Every little breath you take
Every little gesture you make
Every little jack you fake
I be the expert mic gladiator
Pop shit on records I'll cut your fingers off later

Hook X2

Verse 3:
Pump the new smash platium single the thug star spangled banner
Illustratin' grammer in a hostile manner
Texas chainsaw cuts hard to the core
Makin' sure they don't try to battle me no more
You seem to believe all you need is a rhyme and a dream
To defeat the all time great microphone supreme
But wake up 'cause you playin' with the game of death
I'll smoke your body ashes in a blunt and leave no evidence left
Straight ashes ashes, dust to dust
I got you in my clutch there's nothing further more to discuss
And it's scary though when the eeriest voice on the radio
Is in your hometown doin' the show
With the technique that I'm usin' choosin'
abusin'
Got more flow than D'Angelo crusin'
With poisonous venom Oh my God I get in em'
Turn 'em out give 'em something good to talk about 

Hook",Manifique (Original Rules)
Keith Murray,"Verse 1

Now for next to little or nothin' I be rippin' up every function
with scientifical mad man consumptions
with mass productions of mass conjunctions
I display new ways of mc destruction
'cause ain't nothin' better than the shit I got 
makin' niggas jump off the roof and roof-tops
I put the hip in hop and the don't in stop and the clips in glocks 
when I rock box your block
my hypothesis on this is you niggas better come in terms of my vocabulary quick
or get dissed
my brain bleeds mental complex feeds
bring it on kid I got exactly what you need
twisted metaphors to get your shit in star wars
live forever like Bob Marley just because
the mad matador metaphor rips the hard core 
for him and his them and theirs you and yours

chorus:

And it beez like that sometimes
cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
we keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy 
cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
and it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy

Verse 2:

the most beautifullest vocabulist
punches phony mc's dead in their esophogaus
my analysis is roughly calloused
you better practice if you want to challenge this
I'm symbolic to the sun moon and stars
you gettin' knocked out the box no matter who you are
the funk phat tracks lures you to listen
as my vocals send your brain up in the fetal position
learn a quick lesson of mic aggression
so when I walk down the street there'll be no second guessing
now you can walk the walk talk the talk
back burnin' all day but your still fireproof like an ashtray
I'm a scientist in the mix like Plyx
turnin' all you fly emcees back into maggots
non prop soil watch me bubble and spoil
punch you Grand Royal as you foam like boil
 
Chorus

verse 3:

I played the many thousand roles of street life 
showed Whodini that the freaks come out in broad daylight
me and my crew be tight like Lavren and Shirley
rollin' through all ya'lls hoods pullin all ya'lls fly girlies
emcee's always bitch, that makes my style all hard
I role with nobody but God and the Squad
me and my troops we knock the shit out the sides of dudes
lettin the OJ juice loose on phat tracks E-d produced

Lookin' like the creature from the Black Lagoon
There's gonna be a 187 real soon
If some niggas don't give me some elbow room

Like a pack of wolves foamin at the mouth on full moon
I track range between space and time
And push back like receding hair lines
That's the essence of the effervescence
At this melodic dynamic shit progresses
A mic murderer for hire
As I sit back and watch your little gimmick backfire
Under the circumstances in any order of events
I be with sick niggaz rollin' thick
Dissin the system got America mad at me
Like my name was O.J. Simpson

People wonderin' if I'm a start some shit
Prisoner of the media very often
Cause people be blowin shit out proportion
False information and bogus arithmetic
Got everybody stuck on stupid, misinterpreting shit
How could I? Why should I damage my career?
Over a nigga that'll probably bust me out of fear
Don't let your mouth get you into somethin that your ass can't get out
When I see you I'm a pull your dreads out your scalp
Caution: code red
I could kill you now but instead I'm a put this thought into your head
I got the illest crew in the industry
We could go to war for 30 years like foreign countries

And laughin at these clown ass niggaz like they funny
The grand imperial with milky material

One thing I gotta say my Squad never lost it
Unlike you corny MC's out there who Farrah Fawcett
Can't rhyme runnin your mouth all the time
While Def Squad sit back and enterprise perfect crimes
Got the Funk Lord squeezin the life out of keyboards
While each MC tear the frame out of mic chords
Yo I was in the bullpen with them niggas pullin heists

Cause punk ass only bagged me with two ounces of weed

Get bird's eye view
And don't miss the crispiest nigga in the nucleus
With futuristic linguistics

With the ability to travel nine planets
Niggas can't undrstand it, please

We could battle for car keys and car titles
House deeds and bank accounts to make it final

Mind state sick like Idi Amin

You can do what ya got to

Abracadabra talk shit I'll reach right out and grad ya
The hype got you like gimmy
Don't let it have ya
I'll knowck you skeezas pleasers black like Jesus
Never lost in the jungle
Navigators with caesars
Instead dare iz a dark side said by Red
I'm consciously, crusciously coming for your head
I'm from a small coast call stay out my path
And from a big city called foot up in your ass
Jeepers, weepers, peepers get snuffed
By the sneakiest, throughout the speakers
Like fist to cuffs
Who the fuck is this paging me?
Oh, it's my creepy, greepy, grimy
Rough rhyme, crimy Reggie, I'm saying 
Fuckwho, went where, when, why and how
Get my shit to me not now but right now
Lucky niggas went platinum
Thinkin' they can see us
We swoop down on crews
Like angels on dust
I'll leave you mental so broke
You can't pay attention
When I get inside your head
And take your brain to another dimension
I'm itching for a scratch
And somebody to try to match
The battle cat constatly be on it like that
The doom has dawned in
We knockin' niggas out without warning
And pissing on them
The configuration is brain cell wastin' 
Renegades of funk
Like Africa Bambatta and the Zulu Nation
You facin' a maniac
Pacing over the track
Constantly bringing drama like Jason
In fact I'm L.O.D.ing it and there go planet Def Squad
Puttin' it down play for play like Ahmad Rashad
For the cause, I""m wiring jaws
Got niggas eating full-course meals out of crazy straws
And if it win't def it ain't shit
I'm taking it to the limit
And killing it each and every minute
Cause Keith Murray takes the beef a major step higher
And peace makers will get causght in the cross fire
Hip Hop's filled with back stabbers
Blunt grabbers, cats with dirty claws, dogs with filthy paws
Then you got rap artists
Claimin' to be the hardest
Bust them in their shit
And they're quick to press charges
Spot rushers, block busters, rockin' diamond clusters
Comin' to stick the rich out you motherfuckers
Educated black man on premises

Keith Murray,"Intro:
Announcer: Can I have your attention please?
Keith: On my way to JFK 
Announcer: Final boarding for flight 655 at Gate 14
Keith: I don't want of ya
       I'm on my way to LaGaurdia
       I'm on my way home or away, JFK (2x)

Hey yo, anywhere I go I definitely reo for mine
Cause I'm constantly in a Def Squad state of mind
I went to New Orleans and kept it clean
Spitting, splitting rappers at they seams for the cream
By all means
Although I seen the green wasn't enough
I jumped in the Lexus, went to Texas, pulled a royal flush
Feelin like Tony Atlas, up in Dallas
Rhymacutin with them niggas who be shootin up in Houston
And do remember I get in ya in Virginia
Swept N.C. and S.C freeze the West Indies
Oh and I'm going back to Indiana and Alabama
Did the ink pad bounce through Atlanta
I be rapidly runnin through chocolate cities
Like Philly, D.C., Cincinnati, and M.D.
And Jersey, Lord have mercy
Can't nobody serve me cause my world be free

CHORUS:
Goin around the world, goin around the world
All around the world, goin around the world
Goin around the world cause my world be free
Goin around the world (3x)

Cause my world be free
Then I was touching ground Uptown
As my rings gleamed in Queens
As I cooked it up in Brooklyn for all the friends
Kentucky was lucky I had to much Hennessey
When I was representing love love Tenessee
Kansas City, Missouri can speak upon the glory
St. Louis can even tell the story
Of how I dropp shit thick and cold like the snow in Chicago
A major up in Ohio, I was pack with cactus tactics
Up in Phoenix, Arizona set shit on fire in Oklahoma
Niggas had their ears pinned to the ground listening
When I was stomping through Detroit, Michigan
You hear me sounding crispy looking all scandalous
Swervin in the streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles
Don't even ask the question did I visit Africa
Shit I warmed it up in Alaska, smashed Nebraska

CHORUS (3x)

From interstate to tri-state to international
Mr. Keith Murray always keeps it classical
They had me up in England, mic stranglin
Jewels danglin while my single jingle jangling
Number one in my field, never defeated
Went to Sweden demonstrated malicious mic beatings
I was with my right hand man, Redman
When I did the Ichiban crane style in Japan
I transform like Dr. Bruce Banner
Stepped off the plane and blacked out up in Canada
I'm a million dollar man like Lee Majors
Fucked around and hit the jackpot up in Vegas
Yeah handin out vapors like bad news
Yo I be everywhere puttin down y'all
It's Def Squad y'all know my plans",World Be Free
Keith Murray,"Can I be committed is the question in my head

Keith Murray,"Yo shit is real dog, you know?
Stay out the web, 'cause once you get caught up in the web
That's it, you know?
They get you they got you good
Yo do the knowledge, take notice, stay focused
Shit is real, and it's real hard out there, for a black nigga

[Verse 1]
Ayo the way they doin me I can't stand it
Branded as a social bandit, but I'm a man and I'ma handle it
I'm not the first and I won't be the last
Just look how they did Pac and Tyson in the past
Yo at times, sometimes, I feel like I'm cursed
Because my life done went from bad to worse
Through all the stressful moments and all of the worry
I'ma still remain the same Keith Murray
Because I know deep in my heart God is on my side
If I gotta do my time, then I'ma do my time
They label you wrong, when you try to do right
And then they wonder why a con is so uptight
I'm just livin proof, of when you livin the truth
I been goin through bad times, since I was a youth
Now look, they got me locked in jail
People wonderin will I prevail or fail
But only time will tell


My mind, just now and then
Lookin down the corridors and wonders what might have been
It was a bad day

[Verse 2]
Yo, I wouldn't even stand here and lie to you, yeah it's true
All the shit that you hear about I'm goin through
And we good people at heart Jesus knows that we try
So I wonder why we get a break no time
My little sister just died, and the judge let me fry
And now I gotta kiss my lil daughter goodbye
All the pressure, make me want to grab the tech off the dresser
But understand that don't make you a man
So I address the, situation best way that I can
With a letter to the senator, from the lyrical political prisoner
That the system label a sinister
In jail while I confess my sins to the minister
It's enough to make a nigga go A-Wall
But for now I leave it in the hands of the Lord

It's a real situation we all go through
You know, unfortunately, Today was a bad day
Word, recognize, I'm no different from you
You no different from me, you know
It was a bad day

[Verse 3]
No slack for the rapper, no rest for the worried
Now everybody in the world heard of Keith Murray
When the hype dies down and reality sets in
We all goin through the same thing for a friend
And it ain't nothin good in the hood
Your own people will stab you in the back
Set you up and get you good
From the start, I came from the heart
Giuliani got the nerve to oppose the million youth march
They confiscated my passport, though I might of boated
I'm young black and dangerous that's why I got railroaded
And magazines, as if it's been misquoted, let it be noted
They can't break me to the streets I'm forever devoted

Yo
I'm tellin you man, this is life, you gotta live this life
Would you fall, would you make it, you never know
Today was a bad day
Livin proof of the truth, locked the fuck up, on some bullshit
You know, you livin, right or wrong
It was a bad day
But yo keep your shit tight, 'cause when the get you they get you good
I had a bad day
Yeah, I understand you had a bad day",Bad Day
Keith Murray,"Phase one

I grab the Henny and twist the top
Guzzle it that's when the reaction starts
I split the chalk with the dutch
Had the hash in the greenery, then the L get sparked
Keith Murray's never smokin on babith
Niggas give me dirt and I throw it in the garbage
Actual facts, writin exact, sacks of African Black
I smoke two back to back
I smoke so much I choke out fire alarms
With the towel under the door feel the effect of the bar
Put Visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Looked in the mirror, said to myself yo you high as hell
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
Inahle it through your mouth, freeze like you froze
Then *blowing sound*, blow it out yo nose

CHORUS: Repeat lines 11-14 2X

Me and the Funk Doctor Spot up top on the hop
Block two big jig hot shots coppin mots
Seasons slice precise, ice 'n' tights
Chickenheads that circle the block twice
If you chokin then pass 'cause it's not a game
Bitches hit my blunts and never feel the same
They start actin strange and kinda erotic
I try to tell her you ain't nothin bout no chronic
Ahh drats I think I'll take a long walk
And light a fat one up for the sargeant general of New York
Who determine gettin lifted kill brain cells maybe
If it wasn't for weed, niggas would be goin crazy
So smell it from afar, comin from the bar
Or rushin out when I open up the car door
Whether home or party in a bag or a jar
Put that lah in the air and represent with a stand form

CHORUS 2X

I'm not sayin I'ma a pothead, 'cause I'm not
I'm just sayin that I smoke a lot
Catch me in V.I.P. smokin with Dennis Scott
Or after the show in the parkin lot
I only buy weed from a selective few
'cause niggas is wicked and they will get you
I ran outta blunts got some paper from your mother
She had extra weed so we rolled another
No doubt, I hear you out
Before I roll my L, I think the cancer part out
I'ma kite 'cause I missed the buddah spot before the flight
And damn we gon be away for like 12 nights
So here I am in Amsterdam gettin high again
You know what, come to think of it, yo, I'd love a Heineken
Inhale it through your mouth, freeze like you froze
Then *blowing sound* blow it out yo nose

CHORUS",High as Hell
Keith Murray,"I'm incredible  I mix up shit like cake mix 
Keep it blazin hot  rhymes burn to keep you frost bit 
MC's is assed out cause they lost it 
Peep my foundation  the way I reinforce it 
I monitor movements  precisely 
Makin niggas hit high notes  like the Eisley's 
Finally  some bitches I can touch up 
Tie em to the grill of my Six  pop the clutch up 
Hush up  I rush up, inside your cut 
Make you puss up, then bust up, cause my shit bumps 
This Don's Trumps, kill straight cats and all chumps 
Cause ""Life is like a box of chocolate,"" Mr. Gump 
Uh, the ultimatum, lets abbreviate em 
LL platinum again, don't you hate 'I'm? 
A thin line between darkness and sunshine 
Five Percenters that was raised on swine 
Known to be wise, and you wise to understand 
Bringin me drama is a handstand in quicksand 
I've been hot so long, I'm immune 
Your rap career get cut short like Poom-Pooms

Now, from the streets to the suites and all around the world, 
They all recognize we (Incredible) 
We can stand in the water and can't get wet, 
You can bet your last dollar we (Incredible) 
We gets it on in the worst way 
All the homeboys and the girls say we (Incredible) 
From one brother to another 
They agree with each other, lyrically we both (Incredible) 

Adios, mios, Montageune 
We're too hot to hold and too bold to be controlled 
Your only skin-deep, my ugly comes from the soul 
I find the leaks, and E plug the holes 
I have more beef than filet mignon 
But got smart, and flushed the bullshit down the ?como? 
Rappers just started rappin last week, get a deal next week 
And go platinum next month 
But pass the blunt, so I can stay hy- like -dro 
Don't act like you don't know, I'm about to fly a flow 
I'm three from three from a three-point land 
With more devastation than a nigga can withstand 
Remember me? Untouched by any emcee 
I add verbal assault to your mental injury 
Cause I'm the vogit, toat it, quote it 
Five-0 said freeze, man I blowed it 
Ryhme strategies, no one's bad as this 
I sew up the populace like a seamstress 
A prisoner, doing time and the bit 
A grown man, and don't play with no kids; I'm incredible!

Mass hysteria illusion widespread across the world. Riots are reported in
London and the United Nations is calling for an emergency meeting.

Verse 1:
A-Yo back in the day I sold hand to hand crack
Escapin' jail all day to get my money back
Starving' so bad that my stomach touched my back
Anywhere that I went yo I didn't know how to act
Oh his chain is phat 
Fuck that snatch that flash the gat 
When all I really wanted to do was rap (1,2 y'all)
I've been preparing for this moment for years so step back
Cla clack take that catch a heart attack
I am the illest MC on the streets today
But fans say wack rappers shouldn't come my way
But I say
I destroy crews like an AK
Well OK please explain why you talk this way
Cause you can sell a million records and be wack (word up)
You can have mad skills and don't sell jack
It got my brain racin', heart pacin', fightin' incarceration
On the Internet in front of the whole nation
In front of the judge with a grudge and no budge
And no love
That's how it is when you a thug
If push comes to shove I rise above
And stay dedicated to rap like ghetto love

Hip in heat in the seat of the jeep
The more I try to get out the more I realize I can't
So I roll with the beat and sing the war chant
The power and the struggle in the concrete jungle
And the troubles in the rubbles of the brothers on the bubble
And yeah I heard your story your fuckin' niggas bore me
On how you goin' out in the blaze of glory
You ask Joe you sad as John Doe
You can fool some heads but the real niggas know (word up)
Niggas try to get on the mic with no skills
I got one question for you 
How that shit feel?
You feel you keepin' it real but you fake as a three dollar bill
My grandmother has more skill
My man A+ put the bug in my ear
But don't make me open that door and have to go there 
Because...

Verse 3:
Truethfully I went from havin' nothing to eat
To eatin' a feast
I went from chillin' on the streets to livin' in phat suites
I went from a twenty four hour day crime wave
To workin' in the studio with E gettin' paid
And it ain't no mystery people know the history behind me
And if you don't ask somebody on the street
But Murray never worry the girls love me very
Make a hit record quick fast in a hurry
Total captivation domination with conversation
That'll be talked about by the younger generation
Remedial MCs will always implement violence
That's because they ain't got no talent
So I suggest you rest and learn about the heart in your chest
Never the less fuck who's bein' the best
More small rappers unite for world peace (word up)

Keith Murray flips the undergroup cut dope funk flow chromotose
So listen close
I'm like the undertaker turning rappers into ghosts
Host and roast MC's like I'm suppose
I can send L.O.D. to bust caps perhaps
Bring E and Red and we can kick some raps
This track is so sickenin' and bouncin'
Make you nod your head so much you need counciling
I flow to a rough kind of mode
Competition run for cover cause I'm droppin' loads
No brainer crossing over in the Range Rover
Insainer pack heat like a super nova
Keith Murray gets it on and poppin'
Shut it down like administrative lockin'
Marble face poetry poverty hard
Perform like the ? 
We went from allies to enemies 
Stingin' like centipedes 
Sit around and watch death come in threes
I burn like lye

Spectacular monster rap or slasher
At the nightfall I'm after ya like Blackula
I rap with a Blackenstein frame of mind
Aircraft fly when I use to push my braids to the side
Slide from Keith Jekyle to Murray Hyde
My battle cry make niggas want to just lay down and die
It's imparitive that you feel the heritage I provide 
Comin' courtesy but with no Jive

Cause when I rock I got all the girls with me
Got niggas bouncin' off the wall like spider monkey
Bury the hatchet in the back of anybody tryin' to match it
It's the vulture new fulture gonna scratch it while you catch it
There's a hole in the bucket there lies a 
Nigga dead and stinkin' 
For sittin' around with his ass stinkin'
Flamboyant undunted most wanted 
Those that don't understand it better get up on it God damn it

We gonna let y'all niggas know to your face what's up.",Media
Keith Murray,"I'm a take you back to day one, livin' in this new york slum
It's deaf to the dumb, only break bread with some
Moms left at fifteen, had no American dreams
To this day I'm sellin' to my cousin, who's a fiend
No one would got me but my older brother
Little did we know the dirt we did fell back on my mother
But didn't care back then, that's why she left like that
Now my parents became the street, and it's best like that

Some nights I pray to God and ask him to pull my cord
'Cause times is hard like the opposite street'll leave you scarred
Street wise, with no respect for authority and shit
A chronic hustler of crack; a typical bitch
Raised by Madu, who strung out on a glass dick
But every now and then I blessed her with a hit
So she don't have to trick
It's prevalent amongst kids today
Hustle krills, stack dough, and everything's okay

[Chorus]
It's the emancipation proclamation under the self-devised guidelines
Of self preservation and starvation (I gotta live)
It's the emancipation proclamation under the self-devised guidelines
Of self preservation and starvation (and I gotta live)

My life in this world wasn't about diamonds and pearls
It was rough growin' up around the boys and girls
After daddy left, shit was a mess; momma stressed
But I give her an award, 'cause, damn, she tried her best
Holdin' down the household, barely had money to fold
Christmas time, cherished our little shit like gold
I can't front; daddy was still there for me, cared for me
But him and mommy breakin' up was like a nightmare to me

Yo, this is for the younger fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
Success is nothin' if it ain't; if it was with the others
We gotta make the best out of this terrible situation
If not for us, for the younger generation
We gotta break the chain, and deal with the pain
For all our people that was slayed in vain (revenge)
For all our peoples that was falsely framed (revenge)
For all our peoples that's livin' the name

[Chorus]

Let me show; I gotta love L.O.D., they put me under they wing
And then I teamed up with the most beautiful thing
In the world, 'cause L.O.D. we all we got
I'm a fans and my mans keep it, like it or not
I know it hurts havin' to do everyday dirt
Police all over my back; feel like bustin' them jerks
When I'm my road to the riches, I stay away from snitches
And them bitches, and keep my mind on business

Life was tough, so I became aggressive like a pit
The only time I felt relaxed was when the blunt was lit
Thinkin' me and my team can be tight like the Gambino
Muscle in the hustle scene; respected like Leno
It gets deeper than the words of Proverbs
New thoughts emerge as I cop the squat on the curb
Thinkin' the herb; strengthen my brain like spinach
And heavy shine, flooded with ice might; reduce my self-spirits

Stick 'em; my life is so real it hurts
Like when I saw my pops bein' driven off in a hearse
Like when I saw my mother bein' driven off in a hearse
Like you school when the roach crawl out my shirt
Like on thanksgiving when we got free food from the church
Back then it was DJ Red Alert and Cool Herc
Rockin' been stripe knees and latigra shirts
Back then L.O.D. was puttin' in work

From the cradle to the grave
We all in the struggle, we gon' struggle, we gon' strive to stay alive
All my real people know what I'm talkin' about
Watch each other backs

With that bone chillin' horror killin' all on goin' drama
Save the rah rah for your mama

So who's an error when's a never?

In the black range look ya never ever worry
Parked in the front I hear voices sayin' ""That's Keith Murray""
The name of the game is fame 
You know the price you recognize the God like Christ
Masses of posses packed up schemin' 
Ladies love me they keep on screamin'
Expressin' all the feelin' of the world today
Some might listen to my music and try to say
Nothin' other than ""Yo this shit is dope""
And in the everyday life struggle Murray goes for broke
From day to day month to month year to year
I swear I tear any mic any stage anywhere
I be the standards of which excellence is measured 
So for me to rock all day it'll be my pleasure

Ride wit me (Def Squad) 
Roll down your windows and ride wit me (uptown) 

Ride wit us 
Bitch ride wit us 
Ride wit us 
Roll up your windows and ride wit us 

Lets smoke this Oakland indoe 
Don't roll down the window 
Start the car 
We ain't going too far 

You know that big 'bootied' girl you always fuckin' wit 
She got a sister I really wanna get 
Some Georgia girls from college park 
You already fucked when we get that started off 

Park in the driveway, it won't take long 
Do it like that, it goes on and on 
You know this the kind of shit, I know you want
E made the beat let me show you somethin' 
Quite a few haters want to see us played out
 
But we got the formula to get payed now 
You can't stand in the way of success 
We got the same job but you make much less 
I remember how it used to be, before we had crack 
If you had a few hundred in your pocket that was fat

[Chorus]
If you feel like smokin' then ride wit us 
Hop the train with no token then ride wit us 
And if you don't give a fuck then ride wit us 
Roll down your windows and ride wit us 
And if you got five on it then ride wit us 
And if you ain't fake niggas then ride wit us 
And if your crew pull trigges then ride wit us 
Roll up your windows and ride wit us 

Ah-yo, I lick two shots that's heard all around the world 
Check how a forty and a blunt can take a nigga girl 
Like E.F. hunting, don't say nothin', I'm haunting 
On the microphone, its the eve of destruction
 
As the world goes around like Passion 
You get flattened in an orderly fashion 
You was warned like a coming attraction 
I got playa hated, felt liberated 
Put him on the burner cause the nigga violated 

We scamper like guard dogs through the fog 
If you feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog 
The sergeant general get busy chief 
The fastest way to spell rhyme relief is Keith 

I leave you assed out like a cocaine drought 
Hey yo can I get a witness like Andre Krouch 
Niggas need to stop frontin' 
Bitches need to stop stuntin' 
Cause they know fuck well they can't stop my production 

[Chorus] 

I got the forty acres without the fuckin' mule 
Doc Ike Turner givin' mics audio abuse 
I smack a big mouth bitch, and her babysitter 
And her lesbian friend, and that nigga wit her
 
I don't give a fuck, I smack blood out a midget 
My tactics make evil D say come on kick it 
A black five wit rims, what you can spot me in 
Wanna die, I snatch you like Doc Kevorkian
 
So turn the beat up 
While NARCs got me on sweep up 
I'm lucky, I usually tote more Guns than Peter 
I fuck you up to where your forehead will cut meat up 
You wanna box, I square more than Matt Asenerina 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this) 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this0

[Chorus]",Ride Wit Us
Keith Murray,"Intro:
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
This is for only certain people (word up)
This is for all my peoples in the struggle
All my peoples in jail
All my peoples dyin' to live

Verse One:
On my way home alone I took the shoertcut through the danger zone
Ran into alligator looking Jerome
I jumped out the truck all drunk
Nuts hanging out the car like ""what?""
Nigga, I gives a fuck
He said ""what up"" I said ""what up""
He said ""I need to be up""
I went in my nuts hit him with a 100 yo
He gave me a glare with sparklin' gold teeth
And said
Yo Keith, your product is always peace
Yo son, you know I just got released
I was on the block and got bagged by pussy police
And they the reason why Calvin is deceased 
The bullshit will never cease but dough is comin' at least
I gave him a pound and a hug
Told him ""hold it down thug""
Peace
I'm a fleece 'cause its hotter than fish grease
We was high as a kite
Feelin' kinda petro
I metroed
My way back to the Montero
Before I even made it to the car door
I was rushed by 2 jakes 
and then 2 more
so here wew are fightin' through all the excitement I ask
What you lockin' me up for?
One said Secret Indictment

Chorus: (2x)
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
The gates are locked 
And you are trapped inside

Verse Two:
Starin' at the face of the judge
With the identical image of a true thug
I shoulda smuggled in a shotty (word up)
'cause they tryin' to treat me like I killed somebody
And what the D.A. had to say
Wasn't justice in no kinda way
Under the doc number 284389
We the people recommend upstate time
I said your honor
I can't even see that far
That's when my lawyer started droppin' the repetoir
He said your honor
These allegations against my client are very undefient
Toward the contrary
The judge said
Mr. Murray didn't I tell you if you in my courtroom again 
Your ass is gone a long time
Then he presumed
Plus your a member
Of the notorius gang
the Legion of Doom
He said look at me
Thought he shook me
I turn around and the bastard 
Through the book at me
I hope this teaches you a lesson
A half a million dollar bail
Boom
This court is in session

Verse Three:
I reach the tear visions of pair
Remind me I'm locked up
So I got no chance but not to give a fuck
Check out my perspective as it dropped
A lock across ya chest
And bust ya snotbox
Technicalites make me want to bust chops and cops
And murder flocks in all actualities
That's a necessity in my recipe
Plus it was a black cop that framed me
And if it ain't one thing
It's another ask my brother
Went in jail for one thing
Stayed in for another
So here I am frustrated
Sittin' in jail
Thinkin' bout all my unfinished business left in the world
I hopped on the jack connect with my connect
Told him what I was up against
Plus they found a Tech
Get the cash together
Put up the car and the house
We on the jail phone
So watch what come out ya mouth
In 24 hours I was out
But the situation's never ended
'cause the case is pended
To be continued",Secret Indictment
Keith Murray,"""Yo  this shit right here  is some shit  some serious shit"" 

Yo  the fact that I'm down wit Def Squad's hard to determine 
Till you see me hoppin out the Coupe wit E Sermon 
Or hoppin out the Keith Murray Suburban 
Or hoppin out the Lex Land wit Redman  wildin and cursin 
My thought process is mysterious like the Lochness 
My furious mindset is complex 
Killin shit like a carnivorous millitant prehistoric monster 
Comin to stomp all over you hip-hop conference 
Landed in an Unidentified Flying Object 
Turn you into an unidentified frying carcus 
The smell of raw flesh make you nauseous 
Acidest arsonist, burnin your bones to carbon and phosphorus 
My metaphors sting like after haircuts when 
The alcohol is applied to the raw skin 
So whoever want to battle get blasted 
Get your teeth enamel shattered, shitted on like Pampers 
You had a bad bitch, I left the back twist 
I stuck my dick in everything from asshole to the nasal passage 
Dug her out all day, then changed my sperm DNA 
Now she got nobody to blame 
I been spittin raw, what the fuck you think I'm livin for 
Throw me in jail, I'll do a prison tour 
For wannabe hard niggaz, insecure niggaz 
Wit they heads to big for they neck to support niggaz 
Three in the Squad plus me equal four members 
An extra addition for any special force mission 
Man listen 

Ain't these niggaz on some shit 
Keith Murray, Canibus ain't no stoppin it uhh 

Let me draw a brief description of what happened 
I was rappin, niggaz got the scrappin, guns got the clappin 
Three-fifty-seven degrees I was separated 
Have bullets deflected metal, bodies decapitated 
GUSH!! a nigga got struck as I look 
I caught the next guy runnin by wit the metal hook (BOO-AHH!!) 
Blew his back open, blood gushed on my face 
A bitch fainted 'cause she seen I enjoyed the taste 
The case is that I split your melon 
And feed it to the jigga-boos wit fried chicken wings 
I'm wildin for Long Island, I turned and took Charles Ferguson 
And open fire on any trains now 
You may never know who's in your shadow 
You punk ass niggaz just best stay shallow 
And hollow, if you want to live to see tomorrow 
'cause ain't no sun comin out tomorrow 
Yo, I might do something y'all niggaz might regret like 
Blast you in your face and disregard your vest 
I'm pissin and dissin off of recognition and niggaz to listen 
Just to let you pussies know how I'm livin 
'cause I Return like the Jedi, wit my dead eye 
Leave niggaz to die, peace to niggaz up in Bed-Stuy 
Oh-ah, this that type of shit that make them niggaz want to wet it 
Word up, got me ready to set it 
 
Seems I steps wit aggression 
To any bitch who think they nice in this profession 
What? what you think your wrecking? 
I break your stlye down to little fragments 
The pain is permanent, so spare yourself the embarrassment 
Buck-fifty 'cross the face 
Followed by knife wounds to the chest for you attempt to retaliate 
I noticed all you bitches flows is based around clothes 
But Deja Vu got something for you stankin hoes 
Studio gangsta bitches I diminish ideas of bringin beef 
Before the thought even finishes 
I want to see red, blood from a chicken head 
'For I wild the FUCK OUT like the Grateful Dead HA 
This wild style must run in my genes 
Because my sister's in the county 
And my brother just came home from Green 
I strike like the black widow, through the underground radio 
Kitto and still stack dirty ditto",Some Shit
Keith Murray,"Verse 1

When I rap competition perform disappearing acts
I jam suckers like smuckers
My squad is funky like a six pack of motherfuckers
With conversation my creations will collider nations into confrontation
Competition couldn't stand a chance
I'll wear you out like if I had one pair of pants
Murray emphasises cadarac poetry meaning you blind bats can't see me
Throughout my career I rip year to year successfully
Dragging debree in my vicinity
My symbol is the sickle like the Grim Reaper
My style is the greatest invention since the speaker
A pyschopath with a knife in my voice 
The lyrical homocidal madman is top choice
The scene I scope it first because I'm homophobic
And then I rope-a-dope it
And dominate the sight of  bloody red
Coming out my head leaving rappers brain dead
I come through like POW! and BAM!
Reppin' like the lyrical version of Shazaam (Damn!....)
When I rap

Chorus(2x)

[L.L. Cool J sample] Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
[DMX sample] Believe what I say!
[Keith Murray] When I rap

Verse 2

When I rap one hand can't clap
So lets squash the beef cook it and we all can get fat
Try to swallow a line and you'll find
I'm one hard act to follow rollow in my vibe
Swallow and your throat will explode
Sending you through schizophrenic episodes
My style is so well off on it's own 
I leave it unattended and go see my dog about a bone
When I'm the microphone ( When I rap )
And biting niggas will leave it alone
I go together with the rhythm like a sentence and some verbs
And herbs so check out every word
I kicked a verse for Father Time
He put the world on pause cause I fucked his head up with a rhyme
Diamond studded rough and rugged fuck it
There's nothing left for you to do now but kick the bucket
Dummy who's ever flipping
It better be a round-off back hand-spring arabian summy
With more concentration then an acrobat
When I rap

Chorus

Verse 3

When I kick the gift of gab and I'm grim and I'll be god damned
If any mortal or immortal man can withstand
And not slam my jams cause I take them on a trip
And flip the script with legit manuscripts
Fogging up the mic with real legit compounds
Mass mic Murray man flurries in the bound
Oh what the fuck you fall and can't get up when I erupt
So pass the buck cause you've been struck
With the will I learn will I burn
Off carbon dioxide cause I'm on the flip side
Word conducter emcee destructer
Millions be saying ""That Murray's a motherfucker!""
I dip and dive punch you in your eye
In a battle if you try to lie in your rhymes when we socialize
I'm beating Mother Nature down to her knees
While making more papers than trees
You can't be serious that's impossible
I leave niggas laid up in the hospital
Bandaged from head to toe and hat
My shit is intact when I rap

Chorus(4x)",When I Rap
Keith Murray,"[interlude]

Yeah, yo, Def Squad, Full Cooperation on this one yo, total concentration
Wassup wit these cats out there?, I don't think they figured, son
I don't think they hear you son, ha ha

[Keith Murray]

Now first but not least you will respect Keith, lay a nigga down
Like a doo-rag in some grease, you must be crazy tryin to play me
I been dedicated since King Tut the third baby
Lyrical chemist rhyme minister, diminished you for the benefit
Then continue to kill shit for the fuck of it, I see y'all been writin
Still bitin, still lookin lame, half y'all niggaz still soundin the same
I'm excitin when live on stage, when receiting in lighting, frightening
lightning
Throwin thunder in chain, when i first came, I gave birth to a million MC's
In the game, who should all carry my last name
And I'm Gonna Get You Sucka like Damon Wayans, and fame like Jermaine
Bring pain and novacaine, okay y'all lil monkeys want to play?
My Squadron brings the art of war the correct way (OKAY!)
Chorus 2x

Chorus
I need your full cooperation and total attention
There's a few things I'd like to mention, these rappers out here swear they're
So appealing I, step to your business and hurt your feelings

[Erick Sermon]

Okay, well thinkin it's okay to rhyme that way, you'll be P.O.W., M.I.A.
And I'm seven steps ahead of you, five from eternity
An all that shit you kick just don't concern me, I separate the dead from 
The chump, ask a nigga blunt, ""Yo, how many lumps you want?""
So flavorous you could taste it, so hardcore I wrote this layin on the floor
In the basement, my style ain't no walk in the park, got mainstream MC's
Scared to rhyme after dark, an there Ain't No Half-Steppin
I'm reppin like a nuclear weapon, manifestin the Immaculate Conception
Lyrically I rape an MC like sodomy, add tragedy, to your odessy
For battle reservations call 1-900-SQUAD, frontin on us
Is like frontin on God
Chorus

[Redman]

Now when we take it there, these three niggas in the square
My squad hangs out like fourhundred pounds in braziers
My deathrow allines, bein signed then aligned to electric
So it clear like a chair in Texas, HOT, approach wit extreme caution
No horsin around when my squad abortion a sound
Our crew's like Smokey off sokey, even Little Bo Peep, your style is weak
Guard your Rollie, wit all the ice in it, I snatch the ice out and put a price
out
Cop a Benz, put my mom in it, as long as I'm alive I'mma keep the vibe
24-7, 365

[Keith Murray]
Keith Murray's, comin from the North South East and Left
Rhymin to death, makin a world when I take a deep breath
With a body boom bash, my paragraph a trey-deuce
Human behavior in a psychopath
Ooooh, I might lose my cool, and break fool
and pull out my get busy tools
I write like a mad journalist
to funk, that's deeper than a bottomless spliff (that's my word)
The most beautifulest thing in this world
is my notion, for murderous poetry in motion
And the illiotic shit I come across
form a leash you're trapped in with explosive force
I push your head through the cracks of sanity
and leave your brain doin a bid in purgatory
It's ninety-six degrees in the shade
before I catch blood on my blade
I take my frustration to the stage
and gets open dope and stupid bumblin rumblin tracks
When I rap my jams be packed like a laundromat
My context'll wreck your whole concept
Cause my delivery is so complex
And I'm inter-galactic on plastic
with the super distinguish that I kick
I'm high strung at the top of my lung
with my tongue makin hardcore niggaz want to get dumb
My dialogue comes straight from the slums
Damnage to your medula, cerebrum and cerebellum
if ya got a crew ya better tell em

Keith Murray,"Yo, the fruit don't fall far from the tree
Yeah, uh

My grandfather use to tell me
This place ain't got nothing to offer you
Don't you see all the changes everybody going through
This family got problems and they do too
But everybody wanna tell you what they think you should do
He said watch them so called friends and them girls too
Sonny do you like they did Jesus crucify you
As he sat there in his chair looking out the window
I'm thinking when you can't get away where do you go?
(Inside your mind) man child never had a chance to be young
Either you selling drugs or out there on the binge strung for some
There's only two places to go the morgue or the Pen
For some school is an option entertainment to alternate them
Then they'll try to exploit you discriminate you
Use you as a tool make money and live in luxury off you
And we so confused we wanna believe in something
So they promise us the world but give us nothing

I say we can be all in this together
Yeah, will you end up like, your family tree
Tell me what you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do
Your mind ain't too far from the sky

The death of a loved one remind you of yourself don't it?
Knowing you could be next at any given moment
Like Twine I used to call him a brother of mine
His pops was a drunk and his mother was blind
He use to stay at my hose sometimes my moms didn't mind
We was just nickel and dime hustlers wasting time
Living in the streets targeted and forced to kill
Dualistically we learned how to lie and steal
Gangsters of the future modern days thugs
Seem like me whole hood is covered in blood
Traveling a ruff life in the eye of the storm
Now I wear their life stories tattooed on my arm
Psyc's grandmother passed away on April fools day
Then her funeral was on her birthday shit is real
My man had four baby moms and two on the way
And trying to make a living for them passes away in vein
God bless him, ask Skeeta

Child of the streets well, well, well, well
Will you end up like your family tree?
Tell me what you gonna do 3X
(Child of the streets, understand the habits
Behind the child of the streets)

They try to fuck my fame up tear my name up
Turn around and sue me fuck my little bit of change up
I knew it was going to be some shit to get me for some cream
I saw it in my subconscious world like a vision
At first it hurt me like a knife in the heart
But by nature I continued to live out my part
As art imitates life and life imitates art
Don't respect the streets and they tear your ass apart
It's important that my understanding understood
But it's more important that it's understood in the hood
And to all the females in the Pen stay strong
Any day in jail girl is a day too long
And for those who had to do what they did to slide
Now running like a fugitive to save the live you live
Put in a box saw my step pops
He said boy Keith what the blood clot how much time you got?

Child of the streets little sister
Tell me where will you lay your head?
Child of the streets little brother
Where will you make your bed?
Y'all tell me what y'all gonna do
What y'all gonna do
Tell me what y'all gonna do
Tell me",Child of the Streets (Man Child)
Keith Murray,"Yeah, this the build up, oh no, you knew we was coming back
But you ain't know we was coming back like this

Yeah, uh huh, Keith Murray, uh huh, Def Jam, yeah, Def Squad
Keith Murray gon' make you go uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, Def Squad gonna make you go ah, ooh, ooh, ah

I come on stomping mud holes in tracks like Timbaland
The producer and the booth, niggas so don't get cute
I come through in the coupe with the chopped off roof
Humiliate you then blast you in your birthday suit

You a small side order of apple cider
I'm a three hots in a cot dungeon rider
My hardcore street team crash the party with Def Jam
And incorporate murda like Gotti

How about in back of the yellow cab like Seinfeld
Chew you like little neck clams on half shells
I got a hypochondriac flow that get real ill
Get nauseous to the beat, I spit sick at will

And the time has come and your shit is sour
You need to turn your flow up an hour
Give you a permanent lean, like the Pisa Tower
With a hoes that will wet you down like a cold shower

Yo we got the shit on lock, uh huh
Come through and blast the spot, yeah man
And my name is the record, so check it, when I put it on record
Everybody say, ""Oh, my goodness""

And my folks if you with me where you at? Yes sir
If you love what I'm doing holla back, talk to me
And when I step on the scene, a lean mean wrecking machine
Everybody scream, ""Oh, my goodness""

And yeah, I hear you talking motherfucker write the check
And if you in the house then protect your neck
I'm 'Mister see you anywhere it's gon' be a showdown'
So ya'll better have lyrics when I come 'round

Cause I ain't lost a battle since God knows when
Some niggas tried to front but they gots no win
Taught how to prevent to lose and handle the win
Like birds are made to fly and fish made to swim

Wait a minute, homie you don't really know me, homie
I'll take you to a picnic boy you lunch meat
With my dazzling appearance and my world wide clearance
I am treacherous, inferior, impermanent, impetuous

I rock like an archaeologist
Draw a picture like a forensic artist, perform like a dramatist
I'm fabulously wicked, miraculous
Rustic, majestic, ridiculous, oh, my goodness

Yo we got the shit on lock, uh huh
Come through and blast the spot, yeah man
And my name is the record, so check it, when I put it on record
Everybody say, ""Oh, my goodness""

Oh, my goodness
Keith Murray gon' make you go uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, Def Squad gon' make you go ah, ooh, ooh, ah
Oh, my goodness

And you in line motherfucker like them people in court
So when I see you I'm a pop your top like a cork
I pack flow like ammo, spit like camels
Come through and bless your whole crew like achoo

But some still wanna holla, pop they collar
Fucking with me like I run a funeral parlor
Linguist, lyricist out for chips like Estrada
Bilingual emcees even couldn't even couldn't do me nada

With this mic I'm handy, flows be dandy
It's a full moon and hoes wanna fuck like Brandy
Yeah, I've been hated on, you probably heard it
And I kicked their little ass but them niggas deserved it

And I'm still in the hood and I still rep the hood
Still tee'ing off for a long green like Tiger Woods
I ain't even gotta say it, ya'll know when it's hot
So ya'll go back up in the vocal box

Yo we got the shit on lock, uh huh

To make me want to lick your funky emotions
She can make a crippled man walk and a blind man see
How can I put this? hmm
She can make the Grinch love Christmas
How can I manifest her uniqueness in vernacular?
(Like a chocolate candy bar) yeah that describes her

[Chorus: x4]

(She looks like a)
I seen her at the park on the black top watching the kids play
Hey style complimented the sunny day
There's a mild nature about her
Gentle but firm for all the bullshit life brought her way
You reflected beauty of a starless night by far
Like Billy Joel said ""I take you just the way you are!""
I had a crush on you since the days of love tap
Karate shoes you had jelly cornrows with the peas in the back
I knew you'd grow to be a fine specimen someday
You the very inspiration for the song I sing
The way you sprint the runway and scale the catwalk
Your life is a movie and the camera's never off
It's like love at first taste, coming deep from within
From your DNA structure to your whole body ova
Your beauty is respected in the eye of the beholder
I love that little chocolate bar tattered on your shoulder

[Chorus: x4]

(She looks like a)
Oh yeah the time is now and the place is here
So come a little closer let me kick it in your ear
And share this wit you girl you super official
I just want to bite you girl you look good like a Snickers
Ooh la la, ah wee wee, walking by looking all like I Ecstasy
Got doe ma didn't know, good gracious alive!
Aw shuck now, there she go
Hey yo come and rest your feet my little chocolate soufflet
I know you're tired you been running through my mind all day
And Oh My Goodness! can I get a witness?
This roundy brownie is something to see
I never had a craving like this before, I'm addicted
Lord have mercy! please give me strength!
Dark, rich and thick like a fresh baked cake
Just thinking of your shape girl I catch a tooth ache

Keith Murray,"Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo the streets is hungry - word
Its time to eat most definitely
Grab ya plate
Get ya knives and ya forks yea
Keith Murray Get ready

Yo as I look out at the high rise
And right about my life into the sunrise
Lookin' at the smoke where the twin towers stood
Forty blocks away forty stories high I could see it good
But we been at war and under attack
We got P.O.W.s fightin' to get back in jail
And these affected by the poverty war
We pack gats frontline and will endure
I go to bed with god and wake up with the devil
In a battle I blacked out and beat a man with a shovel
Its obligatory that you hear my side of the story
He had the face a fear, shakin' like a leaf on a tree
You just another potential casualty
This is a walkin' corpse song and the beat is your conspiracy theory
And the time is getting more scary
So pack when necessary and say your L.O.D. Hail Marys

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo I'm eye of a tiger inside the head of a liar
Give 'em pure hell brimstone and fire
This is MC cannibalism by connoisseur
From the lyrical lexicon matador of metaphor
Yo from the little voice in my conscience
I might just leave your fuckin' ass unconscious
Yea I seen you wit with that smirk on
You little fuckin' clown I turn that smile into an upside down frown
Produce chaos in the culture of the enemy
You will never posses the skills to defeat me
I be the all eye seein' you hear it sporadic
I rhyme at will be on your ass automatic
With thoughts of power I rain thunder showers
I eat a lot of brain food and you'll get devoured
Man hunt chase of the night stalker off da leash walker
My dog is a fire barker

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo from the instinctual coming of the insect
To the mind of a genius and the heart of a prophet
To them bootlegged niggas and the chicks that cop it
Ask anyone they know how the fuck drop it
And coastin' constant motion essential
With fusion nuclear potential
You hear a cold whisper you see da mask of a phantom acts wailin'
Deranged assailant
I tame the rage, isolate, chase and kill my prey
Walk the lion outta da cage
And that's a part of life or should I say death
Reach in your mouth snatch out ya very last breath
Searchin' my subconscious for the meaning
I'm sweatin' blood bullets cause my whole world is bleedin'
Ooh now check how I come at you
I will eat you defeat you I'm parasitical

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

There's no where you can run
No way to hide
The world is a cage and we all locked inside
So you might as well fight to survive
Yea yea

Keith Murray,"I'm always getting shitted on son, ain't gonna be no, no different
Can you accept me as I am? I ask you
Always, the love lords? I need you
Can you open your heart to mine and accept me and all my faults
During the human course activity, watch me give me my room
I am radiant, give me my space, I am light

[Verse 1]
Yo, 2/27/98 I wrote a check out
to H.W. funeral home for my little sister Christina
15 years old damn man this fuckin world is so cold
8 months before I had to do three years
Coming from the air port my face burning with tears
I had this black cloud hovering over me
Far back as I can check back down my family tree
Its been with me since my first LP
2nd LP I was sittin in court
3rd LP I was trapped in the belly of the beast, got it back to the streets
by the power of the mind and positive of light
some say livin is death and dying is life
I say pray for me that I should be born tonight
I remember roaming the streets in those cold winter nights
Look at me this is my life

[Chorus]
Suddenly my life feels so alone, tell me what the hell is going on
Tell me, tell me, why my life feels so alone, so wrong
Tell me what the hell is going on
Help me, please help me

[Verse 2]
I can't even begin to explain the mental anguish
I went through as a child when I heard my pops had passed
I went to see him on the sick bed
with my grandmother, that day I knew it was the last
I loved him but I had to grow up without him
Over the years I've lived through frustrations and questions
In 90' I went to jail as an adolescent
Then in 92' my moms had to go back to the essence
Got me thinkin about the meaning of my existence (I lost my best friend)
I realised the devil was spying on my from a distance
He don't want me to receive my blessings he fear me
My family suffered more deaths then the Kennedy's
This is real and if you don't believe me ask someone that grew with me
Know them and feel my energy
Please never fabricated nor duplicated so I ask you
Can you open you hearts and minds and receive me with all my faults
Can you open your hearts and minds unconditionally to begin to understand my cause
Hey yo this world is a pool of sharks
But I'm the animal right when I stand up for myself and bark
And this year I gotta go all out for it
I've been hustlin for 13 years, nothin to show for it (I mean nothin)
Lookin over my bills damn they eaten me up
Entertainment task force watchin so what the fuck
I paid my taxes too fuck you and your uncle
The laws of nature will see me through
And yeah I peep it and naw it ain't no secret
How niggaz give their word with no intentions to keep it
I'm givin you the roots of the real
My emotional feelings bi-polar is how I feel

[Chorus]",Christina

Spit like this, get my wrists all glittery
Get cake, snakes get slithery
Lean in, show why'all the meaning of chivalry
Rap ruler, you could ask Buddha
Right jab like Zab Zuda
Every member on my team is the shooter
Tight like a womb, no room for intruders
Spark Buddha, twistin' the Philly
And Good Humor, don't be silly
It's gravy baby, I got it all smothered
Like makeup, I got it all covered
Want a jewel, don't be cruel
It's authentic, don't be fooled
By these phony accusations
Backlash and slanders
Front, and they put pits in ya
Stunts and propaganda
Keep it private, 'cause I'm the commander
In chief, I never stop like beef
Gimme a break, I might shake the building place
Say vacate all women and children

Warm like campfires
Matter of fact, I'm blazin'

Took her to the stu and seduced her
Let her do a skit, then she hit my producer (Oh)
Not whatcha used to, I'm looser
Ya need to stop fuckin' with them losers, now who's up
The mystic ruler, grand imperial
Filthy, but milky like cereal
Bang this in ya stereo

Then I'ma take her to Jamaica
And I give her a reason to get curious
But ya pain, it ain't that serious
MC's ran with this and that
But change your name to Saran 'cause it's a Wrap

Chillin' with the Legion of Doom at an early age
Watchin' all the older niggas in the hood get paid
Yo I knew I could get it if I wanted to
Cause I lived on the corner where all the base heads came through
So it was only write that I get me just do B
Shit, I ain't choose hustlin', hustlin' chose me
This my block, I live here I sell drugs here
Let a nigga come through and slit my throat
I dare I swear, I got the tre eight in the tree
And the guage is right over there! Where?
In the bushes for you douches with one eye out
A nigga keep lookin'
For the police and them base heads juxin'

Wher u get the new sneakers from I know I ain bought 'em""
I told her ""[? ] my uncle Tejuan bought 'em""
I grew up around hustlers, she knew I'd try it
She asked me was I doin' it you know I denied it
But I was tired
I wanted what I wanted when I wanted it
Fuck the consequeces I knew just how get
Cop that, cook that, chop that, pitch that
Save that, get stacks, fresh kicks, new hat

To make y'all happy with Mary J. who Puff came to get (Me)
Then who called for Total to make y'all see (Me)
Then who he called again for Special Delivery (That a be me)
There's nothin you could tell me, I rocked every hole in the wall
Then arena to arena with R. Kelly
Who made you feel beautiful while gettin lifted (Me)
I rocked bells with L you must be stupid
I don't need no permission, to do what I do
Come through and show the whole world how I do

[Chorus: Tyrese]
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your sh*t together (*Right here, yo!)

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
And who you know get out of jail and get them figures
Get back into the game like f**k the system
Hit the studio and bless y'all with Fatty Girl
Who got 'em sayin ba donk a donk around the world
Now I'm hearin I got anger issues on the street
The only anger I got, is when I'm f**kin up a E beat
Keep runnin your lips and I'm a have you dancin like the crips
Turn your six pack to some barbeque rib tips
Mother hot damn this man jam like a phone
And plus the sh*t I get more draws than a dresser 
When I flow, there's no one deafer
Make you make the ugly face like Lamont's Aunt Ester
You can't stealth me my tank is too healthy
Even negative situations help me
When E lace the beat, and me and Ty bust one
Trust son that's money in the bank like a trust fund

[Chorus: Tyrese] 
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your shit together

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
Yo! Keith Murray is your (?) MC Ultra
With the sickest comeback like ni**a I told ya
Honeys sweat me like conversation, mind affiliation
House niggas like the Fannie Mae Foundation
The K don't play f**k around touche' and toupee
What you say get done away like Faye
I rhyme flagrant you sweeter than a sugar fragrance
Ignoramus, blow your brains out on a pavement 
The game we been milkin for awhile like a green cow
You seregant MC, that ain't your style
Metaphors dawn on you in time like revelations
Battlin Keith, self mutilation
Let it be sensible, I'll make you invisible
Ni**as can't see me the flow is invincible
My style royalty like residuals
You subjectable, hospitable y'all niggas is despicable

[Chorus: Tyrese] 
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better

We'd have to be crazy to pass it up

Keith Robinson,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

You must have been the star
You took it too far, yeah girl

I spend nights all alone
Couldn't reach you on the phone, my baby
Tell me, where were you?

Now you miss, what we had
It's too late, my baby
Again I sing this song to you

Sorry, sorry, baby, it's over now
You went for yours, now I'm going for mine
Sorry, sorry, baby, it's over now
You went for yours, now I'm going for mine

Ooh, you played me girl
Ooh, you ruined a good thing
Yeah girl, yes, you did

Listen girl, you got the best of me
And now girl, we're through
Tell me girl, what can I do?

Sorry, sorry, baby, it's over now
You went for yours, now I'm going for mine
I said, ""Sorry, sorry, baby, it's over now
You went for yours and now I'm going for mine""

Why did you have to hurt me, girl?
Why did you have to do me wrong?
I loved you, baby?
Now I gotta, I gotta sing this song?

Keith Sweat,"(Why, why me, baby) Girl, I need to know why
(Why me, baby) What did I do, girl, what did I do
(Why, why me, baby)
You broke my heart

Check this out, honey
It seems like 99 years have gone by
Since the last time I talked to you, you know
I never realized that somethin` so innocent and so sweet
Could make a man feel so much pain
Times you`d jump out of my car and I`d chase you till I was out of breath
Go to your job and pick you up
But you never showed up that day
Where were you, baby
Who was you seein`, it`s a hurtin` feelin`, sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin` me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
'Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin` I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late
You hurt me, baby
But hey, I`m man enough to admit it
What I want to know is why

(Why, why me, baby) {Tell me why, baby, tell me why}
(Why, why me, baby) Tell me, baby
(Why, why me, baby) Tell me, baby
You broke my heart, baby {Check this out}
(Why)

Yo`, the way it happened was crazy
We had a argument
I didn`t see you for two or three days
And then when I go to the movies to get you off my mind
I see you sittin` there holdin` hands with the next man
Caught you on the phone a couple of times, but it was always your cousin
Step off, just a friend
People used to tell me, ¡°L, she was fakin`¡±
But I couldn`t see it, I was blinded by love
Nothin` was too expensive
No night was too rainy
I was always there for you
I did things few call me a fool for doin`
Droppin` your friends off, all that
All I wanted in return was your undivided attention and love
If my heart had eyes it would cry
You`re still in my world
Life is worth livin` love
Tell me why

(Why, why me, baby) Why would you do it to me, baby, yeah, yeah
(Why, why me, baby) You hurt me so bad when you left me, baby
(Why, why me, baby)
You broke my...heart, baby {Tell 'em what time it is, Keith}
(Why) {Tell 'em what time it is}

I walk around talkin` to myself
Do another day gets nothin`
Am I goin` crazy, baby
I look at the photograph that we once shared
And think about the moment, yeah, yeah
About each other
Remember the poems I used to say to you, girl

There`s a right and a wrong way to love somebody
I`ll always give all my love to you
I`m on a merry-go-round and round
Girl, how deep is your love
I`ve got to go outside in the rain
It`s nice to believe that we can last forever

You really broke my heart.
I tried to play you,
But you played me first.
It was so foolish, oh, how it hurt.
I think about you, each and every day.
Oh baby, hear these words I say:

[Chorus]
Can we make love for old time sake?
I remember, girl, the love we used to make.
You were mine before you were his.
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on.

As I sit and wipe my eyes,
I begin to question why.
Ask myself what went wrong;
Why we didn't last for long?
You blame me and I blame you,
There was nothin' left to do.
If we woulda thought it out
We prolly coulda worked it out.
Now you don't belong to me,
I think about you constantly.
What am I supposed to do?
I musta been a damn fool
To let your lovin' slip away.
I think about you everyday.
I must have been crazy... to let you get away.

[Chorus]

He don't love you right,
I know he don't hold you tight.
Girl I know what you like,
Oh yeah...

Can we make love?
Can we make love?
Can we make love?
Come on, come on.",Can We Make Love

Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade

We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago you were my love
Oh my love

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds

And what I did was for me and you

Girl, can't you see what you're doin' to me?
Is this the way you want things to be?
Gave you everything that I have
You treat me so cold, you treat me so bad
Girl, can't you see you're killin' me?
Is this the way you want things to be?
My mind is so damn confused
Tell me what am I to do?

I was on the grind movin' bricks
You was tryin' to bring me back 
To nickels and dimes, you had to quit
I was servin' it
Ready to ride or die behind my partner
Ready to slang that nine at any time
Cuz I'm a rider
Nigga know, Lil' Wayne
Get down and dirty for this cheddar
And for me to let a broad interfere, nigga never
I was taught better than that
Slim and Baby gave me the ropes
And Rabbit taught me the game
And if you think I'm gon' let go
Then you can catch up with your thang
It ain't gon' happen

Why you treat me cold, cold, cold, cold?
Why you do me wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?
I was doin' what I had to do
And what I did was for me and you",Why U Treat Me So Cold

Nowadays all you do is lie to me, probably tired of me
My woman, you ain't gotta be
I tried to be your friend but I gotta go off intuition
Our relationship is a play, it needs an intermission
Drifting on memories when our love was strong
But baby I can reminisce alone

What wrong with my mind (whats wrong, whats wrong)
Whats come over me?
(Who is that somebody?)
Whats wrong with my ears
Theres a seed in me
(Who is that somebody?)
Whats wrong with my mind (whats wrong, whats wrong)
Whats come over me?

Uh. Excuse me Miss whats your name, Keith's back again so tell all your friends.
Keith Sweat, Lets go

I'm not hating on him but I beg a pardon 
'Cause I always see you cry and you never tell nobody why. 
I see you with your diamond ring. 
And he can buy you any brand name you choose 
I'd do the same thing if I was in his shoes. 
But what about the days. 
Like when he comes in the house. 
Taking it out on you. 
Thats when I start to come through (and then I fall past you)

Baby I will steal you ( I will Steal your Love )
Tonight (it tears me up) 

[Chorus]
It tears me up inside to see you crying out 
Pouring like a waterfall 
'Cause he don't treat you right 
Like a Porsche auto, uh to the nonstop pardon
That's not how you treat the woman of my dreams

Maybe I'm being major everything he does 
I know it kisses to the hugs 
I'm sitting here wishing it was us. 
Oh how can I take the game flip it upside down instead of him 
Baby girl I should be your man you should be sleeping in my bed. 
You're supposed to riding in the passenger seat of my car 
Let me make a move 
It's telestar sunshine baby I will steal you 
Tell your man he don't deserve you

It tears me up inside

Its painful to sit around watching the girl of my dreams
Its painful cause im alone and she the reason being

When I made my way to the house the word rolled out my mouth 
Excuse me miss what's your name its kind of hard for me to explain 
I've been watchin' but I'm not insane all I know is

Keith Sweat,"It's a shame we don't talk no more
It's a shame we don't shop at the mall
It's a shame we don't make love like we used to

It's a shame you don't like my friends
It's a shame I don't like your friends
How could something be so good
Could just come to an end?

I remember when the wedding bell rang
I even had your favorite artist sing
I could see this mirth on people's faces
They'd do anything to trades the places

Even that when we were driving 'round the world
Talks, because you were my girl
Oh, but what they said didn't mean a damn thing
'Cause I knew you were wearing my ring

I remember when we hooked up
Everyone was shook up
Couldn't believe that we got together
We made it through the good times
Couldn't withstand the bad times
Oh, girl, whatever

There was a time we could conversate through our problems
We would always find a way to solve them
If there's a way we could make it alright
So we don't, girl, have to fight

How could something be so good

Let me thank you for your time
I'm so glad that you were mine
No matter how much you hate me
Remember when it was just we

Just remember the days we were together
Oh, girl
Listen to me, girl

I took a trip to where we used to live
The tree was still there we carved our names in as kids
? , had a sign that said she don't live here no more
Went to the neighbors asked because ?
You're the only one for me
Love's the only thing in life that is free
Now all I have left is just a memory

I remember when you were young,
Back in the days of bubble gum
And the only thing that mattered in life
Was the candy store, down on the corner
All the kids in the neighborhood,
Would get money from the parents if they were good
And we were good, we would all gather around at the candy store
Down on the corner

That's when I first saw you girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Looking so sweet, I said, how do you do, at the candy store
Down on the corner
You were my girlfriend, I was your boyfriend ?
I met you, at the candy store

? in the back, sunroof top, TV in the seat with the gangster lean
Holler at the shawty, with the afro puff
Light blue halter top with bell bottoms with tops
Hat to the back, tube socks to the knee

We often fantasized about a life with me
Now all I have left is just a memory

With silver buttons, buttons, buttons, all down her back, back, back

Jump over the fence, fence, fence

Keith Sykes,"While out sailing on the ocean
While out sailing on the sea
I bumped into the Saviour
And He said pardon me
I said Jesus you look tired
He said Jesus so do you
Sit down son
Cause I got some fat to chew

Everybody needs somebody that they can talk to
Someone to open up their ears
And let that trouble through
Now you don't have to sympathize
Or care what they may do
But everybody needs somebody that they can talk to

Well he spoke to me of morality
Starvation, pain and sin
Matter of fact the whole dang time
I only got a few words in
But I won't squack
Let 'em talk
Hell it's been a long long time
And any friend that's been turned down
Is bound to be a friend of mine

Now we sat there for an hour or two
Just eatin' that Gospel pie
When around the bend come a terrible wind
And lightning lit the sky

And I believe I heard him sing these words
As he skipped out across the sea

Keith Textor,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A Foggy Day

Kill what's inside of you.

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue,
In her own mad mind she's in love with you.
With you.
Now what you gonna do?

[Chorus]

She's some kind of demon messing in the glue.
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you.
To you.
What kind of fool are you?

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea,
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored.
And wouldn't you be bored?

Keith Urban,"Billy left on Friday night with twenty dollars cash
Had a thousand more and a diamond on his hand
When he got back
I don't know just where Billy got that dough

Saturday he spent in style
Drinks were on the house
Lincoln here, and a Jackson there
Suspicions were aroused

A dime was dropped and a name was named
A body soon was found
A travelin' Bible salesman on his monthly trip to town
Three bullet holes

A .38 done took his soul
What do you know
No diamond ring no money roll
A quick investigation

They dragged Billy to the station
And broke him down with the third degree
His alibi unraveled
Judge Riley banged his gavel

A 12-man jury all agreed
So he must be guilty
I knew Billy spent that night 
Winning big at cards

And the salesman was a married man
Who broke my sisters heart
Billy sits in Levenworth 
Waiting for the gas

And I know lots of other things
But no one ever asked
So they'll never know
Swear to God they'll never know
Case is closed, that's how the story will be told",Billy

Desiree you love his money more than me
And the taxi's at the gate

It'd be easier to leave if I were mad
But it's hard to lose the best you'll ever have 
And to write this note to you
Was the hardest thing to do
But not as hard as bein' a poor boy
Who can't afford a girl like you

I risked a whoopin' every time I went
'Cause white boys weren't allowed
On the colored side of town
But I was proud to call
That old black man my friend
He had a pillow by the bed he used to pray on 
And a beat up old guitar he let me play on
I knew where my fingers went
From his greasy fingerprints
Yeah, he was passin' on
What was handed down to him

[Chorus]
And it soaked up all the blood and sweat and teardrops
And the beers he missed in smokey little bars 
And sometimes that old man he comes alive in my hands
I feel the beating of his sad old broken heart 
Just like there's a ghost in this guitar
A ghost in this guitar

Well, the night before he died he made me take it
He said, ""You play it now, 'cause I gotta go"" 
And I can feel him in my fingers when I play it

And sometimes I just sit back
And let him go
Sit back and let him go

[Chorus]
Hank don't fail me now
You've always bailed me out
""Your Cheatin' Heart""
Could set that suitcase down
Give me one more song to whine
That'll make her change her mind
Cause she's walkin' out
Hank don't fail me now

Yeah she was throwin' stuff, cussin' like a sailor at me
She was waving her arms around like she was fightin' bees
If I could yodel her a lick
That just might do the trick
If I sang ""I Saw The Light"" would she believe

And how you kiss on my face

Well I still remember
You came by my trailer
With chicken and some homemade wine
The dogs got to barkin'
When we got the sparkin'
We almost set the house on fire
Well I got a big heapin' helpin'
Of the stuff I get a hankerin' for

Just keeps me comin' back for more

Dorothy and Toto fought just some witch
And if Babe Ruth was just a guy with a glove
Then oh baby this is just some love

I speak my mind baby that's the truth
But you've got a temper too
So when they see us start to fuss and fight
I guess they think we're through
But if they're judgin' us by what they see
Then they don't have a clue about you and me

Niagara Falls is just some water spills

Now the statues on the side of that big gate

And I can't keep from thinking

Is the part when I get up and go away

Over a small glass of tea

Sure I could hang around and complain about
The way things ought to be
Yeah there's trouble in the world
But you're the girl
Whose open arms are all I really need
And that's why I come runnin'
To be there by your side
To let 'em call me crazy
But it can't be denied

Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Ah baby it's a love thing, yeah

And it's not about the same last name
It's not a thing that can be explained
It's how you make me feel inside
And the way you hold me every night

It's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby, it's a love thing, yeah

Here we go now
It's a love thing

They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than just a diamond
On your hand
Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah
Come on it's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby, It's a love thing, yeah
Oh, it's a love thing, whoa
Oh sugar, it's a love thing
No it ain't about no diamond ring

These days our luck is running low
It's hard to explain but a little bit of rain

We're not a bit superstitious
No need to worry at all

'Cause when we can't roll a seven
And our last lucky penny is gone
This world can be tough
But I know when our love is this strong
We can make a little luck of our own, luck of our own

Baby can't you see true love is all we need
So just throw that rabbit's foot away

Like they used to come before

Wonderin' what your thinkin' inside
Will I wake up and find that

Go it alone for awhile

You gotta stop lookin' behind
And take everything as it comes for today is

Just somebody who she can believe in
And say they need her too

An old love story she wishes portrayed her life
No one would know what goes on in her mind

Til' someday she finds what she's lookin' for
And her ship'll come sailin' into her shore

I see the sunrise and it makes me want to change my mind

I stopped for a coffee in a nowhere town
A pretty waitress says ""Hey what's the frown
Boy you got it bad""
Well so many times you told me before
If you don't like it, well there's the door
This time I've gone for good and I got it bad

I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder then the devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Oh I got it bad

Moonlight on the water still looks the same
Pretty girl beside me but I don't know her name
Guess I got it bad

I'll believe her if she says hey baby
I got to love to spare
Well tomorrow I'll take it like a man
Tonight I'm taking all I can

I never work on a Sunday
I've got a life of my own
And this here is the one day
I spend with my family at home

I left the office in a flash on Friday
Threw my boots in the car
Cashed my pay cheque & headed for the country
To sleep underneath the stars
I drove all day Saturday and right into the evenin' 'till there were no more city lights
Those broken lines were gettin' blurry through my windscreen
Well I guess I drove all night
Then Sunday mornin' found me rollin' into sunrise
With my fuel gauge dead
I pulled into fill up, found the place deserted and a little sign that read...

[Chorus]

All I could do is call up a tow truck
To take me further down the road
I fumbled round & round for some change in my pocket, 
Walked fifteen minutes to the phone
There in the phone book I found a business ad-vert, saying ""Use Us Instead""
I dialed the number and a tape recorder answered and it politely said

[Chorus]

I finally got back home and it took forever
Then at work the next day
Somebody said 
""Hey the boss said he wants to see you in his office right away""
He told me just how far behind the work was getting
And on the weekend could I stay
I started laughin' and said 'You must be kiddin' 
I just got one thing to say...you know what I said

To spend with my family at home",I Never Work on a Sunday

Oh you drive me wild

Baby our love is still comin' on strong
You give me strength that I needed so long
I can't explain how I feel in my heart
But the love we got goin' will never fall apart

After so many years have gone
It seems we both were meant to be

Right there waitin' in the wings
Unaware of the foolish things you do, think about it

And there is nothing she'd ever need to hide
You're takin everything she gives for granted
You got it all and still I don't know why

If somebody told her 'bout your secret ways
Do you think you'd ever find another

My heart, my soul
My hands, my pride
And when I feel alone

And I think I can't go on
I hear him sayin' ""Son you'll be alright""
Everything's gonna be alright""
Yes it is

The older I get
The more I can see
That he loved my mother and my brother and me
And he did the best that he could
And I only hope when I have my own family
That everyday I see
Oh I hope I see
I hope everyday I see
A little more of my father in me

A little more of my father in me
I hope everyday I see in me
In me
In me
I hope everyday I see

A little more of my father in me",Song for Dad
Keith Urban,"I'm livin' in a world that won't stop pullin' on me
I'm not complaining but it's true
It's like I owe my time to everyone else
'Cause that's all I seem to do

You might not notice but I need a good friend
Someone to talk to when I'm down, down, down
There's so much on my mind that I want to get out
But there's no one around

[Chorus]
Sometimes I can't help thinkin' what about me
Some days go by that I don't even see
Yeah I'm doing everything right and I can't break free
Oh is this the way it's always gonna be
What about me

Well I'm dreamin' I'm on  a highway with the windows down
I'm burnin' up the road at my own speed
But I'm stuck here goin' nowhere in this traffic jam
And there's a woman with her kids in the car next to me
And I swear she's singin'

[Chorus: x2]

Oh what about me
Hey what about me",What About Me
Keith Urban,"I've seen that darkness on the edge of town
The sun come up and the rain fall down
And I've been a fool, yeah I've been around

And when the world got too much for me 
I took off and left a memory
Thinking I'd find something better for me somehow
Oh but now

[Chorus]
Whenever I run
Instead of running into the blue
I follow my heart
And there in your arms
Is where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come
Baby you're the one I run to

I used to quit when it got too tough
Throw in my cards when I was down on my luck
But baby you mean too much to me
So now

[Chorus]

I never could stay in one place too long
I never could stand that still
Ah but you changed so much in me
And now I know I will

I'm gonna stay where the love is right
I'm so tired of being a bird in flight
Good love takes work
Ah but that's alright
That's alright

[Chorus]

Instead of running into the blue 
I follow my heart
And there in your arms
That's where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come

The one I run to
The one I run to",Whenever I Run
Keith Urban,"I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
I had a job and I lost it
But it won't get to me

'Cause I'm ridin' with my baby
And it's a brand new day
We're on the wheels of an angel
Flyin' away

And the sun is shinin'
This road keeps windin'
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't want to be me

Now she's strummin' on my six-string
Across her pretty knees
She's stompin' out a rhythm
And singin' to me the sweetest song

The sun is shinin'
This road keeps windin'
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't want to be me

Oh the sun is shinin'
And this road keeps windin'
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't want to be me

I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
We're on the wheels of an angel
And I'm free
She's strummin' on my six-string
It's across her pretty knees
She's stompin' out a rhythm
And singin' to me",Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me
Keith Urban,"When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
And whispered in my ear, guess who
I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you

And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

That's right
You look good in my shirt

Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

c'mon now
Aww that's right
Oh you look so fine

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

You look good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt",You Look Good in My Shirt
Keith Urban,"There was a world outside my door
I wasn't in touch with anymore
There was a way I used to feel
I knew what was and wasn't real

You built a bridge, I tore it down
I felt safe on shaky ground
And I was a master of despair
Making believe I didn't care

[Chorus]
I shouldn't be standing here today
After all the crazy things I've done
I'm ready to fall and that's OK
I ran as far as I could run
You won

Out of a world turned upside down
It took some time to come around
Out of a dream you made me whole
Yes you did
You lit a fire down in my soul

[Chorus: x2]

And you won

I'm ready to fall
I thought I knew what I was doing
I thought I was in control
I thought nobody could slow me down
But what did I know
I was just a kid, a motherless child
No one to watch over me I was runnin' wild
Free of all responsibility 'til my life
And my love for myself caught up with me
Yeah, it caught up with me
And now I'm (ready to fall), yes I am
So ready",You Won
Keith Urban,"We all drink to forget 
Some of us more than most
When reality gets too real
And the fires of hell to close
But I'm here to let you know that 
That you can make it through
If you believe that someone is watchin' over you

[Chorus]
And call it an angel
Call it a muse
And call it karma that you've got comin' to you
What's the difference
What's in name
What matters most is never ever losin' faith
'Cause it's gonna be alright
You're not alone tonight

We all have our days
When nothing goes as planned
Not a soul in the world
Seems to understand
And for someone to talk to 
You'd give anything
Well go on and cry out loud
'Cause someone's listenin'

Keith Urban,"It's just a piece of paper,
It says, ""In God We Trust""
A little sure felt good
But a lot was not enough
And everybody loved me when I was on a roll
And I thought I had everything
When I held the gold

But you're not my god
And you're not my friend
You're not the one
That I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth
You're a temporary shot
You ruin people's lives
And you don't give a second thought
You're not my god

Little white lies on a mirror
Cut neatly in a roll
Medicine that kept me from lookin' in my soul
I thought you were the answer
To all of my despair
And you almost had me six feet down
But I'm still breathin' air

But you're not my god
And you're not my friend
You're not the one
That I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth
You're a temporary shot
You ruin people's lives
And you don't give a second thought
You're not my god

From the cradle to the grave
Temptations all around
But no matter how good the fix
It's gonna take you down
Now some call it a weakness
Some call it a sin
But it's all the same behind each game
I see your evil grin

But you're not my god
And you're not my friend
You're not the one
That I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth
You're a temporary shot
You ruin people's lives
And you don't give a second thought

But you're not my god
And you're not my friend
You're not the one
That I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth
You're a temporary shot
You ruin people's lives
And you don't give a second thought
You're not my god

Well she's really doing fine for eighty-four
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn
The poor old girl she needs a hand to run that farm

It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known
It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown

Oh it's goin' back home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen
""Hey but that ain't natural"" old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

I'm changing lanes and talkin' on the phone
Drivin' way too fast.
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of comin' in last.

And days go by,
I can feel 'em flyin'
Like a hand out the window in the wind.
The cars go by,
Yeah it's all we've been given,
So you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by,
Oh and a woo-hoo

Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by,
Headlights, taillights,
Running through a river of neon signs.
But somewhere in the rush I felt,
We're losing ourselves

And days go by,
I can feel 'em flyin'
Like a hand out the window in the wind.

Oh, yes, it does.
We talk about forever but we've only got today

Better start livin' right now!

Probably moved on with her life
Found someone she knows she can believe

I played him well

Had all the lines but not the heart
No look where we are

And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I want to cry

Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better

And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all gonna be alright
You take my hand

That makes me believe we can make it through anything
'Cause when it all comes down

I just lean on you 'cause baby
You're my better half

Yeah you pull me close and you hold me tight

And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
'Cause when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you 'cause baby
You're my better half

Well, you take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and I understand

It's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe that we can make it through anything

Oh baby, it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything

Keith Urban,"I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I wanna sleep with you forever
And I wanna die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

I wanna honor your mother
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Comin' your way

I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits but it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you this promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you with a warm, wet kiss
Yes I am

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you baby
And I'll win your trust making memories of us
Oh oh baby",Making Memories of Us [Remix]
Keith Urban,"Outside my window, I swear on my mamas grave,
Faded out the street noise like an out of focus Polaroid,
So I shot the moon, and I cursed the wind,
Making me think that you were, here again,
Smoke and mirrors, somebody stole you away,
That's the biggest conspiracy since, JFK,
So we combed the corners, and glass houses,
Right directions, but, never found it.

Well I'd trade in all the rest of my days,
Just the mere reflection of your face,
For one shining moment

With you, or somebody like you,
With you, or somebody just like you,

Called inspectors, the cops and the CIA,
The drew chalk circles round, the place that we used to lay,
But nobody testified, not a single witness,
I swore I was crucified with, no forgiveness,
The sheriff shined his light like I was drunk and dangerous,
My hands were already tied, so he , put away his handcuffs,
And in my blindspot, I saw the silhouette,
Your crazy legs smoking a long black cigarette,
But I'd trade in all the rest of my days,
Your crooked smile, your wicked ways,
I'd fill up all this empty space,

With you, or somebody like you,
With you, or somebody just like you,
Oh you, or somebody like you, oh

Now I should of learned my lesson,
Done what I was told,
Should of counted all my blessings,
Like fingers and toes,
And now I'm, tripping like a blind man,
And searching high and low,
For you, or somebody like you
For you, or somebody just like you

For you, or somebody like you,
For you, or somebody just like you, oh oh

Yeah, whoa somebody just like you
Oh somebody just like you, oh",You (Or Somebody Like You)
Keith Urban,"Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide-awake just watchin' you sleep
And I promise you you're gonna have
More than just the things that you need
We ain't got much now, we're just startin' out
But I know somehow paradise is comin'

[Chorus]
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life

Oh now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're gonna fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters

[Chorus]

So hold on, hold on
See'mon baby, hold on

Yeah, we're gonna have it all
And ooh

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Oh, a better life
Hey we're gonna leave this all behind us baby, wait and see
We're headed for a better life, you and me
We're gonna break the chains that bind and, finally we'll be free
We're gonna be the ones that have it all, you and me
Just hold on tight now baby",Better Life [DVD]
Keith Urban,"I woke up early this morning around four a.m.
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's okay
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishin' I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah

And you're gonna think of me
Oh someday baby, someday",You'll Think of Me [DVD]
Keith Urban,"I'm changing lanes
I'm talking on the phone
I'm drivin' way to fast
And the interstate's jammed with
Gunners like me afraid of coming in last
But somewhere in the race we run
We're coming undone

Days go by
I can feel 'em flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind as the cars go by
It's all we've been given
So you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by

Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights running through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
We're losing ourselves

Days go by
I can feel 'em flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind as the cars go by
It's all we've been given
So you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by

We think about tomorrow then it slips away
We talk about forever but we've only got today

And the days go by
I can feel 'em flying

You better start livin'
Better start livin' right now

Cause days go by
These days go by

So take 'em by the hand
They're yours and mine
Take 'em by the hand

Take 'em by the hand
Don't let 'em all fly by

Don't you know the days go by",Days Go By [Acoustic Version]
Keith Urban,"So, here you are now, nowhere to turn
It's just the same old yesterday
You made a promise to yourself
That you were never gonna be this way
And the only thing that you've ever known is to run
So you keep on driving faster into the sun

But everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes

You don't have to find your own way out
You've got a voice; let it be heard
Just when it feels you're on a dead-end road
There's always somewhere left to turn
So don't give up now
You're so close to a brand new day
Yes, you are
And if you just can bare to be alone, then I'll stay

'Cause everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes

Well, maybe I've been too caught up
To see what you've been going through
All that I can say is that I'm here now

And everybody needs somebody sometimes
You know they do
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
Everybody needs somebody sometimes

Keith Urban,"It never ceases to blow my mind
It does it to me every time
Standin' here lookin' at you
It makes me wonder what He was up to
Was He thinking about me when He thought about you?

[Chorus]
When God made woman
He must've been proud
Yeah, he must've been crying or laughing out loud
It must have felt like the first time
Gettin' kissed by the sun
When God made woman

It must have been the most beautiful day
Lookin' down on all creation
He took a river that winds and turns
Took a fire that breathes and burns
And put it all in place
In the most perfect way

Keith Urban,"So you're leaving 
In the morning 
On the early train 
I could say everything's alright 
I could pretend and say good bye 

Got your ticket 
Got your suitcase 
Got your leaving smile 

I could say that's the way it goes 
I could pretend and you won't know 
That I was lying 
'Cause I can't stop loving you 
I can't stop loving you 
No, I can't stop loving you 

Though I try 
Took a taxi 
To the station 
Not a word was said 
I saw you walk across the road 
Maybe the last time, I don't know 

Feeling humble 
I heard a rumble 
On the railway track 
And when I hear the whistle blow 
I walk away and you don't know 

That I was lying 
'Cause I can't stop loving you 
No, I can't stop loving you

I wasn't where you wanted to be

That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

Sometimes in our life
We get to where we wonder if
The long road that we're on
Is headin' in the same direction
Well, when it comes to you and me
We're right where I know we should be

Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
The slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Remind me, please

That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
You don't gotta say you're sorry, baby

Once again this town's gonna make some noise

But the creek, it did rise up any how
And the bossman don't seem to care

Baby, if you want, I can make it better now

Keith Urban,"Well she was precious, like a flower
She grew wild, wild but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful and different
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holdin' back the wind

She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream, and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy
Stupid boy

So, what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down

And you stole her every dream, and you crushed her plans

I think I know just what you're going through
Did you believe you'd never change?
Nothin' ever stays the same

I know it's hard holdin' on
Even harder trying to let it go
And so you're frozen like a stone
But you are not alone

Every step I take
I get a little less afraid
Of giving in to love, love
Let it out
Believe me when I say
It gets better every day
Once you get used to the pain

What you hide inside I see
There's a scar that's always gonna be
There's a past in everyone
You can't undo
You can't outrun

Every step I take
I get a little less afraid
Of giving in to love, love
Let it out
Believe me when I say

Don't fear it now; we're going all the way
Where the sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down, and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up 'cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love

Everybody's looking for what we've found
Some wait their whole lives and it never comes around
So don't hold back now
Just let go of all you've ever known
And put your hand in mine

Don't fear it now; we're going all the way
Where the sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down, and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up 'cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love

I close my eyes, and I see you standing right there
Saying 'I do,' and they're throwing rice in our hair
Then the first one's born; then a brother comes along, and he's got your smile
I'll be looking back at the life we had still at your side

So don't fear it now, we're going all the way

I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left

It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been

I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight

But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander 'round this town
'Til summer comes around

I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks
And I count the days til you just might come back

And then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you swore you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
'Til summer comes around
And it comes around

And I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on the Ferris wheel rocking with the motions
And Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment
And ""Baby I'll be back again"" you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down

Keith Urban,"Well if you ever said goodbye
I wouldn't waste all of my time cryin'
I wouldn't sit home alone wondering where I went wrong
I'd be rockin' on out of here
Baby, faster than a rolling tear
Ain't no grass gonna grow under me when you're gone
No, I won't stay down for long

I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground runnin'
I know exactly what I'd do, honey
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground runnin'
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you

Yeah woo

I'm gonna stop in
For a couple things I gotta pick up
Like some pretty red flowers and a store bought card
That say what I really feel
That I need ya' and I always will
And the three little words that used to come hard
Then I jump in back in my car and then

I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground runnin'
I know exactly what I'd do
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground runnin'
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you
There ain't no doubt, I ain't that proud
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do
I'd hit the ground
Hit the ground
Hit the ground runnin' after you, yes, I would, woo

So if you gotta go baby, I won't stop you
And I won't sit around and miss you, no, no, no
'Cause if you leave I'm a comin' with you
Comin' with you, baby

I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground runnin'
I know exactly what I'd do, sugar
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground runnin'
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you
There ain't no doubt, I ain't that proud
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do

Keith Urban,"Love doesn't come with a contract
You give me this I give you that
And it's scary business
Your heart and soul is on the line
Baby why else would I be standing 'round here so tongue-tied

If I knew what I was doing, I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in, I'm in

Baby come on in the water's fine
I'll be right here you take your time
Just let me hold you and we'll both take that leap of faith
It's like I told you there's no guarantees when you feel this way

If I knew what I was doing, I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in, I'm in

Baby I'm in, and I'm in

Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am
Everything thing I am

Oh, and if I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend, yeah
If you need a lover and a friend
Oh baby I'm in, and I'm in,
Baby I'm in, and I'm in

Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am
And baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
And baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
Baby come here, baby come here, baby come here.",I'm In
Keith Urban,"I used to cry out in the middle of the night
Baby hold me tight
But there was no one beside me when I opened my eyes
Now I turn the corner of those days and nights
Something inside me changed and I think I might
Be starting over
I don't wanna run
Oh no, cause you might be the one, baby

[Chorus]
If ever I could love
I think it could be with you
If ever thought I found somebody so true
I wonder if you feel
The same way that I do
If ever I could love
I think it could be with you

You know I can't read your mind love
But it seems to me
That your heart and mine tonight are
Defying gravity
There's something so familiar
And still so unknown
The closer we get I swear it feels like coming home
And I'm ready to be brave
Oh yea and you look at me say

[Chorus]

If ever I could love
If ever I could love
If ever I could love
If ever I could be
If ever I could love
Oh yeah no way

[Chorus]

I was scared to love again
Till the day that came
When she walked out of my life
I got hurt so bad
I swear I'd never let another inside this heart of mine
But you touch my hand and every plan that I had
Disappeared like a fallen star
There's a new beginning and I'm moving to the rhythm
Of a beating braver heart
A braver heart
If ever I could love, oh oh
If ever I could love, yea yea",If Ever I Could Love
Keith Urban,"To kiss and tell, it's just not my style.
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart,
Broke it right in two, and it took some time but I'm feelin' like
I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

It's that moment when you start closin' in
First you're holding back, then surrenderin'
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing.
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

'cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah.
Are you ready? Are you ready, to cross that line, put your lips on mine?

(Put your lips on mine baby)

Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl",Kiss a Girl
Keith Urban,"I thought I was doing all right being alone
I swore I'd never let somebody get close again
I was never gonna let my guard down, not for anyone
But there's a light in your eyes and it's got me moving' in
And tonight these walls are all coming down

And my heart is open
I'm lettin' you in
'Cause you give me a reason and the faith I've been needing to start again
And your love is healing
I'm finally breathing
And I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment
My heart is open

These days it seems like everybody's just walking away
Like there's no forever and love is just a game
But don't you know that you can believe me when I say that I'm your man

And my heart is open
I'm lettin' you in, baby
'Cause you give me a reason and the faith I've been needing to start again
And your love is healing
I'm finally breathing
I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment
My heart is open

I can't wait anymore, no no
Because I've got nothing left to prove
And I've got so much love for you
That's why I'm tearing out the walls, and baby I'm kicking down the doors

And your love is healing
Baby, I'm finally breathing
And I can hear you calling, I'm ready to fall in love again
My heart is open

Yeah, my heart is open
Oh, baby
My heart is open.
Oh, yeah,
Oh, yeah.",My Heart Is Open
Keith Urban,"Well I know there's a reason
And I know there's a rhyme
We were meant to be together
And that's why,
We can roll with the punches
We can stroll hand in hand
And when I say it's forever
You understand

That you're always in my heart,
You're always on my mind
But when it all becomes too much,
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
'Cause only you can love me this way

I could have turned a different corner
I could have gone another place
Then I'd of never had this feeling
That I feel today, yeah

That you're always in my heart,
You're always on my mind
But when it all becomes too much,
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
'Cause only you can love me this way

Oh

That you're always in my heart,
You're always on my mind
But when it all becomes too much,
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
'Cause only you can love me this way

Oh

Only you can love me this way.",Only You Can Love Me This Way
Keith Urban,"Out on the street corner
Just like every morning I sit here
And I watch you walk my way
And even though I don't know you
As you get closer I swear I feel
My heart start racing, aching
Maybe it's in my mind
And maybe I'm only dreaming
And I swear you catch my eye
As you walk on by
Oh why you gotta leave me so blue

Baby why can't you see
That I'm the only one for you
You could search the world over
But you'll never find another so true
'Cause if you're looking for love
I'm standing right in front of you

(I'm standing right in front of you)

I bet your heart, like mine
Has been broken by someone
We never should have given it to (oh no)
So we put up a wall to keep from falling so hard
It's so sad
'Cause there's such good love inside
And I've been hoping that I might find
Someone who feels the same way
Someone to share my life
On this beautiful ride together
We could see it all through

Baby why can't you see
That I'm the only one for you
You could search the world over
But you'll never find another so true
'Cause if you're looking for love
I'm standing right in front of you

(Standing right in front of you)

So this morning I'm just going to walk up, and say hello to you
'Cause if given a choice between love and being alone
I know which one
I know which one I choose
And give me a chance
I'd be a better man for you (I believe I would)
And open your heart girl
Let me make your dreams come true

You can search the world over
But I can take it to the moon
'Cause if you're looking for love
I'm standing right in front of you (yes I am)
Standing right in front of you
(Standing right in front of you)
Open your eyes, (I'm standing right in front of you)
Just give me a chance baby
(I'm standing right in front of you)",Standing Right in Front of You
Keith Urban,"There were nights where I was sure
I wouldn't see the morning sun
And there were days that seemed so dark
I couldn't wait for night to come

I couldn't stand to think about how
My life used to be
And how without a single warning
It all slipped away from me

And like a fool I thought that I could fight
The shadows on my own
To the dark I was no stranger
But this was stronger than I'd known

And by the time I knew that I was in too deep 
I'd gone too far
And the light that used to guide me
Had faded from my heart

And I found myself in places I thought I'd never go
Surrounded by strangers I was so far from home
And I don't know how you found me
All I know is I owe you everything to you
Yes I do

[Chorus]
And I thank you for my heart
I thank you for my life
And I thank god for grace and mercy
And that you became my wife
I'm seeing for the first time
The stars, the sun and moon
But they've got nothing on the power
Of this love I have for you

And I thank you, I thank you

Now people say they'll stand beside you
They swear they never leave
But when the rain started falling
You know it only fell on me

and it was hard to keep believing in myself
When all I felt was so much pain 
And guilt and shame
I couldn't even as for help

I don't know if I believe in other lives
But when you came
There was something so familar
About the way you said my name

And the whole world started turning
And I swear that I'd been born again brand new
And it's all because of you

[Chorus]

And I thank you

And I've seen so many things
That I just can't explain
But the miracle of miracles is how
With your love I was saved

And I thank you for my heart
I thank you for my life
I thank god for grace and mercy
And that you became my wife
And I'm seeing for the first time
The stars, the sun and moon
But they've got nothing on the power
Of all this love I give to you

And I thank you for my heart
I thank you for my life
I thank god for grace and mercy
And that you became my wife
The day I started breathing
Was the day you took my hand
And 'till the day I die
Baby, I'll forever be your man
And I thank you, I thank you
Oh, yes I do
Oh, don't you know, that I thank you
Oh",Thank You
Keith Urban,"I just kissed you goodbye
A half an hour ago
I know you've driven to the airport
But I just gotta pick up the phone
And hear you one more time
Saying my name
I must be going outta my mind

Why's it feel so long
Since you've been gone
Why's it feel so long

Time keeps dragging on
Til you get back home
Why's it feel so long
Baby

Cause I miss you babe

I've never loved anyone like I love you
So when you're not around
I must confess I lose myself
And I don't know who where I am
I might be crazy
Crazy about being your man

Why's it feel so long
Since you've been gone
Why's it feel so long
I don't know why
Time keeps dragging on
Til you get back home
Why's it feel so long

When I finally see you
I know it'd be like never left alone
But there's no cantillation
Tonight isn't waiting
Praying maybe you'll come
Coming coming babe

Tell me now

Why's it feel so long
Since you've been gone
Why's it feel so long
I don't know why
Time keeps dragging on
Til you get back home

Why's it feel so long
Since you've been gone
Why's it feel so long
I don't know why
Time just cross along
Til you get back home
Why's it feel so long

I look at my watch
Stare at the clock
And they don't move
I don't need a round
I'm just froze on the couch
Oh the seconds feel like hours
An hour's like a day
It's a twilight zone in this home
When you go away

Please don't go away",Why's It Feel So Long
Keith Urban,"Last night I fell asleep, and I saw you dancing in my dreams,
Just like the autumn leaves have fall for you.
All for you.

You changed my life, you changed my ways.
I don't even recognize myself these days.
It must be a reflection of you.
Only you.

I can't remember feeling love like this in so long.
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.
It's so true, I'm all for you.

My arms still hold you tight, keep you warm in the coldest night.
My hand to pull your hair right back away from your eyes.
For you. Only you.

If I knew how to do it,
I'd paint the moon, the stars around you.
Paint the perfect kind of sunset.
But I couldn't make it more beautiful than you.
Oh, nothing compares to you.
You know it's true.

I can't remember feeling love like this in so long.
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.
It's so true, I'm all for you.
I'm all for you.

I can't remember feeling love like this in so long.
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.

Some might call it insanity.
Without a doubt for the rest of my life,
I'm going to be crazy.
Baby, crazy for you.

All for you.
I'm all for you.",All for You
Keith Urban,"What kind of spell is this
That you've cast on me with your kiss
Its like I've lost all control of my senses
Its just not like me, to give in so easily
And drop my guard and leave my heart defenseless
Oh, but I'm feelin' good here beneath the pines of the Georgia woods

[Chorus]
And what a surprise, here by your side
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy
I waited so long, for something this strong
And now I gotta be fallin' 'cause I'm already callin' you baby

There's nobody here to see
These sparks between you and me
We'd better be careful my love, or these woods will be burning
Or maybe we just give in, throwing caution to the wind
Its funny how we ain't got any say in the matter

[Chorus]

Uh huh
Oh take me downtown
Uh huh
My sweet angel

Yeah, I waited so long, somethin' is strong
And I know I'm falling 'cause I'm already callin' you

What a surprise, hear by your side
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy

Oh callin' you baby
Yeah, uh huh",Georgia Woods
Keith Urban,"I can't sleep, ain't no sleep a'coming
I'm just lying here thinking 'bout you
I'm in deep, falling deep into the picture
In my mind of everything we're gonna do

Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are
'Cause I need you by my side

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
But when you say my name in the middle of the day,
I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind,
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin' like these wheels in my head tonight

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
But when you say my name in the middle of the day,
I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind,
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

The only place that I wanna be is where you are
'Cause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
All I really want is more than this moment right now
'Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day,
I swear I see the stars come out
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes
Oh I swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

I swear it's like you're waiting on the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down
Hey, yeah oh, I'm loving thinking 'bout you
I can't sleep, I'm just lying here thinkin' 'bout you",Long Hot Summer
Keith Urban,"The rains coming down hard tonight,
Pull the car over
Now I'm sittin' alone on the roadside
I tilt the mirror down and say to me,
Why you always think the answers gotta be,
To just leave
I'm making the same mistake
I'm hoping its not too late
Because I

[Chorus]
I don't know where I'd be without you now
I guess I get scared 
And that's why I act like such a fool
Cause you're the one thing I can't lose
I feel the tears coming
And I wanna cry
I think of us baby
And all the love inside comes shining through
And it always leads me right on back to you

I never felt it,
I never knew
Someone who could get inside my soul the way you do,
Yes you do

Yeah you got me in the palm of your hand
Its beautiful and terrifying,
Can't you see
For someone like me
But instead of running in,
I know
Its when I should hold you closer
Because I

[Chorus]

I don't know where I'd be without you now

I guess I get scared and that's why I (lie?)
Such a fool
Cause you're the one thing I can't lose
I feel the tears coming
And I wanna cry
I think of us baby
And all the love inside comes shining through
And it always leads me right on back to you

Cause nobody's ever loved me
Like you
And I was born to be your man forever

Forever baby
Yeah
I feel the tears coming
And I wanna cry
I turn the car around
And put it in drive
And I know what to do
Gonna come on back,
Come on back to you

Oh, oh baby
Gonna come on back,
Come on back to you
Oh, oh baby
Gonna come on back,
Come on back to you
Cause I can't live without you,
I cant breathe without you

Keith Urban,"Let's gettin' to the point, we're not even listening anymore!
We're just walking around in circles, and wearing holes out on the floor
I'm tired; I know you're tired and it's late,
And it's almost four.

And what are we trying to achieve, baby?
What are we trying to win?
I said the same thing three hours ago,
And now I'm saying it again.
And I know you and I well enough to know,
Neither one of us is giving in!

Baby, I love you I'm not going to bed angry,
And baby, I need and I want you to be happy,
We've been going around in circles with no end in sight!
Maybe we should just
Shut off the lights,
And wait till the morning!
Shut off the lights,
Wait till the morning!

It's amazing all the old wounds
We still carry around,
Wait to bring 'em all up, when it all comes down.
Like it's coming down now!

Cause I don't wanna lose you,
And I don't wanna hate you,
I don't wanna feel that

Keith Urban,"I've loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
A smile and just knew it.
And up until you came along, no one ever heard my song,
Now its climbing with a bullet.

Its nice to have someone, so honestly devoted,
But when it's said and done, girl I hope you know that,

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long
It'd all be as good as gone, without you.

Oh ho, without you, hey hey

Along comes a baby girl, and suddenly my little world,
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did.
And people that I barely knew, who love me 'cause I'm part of you
Man it's tough to figure
How two souls can be, miles from one another
But still you and me, have somehow found each other.

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long
It'd all be as good as gone, without you.

Without you, oh oh
Without you I'd survive, but I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life, just going through the motions

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,
This life, this love that you and I have been building up so high
It's never gonna touch the sky, without you.

Mm, without you
Without you, baby, baby, baby without you
Without you.",Without You
Keith Urban,"One, two, three baby don't think twice
Just like that you gotta brand new life
Hop in this truck and run through the red lights

Yeah where you wanna go, baby name the town
We can go up north or head down south
Roll down the windows with the radio loud

Come on turn it up, yeah
Start living your life
On the double, leave your troubles behind
You knew we're gonna be alright

You could be a black bird
On a country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe, you gonna fly with me
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans
Scared of the rain just scared to sing
But you better believe, you're gonna fly with me

Well, here we are baby in the back of my van
Sun's going down sky's turning red
Stars coming out
Baby look at you now

God know how long but its been a while
Since I heard you laugh and I'd seen that smile
Felt that kiss and I can get use to this
Baby I could get use to this

You could be a black bird
On a country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe, you gonna fly with me
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans
Scared of the rain just scared to sing
But you better believe, you're gonna fly with me

You're gonna fly

You could be a black bird
On a country street

You could be a songbird from the New Orleans
Scared of the rain just as scared to sing
But you better believe yeah you better believe oh baby

You could be a black bird
On a country street

But it's still not enough for how I feel about you
I wanna put you in a melody, I gotta set you to a groove

I wanna put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl oh
If I could press play, repeat, how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I wanna put you in a song, oh oh oh

Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight
It'd be so easy I'll just write it from my heart
'Cause I gotta tell the world what you mean to me
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be
Stuck in my head all day
'Cause you're already there anyway, yes you are

If I could press play, repeat, how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I wanna put you in a song

And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah
And when they see you on the street they'll say
Hey ain't you the girl in that song

I wanna put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I'm in love with this girl

The disappointing truth
Is I don't like to lose

Promises I made
And bills I never paid
Another missed birthday
Shame on me, shame on me

And lovers that I hurt
Lessons never learned
Shame on me, shame on me

Its not like its worth it
Everyone hurts the same
Hey, I'm not tryin to be special
'Cause I ain't no angel

Sometimes they seem rehearsed

And man, lookin back at these pictures of us, we were so cool
You were so hot in your pink lipstick
Painted on the end of a lit cigarette
And I loved you girl, yeah, I loved you girl

And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you
Were countin down the memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

A little tattered and torn, it still keeps me warm on a Friday night
Bandana patch from kickin some ass in a frat boy fight
You wore it in the stands at the football games
Some ink beneath the sleeve, I still wear your name
And I loved you girl, yeah, I still love you girl

And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you
Were countin down the memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

I know you grew up, I grew up, too
You got two kids, hell, I got two kids, too
Thank God they look like you

And every night I put it back it on and Im sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river if you get the shivers, Ill put it around you
Were makin them memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three words, two rings, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

Well, there's nothin in the world makes me feel more alive
When its just you and me and the moon is high
I slip into the sleeves and with your hand in mine
I go back to the night when I fell into your eyes

Two kids just fallin in love
And here we are right now, good heavens above
Its only gettin better, baby
Its only getting better, baby
I just love that black, leather jacket",Black Leather Jacket [*]

Cause our personalities, all been clashing
I would rather be left alone

And baby, don't turn like we fought
Then we broke and say that it was our fault
And can we go our separate ways
Content at the decisions we made, lady

Who felt to keep love new
There's upon a need that wants to be free
There's a part that we'll always believe, yeah

When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
You can never let nobody ever come between that
When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
Gonna cry together, nothing's better than when you love somebody

Maybe we got involved too fast
In a day we making love was too much to axe
There has to be more than sexual love
So you and I have to try to talk and take it slow

Now do we have a common dream
Something we can show that can prove we're a team
People, wanna prove them wrong
But now the wrong has marched home, hey, hey

So, girl, we got to let go, I love you, I know
We managed tonight to be brave enough
To weather the storm as others we've known have chose to do
They're not changing my point of view, no

The dream I dreamed was not denied me!

Keith Whitley,"Loving you was just a storybook of fair
I've decided there ain't no real life anywhere
Soon I'll be a faded picture in the book of your mind
Another town is somewhere down the line

Another town, another grocery store
Another town, another set of swinging doors
Somehow, I'm a little bit suspicious in my mind
It's another town that don't need my kind

Tell your mama, she was sure a dandy cook
Tell your papa that I understood his looks
If I put it all together, you're a piece that wouldn't fit
Another town's a comin' up I guess

Another town, another grocery store
Another town, another set of swinging doors
Somehow I'm a little bit suspicious in my mind
It's another town that don't need my kind

As I leave you, let me leave you with this thought
Time is candy and we ate all that we bought
Those little tears you're cryin' are just wrappers on the ground
That a new wind blows into another town

Another town, another grocery store
Another town, another set of swinging doors
Somehow I'm a little bit suspicious in my mind
It's another town that don't need my kind
It's another town that don't need my kind

Was in Miami

Even in the taxi I could hear my telephone ring
Calling me from

Keith Whitley,"Alone at a corner table,
She was watching me watching her.
I was singin' about an old flame burning,
She was hanging on to every word.

I was pouring out my feelings,
She was pouring out the wine.
Through the smoke and the beer,
It was perfectly clear,
That we were touching each others minds.

It was love ten feet away.
Imagine her in my arms, with that look on her face.
Lying somewhere in some shadowy place.
It was love just ten feet away.

I just knew my closing song would do it,
I knew that I was heaven bound.
I could tell she was moved, but before I was through.
This stranger walked up and set down.

He was trying his best to impress her,
But she never took her eyes off me.
When he got up and left, I said to myself...
Woh-o-woh what a night this will be.

It was love ten feet away.
Imagine her in my arms, with that look on her face.
Lying somewhere in some shadowy place.
It was love just ten feet away.

Keith Whitley,"Caught a plane to Birmingham
Leaving you was my plan
Then head on south by any means
Thought I might blend in 'round New Orleans

But when the plane got off the ground
I saw your face in a cloud
Saw your tears out on the wing
Don't guess my heart was free to leave

Birmingham would have to wait
For a little later date
And I said I’d see you later, New Orleans
'Cause I knew my rambling ways
Had seen their better days
And suddenly I had a change in dreams

Caught a plane from Birmingham
Back in your arms is where I am
At times we laugh and talk about
The day I did the Birmingham turnaround

Morning comes and I'm alone ...
It's been a year since you've been gone 
But it seems like yesterday ,you said goodbye 
I'm finding ways to pass the time ,so i wont lose my mind
But my every waking hour I think of you 
That's just a day in the life of a fool 
The one who's holding out for only you 
Knowing all along your love for me is true 
It's just a day in the life of a fool

You would think I'd learn by now , to forget it all some how .
But my favorite memories were made with you 
So every moment that I have , I live them in the past 
Even though theres no way back to where we were 

Thats just a day in the life of a fool

I'm a friend of thunder
Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me

Got down on his level
But I never gave in, so he gave up on me

I can spot bad weather
And I'm good at finding shelter in a downpour
I've been sacrificed by brothers
Crucified by lovers

When I'm feeling down
If I don't keep my head up, I may drown
But it's hard to keep believing

While the rain beats your hope in the ground
And tonight it's really coming down

I'm no stranger to the rain
But there'll always be tomorrow
And I'll beg, steal, or borrow a little sunshine
And I'll put this cloud behind me

Where you struck the spark
To a fire that's still burning

You just drifted away

And remember those games
Those cold football games
I was your hero
Though I seldom played
Back then could you see
What our future would be

Mama did her best to do it all when Dad was gone
And every night she'd swear he'd really rather be at home
Sometimes we'd believe her 'til we'd look in Daddy's eyes

The steel rails controlled him like whiskey in his veins
Number two diesel fuel flowed through his veins

But I know the things I do don't compare with the things I did

If you think I'm crazy now, should've seen me when I was a kid",If You Think I'm Crazy Now (You Should Have Seen Me When I Was a Kid)
Keith Whitley,"

You said I'd live to regret it

I said, ""I'll die before I do.""

Now the pain is gonna kill me if I let it

Has it been a lifetime

Since I walked out on you?

I've been runnin' with my life wide open

Reaching out for whatever's in sight

But living like there's no tomorrow

Finally got to me tonight


You told me someday I'd be sorry

Now I feel every word come true

And one thing I've learned in a hurry

Freedom is a prison for a fool


Dialing our old number wasn't easy

It's been hard to admit,you're right.

And living like there's no tomorrow

Finally got to me tonight.


I've been runnin' with my life wide open

Reaching out for whatever's in sight.

But living like there's no tomorrow

Fin'ly got to me tonight

Keith Whitley,"I may not look like much
But I think that with your touch
I could be somebody you'd be proud of
Lend me a hand, understand
I've been such a lonely man
Help me find the hope that I've run out of 
Turn me around, turn me on, turn me to love

Break these chains, that surround my heart
They've been there long enough
Take my life, you could fix it up 
Turn me around, turn me on, turn me to love

I do believe that you will know just what to do
You can help me find a new direction
I need to live for a change get my world rearranged
I think you might be my love connection
Turn me around, turn me on, turn me to love

Break these chains, that surround my heart
They've been there long enough
Take my life, you could fix it up 
Turn me around, turn me on, turn me to love",Turn Me to Love
Keith Whitley,"If I were alone in the desert 
Without a drink of water around
With my knees and hands in that white scorching sand
With the hot Sahara, sun beating down
If I could be granted my wishes
Anything I want would come true
I know that it might sound funny 
But here, what I want you to do

[Chorus:]
Tell Lorie I love her
Tell Lorie I need her
Tell her everything would be ok if I could just see her
Tell Lorie I love her
Tell Lorie I need her
And if I leave this old world tell her she's¯ the only girl for me

If I were a drift on the ocean 
A vessel with no sails or steam
Floating aimlessly on the endless sea 
Hopelessly lost it would seem
If all of the fish in the water 
Could echo my last dying plea
I know you might not understand it
But here's what I want it to be 

[Chorus:]",Tell Lorrie I Love Her
Keith Whitley,"Runnin' around 
I've spent my whole life runnin' around 
Settlin' down 
I never dreamed I'd be settlin' down 
 
But something's comin' over me 
Woman, you have got a hold on me 
And the reason just might be 
You're so good to me 

Somebody's doin' me right 
Somebody's holdin' me tight 
Sharin' my days and my nights 
Somebody I really like 
Just took a hold of my hand 
You make me feel like a man 
There's been a change in my life 
Somebody's doin' me right      
 
It's alright 
Oh girl it's alright 
 
Set in my ways 
Thinkin' that love would only get in my way 
But now I'm wantin' to stay 
I like this feelin' of wantin' to stay 
 
Really it's no mystery 
What brought all this change in me 
You're the one who made me see 
How love was meant to be 
 
Somebody's doin' me right 
Somebody's holdin' me tight 
Sharin' my days and my nights 
Somebody I really like 
Just took a hold of my hand

They said look at that perfect pair
as you blushed from all their stares

an hour later and I gunned

I sit all alone and I'm in love with a one night stand

This never happened before 
Was always able to walk out the door
But now, but now

They remember nothing, not having something

Do you remember back in the day when your mama said
?Some day when you're grown and you got your own
And know I knew what was best for you and I'm telling you
Then you must not remember your first crush??

Not like I don't appreciate
All the ways you try in protecting
But I just wish that some day
You'd open your eyes and see

That you're probably are right, don't worry
Got my mind on, right, so it ain't a thang, no
You gotta trust me, I'm feeling you, feeling you
But can you remember?

Feel the beat gettin' me excited

And I feel it comin' on
Footworkin' it takes you high
Wanna know how we do in the Chi
When we ridin' the hype
And I feel it comin' on

It ain't no thing just work it out (footwork)
Just bring your game show what you about (footwork)
It ain't no thing it's time to work it out
Watch ya feet work, watch ya head jerk, on ya tip toes kickin' up dirt with ya footwork

Footwork, and freeze, now stomp, start it up start it up

So what about they running up to me
Like hey girl don't you remember me

I'm thinking yeah that's great, but who are you
They seem to ask the same questions every time
And I help em' out, help em' out, bring em' round'

You wanna try and get something from me but I know what's up

You wanna friend me up (You say don't front)

And you wanna try and get to know more bout me

And then you start doing things so peculiar like it could have used me cause I'm a star

He comes over and sits with me
We watch movies, go online
Under strict parental guidance

Everyday that's how we be
Had all his attention on me
'Til my pops got me that new PlayStation 3
And a twenty inch flat HD

That's why I, I hate Madden
That's why I, I hate Madden

'Cause that joystick
Messed around and took my boyfriend
Them games be makin' me so sick
'Cause I can't compete

I was cool, we'd share it at first
You know how I'm takin’ this personal
Hands on my hip, muggin', neck rollin'
Snatched the controller, game over

He was cool but he flipped on me
Now I see how it's gon' be
Tried to act up, put his card like a school ID
Made him bounce, he don't really want me

The type that I should have known not to mess with
I had his heart, his number one chick
So he couldn't have been that committed

It's like I wasn't even in the room
He was all up in that tick, tick, boom
How you 'gon worry 'bout [Incomprehensible]
All I'm sayin', you really should have put this thing first

Keke Palmer,"Some people don't know what it really means to be hood
They think you're made here just a stuffler, you're up to no good
They think these brothers don't know nothing else but bling and white tees
And they think that all these women can do is somebody's weave

They think these hustlers and gangsters and goons riding by
But be easy with your mouth ?cause you don't know nothin? ?bout
The life that gets lived, the struggles to deal with
It?s hard some days, man, if you feel me then say I'm hood

Yes, I'm hood, H O O D
Don't speak on it if you don't know what it means
I was raised in the hood, overcame in the hood
Not ashamed of the hood ?cause the hood is in me

Yes, I'm hood, H O O D
Don't speak on it if you don't know what it means
I was raised in the hood, overcame in the hood
Not ashamed of the hood ?cause the hood is in me

Everybody put your hands up and rep the hood
If you wanna you can stand up, I know it feels good
Don't be ashamed of the hood, people change in the hood
Ain't nothin? strange ?bout the hood, it?s in everybody

No matter what you do they'll never see us no different
No matter what we accomplish [Incomprehensible]
We gettin? honors for Grammys, on Billboard chart toppers
Thought that they could stop us but we still got an Oscar

They can give it up because we ain't [Incomprehensible]
It?s a movement, baby, and there ain't no stoppin? that
So I?ma keep doin? me and hope you keep doin? you
We're look out for one another, at the end of the day I'm still hood

Yes, I'm hood, H O O D
Don't speak on it if you don't know what it means

If you wanna you can stand up, I know it feels good
Don't be ashamed of the hood, people change in the hood
Ain't nothin? strange ?bout the hood, it?s in everybody

I don't matter if you got some hood in your blood
It don't make you any less, represent it like what?
It don't matter, it makes you more real than the rest
People think it?s disrespect, consider it a blessing

?Cause you grew up on another side
Saw the world with a different eye, people don't realize
Learn to appreciate the little things and the joy life brings
Ain't nothin? wrong with bein? hood

Yes, I'm hood, H O O D
Don't speak on it if you don't know what it means
I was raised in the hood, overcame in the hood
Not ashamed of the hood ?cause the hood is in me

Keke Palmer,"""How Will I Know""

[Verse 1:]
I know there is something that I'm feeling
But I can't quite put it into words
It's got me hopin hopin that you feelin it too
Cause for me it's a first
Does anyone truly understand what real love is about
Don't say I'm too young to know what's real
My heart skips a beat
I can hardly breathe
Every time that he comes near

It's so amazing almost crazy how
I'm thinkin bout you lately
Tell me how in the world did it come to this
It took me by surprise
When you opened my eyes
To hopefully show me what love is

[Chorus:]
How will I know
Could it be the butterflies I feel whenever I'm with you
How will I know
Or the way I'm at a loss of words I can hardly keep my cool
How will I know
Everyday now stop stop stop I keep thinkin bout you
How will I know I'm in love

How will I know
Could it be the butterflies I feel whenever I'm with you
How will I know
Or the way I'm at a loss of words I can hardly keep my cool
How will I know
Everyday now stop stop stop I keep thinkin bout you
How will I know I'm in love

Somebody tell me
Will I ever know
Somebody tell me
Will I ever know

[Verse 2:]
If it ain't love
Then tell me why am I always searching for excuses to call
And if it ain't love
Then tell me why am I always hopin' to see him in the halls
And if it ain't love
Somebody tell me why I lie awake at night starin' at the walls

And if this isn't love
Then I don't really need it cause I'm happy here with no love at all

It's so amazing almost crazy how
I'm thinkin bout you baby
Still I don't really know if this is real
I want you so much more
But I'm unsure if this is true love
That I feel

[Chorus:]
How will I know
Could it be the butterflies I feel whenever I'm with you
How will I know
Or the way I'm at a loss of words I can hardly keep my cool
How will I know
Everyday now stop stop stop (everyday, all day)

Keke Palmer,"Listen up, turn your box up, gather all around
This one's strictly for the ghetto
Some of y'all recognize, some of y'all won't
Better pay attention and listen close

There was an old lady who lived in my hood
That sold freeze pops for a quarter
Had so many kids that I lost count
More sons than she had daughters

And every night before they would fall asleep
They'd pray for shelter and food to eat
But the landlord huffed and blew the house down
Now they out on the streets

And now she cleans, she mops
The tears they drop
The only sound that drowns it out
Comes from my music box

So just let the music play
Don't let it stop
It ain't easy growing up in the hood
But I got my music box

When the sirens sound wind it up
Or the shots ring down just wind it up
[Incomprehensible] the hood but I'm up to no good
?Cause I got my music box

There was an old man, he lived in the hood
Had rubber bands, dimes, and quarters worth a block
Put him away, left his wife and kids
And a sexist teenage daughter

Couldn't shake the reflections, starved to perfection
I've seen it all before
Now she ignores the advice of a kid folk
Tell her stay home but she creeping out the back door

And now she pays the cost
Young girl so lost
I feel your pain, try to maintain
Wind up your music box

So just let the music play
Don't let it stop
It ain't easy growing up in the hood
But I got my music box

When the sirens sound wind it up
Or the shots ring down just wind it up
[Incomprehensible] the hood but I'm up to no good
?Cause I got my music box

This hood situation's got me sick
Call the doctor, quick, quick, quick
Doctor, doctor, will I die?
Na, na, young girl, just let the song play

So just let the music play
Don't let it stop
It ain't easy growing up in the hood
But I got my music box

When the sirens sound wind it up
Or the shots ring down just wind it up

Keke Palmer,"We were so close like two souls in one heart
But you're giving me this feeling that we're drifting apart
You don't come to me like you use to and I don't cry on your shoulder
I'm trying to understand this before darkness takes over

Did we lose touch cause' I didn't show you love?
Did I say too much, didn't I say enough?
Did I let you down last time you came around?
I hate to see you pull away

It's like our rainbow's fading to black and white
And I just don't know why we have to fight
Do we have a problem? Can we resolve it?
Is it something that we gotta talk about? Can we figure it out?

'Cause if we can't make it work, make it right
Our rainbow's gonna turn to black and white
White, white, white, white

The distance between us is growing everyday
Filling up with words, we had no chance to say
What we had was like magic, we?d always thought the same thing
I'm afraid we might lose that, the colors are already changing

Did we lose touch cause' I didn't show you love?
Did I say too much, didn't I say enough?
Did I let you down last time you came around?
I hate to see you pull away

And I just don't know why we have to fight
Do we have a problem? Can we resolve it?
Is it something that we gotta talk about? Can we figure it out?

'Cause if we can't make it work, make it right
Our rainbow's gonna turn to black and white

Rainbow, the shades have turned to black and white
Every color disappears when you're not here
Our rainbow turns to black and white
Can we resolve it? We gotta get over it

The shades have turned to black and white
Every color disappears when you're not here
Our rainbow turns to black and white
Can we resolve it? We gotta get over it

I just wish we could go back to the way we were before as friends
I mean right now it just seems like something?s wrong
No more fights, no more violence
Wanna be best friends

Just doesn't make sense, I mean I know how it can be

Can we get over this? We gotta get over it

I need somebody with a strong bank plan
I need a man who can with the third hand

Reminiscin' what it feels with a thug, playa what

I need a bad boy, to lay with
I need a bad boy in a beater and tims
Wanna a thug around then I wanna do it again

Like two  or three
When you bring that body next to me, 
That's what I need
We can do it fast or slow, 
And around and round we go
Strawberries and ice cream, 
That's what he brings
But we never do the same thing, 
Ya na' mean
That's the kind I need in my life
That will make a sista feel right
Sippin' champagne, shootin' dice games, 
It don't quit
In the rain or a ninja doin' tricks
He's a thug and he's pretty
But he'll throw 'em' up quickly

Gotta get my prada bag
Step out the S-ca jag,

Tired of lookin' at this lazy face
Sleepin' in the bed that I paid for
Used to have a job but he don't no more
Said that he got big plans for me
Can I move in till I get on my feet
But it's been a year and 3 months passed
Gotta show me somethin' 
'cause I don't want to give up on you, man

I don't want to give up now (no no no no)
I don't want to throw the towel (no)
I don't want to waste all of this time

Don't want to do what my girls say do (what my girls say do)
I don't want to
I don't want to (I don't wanna)
I don't want to (no)

Work all day then when I get home
I want to spend some time with my man alone
DVD or some BET
Dinner for two, just you and me

Cellphone rings now he's at the mall
Shoppin' is a must when the bills are paid
So I don't need to tell you baby just hear me when I say

And you're tellin' me you're lovin' me
Put your hands on my thighs
While I'm starin' in yo brown eyes

I can picture us runnin' in the rain
After a movie then we spark a flame
Oh I love it when you scream my name
Goin' 60 in a 30 lane
We pull over to the parkin' lot
In the park that's my favorite spot
Doing just about anything
We'll be goin' 'til the birds sing

How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more

And yes I do regret the day I took your broke ass in
To my life, to my home, to my bed
Said that I must have lost my head

I guess you thought 
That I'd let you walk on me like the floor
I guess you thought 
That you'd keep tracking dirt inside my door
You got it all wrong
It's been too long 
All of the love is gone
Now I'm singing you this song

There's nothing I wouldn't do to make it up to you
One conversation baby that's all I ask
We can work this thing out it really ain't all that bad
See I was wrong for what I did all those nasty things I said
I was trying to pay you back for making me so mad
So if my soul my heart I beat
Will you help me on my feet
And I promise you I'll never fall again

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I got nothing to give without you
Cause I don't wanna breathe without you
I don't wanna love without you
I think I'm giving up without you
I know I can't go another day, without you

I stay locked in my room I don't go out no more
I keep hoping it's you that's knocking on my door
I'm not sleeping too well I've not had a meal in days
See baby I need your help what is it gonna take
I would give my soul my breath if you just meet me at end
So that I can tell you all the things you need to hear
And I swear to tell the truth cause I never lie to you
Let's get back to making love like lovers do

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I got nothing to give without you
Cause I don't wanna breathe without you
I don't wanna cry without you
I think I'm gonna die without you
I know I can't go another day, without you

Loneliness is what I'll forever breathe
Only If U decide to rescue me
Show me the way to get back to your heart
And I'll travel down that road no matter how far
Where ever you are

You are too scared I won't let it bring me down

Don't be blinded by love
Cause enough is enough enough
Heard a million stories
Enough is enough enough
You got to let him go
There is no reason to love love
Can't let him take control
It's only burning you
Enough is enough enough
Is tearing you apart

Lately I know times you have been empty
So lone without the calls it's confusing
Don't let it disturb your mind
You can lose it I have seen it with my eyes
It's abusing and different disguise
Some excuses it can leave you so hurt and miserable
Without a question

Don't be blinded by love

Emotions be something with the shame
Ends cold out of blue, assumption in the face
I hope you will find someone that cares about you girl
Who respect you who appreciates you and holds it down for you
Gotta know how much you truly worth

Pray that there is traffic when you are on your way
Every green light on the street turns to red

I know you mean well 
You're genuine I can tell 
Besides you and me 
I know that we would soar 
But are you ready? 
You gotta be sure  you gotta be sure 

Oh no I know you got the feeling, hold on

You feel like hitting the ceiling, hold on 
Hey this is my life, hold on 

So we're arguing 
Talking about it back and forth 
And forth and back as if there is no source 
And now I'm wondering 
Is this what he had in mind? 
Cause if I thought we'd get through that door 
Tell me what's gonna be my price

Word is he's seven - thirty his hands never dirty

When they hear this Neptune talk
N.E.R.D. we levitate when we moon walk
Ain't shit stoppin', my laser clip dropping
Pullin' up in my intersects with my bitch robbing
Star Track we walk around with rockets in our pockets
Make my fucking dick hard the way my glock spit
Remind me of last night got my neck and cock licked
Day dream, rude awakening she smoking chocolate
Jesus, Simon

Love roaming like Caesar's time and
Yo Kelis you Arabian diamond
If I'm the sun and your a diamond
Baby we be shining
And all my hoes gone
You blowed them away and the ozone
So hot and so rich feeling this ghost tone
Sol nigga and sol bitch
Accept our foes is gone
The world smells is fishy
But I smell nothing when your lips kissed me
Guardian now, fuck is he?
Don't dare but love me
Karats stuffed
Straight up beware of us
Body in the truck odor it's just scared of us
The devil's mad and ain't trying to see the Armageddon
So I name our first daughter Nazareth
My first son Heaven
Yeah the world is real crazy, huh
And ya don't stop, uh

I'm still dreaming
I don't see you
I can't feel you
I'm alone for real in my mind
I'll feel this all night
When my life takes flight

This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time

I feel like I'm falling
What happens when I hit?
Must mean then that's it
This black abyss, this pit
It all seems shades of gray
I'm never ready for light of day

This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time

This isn't just in your mind
We're suspended from space and time

Why do you hurt me?
This reality
Why you smile at me?
Show your fallacies
Dreams hold me down
But let me go
When reality will wake me

My bodies back on Earth
Only spirits can fly
Soaring through dimensions of love
Kinds only my father speaks of

What makes you think?
You get away with that
Talking to my best friend
Behind my back
Look what you did to us
Look what you did to me
What a wonderful loss
Wouldn't you agree?

She introduced me to you
Said you were just friends
She assured me you were the one
For me until the end
Now I should have known
By the magic between you two

Can lie too, can lie too

He has an appetite, for sex and cash,
He hangs on the corner, talking trash,
Or rolling, in his freak mobile,
Mercedes Benz, on 20 inch wheels,
Get calls all day, on his cellular phone,
From nasty girls, they won't leave him alone,
He's got them crying, 'cause they can't see,
Why he's in love with a girl like me,
Innocent, kinda polite,
The kind of girl who says her prayers at night,
He picks me up everyday from school,
And all my friends, they just dream and drool,
And on the way, the music blasts,
We hit my street, he lets off the gas,
And just before, my house appears,
He pulls over whispers in my ear...

Nothing but a whole night of griding and grabbing
Moanin and groaning till six in the morning

You'll be hearing my car door slamming
And Perelli's balling, chrome chain, daddy for short
Honey sub for bartender, E & J on the rocks

And shoes to the bags

Yeah Yeah

I know the phrase far-fetched
Could never seem this far (I love the way you talk to me)
But did I ever tell you you're my shooting star
Warmer than a house
Faster than your car (there's nothing like it)
Did I ever tell you you're my shooting star

It's a cold night
But you would never know (you keep me warm)
And there are more blues than any I could ever see
It's like a melody (like this song) every breath is heavenly
A deep, deep sea
I'm lost completely
When you speak to me
When you speak to me

Said you're something
You're special
You're blessed too
You guide me (tell me more)
You protect me from this cold world
When you hold me (Yeah)
And don't let go of me
I said your wings are white
They're very wide
That's why you fly

Baby angel girl
With this world we're in

But I'm your wife so in these hands, you put your life
Hold me like your baby, treat me like your lady

Never did I lie, never did I mean to trick y'all
But they told me this is how to get rich, y'all
Makin' hit songs, same lame lyrics, same bass, same kickdrum
Buy the record, you became a vic-vic-victim

Bitch can't front, get what I want
Neck, hands & my wrists numb, sickenin?
Diamonds on my wristband, who I'm talkin' to?
You, you & my biggest fan, thinkin' that ya girl got it all

And I got the best man, best hair, best legs, need a break, you in my face
Askin' K what I'm puttin' out next year
Is it gonna be real freaky, critics wanna come critique me
Are you gonna be more grunge rock-n-roll like back when you dropped before?

But get back 'fore I get ill

Groupies just too much, everybody's like, ""let's do lunch""

That's why it doesn't matter, that's why I'm not a rapper
Still spit a few bars, might never hear this song
Label might say, ""Hell naw! Get a new female star
She don't have to sing - she don't have to bring anything!""

Get her some new earrings, fly her off to Beijing
Book her shows in Wyoming, David Letterman & Conan
Your advance just alone and doesn't it all sound grand?
Number one on SoundScan, just keep the clubs bouncin', join us

Come join our circus where we all wear masks

How can I shake this circus clown?
What does the ringmaster need from his crowd?
Should I dive through the circle of fire?
No - I'm just gonna be me!

And your mind is set on touching the stars
Can't you tell I'm ready to leave?
So I can meet you wherever you are, baby

Something 'bout tonight
Something 'bout the way you look

Got my rockets turned on
So we can blast off straight to the moon
You can take that Jacob off

Kelis,"I was walking, was living
My melody was acapella
There's a beat I was missing
No tune, or a scale, I could play

The sound in the distance
No orchestra playing together
Like a boat out to sea,
The silence was too deafening

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing

Everything was the same
One color was just like the others
An assembly routine
My memories were all black and white
Till I stopped over thinking
Decided to draw back the curtains
And I cleared all the cobwebs
And began to let in the light

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing

You are the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

You are the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

You are the drum in my heart beat

Stuck on the notes you play

Keller Williams,"Freak of nature, with jaw dropping skill
From the low rhythmic bass lines to the harmonic fills
New Age Funk on acoustic guitar
Always wanted to be like him, Except for that day in the car
With the old beat up Martin
He would spank like a hound
Not even God knew what he turned to he had his own sound

[Chorus]
He was ""Live on a Double Planet"" 
He was ""Watching his Life go By""
All the ""Aerial Boundaries""
Lifted me so I could fly
He had ""Breakfast in the Field"" with the ""Taproot""
And the ""Tourched"" theories would burn
""The Oracle"" of his own existence
Is now on ""The Road to Return""

Sometimes the louden or the Impossible Harp thing
Playing drum on a bouncing ball, I loved to hear him sing
Spike dog collar that hung his rabies tag
Dramatic interpretation his shows would never drag

Or way up to Telluride
Or that day in High Sierra
Where we definitely locked eyes.",Not of This Earth
Keller Williams,"Earl is the dog
Sheeba is his girl
She is the queen of the tundra
He is the golden boy

Like any couple in love
They have their issues
There are lines that could never be crossed
Even though they drink from the same bowl
They could never eat from the same bowl
That's a line that can never be crossed
So don't you even try

Earl is the dog
(Little earlie)
Sheeba is his girl
(Sweet Sheeba)
She is the queen of the tundra
He is the golden boy

It's an all day affair
To lay and be petted
Spend some time with a chewy toy
Just sniff around
Follow that smell
Nudge the gate open
To the outside world
Where the squirrels run for their lives
And the scent goes on forever

He's a bed-hog
She is leaky
He's the watchdog
She's the front seat security
But the deadly gas
That can clear a room
Or make you think
You're gonna wreck the car
Eventually goes away
We don't seem to mind
It happens every day
All the time
‘Cause they can do no wrong
And now they are immortal

Kelley Polar,"When in my mind
I know that I have tried
Only to find
That you're not satisfied

And you want to see
How life would be
If you still had more
You say that you feel
An emptiness inside
But true love
Is something that you can't divide

Still if you told me
That you need three
I'd give you four
Ahhh, ahhh
Ahhh, ahhhh...

I see that you're 
Not above
Taking a chance to see
If you even know love
Could tolerate the oddity
But when your someone is just a some
You can leave out me

And if in the end 
When you've had enough
I will be yours
And I will have had enough
And if there is only two
Maybe it's true
That the two are one",Thurston and Grisha

That I could fly
But when I woke
I had forgotten how
And now it seems
I don't know why
I just feel so much sadder now
I jumped from high
And hoped to rise
But gravity would not allow it
So now I fall 
And close me eyes
I guess it doesn't matter now

I hear the sound
And I feel the wind
Falling in my endless dive
I'm wondering about how strange it's been
How strange it's been to be alive
I see the ground
And here at the end
I think about how I might survive
I'll fall half way and half again
Perhaps I never will arrive
Perhaps I never will arrive
Perhaps I never will arrive

What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you

Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand always, always

Days may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there always

Finishing the hat
How you have to finish the hat
How you watch the rest of the world
From a window while you finish the hat

Mapping out a sky
What you feel like, planning a sky
What you feel when the voices that come from the window go
Until they distance and die, until there's nothing but sky

And how you're always turning back too late, from the grass
Or the stick or the dog or the light, how the kind of man
Who's willing to waits, not the kind that you want to find waiting
To return you to the night, dizzy from the height

Coming from the hat, studying the hat
Entering the world of the hat
Reaching through the world of the hat like a window
Back to this one from that

Studying the face, stepping back to look at a face
Leaves a little space in the way
Like a window but to see
It's the only way to see

And when the one man that you wanted goes
You can say to yourself, ""Well, I'd give what I'd give""
But the one man who won't wait for you knows
That however you live, there's a part of you

Always standing by, mapping out the sky
Finishing the hat, starting on a hat
Finishing a hat, look, I made a hat
Where there never was a hat",Finishing the Hat [From Sunday in the Park with George]
Kelli O'Hara,"Well, well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well, well, well
Wonders never cease

She loves me and to my amazement I love it
Knowing that she loves me
She loves me, true, she doesn't show it
How could she, when she doesn't know it?

Yesterday she loathe me
Now today she likes me
And tomorrow and tomorrow

My teeth ache from the urge to touch her
I'm speechless for I mustn't tell her
It's wrong now but it won't be long now

Hope my love discovers
That she and I are lovers
Imagine how surprised she's bound to be
She loves me

She loves me and loves [Incomprehensible]
She don't show it, how could she?
She don't know it

Tomorrow
I'm tingling such delicious tingles
I'm trembling
What the heck does that mean?

I'm freezing, that's because it's cold out
But still I'm incandescent

I'd like to scrawl on every word I see

Kelli O'Hara,"Is it warm, is it soft against your face?
Do you feel the kind of grace inside the breeze?
Will there be trees, is there light?
Does it hover on the ground?
Does it shine from all around or just from you?

Is it endless and empty and you wander on your own?
Slowly forget about the folks that you have known
Water's rising, bread fill up the air
From moping kitchens everywhere
Familiar faces far as you can see, like a family

Do we live, is it like a little town?
Do we get to look back down at who we love?
Are we above, are we everywhere, are we anywhere at all?
Do we hear a trumpet call us and we're by your side?

Will I want or will I wish
For all the things that I should have done?
Longing to finish what I only just begun

Or has a shiny truth been waiting there
For all the questions everywhere
In a world of wondering, suddenly you know
And you will always know

Will my mama be there waiting for me?
Smiling like the ways she does
And holding out her arms
And she calls my name
She will hold me just the same

In the starlight, that is what we are

Sleep, sleep, I couldn't sleep tonight
Not for all the jewels in the crown

I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exciting
While all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night

Kelli O'Hara,"Once I was, I was, I was, there were ribbons in my hair
There were leaves of streaming gold everywhere
If a boy said, ""Hello"", I would hide, trembling so, trembling so
Now I barely know what the meaning of 'No' is

Now I am, I am, I am past an audience I stare
What is gold is how the lights touch my hair
All the boys turn to men, all the leaves change again
Change again, change again
Still I answer, ""Yes"" though I know what will happen

As these phases come and go
Music tells me what I need to know",Once I Was

One love to be living for
One love to be living for

Close to my heart he came
Only to fly away
Only to fly as day

Still saying that paradise

I wish I'd spent with you

I'll keep remembering kisses

Kelli O'Hara,"Once I hated this city
Now it can't get me down
Slushy, humid and gritty
What a pretty town

What thought I could be duller
More depressing, less gay
Now my favorite color
Is gray

A wall of rain as it turns to sleep
The lack of sun on a one-way street
I love the grime all the time
And what more do I need?

My window pane has a lovely view
An inch of sky and a fly or two
Why I can see half a tree
And what more do I need?

The dusk is thick and it's galling
It simply can't be excused
In winter even the falling snow looks
Used

My window pane may not give much light
But I see you, so the view is bright
If I can love you, I'll pay the dirt no heed
With your love what more do I need?

Someone shouting for quiet
Someone starting a brawl
Down the block there's a riot
And I'll buy it all

Listen now, I'm ecstatic
Hold me close and be still
Hear the lovely pneumatic
Drill

A subway train thunders through the Bronx
A taxi horn on the corner honks
But I adore every roar
And what more do I need?

I hear a crane making street repairs
A two ton child running wild upstairs
Steam pipes bang, sirens clang
And what more do I need?

The neighbors yell in the summer
The landlord yells in the fall
So loud I can't hear the plumber
Pound the wall

An aeroplane roars across the bay
But I can hear you as clear as day
You said you loved me
Above the sound and speed
With your love what more do I need?",What More Do I Need? [From Saturday Night]

Stretch my arms up 
And look out the window

Birds are singing 
I am greeted by the gift of another new morning 
And I know tonight as my head hits the pillow 

I will ask myself as I look out the same window 
At the end of the day 
Did I laugh and dance enough 
Did I tell my friends how much they really mean to me 

At the end of the day 
Did I really push myself 
Or was I too afraid 
To give my heart away 

At the end of the day 
I want to learn I want to live 
take some big chance and just trust in my instincts and my intuition 
If I win or if I lose 

Any road that I choose 
I will drive all the way 
I want to know tonight as I fall fast asleep 
I am one day closer 

To where I want to be 
At the end of the day 
Did I laugh and dance enough 
Did I tell my friends how much they really mean to me 

At the end of the day

In a heartbeat a wiseman can be a fool

Or a heartache that never ends
Through the darkest hours 
When all is said and done
It has the power
You go from lonely to the lucky one

Love's funny that way
Now matter who you are
It can shake your faith
Or it can break your heart
Once in a while the mountains move
We all long for those days
You live, you laugh, you say
Love's funny that way

Not long ago I got to know the lonely side
Just me and my pain and nowhere to hide
It amazes me
How my world turned around
If it's meant to be
That's all that matters to me anyhow

No matter who you are
It can shake your faith

We got it we got it we got it goin' on
And with a little luck and a lotta love
We'll keep it goin' strong
We got it we got it we got it goin' on
Let's keep holdin' tight cause it feels so right
We know we can't go wrong

The road gets rough but we keep movin'
The music stops but we're still groovin'
Through it all baby we keep provin' it ain't a fantasy
What love was meant to be
'Cause baby you and me

We got it we got it we got it goin' on
And with a little luck and a lotta love
We'll keep it goin' strong
We got it we got it we got it goin' on
Let's keep holdin' tight cause it feels so right
We know we can't go wrong",Everywhere
Kellie Coffey,"Jenny was my best friend.
Went away one summer.
Came back with a secret 
She just couldn't keep.
A child inside her,
Was just too much for her
So she cried herself to sleep.

And she made a decision
Some find hard to accept.
To young to know that one day
She might live to regret.

But I would die for that.
Just to have one chance
To hold in my hands
All that she had.
I would die for that.

I've been given so much,
A husband that I love.
So why do I feel incomplete?
With every test and checkup
We're told not to give up.
He wonders if it's him.
And I wonder if it's me.

All I want is a family,
Like everyone else I see.
And I won't understand it
If it's not meant to be.

'Cause I would die for that.
Just to have one chance
To hold in my hands
All that they have.
I would die for that.

And I want to know what it's like
To bring a dream to life.
For that kind of love,
What I'd give up!
I would die for that.

Sometimes it's hard to conceive, 
With all that I've got,
And all I've achieved,
What I want most 
Before my time is gone,
Is to hear the words
""I love you, Mom.""

I would die for that. 
Just to have once chance
To hold in my hands
What so many have
I would die for that.

And I want to know what it's like
To bring a dream to life.
How I would love
What some give up.
I would die 
I would die for that.",I Would Die for That
Kellie Pickler,"I remember the way you made love to me
Like I was all you'd ever need
Did you change your mind
Well I didn't change mine
Now here I am trying to make sense of it all
We were best friends now we don't even talk
You broke my heart
Ripped my world apart

Didn't you know how much I loved you
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you

I can't get you out of my head
I still feel you in this bed
Left me all alone
You couldn't be more gone
From falling apart to fighting mad
From wanting you back to not giving a damn
I've felt it all
I've been to the wall

Didn't you know how much I loved you
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you

One day justice will come and find you
And I'll be right there in your memory to remind you

Didn't you know how much I loved you
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby
Baby, tell me

Didn't you know how much I loved you
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you",Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You
Kellie Pickler,"I gave away my first real kiss
In the rain on a Friday night
To the star of the football team
Underneath the stadium lights
I cried the day he told me he was moving on
And I swore I'd never love again
All summer long

[Chorus]
I can still smell the blossoms of those sweet Magnolia trees
I can still hear the Bible stories that my grandma used to read
As years fly by, I'm still the same inside as I used to be
I guess there ain't no changing girls like me

I rode with grandpa in his pickup truck
Standing in the front seat
Had my arm around his shoulder
I was his little diamond store queen
We listened to all those songs playing on the radio
Now I lay in bed and wonder
Where did all those days go

[Chorus]

I want to settle down but I need to be free
I might be afraid to fall
But I've still got a dream

I can still smell the blossoms of those sweet Magnolia trees
I can still hear the Bible stories that my grandma used to read
All the years fly by, I'm still the same inside as I used to be
I guess there ain't no changing
I guess there ain't no changing
I guess there ain't no changing girls like me
Girls like me
Girls like me",Girls Like Me
