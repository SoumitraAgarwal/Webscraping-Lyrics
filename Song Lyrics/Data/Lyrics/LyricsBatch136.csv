Gene Clark,"I  walked by your window
I thought that maybe you'd see me
Knowing there'd be changes
Is this the way it was to be
The things we planned just yesterday
Was it only something that we had to say
Last night I remember
You looked as though you really cared
Today not the same one
You had another face prepared
The magic of those things we'd seen
Vanished with the words that we were supposed to mean
I called up your name and
Maybe its true that you don't know me
Could this be the same one
Who had so much you wished to show me
I don't know what was to believe
I guess I'll pick my mind up and then I'll leave",The Same One
Gene Clark,"Well you're smolderin' with fly words,
Catch the moment on the run
And you say there's nothin' easy
About the plywood tract you're from
And you stand inside your wind stilts
Watch the sentence act begun

So you say you lost your baby
Do you know that your the one
With the stand to watch the trials go,
From here to there behind the scene
Throw your troubles to the moon trolls
To swallow up like stormy dreams
Take an entrance to a stand-off,
Looking if there's such a strife

And you say you lost your baby,
Wondering if its in your life
Well you fly your banners Mondays,
That take a rise and fall in one
Ask the questions of the pilgrims,
As they come to pledge what's done
Claim a tabernacle hillside
Where you'll sight the dyin' sun

So you say you lost your baby,
Don't you know that you're the one.
So you say you lost your baby,
Do you know that you're the one.",So You Say You Lost Your Baby
Gene Clark,"I think I'm gonna feel better when tomorrow comes
When I see the sun through my window
I think that everything is going to be all right
Though I know that you have found another
I hope you understand that I
Still love you so bad
But when tomorrow morning comes
I hope that you will see the sun shine too
Come shining through
I think I'm gonna feel better when tomorrow comes
When I see the sun
When I see the sun",Think I'm Gonna Feel Better
Gene Clark,"Stopped awhile this morning on my way back home
I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone
Cause she is moving somewhere far away  not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go
Even though this time it really hurts me bad
I've been through similarities 
It's not the first break I've had
And I just can't let it bring me down too low
And though I tried so hard to please her
There must be something more to know
Never thought that we would end this way
It seemed  that everything was going fine
Still with all the things that I can do or say
It won't change the fate I know so well is mind

So I'll stop and look right past the pain
Cause I've been in love before and I can love again
While she is moving somewhere far away not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go",Tried So Hard

Gene Clark,"And there could be at any moment a change
And if perhaps to put us down
I won't act like I've seen something strange
Maybe I just won't make a sound
But when the door closes before my eyes
Oh, oh I will cry
Just to know you are going to stay
Out on the side

No I'm not looking to find any holes
From what I think has been denied
That's not the feeling of love when it flows
I hope I can lose that much pride
And if it should come the time when we lose
No I won't try to hide
I'll just watch other's love as it goes
Out on the side

I have fallen through black nights it seems
With the times that I've lied
And I've watched your thoughts stray into dreams
When you're not satisfied
But when the door closes before my eyes
Oh, oh I will cry
Just to know you are going to stay
Out on the side
Out on the side",Out on the Side
Gene Clark,"I lost ten points just for bein'
In the right place at exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there
But I may as well have been completely blind

So if you see me walkin' all alone.  
Don't look back I'm just on my way back home
There's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on

She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life long
Looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't somethin' more to blame it on

But if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now and I won't be hangin' on
There's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on

Thirteen-twenty North Columbus
Was the address that I'd written down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
Might have been that it was gettin' time to leave

And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said  ""Lead on""
Cause there's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on

There's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on",Train Leaves Here This Mornin'
Gene Clark,"You stood not near
Yet hear so clear
Your story had to start
The jingle sun
Has really run
Into my aching heart

And now we shall see
What the future will bring
As we swing freely as one
And now we shall know
What love will show us has begun
So here's to you
With care from someone

This evening came
But not the same
As yesterday had been
Today had come
You're with someone
To hold now deep within

And maybe we'll find
This time is designed
For finding the meaning of one

And now we will know
What love will show us has begun
So here's to you
With care from someone

And now we shall see
What the future will bring
As we swing freely as one

And now we shall know
What love will show us has begun
So here's to you
With care from someone",With Care from Someone
Gene Clark,"With all the legends that the century sings
And it's vision bring to life
While foreign waters breathe against the shore
And the wind plays ore it's rusted fife
I see the ships of a friendly fleet
And a song so sweetly sounding
And gentle souls who think not to defeat
As across the waves they are bounding

And then the thoughts of all the days this time
They have been confined without reason
And in the matters of their health and wealth
They cannot be defined but as treason
But go where and find the better life
As in the name of love you have freed them
And those you need not you have left behind
And those you keep in mind you know to heed them

Across the bridge, across the river
Where we've never been before
Within and out of worlds around us
And in the light of finding more
We always easy understood that
It was no good not to explore
But never really understood that
It was no good just to ignore",1975
Gene Clark,"You toss your head and turn your eyes when storm clouds brew
You look around to quick relate to a good time you knew
Then the dark clouds break away and a rainbow comes on through
The sun I see only shines for me because of you
Before this time we both saw blind in spite of fact
We lost our place and made no haste to make contact
Now by what we gain the taste of one and two
I'm satisfied beneath my pride because of you
And now the worth of living wealth is more in the end
And now the price of simple things is not so much to spend
So close your eyes and pick a place to fly away
And think of reasons why this warmth is here to stay
Then the dark clouds break away and a rainbow comes on through
The sun I see only shines for me because of you
Yes, the sun I see only shines for me because of you",Because of You
Gene Clark,"The dissonant bells of the sea 
Who are ringing the rhymes of the deep
As they sing of the ages  asleep  
Not so near or so far

And the old masters wind of the waves
Sped forth for the free men and slaves
Whispers of secrets it saves
And about whom they are
   
And the workings of sunshine and rain   
And the visions they paint that remain    
Pulsate from my soul through my brain     
In a Spanish guitar

The beggar whom sits in the street
On his miserable throne of defeat
Envisions no wealth there to meet
Thinking nowhere is far

And the laughter of children employed
By the fantasies not yet destroyed
By the dogmas of those they avoid
Knowing not what they are

And the right and the wrong and insane
And the answers they cannot explain
Pulsate from my soul through my brain
In a Spanish guitar

To play on a Spanish guitar
With the sun shining down where you are
Skipping and singing a bar
From the music around

Just to laugh through the columns of trees
To soar like a seagull in breeze
To stand in the rain if you please
Or to never be found",For a Spanish Guitar
Gene Clark,"We carried you in our arms
On Independence Day,
And now you'd throw us all aside
And put us on our way.
Oh what dear daughter 'neath the sun
Would treat a father so,
To wait upon him hand and foot
And always tell him, ""No""?
Tears of rage, tears of grief,
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so alone
And life is brief.

We pointed out the way to go
And scratched your name in sand,
Though you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand.
Now, I want you to know that while we watched,
You discover there was no one true.
Most ev'rybody really thought
It was a childish thing to do.
Tears of rage, tears of grief,
Must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so low
And life is brief.

It was all very painless
When you went out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe.
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse.
But, oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief,
Must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so low
And life is brief.",Tears of Rage
Gene Clark,"Where my love lies asleep
There's no chains to her spirit
As she enters the doorway
Of dreams drifting free
Lightning's flash, rivers roar
Round the island she's sleeping
And the echoes soul
That speaks where she's sleeping
Where my love lies asleep
There's no past nor tomorrow
Only treasures to keep
There's no fears there to borrow

Through the hallways of wonder
Down the steps of the deep
And the secrets that drum
Where my love lies asleep
Past the suns in the morning
Past the stars in their sleep
And the worlds that are near
Where my love lies asleep",Where My Love Lies Asleep
Gene Clark,"When the night has come 
And the land is dark 
And the moon is the only light we'll see 
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid 
Just as long as you stand, stand by me 

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, 
Oh now now stand by me 
Stand by me, stand by me 

If the sky that we look upon 
Should tumble and fall 
And the mountains should crumble to the sea 
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear 
Just as long as you stand, stand by me 

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me 
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me, yeah 

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, 
Oh now now stand by me 
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me 

Darlin', darlin', stand by me, stand by me 
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me",Stand by Me [*]
Gene Clark,"Funny how the circle turns around 
First your up and then your down again
Though the circle takes what it may give 
Each time around it makes you live again 

Funny how the circle is a wheel 
And it can steal someone who is a friend
Funny how the circle takes your flight 
And if it's it right it brings you back again 

Funny how the circle turns around 
You think your lost and then you're found again 
Though you always look for what you know  
Each time around it's something new again",Full Circle Song
Gene Clark,"It's ten PM and I should have made the road tonight  
The moon was out and the clouds came in and took it's light  
My suitcase is over there somehow I  just don't care  
Cause I don't want to be anywhere but right here tonight 
The rains came down and I should have made an early plane 
Where I'd rather be if it can't be seen then I can't explain 
It's so warm in here and I want to hold you near 
And there is no pain or fear right here tonight 
With tomorrows dawn I will carry on what I've set aside
It's not a matter of my faith or of my pride 
It just seems so insane  to strike out in the rain
When it's so easy to remain right here tonight",Here Tonight
Gene Clark,"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

How many lips have kissed you
And set your heart a-glow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

So always make me wonder
Always make me guess
And be there if I ask you
Darling don't confess

Just let it remain your secret
Cause darling I love you so
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know",I Really Don't Want to Know
Gene Clark,"I see the travelers comin'
I watch them rollin' down the line
I see the transits movin'
I remember the railroad line.

I see some smilin' faces
Common place like they've peace of mind.
So many different places
I remember there's more than one kind.

From a place that I can call my home
Down the road that I must call my own
I see no easy way
(But) Today I've got to say
I don't mind seeing what I'm being shown

So I see the jet planes flying
I watch them out of sight
I keep on what I'm tryin'
Hoping that time will treat me right
I remember the railroad line.",I Remember the Railroad
Gene Clark,"I came into town on a Monday morning
The tall buildings breaking up the city sky
The streets were wet it had just been pouring
Like the clouds above the storm just had to cry
I trained my eye on a police cruiser
I watched and I gulped as he passed me by
I looked around to see the street lights changing
And a voice down deep inside me asked me why
Running through my thoughts
Were the memories of the days that I had left behind
Way down in my soul were the hope
That better days were always there to find
The fog rolled in and the lights grew dimmer
And the sound of the city streets seemed amplified
In the misty morning when it had just been pouring
Like the clouds above the storm just had to cry
Like the clouds  above the storm just had to cry",In a Misty Morning
Gene Clark,"Don't you come down  
Don't you feel bad
Even though your dreams are of 
The things you've never had

Close to the earth
Near to the sun
Reflecting your own life
You can see that you 
Can be more than one

Hear the bells ring, morning has come
Over the town the morning star fades in the dawn
Voices of time bringing surprise  
Voices that sing in waking moments    
To look into life's eye

Aren't you glad it's another day 
Look and tell
So you though you would run away 
But you know that way too well

Rhythms of rhyme
Seasons shall say
To look at a longer life now 
A longer yesterday
Don't you come down
You know you're the one
Looking at tomorrow
Let your your troubles
Fade and fly into the sun",One in a Hundred
Gene Clark,"Hallways and staircases everyday to climb 
To go up to my white walled room out on the end of time
Where I can be with my love for she is all that is mine 
And she'll always be there, my love don't care about time 

I laugh with her, cry with her, hold her close she is mine
The way she tells me of her love and never is she trying 
She don't have to be assured of many good things to find 
And she'll always be there, my love don't care about time

Her eyes are dark and deep with love, her hair hangs long and fine 
She walks with ease and all she sees is never wrong or right 
And with her arms around me tight I see her all in my mind
And she'll always be there my love don't care about time",She Don't Care About Time
Gene Clark,"She's the kind of girl
Together like a lion
The kind everybody wants to know
She can fool you with her ways
Leave you with nothing much to say
And you try not to hang around
But you really don't want to see her go away

She's the kind of girl
Mary golden time
Sunshine and flowers in her hair
Simple ways she don't complain   
She likes to move
She won't explain
And you wonder in the night
If everything was right with you
She might remain
Doesn't everybody want to hear
Doesn't everybody want to know
What it is to be so near
And watch it go

She's the kind of girl
Really has to see
What it is that's on your mind
She takes the time and understands
She makes no judgments, no demands  
But she makes you feel the fool
When you wonder how she slipped
Right through your hands",She's the Kind of Girl
Gene Clark,"You were born into the storm
Cast adrift upon a wave
To be living and make life begin

Like the ancient mystic ship
Bounding seaward toward the sun
Becomes a cosmic dancer in the wind

Stars that shine and rains that swirls
Sparkling sands of endless worlds
Driven by the thought that men are free

Love that makes and breaks a man
Memories fade and new ones stand
And another ship bounds through the sea

Like in dreams sometimes it's so confusing to change
When you move from where you have been
To where you have come
Like in life when you look in to a child's eyes
They see it's all very clear
It's near and then gone

Before the rising of the sun
Before the whirling winds were stirred
Before the simple rhymes of men were sung

Before the age of hate and pride
Before we laughed, before we cried
We were all contained and then begun",Shooting Star
Gene Clark,"Some walk out winners of those who've lost
Can it be said at any price this is the cost
Hard is perception, easier is blame
Is this the only life for everyone
Isn't it the same

Children laugh and run away
While others look into the darkness of the day
Some streets are easy while some are cruel
Could these be reasons why man 
Is life's greatest fool

Do you believe when you're all alone
You held the key to your destiny gone
Do you believe in your soul
That too much loneliness makes you grow old

Words can be empty though filled with sound
Stoned numb and drifting, hard to be profound
Formed out of pleasure, chiseled by pain
Never the highest and not the last one to gain",Life's Greatest Fool
Gene Clark,"All alone you say  
That you don't want no other
So the lord is love and love is like no other
If the falling tide can turn and then recover
All alone we must  be part of one another
All alone you say
The power is perfection
Is the power of peace  or merely the connection
To the God of love  that powers the protection
From the tide of life that flows in each direction
When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind must find the right direction
All alone you say

That you don't want no other
So the lord is love and love is like no other
If the falling tide can turn and then recover
All alone we must  be part of one another
When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind must find the right direction",No Other
Gene Clark,"There's been some misunderstanding
And I'd like to make it right
Both of us need inspiration
And the timing must be right
We all have souls yet nobody knows
Just how much it takes to fly
But I see my life before me and I'd like to make a 
Maybe someone knows what fate is
Maybe someone knows  just why
All I know it's all related
Maybe someone can explain time
But I know if you sell your soul
To brighten your role you might be disappointed
In the lights
We all need a fix
At a time like this
But doesn't it it feel good to stay alive

Now I see that in my visions
That my eyes are seeing twice
Once for every expectation and once for what I realize
But I know if you sell your soul
To brighten your role you might be disappointed

At a time like this

Gene Clark,"In my life the piano sings
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings
Fiery rain and rubies cooling in the sun
Now I see that my world has only begun 
Notes that roll on winds with swirling wings 
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings
    
When I'm feeling high or I'm feeling low
Or there is no change
Somehow days keep melting into the night
And there's always light on the cosmic range       
I am always high I am always low                   
There is always change

Hear the strings are bending in harmony
Not so far from the breaking on the cosmic range

In my life the piano sings
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings

Now I see that my world has only begun

Brings me words that are not the strength of strings",Strength of Strings
Gene Clark,"A refuse from a silver phial 
Put her faith 
Into the moon and stars 
Said she had a mind 
That slept inside tomorrow 
And time could only 
Heal its scars 
 
She was fire 
On the borderline 
The lion in the 
Fall of roles 
Said she saw the sword 
Of sorrow sunken 
In the sand of searching souls 
Sleeping in the master`s room 
Seeing through his eyes for gain 
Keeping by his side 
Not to be a victim 
Falling in the darkened rain 
 
She was taken 
From a cruel storm 
The refuse from a silver phial 
Took her magic master`s words 
And sung 
And made his lower self worth while",From a Silver Phial [Alternate Version][#][*]
Gene Clark,"Flying high above the clouds 
We lay in the grassy meadow 
The earth was like a pillow 
For our dreams 
Trials never entered into any conversation 
That was the relation 
Of our dreams 
 
As a change 
In the wind must come 
Over the mountain 
And the seasons 
Roll under the sun 
Passing the shadows 
Of our dreams 
 
Ah! Fine Lady 
Of the north 
Like silver 
On the ocean shore 
Like breeze 
Whispers through the trees",Lady of the North [Alternate Version][#][*]
Gene Clark,"Black girl black girl tell me where 
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines in the pines 
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Now little girl little girl what have I done 
That made you treat me so

You cause me to weep you cause me to moan
You cause me to leave my home
In the pines in the pines 
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows

The longest train I ever saw 
Went down that Georgia line
Saw the engine past at six o'clock 
And the cab went bye and bye
In the pines in the pines 
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows",In the Pines
Gene Clark,"Thursday evening six o'clock
I stepped into a world of living all alone 
Just a simple note that read
I cannot explain why this must be but now I've gone
Friday all day long I could tell myself that's what I wanted anyway
But Friday night has left me
Left me coming down with only lonely Saturday
I could take a walk uptown
I could have a drink or two with some old friends of mine
But they'd ask me how she's been
I don't think that I could take it I would die inside
I can live without a lot but living without her has something new to say
Cause Friday night has left me
Left me coming down with only lonely Saturday
Time on my hands hope the lord understands a man shouldn't feel this way
Time and time again wish that clock would spend this lonely Saturday
Time and time again wish that clock would spend this lonely Saturday",Lonely Saturday

We were the stone romancers and we had all the answers too

Gene Clark,"If you could read my mind, love,
What a tale my thoughts would tell.
Just like an old time movie
Bout a ghost from a wishin' well.
In a castle dark, or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me.
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.

If I could read your mind, love,
What a tale your thoughts would tell.
Just like a paper-back novel
The kind that drug stores sell.
When you reach the part 
Where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
And heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again 
Because the ending's just too hard to take.
I walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three-way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to plays the scene                       
Of bringing all the good things out in me.
But for now, love, lets be real. 
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say
That I just don't get it.
I don't know where we went wrong

We had all those well made plans
And every time something didn't go right
We just threw that in to fate's hands

Little talons on your feet
Like you just want to conquer the man
Wear your mind out on your lips
But your eyes reflect the glimpse
Of a true heart that I understand
Never wanted to see you cry
I didn't ride the dark horse to town
The storm is passing
The clouds roll by
The sun is coming around
'Cause most of all

And the winter snow lay on the ground
And everybody who was high last year
Was surely on their way down
And you really got down, you said there was
Nobody else that you could trust
I wanted so much you to just touch on

Gene Clark,"Sometimes a man must feel ill at ease for a chance to make his stand

To live inside the rational lines is all men draw 
But to be a man he must be his own man and live outside the law",Outlaw Song
Gene Clark,"Oh, the village of the hill
Sitting silently at will
Like some prophecy forgotten by an age
With no guns before its gate
The mysterious estate
Lies waiting for its history's dawning page
With the raging of the sea before its height
And the strength of those whom see beyond their sight
Oh, the smithies anvil rings
And the symphony it sings
No voice nor poet's pen can put to tune
And electric lines of force
Ring around the humble lives
Of the souls that hear the master saying soon
With the clouds that gather near disturb the night
Striking flashes of a difference, fleeing fright
No slight of tongue nor hand
Can so boldly there withstand
When the spirit of it's truth shall speak the time
And no ignorance of life
Can be held within the sight
Of the buttresses of ageless binds of time
The communion of the forces take delight
With the fear that no   tongues may read nor write
White Light
Oh the village of the hill
Sitting silently still
With the strength of ages past they're still at hand
Reckons not to look behind
But to look within and find
And to hear of those enlightened by the lamb
With the powers of the wind both fierce and light
And the waters of the storm went through the night",White Light
Gene Clark,"Think of all the things that money can buy
Like a ranch in the mountains or a pleasure for your eye
Then think of all the things that a dollar bill won't bring
Like someone to hold you close and a song for you to sing

Then think of all the years that it takes to be a fool
Like the lessons you learn in a lifetime like your lifetime was a school
And then think of all the things that don't turn out what they seem
Like the love that you thought you owned in the American dream

Sometimes a child sometimes a wise man
A lonely sole, great extremer

Flash bright in candlelight through Sunday's early morn
We found a room that rainy morning
She took my hand through winding roads and led me home
Some red French wine when later waking
In her warm hideaway, she smiled and combed her hair
She laughed each time I asked her name
Made promises to meet again
But her friends down at the French cafe
Had no English words for me

The cold blue hunger of the soul

Why ever should we be somewhere
Where there's nowhere to go

Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death.

Whose heaven is like Ironsides,
Whose tears are like rain,
Who eats but is not satisfied,
Who hears but does not see,
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me.

I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud,
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood,
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass.

At hand our time's before our eyes
Called out to look beyond what seemed
To hear the woe an angel cry
In the distance the sun rose 
Near we heard a clock chime
But the breeze murmured not yet 
For there still is just a very little time

Our faces drenched by pouring rain  
We laughed as closely we had clung  
Our senses keen from lack of pain
Our souls the streams of songs we sung
Now the shadings around us 
Judged yet not by our sight
In the light of our questing
The truth came through more clearly into sight

Around the eyes of disbelief 
Intoxicated by their doubt
Moreover offered no relief
Afraid to look for finding out
Yet some danced and some sang songs
And some live for today
And around us the windows
Of wonder were unshuttered on our way",Opening Day

Breaks me down to see you in the pains of fear 
The depths of your stone true eyes 
Are reflecting every burden of this life we bear

Tomorrow every trial of life is going to fall 
 
I can only make guesses 
On some of my past addresses 
And tell you what my broken memory recalls.

Lingered way beyond the statements I intended timed

Than what falls from my mouth

And the darkness of doubt
Gales of anger that wane into the calm.

Of the sea beyond the stars
And the sky beyond the sunbeams and the world  beyond your dreams

They barely gleam they barely glimmer
As she circles past the sun
And she tries to tell her sister that her trials  have just begun

Far above the the darkened waters far above the troubled sky
Have you seen the changing rivers now they wait their turn to die
But they turn their tide upon you when the sea  begins to cry",Silver Raven
Gene Clark,"Hours of joy when I was just a boy
And never wrong I knew
Kites of red would fly above my head
The birds would sing their song
Now something's wrong
Where the Sherwood used to be
Neon brambles now I can see
Fields of corn on early summer mornings
Or late afternoons
Anytime there was a place to find
Where life seemed not so soon
Now all too soon
Is this where I used to be
Still remembering what is me
And I won't even try
To find a reason why
I must live here just to die
Now something's wrong
Where the Sherwood used to be    
Neon brambles now I can see",Something's Wrong
Gene Clark,"So now this house has grown too small
Don't think of how it used to be
You say you live now in tomorrow
And there I sense you don't see me
The clock chimes four you'll turn again then
To take pursuit of empty dreams
My sensitivity is dying
You're bound to some day think of me

[Chorus]
Hey hey can't you see
Baby don't you lie to me
I know you think that you must go
Well I think that's alright by me

Nervous words and empty motions
Claim symptoms just too plain to pass
I don't know where you think you're going
But you have drained my love at last
Tomorrow I'll be slowly movin'
I can't waste all my days the same
Don't stop to think of where I might be
Don't stop to figure who's to blame

[Chorus]",That's Alright by Me
Gene Clark,"Believe me when I tell you
I will try to understand
Believe me when I tell you
I could never kill a man
But to know that another man's holding you tight
Hurts me, little darling
Through the morning through the night
The bond has been broken
The promise you gave
The words that were spoken
I can not be your slave
But to know that the trust you had in me is gone
Hurts me, little darling
Through the nighttime through the dawn
I dreamed just last night you were there by my side
Your sweet loving tenderness
Easing my pride
But then I awoke and found you not there
It was just my old memory of how much I care
Believe me when I tell you
I will try to understand
Believe me when I tell you
I could never kill a man
But to know that another man's holding you tight
Hurts me little, darling

Gene Clark,"I lost ten points just for bein'
In the right place at exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there
But I may as well have been completely blind

So if you see me walkin' all alone.  
Don't look back I'm just on my way back home
There's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on

She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life long
Looked around then for a reason

Tell me now and I won't be hangin' on

Gene Clark,"Changes come  so quickly, easily it can seem bizarre 
They say there's a price to pay  for going out too far
You can buy  a one way ticket out there all alone
And you can sit and wonder why 
It's so hard to get back home 
Nothing is important lost, that's not easy to believe
The longer you're in one place, the harder it is to leave
You can have a thousand cards to pull out of your sleeve
But in the end the loser is  the one who does deceive
There's always a reality in what you are doing 
Sometimes it's so hard to see  which one is the true one
I use to treat my friends like I was more than a millionaire 
Spending those big ones like I could afford them all upstairs                                       
But what's been flying high must always touch the ground
Just walk upstairs and ask  you'll be likely directed down

Gene Clark,"She went off to the city
To find what she was looking for
To identify, to really try
To  find herself  some hope
With the summer sun for laughing             
And the winter rain did pour
She was lovelier from learning
And from living, loving more
From her dancing love and young soul
And the gypsies in her dream
To the pulse of stark acceptance
When the winds began to freeze          
With no curfews left to hold her
And no walls to shield her pain
Finding out that facts were older
And that life forms are insane.
The presence of protection seemed
To fade, as did her doubt
That she now was no exception
Nor was the love who pushed her out
           
Though the streets cried out,
Go, homesick
Virtues strength of mind would ring
In the maladies of meaning
The sad song she learned to sing.
Now, her teachers and philosophers
And the poet's silver throat
Are the vessels which on wisdom's karmic  ocean she will float.
Was this her revolution,
Just a child in love's crusade,
With the question in her innocence
Through the lies her eyes betrayed?",The Virgin

Gene Clark,"She wore a blue dress when she walked in the room
And in her eyes the look I saw was filled with gloom
Is this the question I would answer all too soon
Come tell your friend what's wrong with you
Why don't you call me your baby anymore
Am I so changed from some strange love that went before
Is this the change of mind that I've been designed for
Why not your baby anymore

The truth rang out when you called me and called my name

The breeze running through the trees like an organ in a hymn
Thoughts were suspended like a leaf out on a limb 
Fire was burning low and the winter coming in 
Now some music was playing in the background of the night
Some friends from around came in and they all said things were high
And we spoke of a stranger that we all met on the way
Who said there was danger in those who watch out for their greed
Now the summer is past the grain and the river getting high
It's amazing a month can bring so many things that can get by
The old ways were drowning to the new ones with a sigh
It seems so incredible that sometimes I could cry.",Winter In
Gene Clark,"It was more like a dream than reality
I must have thought it was a dream while she was here with me
When she was near I didn't think she would leave
When she was gone it was too much to believe
So with tomorrow I will borrow
Another moment of joy and sorrow
And another dream and another with tomorrow
So if there some day won't be time just to look behind
There won't be reasons, no descriptions for my place and mind
There was so much I was told that was not real
So many things that I could not taste but I could feel
So with tomorrow I will borrow

Shades of evening purple empty space
Where everybody screams like they're all true
Shadows of morning curtains of twilight
Trying to trade the day for the night

Deep misunderstandings have echoed through the years
Judge and you will be judged wrong or right
I wonder why she still stands there her face in tears

To make the next town

In the mountain you revere
Are too old to remember why they put us here

Our battles tunes always sung
Like Jesus loves me, I hold him dear

Lest you get too old and you forget how to sing

I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door

You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there
And maybe you'll be there

Gene DiNovi,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings
Gene DiNovi,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended
Gene Esposito,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Gene Esposito,"Our waltz is music fashioned in heaven,
Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Angels were watching one day,
And our love was their inspiration!

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Gene Esposito,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Gene Esposito,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Gene Hardy,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem

Gene Harris,"Twas a hot afternoon, the last day of June
And the sun was a demon
The clouds were afraid, 110 in the shade
And the pavements were steaming

I told Billy Ray in his red Chevrolet
I needed time for some thinking
I was just walkin' by when I looked in her eye
And I swore it was winkin'

She was thirty-one and I was seventeen
I knew nothin' 'bout love, she knew everything
But I sat down beside her on a front porch swing
And wondered what the coming night would bring

The sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the sky
And it started to swelter
Sweat trickled down the front of her gown
And I thought it would melt her

She threw back her hair like I wasn't there
And she sipped on a Julep
Her shoulders were bare and I tried not to stare
When I looked at her two lips

And then she looked at me, I heard her softly say 
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say
But stay with me until the sun has gone away
And I will chase the boy in you away

And then she smiled and we talked for a while
Then we walked for a mile to the sea
We sat on the sand and a boy took her hand 
But I saw the sunrise as a man

Ten years have gone by since I looked in her eye
But the memory lingers
I go back in my mind to the very first time
And feel the touch of her fingers",Summer (The First Time)

Oodles of butter and somethin sweet
Gallons of coffee to wash it down

Gene Harris,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Gene Harris,"Everything must change
Nothing stays the same
Everyone will change
No one stays the same

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
'Cause that's the way of time
No one doesn't change

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
But rain comes from a cloud
And sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes, everything will change

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
'Cause that's the way of time
Nothing doesn't change

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
Except the rain that comes from a cloud
And sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
But rain comes from a cloud
Sun lights up the sky

In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Gene Kelly,"The bells are ringing for me and my gal.
The birds are singing for me and my gal.

And for weeks they've been sewing every Suzie and Sal.

Gene Kelly,"I have got a sweetie known as Susie
In the words of Shakespeare she's a ""wow""

There's none so classy
As this fair lassie
Oh! Oh! Holy Moses, what a chassis

Back from Yonkers
I'm the one that had to walk
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! What a girl!

If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! Oh! What a girl

Gene Kelly,"We hate to leave,
But when they give you leave,you gotta leave,

We hate to leave, we hate to leave,
Without you guys along, we'll even grieve,
But we'll be back, yes, we'll be back.
Before we're even missed
And tell you guys about the gals out there that we have kissed,
We'll even say, we'll even say,
We really hate to leave.
(You know, Clarence, I hate the thought of going ashore,)
(And leave these guys here sitting in their undershirts)
(We gotta meet all those beautiful dames in their soft silk dresses,)
(But duty is duty, and an order is an order)
(Now I know some guys get a thrill out of meeting)
(A gorgeous gal every night.)

But when they give you leave, you gotta leave.

Gene Kelly,"I met you in a garden in an old Kentucky town
The sun was shining down
You wore a gingham gown
I kissed you as I placed a yellow tulip in your hair
Upon my coat you pinned a rose so rare
Time has not changed your loveliness
You're just as sweet to me
I love you yet, I can't forget the days that used to be
 
When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip
And I wore a big red rose
When you caressed me, 'twas then Heaven blessed me

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Gene Krupa,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam; who would? Would you?

Don't you raise the sails anymore.

It's for sure, I've spent my whole life at sea 
And I'm pushin' age seventy three;
Now there's only one place that was meant for me:

Oh, to be home again,

Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
We're gonna soothe away the rest of our years,
We're gonna put away all of our tears,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.

Slow down, Willie Boy,
Your heart's gonna give right out on you

Turn the stern and point to shore,
The seven seas won't carry us no more.

Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
I can't wait to sniff that air,
Dip'n snuff, I won't have no care,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.
Hear the sound, Willie Boy,
The Flyin' Dutchman's on the reef.
It's my belief
We've used up all our time,
This hill's to steep to climb,
And the days that remain ain't worth a dime.
Oh, to be home again,
Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
Would-a-been nice just t'see the folks,
Listen once again to the stale jokes,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.
I can hear something calling on me

And you know where I want to be
Oh Willie don't you hear that sound

Oh to be home again down in old Virginny
I just want to get my feet back on the ground

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Gene Krupa,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

It's just a pose, I'm not that way,

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Gene Krupa,"Moonlight I see millions of twinkling stars
Ev'ning when a breeze becomes a sigh
Music I hear millions of soft guitars
Underneath the Pampas moon
Where you hum a happy tune
And you kiss your cares goodbye

You'll find your life will begin
the very moment you're in Argentina
If you're romantic Senor 
then you will surely adore Argentina
You'll be as gay as can be
If you will learn to 'Si Si' like a Latin
For mister soon as you learn  
then you will never return to Manhattan
When you hear 'yo te amo' 
you'll still a kiss and then
If she should say Manana
It's just to let you know
you're gonna meet again

I'll bet an old castanet that
you will never forget Argentina
Where there are rhumbas and tangos
to tickle your spine
Moonlight and music and orchids and wine
You'll want to stay down Argentina Way
You'll find your way

Gene Krupa,"High on a windy hill
I feel my heart stand still
All I can hear you calling my name
Into a misty blue
I go in search of you 
There in the shadows calling your name
Why are you just beyond me
When will I see your face
Why do you just elude me
And leave me this lonely space
Oh, into eternity your love will beckon me
I can't forget your voice that calls my name

A starry summer sky,
A laughing you and I, alone.

A sea of midnight blue,
Your face uplifted to my own.

We called it a thrill of the moment, 
And blamed the moon up above,
We didn't know what the glow meant,
We never dreamed it might be love.
It all comes back to me now, 
The love I threw away,
And now each lonely night I pray, 
That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

With eyes of blue and the golden tan
Strong white teeth like Joel McCray

Gene Krupa,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Gene Krupa,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

Gene Krupa,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Is blemished, I'm afraid.

What heaven, what rapture, what bliss

Honestly, I thought you wouldn't.
Naturally, you thought you couldn't.
And probably we shouldn't.
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Actually, it all was blameless.
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we dined alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperon.

No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not, we have to rue it

And the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

He puts the boys asleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stomp their feet
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat
He really breaks it up when he plays reveille

Sprawling from the caves

And the creatures mill around, bemused

If the powers that be
Truly believe in an eye for an eye
And if the punishment should fit the crime
Then the gallows await

Bringing it to its knees

Getting past strangers that don't want to know

Making some highway in my own mind

Three maple leaves on a jacket for two

That he'll only break me heart again

And you're dying to see some sights
Don't be lonely, just phone me
I'll come and get you
I'll show you a good time

You won't need a motel in Hasbrook Heights
No one ever has a sleepless night
Now at my house it's your house
Go kick your shoes off

Start having a good time
Each day is like a week's vacation
Come rest up bring along your swim suit
That's how we get dressed up

You can get away
From it all at Hasbrook Heights
If you're tired of neon lights
We've got sun beams and moon beams
And friendly people
They'll show you a good time

Throw some things in a grip
Take the early train
It's a beautiful trip

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

(Dip dip, dooba bop bop)

I hardly ever thank the stars above
For sending me your very precious love
You never hear me say a prayer
Of thanks to someone 'way up there
Who gave me such a lucky break

Oh, no, darling
Only with ev'ry breath I take

And every time we have to be apart
I hardly ever find you in my heart
And when it comes to thinking of
The thought of losing all your love
I never worry how my heart would ache

Oh, no, darling
Only with ev'ry breath I take
Only with ev'ry little step I make
Only with ev'ry little beat of my heart
And ev'ry single minute I'm awake

Oh, no, darling
Only with ev'ry breath I take
Only with ev'ry little step I make
Only with ev'ry little beat of my heart
And ev'ry single minute I'm awake

Oh ah, ev'ry little breath I take

Turns out to be someone who's not in love with you.

Until I got a cold sore one that would not go away
Yeah I tried ointment on it but nothing was working

She'll remain the rose of my heart
Mom took sick along in December
February brought us broken hearts

The reason we've not called the family reunion
We knew that she wouldn't be there

We know that your spirit is there

No, no, I can't forget the hours
You're the onliest one, mom
And sweeter than the flowers
No, no, there's no need to bother
To speak of you now would only hurt father

It looks so good to see us together
But I had to look after dad
Oh mama, when I passed by your coffin
I didn't want to remember you dead

They all gathered 'round, I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But that was one time we all had to face it
It hurt us so bad you know

No, no, I can't forget the hours
You're the onliest one, mom

It seems my heart just can't give up the dreams we used to share
I tell my friends I'm happy but they read me like a book

'Cause something happened to me while I was driving home
And I'm not the same anymore
Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
I saw a welcoming light and stopped to rest for the night

And that is when I saw her as I pulled in outside of the small motel she was there
And so I walked up to her, asked where I could get something to eat
And she showed me where.
Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
She took me to the café, I asked her if she would stay, she said ""OK""

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
The jukebox started to play and night time turned into day as we were dancing 
Closely, all of a sudden I lost control as I held her charms
And I caressed her, kissed her, told her I'd die 
Before I would let her out of my arms

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
I hate to do this to you but I love somebody new, what can I do?
And I can never, never, never go home again.",Twenty-Four Hours from Tulsa
Gene Pitney," took a room in a house of gloom 
Somewhere I could hide my soul 
There I hoped to find a way to ease my mind 
Couldn't face the gloom tomorrow 

I sat until the hours of three or four 
Thinking doesn't help but seems 
I crept to bed and cried myself to sleep once more 
Then I had the wildest dream 

(Street called Hope) in a town named Freedom 
Where each clock is pointed to the hour of love 
Upon a street called Hope at the house of Welcome 
That's where she opened the door of love 

When I awoke the following day 
Every doubt had left my mind 
My dream it taught me what the prophets say 
Those who seek will always find 

I ran down the stair and out in to the street 
Looking for the nearest phone 
We both said sorry and decided to meet 
To find ourselves a happy home 

You know we're looking for a street called Hope 
In a town name Freedom 
Where each clock is pointed to the hour of love 
Upon a street called Hope at the house of Welcome 
That's where she opened the door of love ",A Street Called Hope
Gene Pitney,"Last night I needed you so bad 
I was alone and feeling sad 
But now that I recall 
You left me after all 
The only girl I've ever had 
 
I never ever made you cry 
No, no I didn't even try 
You promised you'd be true 
You said you loved me too 
My only girl told me a lie 
 
And maybe there'll come a day 
When I can smile and say 
She used to be my girl 
 
But now there's nothing left to say 
She only wanted me for play 
I learned my lesson fast 
But now I know at last 
That girl belongs to yesterday

Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting it's way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, and turning me down
Making me smile, and making me frown

In a world that was war
I once lived in a time that was peace and no troubles at all
But then you came my way
And a feeling of unknown shook my heart,
made me want you to stay
All of my nights, and all of my days

Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Yeah, something has invaded my night
Painting my sleep with a color so bright
Changing the grey, and changing the blue
Scarlet for me, and scarlet for you

I got to know if this is the real thing
I got to know it's making my heart sing

Prayin' if he can make enough to eat
And her mom cleans for everyone

And the sweetness of her arms
How I love my poor princess in rags

To take her out of this old place
I'll work and slave, scrimp and save
To change her rags to silk and lace

From the pain it takes just to set things right

Gene Pitney,"When Liberty Valance rode to town
The women folk would hide, they'd hide
When Liberty Valance walked around
The men would step aside

Because the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shootin' straight and fast
He was mighty good

From out of the East a stranger came
A law book in his hand, a man
The kind of a man the West would need
To tame a troubled land

'Cause the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shootin' straight and fast
He was mighty good

Many a man would face his gun and many a man would fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all

The love of a girl can make a man
Stay on when he should go, stay on
Just trying to build a peaceful life
Where love is free to grow

But the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When the final showdown came at last
A law book was no good

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd
Return that fateful night, ah, that night
When nothing she said could keep her man 
From going out to fight

From the moment a girl gets to be full grown
The very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other
Only one returns

Everyone heard two shots ring out
One shot made Liberty fall

He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all

The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut tree
The wishing well

I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You
Gene Pitney,"In the sleepy town of San Juanita
There's a story that the padre tells
Of a gay senor and senorita
And the serenade of the bells

Seems they asked the padre for permission
To be married early in the spring
But their folks had just made one condition
That the mission bells had to ring

Everyone knew that the bells were broken
And hadn't sounded for a long long time
Then one night the village was astounded
For the bells began to chime

Still the bells are broken, goes the story
But if in your heart a true love dwells
They will chime for you in all it's glory
That's the serenade of the bells",Serenade of the Bells
Gene Pitney,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?
",Where Is Your Heart? [Song from Moulin Rouge]
Gene Pitney,"Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'

'Cause I'm so lonely
 
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
 
Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be 
If it means having you to keep,
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
 
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
 
Lonely nights echo your name
Oh, sometimes I wonder 
Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah!  When you see me smiling
You know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see has all been rehearsed
Darling, I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside, darling
Makes me feel half alive

She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella

She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella 

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine 

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew

Led me to avow

They asked me how I knew

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind

When we were kids I was your friend watching you grow
You didn't get much of the love most of us know

I should know better I grew up in your part of town
And I can bless my good fortune I came through it fine
Ohh oh blue angel you will always be a good old friend of mine

How many years since you took off with your guitar
Joining a band and singing sad songs round the bar
Ohh oh blue angel guess I should have known
That's not a good life for a girl far away from home
When you were sad, poor and lonely too proud to let on
Ohh oh blue angel all your better times just never came along

Now the gentlemen of Soho buy your kindness and your smile
And your flesh is just a souvenir of London for a while
But I know what keeps you going what you spend your money on
Some pusher man from hell has got you hooked on all that's wrong
And a pretty dress don't cover up your eyes
And I won't forget the emptiness I found in your disguise

Your kiss is like a half opened door
I can't get in
You stop me just before I begin
And it hurts to be in love
When you never get enough
Oh it hurts to be in love

This endless urge
Keeps my body right on the verge
We touch and then
I wanna do it all over again

And it hurts to be in love
When you only want me half as much
I tell you it hurts to be in love

I'm always worried you think I'm pushing too hard
Oh baby it hurts me when you tell me I'm going to far

We touch and then
I wanna do it all over again
And it hurts to be in love
When you only want me half as much
I tell you it hurts to be in love
It hurts
Baby it hurts
It hurts

Gene Rodemich,"I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
Like a star up in the blue,
Like I was fallin' off Niagara
In a paddle-boat canoe.
Mmm, I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
And it's all because of you.
 
Like I was walkin' on a tightrope,
Swingin' in the breeze,
And though I try to keep my balance
Yeah I weaken in the knees.
I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
Lover, help me please.
 
Like a leaf falls from a branch,
Like a rock-slide avalanche,
Like the rain on a stormy day,
I never thought I'd fall this way.
 
I thought that love could never touch me,
Yeah I was ridin' high
And then my ivory tower toppled
And I tumbled from the sky.
Mm, I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
You're the reason why.
 
Like Goliath when he met his foe,
Just like the walls of Jericho,
Like Delilah's home in town
When Samson tore it down.

Yeah I was ridin' high
And then my ivory tower toppled
And I tumbled from the sky.

Or should I say she once had me

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

Gene Vincent,"Well I saw my baby walkin',
With another man today,
Well I saw my baby walkin'
With another man today.
When I asked her ""What's the matter?""
This is what I heard her say.

See you later alligator,
After 'while, crocodile.
See you later alligator,
After 'while, crocodile.

Can't you see you're in my way now?
Don't you know you cramp my style?
When I thought of what she told me,
Nearly made me lose my head,
When I thought of what she told me,
Nearly made me lose my head.
But the next time that I saw her,
Reminded her of what she said.

[Chorus]

She said, ""I'm sorry, pretty daddy,
You know my love is just for you.""
She said, ""I'm sorry, pretty daddy,
You know my love is just for you,
Won't you say that you'll forgive me,
And say your love for me is true.""
I said, ""Wait a minute, 'gator,
I know you mean't it just for play.""
I said, ""Wait a minute, 'gator,
I know you mean't it just for play.
Don't you know you really hurt me,
And this is what I have to say.""

When I heard my child in prayer.

Scarlet ribbons for my hair.""

And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair.

And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

Could it be the one I sheltered and held so tenderly?

I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called ""lonely stree-ee-ee-eet? ""

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called ""lonely stree-ee-ee-eet? ""

Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as i
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love di-ie

If I could find that lonely street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called ""lonely stree-ee-ee-eet? ""

Where's this place called ""lonely stree-ee-ee-eet? """,Lonely Street [1966][Alternate Take]
Gene Vincent,"I was ridin' No 9 headin' South from Caroline
I heard that lone vow vow some whistle blow
I got in trouble had to roam left my gal and left my home
I heard that lone vow vow some whistle blow

Just a kid actin' smart I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off to Georgia Main they locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lone vow vow some whistle blow

All I do is sit and cry when the evening train goes by
I heard that lone vow vow some whistle blow
All I do is bear the shame I'm a number not a name
I heard that lone vow vow some whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow, oh Lord
I'll never see that gal of mine I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard thatllone vow vow some whistle blow
I'll never see that gal of mine

Gene Vincent,"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

(Ooh) But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

Why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybelline

The things you used to do

I saw Maybelline in a Coupe de Ville

But nothin' outrun my V8 Ford

Bumper to bumper rollin' side to side

I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water poured up
Under my motor hood
I knew that were doin' my motor good

When I heard my child in prayer
And for me some scarlet ribbons

All the streets were dark and bare

Through the night my heart was aching
And just before the dawn was breaking
I peeked in and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there

And all the times you mentioned him were you and part between
I knew we could never love for long

I shouldn't give a second thought of how it might have been
I shouldn't even miss you when you're gone
I knew the day would come and you'd go running back to him
I knew we could never love for long

I knew at times you missed him cause I heard you when you cried
I guess that he was always on your mind
But I thought that I could take it when you finally said goodbye
Oh how could I have ever been so blind

I could never blame you cause I knew it from the start
You never really tried to lead me on
So tell me why this empty feeling's tearing me apart
When I knew we could never love for long

So tell me why this empty feeling's tearing me apart

Gene Watson,"It hurts me just to know I had to leave her
But when your eyes met mine I knew I would
Sometimes at night my conscience makes me suffer
But it don't hurt me half as bad
As holding you feels good

Cause she's the one that made me need someone
And you're the one that gave me everything I wanted
So don't worry if it bothers me 'cause we both know it should
And it don't hurt me half as bad
As holding you feels good

Yes, she's the one that made me need someone
And you're the one that gave me everything I wanted
She could have done the things you do
But somehow never would

Gene Watson,"The day that we were married
The people shook my hand
They said we two were now as one
And me a lucky man.

From that day on that's all I ever
Wanted us to be
Until the day you told me
We'd be three.

Then we began the waiting
And made our little jokes
You couldn't look at monkeys
And I gave up my smokes.

You prophasized he'd be a boy
And look a lot like me
Lord, but I was proud
That we'd be three.

One night the endless days of waiting
All came to an end
You woke me from my restless sleep
And said we must go in.

The sun won't rise on any day
Again like that for me
The day had come when
Two would soon be three.

I smoked an endless burning chain
Of bitter cigarettes
I must have walked a thousand miles
With fear in every step.

Two long days and two long nights
That I refused to sleep
And they were losing hope
That we'd be three.

The preacher's came, the doctor's came
And said I must be brave
I remember saying
It was more than I could take.

Now what's the world to do with
Any crazy man like me
A lonely one who wanted
To be three",Three
Gene Watson,"She loves to spend my money on fancy clothes and jewelery
Just like it was going out of style
It don't bother her to take it or how hard I work to make it
I just can't say no when she smiles
She's wicked and she's lusty, someday she's gonna bust me
And the day my money's gone she will be too
But it don't even phase me, my friends all think I'm crazy
Lovin' her is all I want to do

Lord, how I love that evil child
She's got a sexy, sexy way that drives me wild
She's the center in her heart and it's tearin' me apart
Lord, don't I love that evil child

Sometimes I get the feeling that I'll have to take up stealing
Just to give her all that she desires
And although I might regret it but I'd go right out and get it
Because she sets my soul on fire
I'm afraid someday I'll lose her but I still can't refuse her
I keep givin' everything I can
I know all the doubt about her but I still can't live without her
Ain't it strange what love will do to a man

Standing out in front of Wilson's five and dime
Staring through the window at the jewelry
Hungry for the things you couldn't buy
Just like a fool I thought that I could please you
I saw you had an eye for things that shine
I paid seven saw mill dollars for a bracelet
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

Was not enough to keep you satisfied
'Cause a man that's got a saw mill occupation
Can't afford to feed a rich girls' appetite

Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive

Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

And losing you is one thing I guess I'll always regret

Is something else that Ive grown used to

With a narrow minded wall

Who would stand and let it fall
Lately to myself

Gene Watson,"Them Texas fields were hot 
And that tractor never was my kind of living
And when I hit sixteen
I had my size and I hit the road to freedom
And I'm glad I wasn't there 
To see my momma cause she must've cried for hours
I still hear her saying Gary
Get your guitar and pick The Wildwood Flower

Now Dallas it was big 
And hard to find a job and so I didn't
It was easier to hitch a ride to Houston
And it was more like living
Now I've been down every road
And I've stood on every porch where they were giving
And if they had an hour or a dime
I would pick The Wildwood Flower

It's hard to turn around
And look back down the roads that I have travelled
Cause like a neverending ball of twine
My dreams have come unravelled
And now as evening lays its shawl
Across the shoulders of my life I have defined
I couldn't tie my life together
With the guitar strings and a poet's heart full of pride

And I'm so glad I wasn't there
To see my momma cause she must've cried for hours
I still hear her saying Gary

Gene Watson,"I wonder if you've had the time it takes to think it over
And sort out all the feel-ings in your mind
Some-times I think you've found some-one to do your thinking for you
'Cause lately you've been show-in' all the signs

[Chorus]
Should I come home or should I go cra-zy
I'm begging you please make up your mind
If you love me, then think it all o-ver
Make up your mind, or I'll lose mine

Last night when I came by I rang the bell and no one answered
But I heard voices whisper through the door

I'm glad you could make it, I hoped you'd get by
I thought about this all week through
What's that, what's the matter, what's making you cry
You say it's the first time for you

Leave if you'd rather not lose what you came for
Walk out the same door that I let you in
Leave if you'd rather not lose what you came with
Stay and you'll find this is where love begins

It's not like we're strangers I've kissed your warm lips
But someone was always right there
But now we're alone so there's no buts or ifs
Come here, let me take down your hair

But my heart, my foolish heart will not turn
She fills me with a crazy wild desire
And, lying helpless, I know just how I'll burn

Back in the fire where my heart must long to be
If it wasn't so, then why, oh, why does it keep draggin' me?
Back in the fire to the flames of ecstasy
I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me

At times I've gone as far as believing
This tortured soul of mine was finally free
Then those long, silent, leftover feelings
Say I'm a pretender, and I'll surrender willingly

And you think you'll feel better if you have a good cry

Time is all it takes for a broken heart to mend
And sooner or later you know you'll try to love again
So why not start tonight, you've only got the hurtin' to lose
There's a full moon out, don't waste it on the blues

Don't waste one more minute
Leavin' a bad break, to keep you home in the dark
There's nothin' like a walk in the moonlight
To let love run away with your heart

You could turn on your stereo and play your saddest songs
Sit by your window and stare out all night long
But if you look up you'll see the stars are just too bright to refuse

Workin' under Junior Moore again, he won't cut us any slack
But it's better than nothing, and it always gets me through

In the midst of celebratin' this newfound freedom I've got
They ain't call them walking papers wasn't even right
So when she brought 'em here tonight
I was expecting to see that same dang doe tears bounce

But she's a looking like a new woman
My, would you look at that dress
Every eye is on her
She is a walking, talking, little miss confident

Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
She's got my buddies in the palm of her hand
And it's a hell of a time for me to be her actual man

How did she go from stone cold to red hot, open tonight
All this honey she is pourin', she must have kept bottled all the time
'Cause heaven knows that I can't believe, that little devil's my used to be
This might be fair play, boys but she ain't playin' right

She's a looking like a new woman
She is in neon light
She's gone from every day square
To party hardy, wild thing, overnight

Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
Sleek blond with a faking big ten
Sure hits a bad time for me to be her actual man

She's emptying every barstool, got the boys formed in a line
I think I'll slip on back 'cause I can't take the sight

My pillowcase is soaking wet and yet I feel a chill
It takes all I can do these days to just survive the nights

When a man can't shake a memory he runs hot and cold and blind
He hates her then he loves her then he hates her one more time
Your love has such a grip on me it chokes me like a vine
Oh it's crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind

But this time you gave me a mountain
A mountain that I may never climb
And it isn't a hill any longer

Don't be the reason she cries
At first she'll be lonely and cry for you only
And then for the lovin' she needs
She'll find somebody new
Whose sure to take her from you
As sure as you took her from me

You might say I'm crazy to give you advice

in conversation...

in conversation, our minds are acting now
Let's ask those questions again
Whay am I angry? why am I doing this?
I made this happen to me

I'm struggling, I'm waiting, watching for the sidelines
It's obvious I'm chasing, there's got to be an answer
Distraction takes over when I'm deep in conversation
I'm looking & learning
That my heart is running faster all the while

No need to look outside,
To see or feel the rain.
I reach across to touch her,
But I know that she's not there.
Rain keeps running down the window pane.
Time is running out for me.

Can't you see what you are doing to me?
Can't you see what you have done?
As I try to pass another long and sleepless night,
A hundred crazy voices call my name,
As I try to pass them by,
I almost can believe that she is here,
In the glow of the night.

Do you know what you have done?
Do you know what you've begun?
Do you see we shall never be together again?
All of my life.

Lonely people, empty rooms,
Pointless violence, silent tombs.
Could it be that we shall be together again?

Sheets of double glazing help to keep outside the night,
Only foreign city sirens can cut through,
Nylon sheets and blankets help to minimize the cold.
But they can't keep out the chilling sounds.
Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming
That she is here with me?
In the glow of the night.

We prayed it would last forever.

They act as if it is perfectly clear

Take a look at the beautiful river of blood.

I fight to rise from this river of hell
I stare round about me
Children are swimming and playing with boats
Their features are changing
Their bodies dissolve and I am alone.

As was seen last night on T.V.
Maybe if we're lucky, they will show it again

That it only lives on in a song

Look out the pavement's changing to jam

See them running
Now where are they going to
To follow them, leads you nowhere
Shout to them quickly but no one can hear you
All they can do is to stare

Your bowler hats are turning green
Your city suits are coloured cream
You, you who changed my life
You made it misery, sadness reins alone
Wonder why you do this, to me
When I've tried so hard for you

People talking to the man who's digging a hole, in his mind
He's no need to worry, he's deaf and blind
See the dustman doing his round in a rolls made of glass
He's gained everything because he's got class

Friends are leaving me when I did everything
Just as they used to behave
Trying to copy them, losing my real self
Floating away in a cloud

The rules you taught you never kept

Far off the chase shrieked revenge.

The last sacred haunt of the dead.
He learnt of the truth which only one wolf may know,
The sceptre and crown of the king.
Howling for blood, One-eye leads on the pack,
Plunging through forests and snow-storm.

Steep rose the ridge, ghostly peaks climbed the sky,
Fang sped through the jungles of ice.
Hard on his tale, One-eye drew from the pack
An old hero conquered by none.

Steep, for too steep grew the pathway ahead
Descent was the only escape
A wolf never flees in the face of his foe
Fang knew the price he would pay
One-eye stood before him
With the crown upon his head
Sceptre raised to deal the deadly blow.

Fang, son of great Fang, the Traitor we seek,
The laws of the Brethren say this
That only the King sees the Crown of the Gods
And he, the Usurper must die 

Snarling he tore at the throat of his foe
But Fang fought the hero in vain
Dawn saw the white mountain tinted with red
Never would the crown leave again

Glowing ember of evening
Your eyes are frozen with guilt
I read my fate on your cheeks
The smoldering coals of a passion
Once a meadow of hope

Days of minstrels and bright steeds
Autumn nights and silk sheets
Your tender battle shadow on me
Scented lavender kiss-es, soft and warm
The union of strength in a love against life
Love against life

Pacidy, my love
Your touch, so limp, was once frenzied
Your argon lips were once sweet
A life has slipped through my hands
My spirits sift in a stale sigh
Did love exist as a dream?

Mother fawn of a pine wood
Shepherdess of my grief
Veils a freedom not for me
Far beyond the steep ridge, where blizzards
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts

Feel the truth in those sad eyes
See the smile that`s so rare

She waits for...
And she plays a game of her own
As she sleeps within the firelight
For her dreams are incredibly wild
But they`re lost and gone forever, with the dawn
Fair and friend of the fleece spoke
Warrior bold, shepherd wise, fair prince of peace
Someone waits in the doorway
On a white horse he comes and holds out the hand
She waits for...
So they ride through a valley of mist
To a castle in the heavens
Where he lays her down to rest
But he`s lost and gone forever, with the dawn
See her writhe in her dream, then...
Mermaids sing in the sunset
Sadly asking if beauty ever walks free
But Queen Frost only whispers
Maidens you will remain, to be free
See her writhe in her dreams...

As he wanders along the line of packages, Rael notices a familiarity in some of their faces. He finally comes upon some of the members of his old gang and worries about his own safety. Running out through the factory floor, he catches sight of his brother John with a number 9 stamped on his forehead. 

The hall runs like clockwork
Their hands mark out the time;
Empty in their fullness
Like a frozen pantomime.
Everyone's a sales representative
Wearing slogans in their shrine.
Dishing out fail safe superlative,
Brother John is No. 9.

Stainless steel razor.",Hairless Heart
Genesis,"Moving down the water
John is drifting out of sight,
Its only at the turning point
That you find out how you fight.

In the cold, feel the cold
All around
And the rush of crashing water
Surrounds me with its sound.

Striking out to reach you
I can't get through to the other side,
When you're racing in the rapids
There's only one way, that's to ride.

Taken down, taken down
By the undertow
I'm spiralled down the river bed,
My fire is burning low.
Catching hold of a rock that's firm,
I'm waiting for John to be carried past.
We hold together, hold together 
And shoot the rapids fast.

And when the waters slow down
The dark and the deep have no-one, no-one, no-one, no-one, no-one left to keep.
Hang on John! We're out of this at last.
Somethings changed, that's not your face.  It's mine - it's mine!",In the Rapids
Genesis,"When it's cold, it comes slow
It is warm, just watch it grow
- all around me it is here.
It is now.

Just a little bit of it can bring you up or down.
Like the supper it is cooking in your hometown.
It is chicken, it is eggs,
It is in between your legs.
It is walking on the moon,
Leaving your cocoon.

It is the jigsaw. it is purple haze.
It never stays in one place, but it's not a passing phase
It is in the singles bar, in the distance of the face
It is in between the cages, it is always in a space
It is here. it is now.

Any rock can be made to roll
If you enough of it to pay the toll
It has no home in words or gold
Not even in your favourite hole
It is hope for the dope
It rides your horse without a hoof
It is shaken not stirred;
Cocktails on the roof.

When you eat right thru' it you see everything alive
It is inside the spirit, with enough grit to survive
If you think that it's pretentious, you've been taken for a ride.
Look across the mirror sonny, before you choose, decide
It is here. it is now
It is Real. it is Rael

Genesis,"And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Early morning Manhattan,
Ocean winds blow on the land.
The Movie-Palace is now undone,
The all-night watchmen have had their fun.
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,
It's the same old ending-time to go.
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream.
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Nightime's flyers feel their pains.
Drugstore takes down the chains.
Metal motion comes in bursts,
But the gas station can quench that thirst.
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'
And out on the subway,
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

The lamb seems right out of place,
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face.
Somehow it's lying there,
Brings a stillness to the air.
Though man-made light, at night is very bright,
There's no whitewash victim,
As the neons dim, to the coat of white.
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid,
Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

Thinks money-honey-be on-neon.

And the sawdust king spits out his scorn.
Wonder women draw your blind!
Don't look at me! I'm not your kind.
I'm Rael!
Something inside me has just begun,
Lord knows what I have done,

They say there's always magic in the air.",The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway
Genesis,"The scent grows richer, he knows he must be near,
He finds a long passageway lit by chandelier.
Each step he takes, the perfumes change
From familiar fragrance to flavors strange.
A magnificent chamber meets his eye.

Inside, a long rose-water pool is shrouded by fine mist.
Stepping in the moist silence, with a warm breeze he's gently kissed.

Thinking he is quite alone,
He enters the room, as if it were his own,
But ripples on the sweet pink water
Reveal some company unthought of

Rael stands astonished doubting his sight,
Struck by beauty, gripped in fright;
Three vermilion snakes of female face,
The smallest motion, filled with grace.
Muted melodies fill the echoing hall,
But there is no sign of warning in the siren's call:
""Rael welcome, we are the Lamia of the pool.
We have been waiting for our waters to bring you cool.""

Putting fear beside him, he trusts in beauty blind,
He slips into the nectar, leaving his shredded clothes behind.
""With their tongues, they test, taste and judge all that is mine.
They move in a series of caresses
That glide up and down my spine.

As they nibble the fruit of my flesh, I feel no pain,
Only a magic that a name would stain.
With the first drop of my blood in their veins
Their faces are convulsed in mortal pains.
The fairest cries, 'We all have loved you Rael'.""

Each empty snakelike body floats,
Silent sorrow in empty boats.
A sickly sourness fills the room,
The bitter harvest of a dying bloom.
Looking for motion I know I will not find,
I stroke the curls now turning pale, in which I'd lain entwined
""O Lamia, your flesh that remains I will take as my food""
It is the scent of garlic that lingers on my chocolate fingers.

Looking behind me, the water turns icy blue,
The lights are dimmed and once again the stage is set for you.",The Lamia
Genesis,"As he walks along the gorge's edge,
He meets a sense of yesteryear.
A window in the bank above his head
Reveals his home amidst the streets.

Subway sounds, the sounds of complaint
The smell of acid on his gun of paint.
As it carves out anger in a blood-red band,
Destroyed tomorrow by an unknown hand;
My home.
Is this the way out from this endless scene?
Or just an entrance to another dream?
And the light dies down on Broadway.

But as the skylight beckons him to leave,
He hears a scream fro far below.
Within the raging water, writhes the form
Of brother John, he cries for help.

The gate is fading now, but open wide,
But John is drowning, I must decide
Between the freedom I had in the rat-race,
Or to stay forever in this forsaken place;
Hey John!
He makes for the river and the gate is gone,
Back to the void where it came from.
And the light dies down on Broadway.",The Light Dies Down on Broadway
Genesis," The chamber was in confusion - all the voices shouting loud.
I could only just hear, a voice quite near say, ""Please help me through the crowd:""
I said if I helped her thru' she could help me too, but I could see that she wholly blind.
But from her pale face and her pale skin, a moonlight shined.

Lilywhite Lilith,
She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith,
She gonna lead you right.

When I'd led her through the people, the angry noise began to grow.
She said, ""Let me feel the way the breezes blow, and I'll show you where to go.""
So I followed her into a big round cave, she said, ""They're coming for you, now don't be afraid.""
Then she sat me down on a cold stone throne, carved in jade.

Lilywhite Lilith,
She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith,
She gonna lead you right.

She leaves me in my darkness,
I have to face, face my fear,
And the darkness closes in on me,
I can hear a whirring sound growing near.

Lit up by whatever's coming here.

Now there's hope reborn with every morning
See the future clearly at its dawning
Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness
As water slips into the sea
The father's sad to see it free
As shadows creep towards their master night
It came to pass that trees defied the wind who shook their leaves
And as the peace descended all around
It came to pass that nature's creatures came to face the world

Disappointment, fear and disillusion
Now there's hope reborn with every morning
See the future clearly at its dawning

All on a beautiful sky, I'll be
Clear and serene in the love I've discovered
Long search is over, the soul is uncovered
Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing
Bidding farewell to the fears now decreased
Come see me take my hand
Come see me in my land
High on a golden crested wave she sits
The little nymphs dance in her hair
The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives
Horizons come to sip wine there
The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef
The albatross flies to the stern
And only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return
Crossing the mountains of truth see them
Soaring majestically high, and then
Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly
Thunder awakes me, it crashes beside me
Shatter the scene and bring chaos to beauty
Leading me forward where destiny may be
Come see me take my hand
View from another land

Genesis,"The winter's bitterness is lost
It's the fireside warmth that comforts me
The peace for all my thoughts

The night brings shadows to the street
It's the time for dreams of things to come
To creep inside their lives

You're concealing every feeling
Can you find me, deep inside you
Let me touch you, let me keep you
Let me know you're there

You're concealing every feeling
Can you find me, no
Yes deep inside you're a part of me
Every day I need to know I'm there, I'm there, I'm there

The evening fantasy begins
In the sandy lanes that cross the fields
The gentle rain will fall

The morning sweeps away the night
And the dreams of you still haunt my thoughts
Bring meaning to my life

You're concealing every feeling
Can you find me, deep inside you
Let me touch you, let me keep you
Let me know you're there

You're concealing every feeling
Can you find me, no
Yes deep inside you're a part of me
Every day I need to know I'm there, I'm there, I'm there

Can you hold me with your small hand
Prepare much, length and beauty of our tiny lives
Future's brighter now

The sky is shining everywhere in our world

""Praise him, praise him."" 
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried, 
""By our command, waters retreat,

Still sitting there, 
Wonder if they're late for church 
And it's cold, so they fasten their coats 
And cross the grass, they're always last. 

Passing by the padlocked swings, 
The roundabout still turning, 
Ahead they see a small girl 
On her way home with a pram. 

Inside the archway, 
The priest greets them with a courteous nod. 
He's close to God.

Years seem so few (four instead of two).

Genesis,"From a dense forest of tall dark pinewood, Mount Ida rises like an island. 
Within a hidden cave, nymphs had kept a child; 
Hermaphroditus, son of gods, so afraid of their love. 

As the dawn creeps up the sky 
The hunter caught sight of a doe. 
In desire for conquest, 
He found himself within a glade he'd not beheld before.

Give wisdom to your son""

Some creature has been stirred"" 
    Narrator: 
""The waters are disturbed

As he rushed to quench his thirst, 
A fountain spring appeared before him 
And as his heated breath brushed through the cool mist, 
A liquid voice called, ""Son of gods, drink from my spring"". 

The water tasted strangely sweet. 
Behind him the voice called again. 
He turned and saw her, in a cloak of mist alone 
And as he gazed, her eyes were filled with the darkness of the lake. 

   Salmacis: 
""We shall be one 
We shall be joined as one"" 
   Narrator: 
""She wanted them as one 
Yet he had no desire to be one"" 

   Hermaphroditus: 
""Away from me cold-blooded woman 
Your thirst is not mine"" 

   Salmacis: 
""Nothing will cause us to part 
Hear me, O Gods"" 

Unearthly calm descended from the sky 
And then their flesh and bones were strangely merged 
Forever to be joined as one. 

The creature crawled into the lake. 
A fading voice was heard: 
""And I beg, yes I beg that all who touch this spring 
May share my fate""

But when the ship moves she's passing by.
Between you and me I really don't think,
She knows where she's going at all.

Never closer to home than the day,
The day I started.

Genesis,"Fifty thousand men were sent to do the will of one.
His claim was phrased quite simply, though he never voiced it loud,
I am he, the chosen one.

In his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die.
Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied,
But they'll fight the battle on.

Then one whose faith had died
Fled back up the mountainside,
But before the top was made,
A misplaced footfall made him stray
From the path prepared for him.
Off of the mountain,
On to a wilderness of ice.

This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear,
But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear.
Terror filled their minds with awe.

Simple were the folk who lived
Upon this frozen wave.
So not surprising was their thought,
This is he, God's chosen one,
Who's come to save us from
All our oppressors.
We shall be kings on this world.

Follow me!
I'll play the game you want me,
Until I find a way back home.

Follow me!
I give you strength inside you,
Courage to win your battles

No, no, no, this can't go on,
This will be all that I fled from.
Let me rest for a while.

He walked into a valley,
All alone.
There he talked with water, and then with the vine.

They leave me no choice.
I must lead them to glory or most likely to death.

They traveled cross the plateau of ice, up to its edge.
Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain.
Still he urged the people on.

Then, on a distant slope,
He observed one without hope
Flee back up the mountainside.
He thought he recognized him by his walk,
And by the way he fell,
And by the way he
Stood up, and vanished into air",One for the Vine [DVD]

Taking pot shots at the tourists?

When you wander round the square in the morning

And when he wished to make a point
He knew just what to do
His window ledges were all covered in grease

Well that's because, they're everywhere,

We set them to work on the rooftops

And I know they're too ashamed
To wear their by appointment badges anymore
Sometimes they use vaseline, sometimes they use the pill
I've often seen them with a gun

Where an ear to the wall was a twist of fate
I will shine a blinding light
Through those hearts as black as night
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But as least the seeds of love will be sown
Now once in awhile when I feel no shame
I get down on my knees and I pray for rain
And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case
There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face
Hand on my heart I will make a stand

Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a Badman

Guilt in the frame of the looking-glass
Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man
Try and fit themselves together again
Lies in disguise in the name of trust
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust !
What's your problem ? What's your curse ?
Won't it make the matter worse ?
In my head...
And they say "" Faith can move move mountains
Fire can cleanse your soul ""
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter - No !
I heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day

When the stories are tall as the day is long
With such a thin drawn between friend and foe
Lord help me now and bless my soul !

Your hands start shaking and you don't know why

Rockface moves to press my skin
White liquid turn sour within
Turn fast - turn sour
Turn sweat - turn sour.
Must tell myself that I'm not here.
I'm drowning in a liquid fear.
Bottled in a strong compression,
My distortion shows obsession
In the cave.
Get me out of this cave!
 
As fear and shock register, he assures himself that self-control will provide some security, but this thought is abandoned as the stalactites and stalagmites lock into a fixed position, forming a cage whose bars are moving in towards him. 
 
If I keep my self-control,
I'll be safe in my soul.
And the childhood belief
Brings a moment's relief,
But my cynic soon returns
And the lifeboat burns.
My spirit just never learns.
 
Stalactites, stalagmites
Shut me in, lock me tight.
Lips are dry, throat is dry.
Feel like burning, stomach churning,
I'm dressed up in a white costume
Padding out leftover room.
Body stretching, feel the wretching
In the cage
Get me out of the cage!
 
At one moment there is a flash of light and he sees an infinite network of cages all strung together by a ropelike material. 
 
In the glare of a light,
I see a strange kind of sight;
Of cages joined to form a star
Each person can't go very far;
All tied to their things
They're netted by their strings,
Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings.
 
As the rocky bars press in on Rael's body, he sees his brother John outside, looking in. John's face is motionless despite screams for help, but in his vacant expression a tear of blood forms and trickles down his cheek. Then he calmly walks away leaving Rael to face the pains which are beginning to sweep through his body. 
 
Outside the cage I see my Brother John,
He turns his head so slowly round.
I cry out Help! before he can be gone,
And he looks at me without a sound.
And I shout out 'John please help me!'
But he does not even want to try to speak.
I'm helpless in my violent rage
And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek,
And I watch him turn away and leave the cage.
My little runaway.
 
(Raindrops keep failing on my head, they keep falling on my)
 
In a trap, feel a strap
Holding still. Pinned for kill.
Chances narrow that I'll make it,
In the cushioned straight-jacket.
Just like 22nd Street,
They got me by my neck and feet.
Pressures building, can't take more.
My headaches charge, earaches roar.
In this pain
Get me out of this pain.
 
If I could change to liquid,
I could fill the cracks up in the rocks.
I know that I am solid
And I am my own bad luck.
 
However, just as John walks out of sight, the cage dissolves and Rael is left spinning like a top. 
 
Outside John disappears, my cage dissolves,
without any reason my body revolves.
 
Keep on turning,
Keep on turning,
Turning around,
Spinning around.

Genesis,"The man steps out in the moonlight
At the sound of a scream from below.
He thinks he is a warrior
So he picks up his sword and goes.

From the mouth of the monster
He rescues the maiden fair.
But we know shes a demon
Come to lure him to demons lair.

Through restless foliage and tall trees he leads
To a house in a clearing, a place in her fear she calls home.

Come with me, I need you,
I fear the dark and I live all alone.
Ill give you wine and food too
And something special after if you like.

And though his body bids him
To enter in with her,
There was something in her manner
That his mind could not ignore.

Also it is whispered
In the kingdom far and wide,
To beware a little cottage
In the forest in a glade.

For who knows what magic takes place in his world? 
So he just thanks her kindly preparing to go on his way.

Come with me, I need you,
I fear the dark and I live all alone.
Ill give you wine and food too
And something special after if you like.

Come to my garden,
Taste the fruits and the spices of love.
You cant resist me,
I'm the kind that your dreams tell you of.

So glad you could make it
We had everything arranged.
So glad you saw fit to pay a call.

Some men never listen,
And others never learn,
But why this man did as he did
Only he will ever know.

He knew he was walking
Into a waiting trap,
Neatly set up for him
With a bait so richly wrapped.

So he went inside there to take on what he found
But he never escaped them, for who can escape what he desires? 

Come with me, I need you,
I fear the dark and I live all alone.
I'll give you wine and food too
And something special after if you like.",The Lady Lies
Genesis,"Fifty thousand men were sent to do the will of one.
His claim was phrased quite simply, though he never voiced it loud,
I am he, the chosen one.

In his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die.
Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied,
But they'll fight the battle on.

Then one whose faith had died
Fled back up the mountainside,
But before the top was made,
A misplaced footfall made him stray
From the path prepared for him.
Off of the mountain,
On to a wilderness of ice.

This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear,
But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear.
Terror filled their minds with awe.

Simple were the folk who lived
Upon this frozen wave.
So not surprising was their thought,
This is he, God's chosen one,
Who's come to save us from
All our oppressors.
We shall be kings on this world.

Follow me!
I'll play the game you want me,
Until I find a way back home.

Follow me!
I give you strength inside you,
Courage to win your battles -

No, no, no, this can't go on,
This will be all that I fled from.
Let me rest for a while.

He walked into a valley,
All alone.
There he talked with water, and then with the vine.

They leave me no choice.
I must lead them to glory or most likely to death.

They traveled cross the plateau of ice, up to its edge.
Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain.
Still he urged the people on.

Then, on a distant slope,
He observed one without hope
Flee back up the mountainside.
He thought he recognized him by his walk,
And by the way he fell,
And by the way he
Stood up, and vanished into air",One for the Vine
Genesis,"Blue girls come in every size
Some are wise and some otherwise
They got pretty blue eyes
For an hour a man may change
For an hour her face looks strange
Looks strange, looks strange

Marching to the promised land
Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand
Pulls you down on your knees
While you're down a pool appears
The face in the water looks up
And she shakes her head as if to say
That it's the last time you'll look like today

Sail away, away
Ripples never come back
Gone to the other side
Sail away, sail away

The face that launched a thousand ships
Is sinking fast, that happens you know
The water gets below
Seems not very long ago
Lovelier she was than any that I know

Angels never know it's time
To close the book and gracefully decline
The song has found a tale
My, what a jealous pool she is
The face in the water looks up
She shakes her head as if to say
That the blue girls have all gone away

Sail away, away
Ripples never come back
They've gone to the other side
Look into the pool
Ripples never come back
Dive to the bottom and go to the top
To see where they have gone
Oh, they've gone to the other side",Ripples
Genesis,"Say it's alright Joe

Say it's alright Joe,
I need another drink
To blow on the glass so I know I'm alive

Play me a song Joe
To fill the hours till morning
Then never again will I bother you
Ooh, build myself a tower
No way in no way out.
Then my friends can visit me
Once in a while.

Say it's alright Joe.
I need some reassurance
You never know what you might find in the night.
Ooh I'm just a busy bee, still alone in my hive,
I'm looking for some other world
To dream out my dreams.

There were kings who were laughing in the rain
And they told me I'd come here to lead the parade
All the colors were changing, the sky was in ruins
The lights are all shining on me and on you
Shine on

Say it's alright Joe
The night will soon be over
And nothing and no one will ever know.
Open my eyes Joe
I'd like to see the daylight
The clock on the wall says it's time to leave.
Never seen the same face twice
Never walked the same way
The little love that I have known
I keep to myself.

Genesis,"Like father like son 
Not flesh nor fish nor bone 
A red rag hangs from an open mouth. 
Alive at both ends but a little dead in the middle, 
A-tumbling and a-bumbling he will go. 
All the king's horses and all the king's men 
Could never put a smile on that face. 

He's a sly one, he's a shy one 
Wouldn't you be too. 
Scared to be left all on his own. 
Hasn't a, hasn't a friend to play with, the ugly duckling

His heart was broken long before he ever came to you. 
Stop your tears from falling, 
The trail they leave is very clear for all to see at night 
All to see at night. 

In season, out of season 
What's the difference when you don't know the reason. 
In one hand bread, the other a stone. 
The hunter enters the forest. 
All are not huntsmen who can blow the huntsman's horn 
By the look of this one you've not got much to fear. 

Here I am, I'm very fierce and frightening 
Come to match my skill to yours. 
Now listen here, listen to me, don't you run away now 
I am a friend, I'd really like to play with you. 
Making noises my little furry friend would make 
I'll trick him, then I'll kick him into my sack. 
You better watch out you better watch out. 

I've got you, I've got you, you'll never get away. 

Walking home that night 
The sack across my back, the sound of sobbing on my shoulder. 
When suddenly it stopped, 
I opened up the sack, all that I had 
A pool of bubbles and tears - just a pool of tears. 

All in all you are a very dying race 
Placing trust upon a cruel world. 
You never had the things you thought you should have had 
And you'll not get them now,

Genesis,"No cloud, a sleepy calm
Sun baked earth that's cooled by gentle breeze
And trees with rustling leaves
Only endless days without a care
Nothing must be done

Silent as a day can be
Far off sounds of others on their chosen run
As they do all those things they feel give life some meaning
Even if they're dull

Time to stop this dreaming, must rejoin the real world
As revealed by orange lights and a smoky atmosphere

The trees and I are shaken by the same winds but whereas
The trees will lose their withered leaves
I just can't seem to let them loose
And they can't refresh me those hot winds of the south
Feel like an alien, a stranger in an alien place

Now the light id fading fast
Chances slip away, a time will come to pass
When there'll be none
Then addicted to a perfumed poison
Betrayed by its aftertaste
We shall lose the wonder and find nothing in return
Many are the substitutes but they're powerless an their own

Beware the fisherman who's casting out his line
Into a dried up river bed
But don't try to tell him 'cause he won't believe you
Throw some bread to the ducks instead, it's easier that way
Feel like an alien, a stranger in an alien place",Heathaze

She never thought about the future, she just did what she would
Oh but she really cared
About her music, it all seemed so important then,
 
And she dreamed that every time that she performed
Everyone would cry for more,
That all she had to do was step into the light,
And everyone would start to roar.
 
And on the road,
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge,
She battled through
Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds.
 
But now everytime that she performed
Oh everybody cried for more,
Soon all she had to do was step into the light,
For everyone to start to roar.
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for.
 
Oh but time went by
It wasn't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong.
Yes times were hard,
Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want.
 
An then there was the time that she performed
When nobody called for more
And soon everytime she stepped into the light,
They really let her know the score.
But she dreamed of the times when she sang all her songs
And everybody cried for more,
When all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar.

Genesis,"Ma would never say what happened
And we knew better than push too hard
We knew we had all the chores to tend to
Like fixing fences and helping her

Washing dishes and making coffee
Me and Virgil'd chop some wood
But we'd stop our swinging
Just to listen to her crying

It didn't sound too good
I can remember, too well
 
But we never thought to pay much heed
We learned to live life the best we could
But then one day pa upped and left us
High and dry without a word

Seemed a pity
My ma was pretty
But I soon learned life ain't that way
And I can remember hearing her weeping
While we were sleeping next to her
 
I can remember 
I'll never forgive and I'll never forget
'Cause pa you broke her heart
Ooh pa you broke her heart
You broke her heart
Ooh pa you broke her heart
 
Well the years rolled by
And 'fore we knew it
Our sister got married and moved out west
I stayed with ma, 'cause I couldn't desert her

I knew it would hurt her to be alone
So we pulled tighter
We said we'd try to make things easy
And raise a smile

But as the night came
We'd hear her crying
Praying for pa to come back again
 
I can remember
I'll never forgive him and I'll never forget
'Cause pa you broke her heart
Oh pa you broke her heart
 
And then the winter came
I'd never known it colder
Ooh it seemed the worst for years
And the night she died I swear I saw her smiling
Saying I was a big boy now, no tears
 
So I packed up all we had, and Virgil got the horses
And we paid our last respects and gave the whip a crack
Ooh, seemed a big bad world, we were riding into
Me and Virgil both agreed, we best head off
And don't look back
 
Nothing but desert all around
Oh it made me wonder
Lord it's hard to carry on
When you're sick with hunger
 
Weeks and months of sleeping rough
Keeping clear of danger
Seems we were miles from anywhere
And too far gone to change it
We'd best keep going, don't look back
 
Well me and Virgil we beat the desert
Riding fast and riding hard
We hit the city, the past behind us
So we raised some hell, we had some fun
But real soon I met a lady oh so pretty, and oh so fine

'fore too long I found myself married
With a home of my own and a blue eyed son
And 'til this day I can hear ma saying to me -

Was it summer when the river ran dry, 
Or was it just another dam. 
When the evil of a snowflake in June 
Could still be a source of relief. 
O how I love you, I once cried long ago, 
But I was the one who decided to go. 
To search beyond the final crest, 
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high. 

So I pretended to have wings for my arms 
And took off in the air. 
I flew to places which the clouds never see, 
Too close to the deserts of sand, 
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies 
Forced me to land and take a disguise. 
I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back 
If I could find a horse not made of sand. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon. 

Hey man, 
I'm the sand man. 
And boy have I news for you; 
They're gonna throw you in gaol 
And you know they can't fail 
'cause sand is thicker than blood. 
But a prison in sand 
Is a haven in hell, 
For a gaol can give you a goal 
[and a] goal can find you a role 
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle, 
Where it rains so much 
You can't wait for a touch 
Of sun and sand, sun and sand... 

Within the valley of shadowless death 
They pray for thunderclouds and rain, 
But to the multitude who stand in the rain 
Heaven is where the sun shines. 
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown 
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down. 
Forever caught in desert lands one has to learn 
To disbelieve the sea. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me.

Picking up the pieces, putting them away
Something doesn't feel quite right

Help me someone, let me out of here
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea

Coming out the woodwork, through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows without substance, in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sign and they moan

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea

Sit down, sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance like photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea

Sit down, sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you

Sit down sit down
Cause you won't get away
So with us you will stay
For the rest of your days. so sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you

She never thought about the future, she just did what she would

About her music, it all seemed so important then,
 
And she dreamed that every time that she performed
Everyone would cry for more,
That all she had to do was step into the light,
And everyone would start to roar.
 
And on the road,
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge,
She battled through
Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds.
 
But now every time that she performed
Oh everybody cried for more,
Soon all she had to do was step into the light,
For everyone to start to roar.
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for.
 
Oh but time went by
It wasn't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong.
Yes times were hard,
Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want.
 
An then there was the time that she performed
When nobody called for more
And soon every time she stepped into the light,
They really let her know the score.
But she dreamed of the times when she sang all her songs

They considered the phone call a hoax.
Furtively glancing then jauntily prancing
The youth caught the guards unaware.

Slipping between them he ought to have seen then
The eyes and their owner so near.
With torch shining bright he strode on in the night
Till he came to the room with the safe.

""Hello son, I hope you're having fun.""

He'd left and let nobody know. 
Gone were the towers he had known from a child, 
Alone with the dream of a life 
He traveled the wide open road, 
The blinkered arcade, 
In search of another to share in his life. 
Nowhere. 
Everyone looked so strange to him. 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence. 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold 
That lies in the deep distance, he cried 

And wept as they led him away to a cage 
Beast that can talk, read the sign. 
The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame 
And questioned his story again. 
But soon they grew bored of their prey 
Beast that can talk? 
More like a freak or publicity stunt. 
Oh 
No. 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence. 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold 
That lies in the deep distance, he cried 

And broke down the door of the cage and marched on out. 
He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck, pointing out: 
There, beyond the bounds of you weak imagination 
Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold. 
Let me take you there, show you a living story 
Let me show you others such as me

And so we set out with the best and his horns 
And his crazy description of home. 
After many days journey we came to a peak 
Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out. 
We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw 
A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all, 
But the beast was gone and a voice was heard: 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail

All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

But I don't know why.

I know you're going, but I can't believe it's the way that you're leaving,
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,
All this time, I still remember everything you said,
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
I can feel your eyes go through me

Only thinking about myself
Now I want to spend my life

She's a lady, she's got time
Brush back your hair, and let me get to know your face

Brush back your hair, and let me get to know your flesh

And all this time has passed me by

Genesis,"The Arrival 
Leaving by the same door from which he had come in, 
He finds some sort of freaks ghetto on the other side. 
When they catch sight of him, the entire street of distorted figures burst into laughter. 
One of the colony approaches him. 

[Rael] 
I wandered lonely as a cloud,
Till I came upon this dirty street.
I've never seen a stranger crowd;
Slubberdegullions on squeaky feet,
Continually pacing,
With nonchalant embracing,
Each orifice disgracing
And one facing me moves to say ""hellay"".

He is grotesque in every feature, a mixture of ugly lumps and stumps. 
His lips slip across his chin as he smiles in welcome and offers his slippery handshake. 
His skin`s all covered in slimy lumps.
With lips that slide across each chin.

His twisted limbs like rubber stumps
Are waved in welcome say `Please join in.`
My grip must be flipping,
'Cause his handshake keeps slipping,
My hopes keep on dipping
And his lips keep on smiling all the time.

Rael is a little disillusioned, 
When the Slipperman reveals that the entire colony have one-by-one been through 
The same glorious romantic tragedy with the same three Lamia, 
Who regenerate themselves every time, 
And that now Rael shares their physical appearance and shadowy fate. 

[Slipperman] 
""We, like you, have tasted love.
Don`t be alarmed at what you see,
You yourself are just the same
As what you see in me.""

Rael: 
Me, like you? like that!

Slipperman: 
""You better watch it son, your sentence has only just begun
You better run and join your brother John.""

Amongst the contorted faces of the Slippermen, 
Rael recognizes what is left of his brother John. T
Hey hug each other. 
A Visit To The Doktor 

John bitterly explains that the entire life of the Slipperman 
Is devoted to satisfying the never-ending hunger of the senses, 
Which has been inherited from the Lamia. 
There is only one escape route; a dreaded visit to the notorious Doktor Dyper 

Who will remove the source of the problems, or to put it less politely, castrate. 
They discuss the deceptively-named escape for a long time 
And decide to go together to visit the Doktor. 

[Slipperman] 
""You`re in the colony of slippermen.
There`s no who? why? what? or when?
You get out if you`ve got the gripe
To see, Doktor Dyper, reformed sniper - he`ll whip off your
Windscreenwiper""

[Rael]
John and I are able
To face the Doktor and his marble table.

The Doktor: 
Understand Rael, that`s the end of your tail.

Rael: 
""Don`t delay, dock the dick!""
I watch his countdown timer tick....

The Raven 
They survive the ordeal and are presented with the offensive weapons in sterile yellow plastic tubes, with gold chains. ""People usually wear them around their necks,"" said the Doktor handing them over. ""The operation does not necessarily exclude use of the facility again, for short periods, but of course when you want it you must provide us with considerable advance warning."" 

He places the number into a tube,
It`s a yellow plastic ""shoobedoobe"".
It says: ""Though your fingers may tickle
You`ll be safe in our pickle.""

As the brothers talk themselves through their new predicament, a big black raven flies into the cave, swoops down, grabs Rael`s tube right out of his hands and carries it up into the air in his beak. 
Suddenly, black cloud come down from the sky.
It`s a supersized black bird that sure can fly...
The raven brings on darkness and night
He flies right down, gives me one hell of a fright.
He take the tube right out of my hands
Man, I`ve got to find out where that black bird lands.

Rael calls for John to go with him. 
And he replies ""I will not chase a black raven. Down here you must read and obey the omens. There`s disaster where the raven flies."" 

""Look here John, I`ve got to run
I need you now, you going to come?""
He says to me:

John: 
""Now can`t you see
Where the raven flies there`s jeopardy.
We`ve been cured on the couch
Now you`re sick with your grouch.
I`ll not risk my honey pouch
Which my slouch will wear slung very low.""

So once more John deserts his brother. 
Rael: 
He walks away and leaves me once again.
Even though I never learn,
I`d hoped he`d show just some concern.

The bird leads Rael down a narrow tunnel, he seems to be allowing him to keep at a closed distance. But as Rael thinks he might almost catch hold of the bird, the tunnel opens and finishes at an enormous subterranean ravine. Casually, the raven drops his precious load into the rushing waters at the bottom. It`s enough to drive a poor boy ravin` mad. 
Seeing the dangers of the steep cliff, our courageous hero stands impotent and glowers. 

I`m in the agony of Slipperpain
I pray my undercarriage will sustain.
The chase is on, the pace is hot
But I`m running so very hard with everything that I`ve got.
He leads me down an underpass
Though it narrows, he still flies very fast,
When the tunnel stops
Catch sight of the tube, just as it drops.
I`m on top of a bank too steep to climb
I see it hit the water just in time
To watch it float away...",The Colony of Slippermen
Genesis,"Leaving my family behind me
Not knowing what lay ahead
Waving goodbye, as I left them in tears
Remembering all we'd said

I looked to the sky, I offered my prayers
I asked Him for guidance and strength
But the simple beliefs of a simple man
Lay in His hands, and on my head

But still they wanted more

But I can hear my children's cry
I can see the tears in their eyes
Memories of those I've left behind
Oh just still ringing in my ears
Will I ever go back again
Will I ever see her face again
'cause I'll always remember that night
As they waved goodbye to their fathers

We came from the North
And we came from the South
With picks and with spades
And a new kind of order
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead
They'll never see the likes of us again

Driving the last spike
Lifting and laying the track
With blistering hands
And the sun burning your back

But I can hear my children's cry
I can see the tears in their eyes
Oh memories of those I've left behind
Still ringing in my ears
'cause I'll always remember that night
As they waved goodbye to their fathers

We followed the rail, we slept under the stars
Digging in darkness and living with danger

Gotta get away in time

I heard voices but in truth there's nobody there

To feel again the wind upon my face
To see again all that I took for granted

Genesis,"A day of uncertain weather
Captured in a frame forever
A face in a faded photograph

He must have had a life
Maybe with a family
And people who meant everything to him

A sinner, a saint, a soldier
Caught up in a war he never
Had a chance to start or build a life

All gone long ago
Leaving no trace
Disappearing like smoke in the wind
To become just a face without a name
Leaving no trace
Disappearing like smoke in the wind

Hopes and fears important plans
Forgotten memories
Footsteps fading in the sand
Schemes and dreams small and grand
Nothing left to see
Footsteps fading in the sand

Someone who cast a shadow
Maybe just a lazy man
Doesn't make much difference now it's true

A day of uncertain weather
Captured in a frame forever

Of those never heard of again

Laying out the credit cards she plays fortune.
The deck is uneven right from the start;
And all of their hands are playing apart.

Off we go with - you play the hobbyhorse,

Genesis,"Is it really true what they're saying
Are you really sure there's nobody come for me?

When I'm walking home there is no one
Once there was a house, full of laughter, so warm

Trying to pretend there is someone
Someone who will care when I need it

I will now receive my comfort
Conjured by the magic power of wine

Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine

Just a drink to take my sorrow
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again
Now I'm down

When I walk outside, there is nowhere
Children follow me with their laughter, so cold

Casting just a glance at the churchyard
Casting just a glance at my painted female friend

Now I'm on my way, I am falling
Got to find some help, ooh, I will need that now

So I will receive my comfort
Conjured by the magic power of wine

Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine

Just a drink to take my sorrow
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again
Now I'm down

I will now receive my comfort
Conjured by the magic power of wine

Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine

Just a drink to take my sorrow
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow now

Genesis,"Pacidy, my love glowing ember of evening
Your eyes are frozen with guilt
I read my fate on your cheeks
The smoldering coals of a passion once a meadow of hope

Days of minstrels and bright steeds
Autumn nights and silk sheets
Your tender battle shadow on me scented lavender kisses, soft and warm
The union of strength in a love against life, love against life

Pacidy, my love your touch, so limp, was once frenzied
Your argon lips were once sweet
A life has slipped through my hands
My spirits sift in a stale sigh, did love exist as a dream?

Mother fawn of a pine wood shepherdess of my grief
Veils a freedom not for me
Far beyond the steep ridge, where blizzards
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts, frailest of beasts

Where blizzards
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts, frailest of beasts
Where blizzards
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts, frailest of beasts

Genesis,"Moving down the water
John is drifting out of sight
It's only at the turning point
That you find out how you fight

In the cold, feel the cold all around
And the rush of crashing water
Surrounds me with its sound

Striking out to reach you
I can't get through to the other side
When you're racing in the rapids
There's only one way that's to ride

Taken down, taken down by the undertow
And I'm spiraled down the river bed
My fire is burning low

Catching hold of the rock that's firm
I'm waiting for John to be carried past
We hold together, hold together and shoot the rapids fast

When the waters slow down
The dark and the deep
Have no one, no one, no one, no one
No one left to keep

Hang on John, we're out of this at last
Somethings changed that's not your face
It's mine, it's mine

I think I'm in love
But the feeling in the word is more
Than your crystal eyes will ever see in me

Don't get me wrong

Although I cannot show my heart
I'll watch and hope while you are near to me

One day, I'll capture you
And call you to my side
One day, I'll take you from
The boredom of our lives

One day, we'll fly away
To the kingdom of my dreams
One day, I'll find myself
And wrap it in my love for you

May I borrow your wings?
Very soon, I'll ask my love
To travel with me to the world outside

May I borrow your bloom?
Very soon, I'll ask my love
To come inside the nest, I'll build alone

One day, I'll capture you
And call you to my side

To the kingdom of my dreams

Help me decide
When should I ask my love to leave?
I'll beg of you that she'll say yes to me

Breathe in deep
Now is the time
She looks at me and gently smiles
As if she knew I'd ask her all the time

One day, I'll capture you
And call you to my side
One day, I'll take you from

Listen, to the news I bring

Frosty breath on the window
See a friend in the snow that gently falls
Feel the truth in those sad eyes
See the smile that's so rare just like the love, she waits for

And she plays a game of her own
As she sleeps within the firelight
For her dreams are incredibly wild
But they're lost and gone forever with the dawn

Fair and friend of the fleece spoke
Warrior bold, shepherd wise, fair Prince of Peace
Someone waits in the doorway
On a white horse, he comes and holds out the hand, she waits for

So they ride through a valley of mist
To a castle in the Heavens
Where he lays her down to rest
But he's lost and gone forever with the dawn

See her writhe in her dream, then

Mermaids sing in the sunset
Sadly asking if beauty ever walks free
But Queen Frost only whispers
Maidens you will remain to be free

See her writhe in her dreams

Who was wise enough to spend all his fortunes
In burying himself many miles beneath the ground
As the only surviving member of the human race
He inherited the whole world

Here today the red sky tells his tale
But the only listening eyes are mine
There is peace amongst the hills
And the night will cover all my pride

Blest are they who smile from bodies free
Seems to me like any other crowd
Who are waiting to be saved

Wait, there still is time for washing in the pool
Wash away the past
Moon, my long-lost friend is smiling from above
Smiling at my tears

Come we'll walk the path to take us to my home
Keep outside the night
The ice-cold knife has come to decorate the dead somehow

And each will find a home
And there will still be time
For loving my friend, you are there

And I will wait for ever
Beside the silent mirror
And fish for bitter minnows
Amongst the weeds and slimy water

I, I said, I want to sit down
I, I said, I want to sit down
I want a drink, I want a drink
To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat

I want a drink, I want a drink
To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts
I want a drink

Then let us drink, then let us smile
Then let us go

A moonlight shined

She gonna lead you right

When I led her through the people
The angry noise began to grow
She said, ""Let me feel the way the breezes blow
And I'll show you where to go""

So I followed her into a big round cave
She said, ""They're coming for you, now don't be afraid""
Then she sat me down on a cold stone's throne
Carved in jade

Lit up by whatever's coming here
Two golden globes float into the room
And a blaze of white light fills the air

And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease

He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside

Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary

We will keep you snug and warm

We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left

Genesis,"Well, the key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find the way out

Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
Till it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night

I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes

He said:
""You're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine""

Oh his words how they hurt me
I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by
I lived to regret it

You're no son, you're no son of mine
But where should I go
Please tell me what should I do
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But I came here for help
Oh I was looking for you

Well the years they passed so slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes

He said:
""You're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine""

Oh his words how they hurt me
I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by
I lived to regret it

You're no son, you're no son of mine
But where should I go
Please tell me what should I do

You're no son, you're no son of mine
But I came here for help
Oh I was looking for you",No Son of Mine
Genesis,"The warming sun, the cooling rain
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze
The lightning bolt that clears the sky for you
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through
The words of love, the cries of hate
And the man in the moon who seduced you, then finally loosed you

You climbed upon a burning rope to escape the mob below
But you had put the flaming out so that others could now follow
To be out of the bounds and the barks
Of those who do not wish you well

You must blaze a trail of your own, unknown, alone
But keep in mind
Don't live today for tomorrow like you were immortal
The only survivors on this world of ours are

The warming sun, the cooling rain
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze
The lightning bolt that clears the sky for you
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through
The words of love, the cries of hate
And the man in the moon who seduced you, then finally loosed you

You're old and disillusioned now as you realize at least
That all you have accomplished here will have soon all turned to dust
You dream of a future after life
Well that's as maybe, but I don't know

But you can't take what you left behind, you're all alone
So keep in mind
Don't live today for tomorrow like you were immortal
The only survivors on this world of ours are

The warming sun, the cooling rain
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze
The lightning bolt that frees the sky for you
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through
The words of love, the cries of hate
And the man in the moon and now

Genesis,"When they went to bed that night, no one would have believed
That in the morning light would not be there
The dark hung heavy on the air like the grip of a jealous man
No place was there known to have been spared
Then panic took control of minds as fear hit everyone
The day the light went out of the daytime sky

Artificial light could hardly penetrate the gloom
Nothing out of reach could be observed
Looting, pillage, murder, rape became the rule of that day
Who hit him no one knew, or whom he hit
Cars were caught in pileups and the planes could never land
The day the light went out of the daytime sky

""Now I can rest here after my journey
Now I can feed here before I continue.""

Some were there who's heads were clear who sought, tried to find
The nature of this deadly foe, the dark
It seemed the sun was still somewhere, though hidden from their sight
By something, though amorphous, yet alive
And so they looked for ways to rid themselves of the parasite
The day the light went out of the daytime sky

""Now I can rest here after my journey
Now I can feed here before I continue.""

They tried in many fruitless ways to see the noonday sun
By blasting with their missiles through the dark
But soon a kind of sleepy state came over everyone
Till nothing seemed to stir or even breathe
And when the darkness chose to disappear, not many had survived
Then came a shadow - another had arrived
And again the light went out of the daytime sky",The Day the Light Went Out
Genesis,"Get out of the way fat man you got something to do
Go fill up your hands till they're shining back up at you
Well you gotta get out while there's gold in the air
It's falling like water, always coming down from those hills, no, no, no

Go West young man
Earn a dollar a day that's what your family said
And you're rollin' the days right on into the night
At the head of the line always goin' way, way, way, way, way out of sight
Go West young man, like your family said

All along the wagons, all along the dusty trail
Seventeen years not over a day like children in the wild
Your mama's milk still wet on your face
And no one wants to pray for your safe journey home

Out beyond the desert, across the mountains by the fall
Servants who leave their masters house all are walking all the way
The golden fields that beckoned you, you
They're darkened by the days, days

Go West young man, like your family said
Go West young man
Ah well if you knew then, just what you know today
Yes you'd be back where you started a happier man
And leave all the glory to all of those who have remained

So go West young man
Go West young man, like your family said, oh no

Go West young man
Go West young man, like your family said, oh no",Deep in the Motherlode [Live]
Genesis,"In and out of darkness, in and out of sleep
Trying to keep my hands upon the wheel
Never saw the corner in the driving rain
I never saw her step into the street

Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep
Memories to keep
Dreaming while you sleep

I can never understand just what went through my mind
I didn't stop to see what I had done
Had to keep on driving deep into the night
The miles between would somehow put it right

Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep
Memories to keep
Dreaming while you sleep

All my life you lie silently there
All my life in a world so unfair
All my life and only I'll know why
And it will live inside of me

I will never be free all my life
Trapped in her memory all my life
Till the day that you open your eyes
Please, please, please open your eyes

Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep

Heard it on the radio, and I saw it on TV
But could I take my secret to the grave?
If I had another chance, would I do the same?
Would I still deny that it was me?

Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep
Are you dreaming while you sleep?
Are you dreaming while you sleep?

All my life I'll be haunted by
All my life just one moment in time
All my life until the day I die

And it will live inside of me
I will never be free all my life
Trapped in her memory all my life
Till the day that you open your eyes
Please, oh please, please, please open your eyes

And just one moment of time, all my life

Oh, and it will live inside of me
I will never be free all my life
Till the day that you open your eyes, eyes
Please, please, please open your eyes

Dreaming while you sleep
Are you dreaming while you sleep?
Dreaming while you sleep
Are you dreaming while you sleep?

Genesis,"I am the one who guided you this far
All you know and all you feel
Nobody must know my name
For nobody would understand
And you kill what you fear
And you fear what you don't understand

I call you for I must leave
You're on your own until the end
There was a choice but now it's gone
I said, ""You wouldn't understand
Take what's yours and be damned""",Duke's Travels [Live]
Genesis,"When you're asleep they may show you
Aerial views of the ground
Freudian slumber empty of sound

Over the rooftops and houses
Lost as it tries to be seen
Fields of incentive covered with green

Mesmerized children are playing
Meant to be seen but not heard
Stop me from dreaming, don't be absurd, absurd

Well, if we can help you we will
You're looking tired and ill
As I count backwards
Your eyes become heavier still

Sleep, won't you allow yourself fall?
Nothing can hurt you at all
With your consent
We can experiment further still

Madrigal music is playing
Voices can faintly be heard
Please leave this patient undisturbed

Sentenced to drift far away now
Nothing is quite what it seems
Sometimes entangled in your own dreams, in your dreams

Well, if we can help you we will
Soon as you're tired and ill
With your consent
We can experiment further still

Well, thanks to our kindness and skill
You'll have no trouble until
You catch your breath
And the nurse will present you the bill

Genesis,"The girl from all those songs
Who made everything feel right
She came in like an angel, into your lonely life
And filling your world with light
Oh, and everybody told you ""you're oh so lucky""
 
Curtains part revealing a country scene
Clothed in green and brown
Evidence of autumn
And recent rain
On a winding lane, a byway
Walking on that road is a certain girl
In all the world the one
Guaranteed to move you and turn your head
When all's been said and done
 
The girl from all those songs
Who made everything feel right
She came in like an angel, into your lonely life
And filling your world with light
Oh, and everybody told you ""you're oh so lucky""
 
The night is clear but cool
Ooh maybe dawn is breaking as you turn to find her gone
Then you see the note
Ooh you cannot believe it
And you think you'll go insane
 
But that was many years ago
And though the pain is dim
A something still remains
Though you hardly can recall
Her face or form
Her memory lingers on
Ooh she made everything feel right
She came in like an angel (in like an angel),
Into your lonely life (into your life)
And filling your world with light
Oh and everybody told you ""you're oh so lucky""",Evidence of Autumn
Genesis,"You are terrified by the smallest sound
Because you live your life in such a sheltered world
As do those who surround you
Well I have seen you stung by poisonous flies
And you suffer much too much from their bites
There you sit in your comfort watching other people get caught by the
Storm

Many a thing that used to be a secret
Has become so talked about
Not worth a second thought
There's different kinds of secrets now
Times change, it's not enough to say
It seemed a good idea a hundred years ago
You think it's not your problem
It really doesn't matter at all

Every stone that's thrown must fall to the ground
But you don't give a thought to where they might come down
You are feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted

Anywhere that they don't speak the same
In any place that they don't think the same
You think it's not your problem
No no

You think it's not your problem
It really doesn't matter at all
Oh...

Maybe it's not your fate to be a leader of men
But you just leave it all to someone else and complain
You could be so much stronger, but it really doesn't matter any longer
'Cause you're feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted
