Led Zeppelin,"As I walk down the highway all I do is sing this song
And a train that's passin' my way helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, is oh so strong

I'm just a simple guy, I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues away 
There's nothing more that I can say but on a day like today 
I pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with you

All I need from you is all your love 
All you got to give to me is all your love 
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm so glad I'm living and gonna tell the world I am 
I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man 
One thing that I know for sure gonna give her all the loving 
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can

Standing in the noonday sun trying to flag a ride 
People go and people come, see my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace, they set the pace, it must be a race 
And the best thing I can do is run

All I need from you is all your love 
All you got to give to me is all your love 
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah",Out on the Tiles
Led Zeppelin,"I've been to London, seen seven wonders I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for
There can be no denying, that the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying, and there's a new plague on the land

(If we could just join hands)
(If we could just join)

Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me 
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight  I hear the rested rivers call
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe

(If we could just join hands)

You got me rocking when I ought to be a-rolling
Darling, tell me, darling, which way to go
You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stolen
Won't you tell me, darling, which way to go, that's right

Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry, and I would dearly like to know
I've all this wonder, of earthly plunder, will it leave us anything to show
And our time is flying, see the candle burning low
Is the new world rising, from the shambles of the old

(If we could just join hands)
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes

Led Zeppelin,"One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night

Be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite

A man I know, went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers, left and right
Whiskers

Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter
Our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set that room alight
Whiskers

Down on Bourbon street
You know it's right
You can see my friend,
They run around all through the night
Most everywhere
Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor
Doin' up my hair

New Orleans queens
Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out, strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White

Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk

And a little bit of helpin' hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground

And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh, so good
Baby if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh so much good

And a little bit of fly right down?
Ooh, just a little bit of sweet con-carne
It makes me feel, makes me feel

Ooh now baby, when you move it makes me
Really feel so good, oh, so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad

Led Zeppelin,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven [Blu-Ray]

I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying

Touch me one time, just like magic I will reappear
Sadness like the rain it showers over me
I wanna feel again, please someone find me

Lost not yet found, grieving in misery
Hope lurks around, when will the sun ever shine on me?
I need love to come and carry me
Take me away, please someone find me

Are you seeing my soul? Maybe I'll scream and shout
Please someone call, I don't wanna live without love
Hear my plea, I have love to give
I wanna live, please someone find me

",Lost & Found
Ledisi,"I remember the days when my life was turned around, 
Not happy with the love I found. 
I needed to change and you were always here in front of me. 
I was running away from the love you gave me, 
Wanted a life but everything was crazy. 
Unsure of love, I needed love.

Then came you, you were like the spingtime you make everything new. 
Just like the sun, you brought the light and now we are one.

[Chorus]
Every time it rains a little you came to cover me, 
You were there for me, you never left one. 
When I felt the world stop and my heart was breaking, 
You were there for me, you never left one.

Now you're in my world and it keeps on spinnin', 
Ain't gone change a thing cause I'm in it. 
Everything is beautiful because of you. 
How did you get here, I was dreaming? 
Somebody heard me, cause I was needing you. 
I was wanting you, I was calling you.

Then you came and everything about me has changed. 
Just like the sun, you brought the light and now we are one.

[Chorus]

You have brought me alive it's so unimaginable 
And this love we share is so unexplainable. 
With everything I have I will give it to you because, 
You were there for me.

I sat back and started thinkin'
And when it came to mind
I began to smile 'cause it's so true
It's so true

Thing never stay,
The way I want them to be
When I was younger back then, it was simplicity
People care too much, but like the seasons; it all has changed
I wish it wouldn't be that way

Life don't stay the same
Thinkin' 'bout used to be

There was a time when I gave up on people
Disappointment just led me to be alone
Then one day I was told
To just stand on my own,
And it's so true
It's so true
Just forgive no regrets
Go on and live and forget it
You can't go back again
Learn to leave in the present
Learn from your mistakes
Like the seasons it all has changed
Oh, everything must change

Can't bring back what used to be

Lee,"Standing on top of the sunshine, holding my face to the wind
I smile and I wonder what it's all really supposed to be about
And then it came along and it hit me like a cool breeze
And it rubbed on my nose, as I undressed in the moment
The here and now of my reality that I embrace
Some, they never get that chance to feel such liberation
But me, I welcome it with open arms

And this is an awesome feeling. Sometimes I need to stop and take a breath
It's like you climbed the highest moment, sang the perfect harmony
That exact space where you knew you wanted to be
It was all you ever wanted was just a chance to be free
And you have it right now

So don't you try to hold me back, don't put your limits on me
I want to open up my eyes and look as far as I can see
If you don't want to fly with me please just let me be

And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone

Happiness is just a word if you don't know how it feels
Sadness an emotion that I refuse to make real
From now on I live my life and make my dreams real
No more fire without light, no more knowledge without zeal
No more tears without laughter, no more anger, no more hurt
I have to take all those things and then I throw them to the dirt
Time to set a course for greatness, time to lift my people up
No more walking into walls, find the doors to get unstuck
I have to fulfill my destiny, I am my Father's son
You can walk with me if you'd like, together we are one

Together we are strong, together we will win

Together we make things right, today it all begins
Tomorrow is a new day, history will remember us well
Yesterday is in the past, we've got new stories to tell
We've got new suns to kiss, new horizons to touch
In fact, I've really never wanted anything quite this much
So don't you try to hold me back, don't put your limits on me
I want to open up my eyes and look as far as I can see
If you don't want to fly with me please just let me be

And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone

Life moves so slowly, time passes through me
Wind flows so freely, carries us softly
And I feel it's time we, look at things closely
Please won't you free me

And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone

Lee Ann Womack,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance
I hope you dance

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'
Don't let some Hellbent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out, reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along)
I hope you dance

I hope you dance (Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder)
I hope you dance (Where those years have gone?)

It's all pretty much the same stuff
Day after day
The only thing that keeps me goin' seems to be our baby girl I'm tryin' to raise
She's my life, my mornin' angel
Always seems to find the rainbow after the rain
Lately she's so busy growin', I don't even think she knows you've gone away

She finally learned to say goodbye
She's sleepin' through the night
She don't wake up cryin'
And she's walkin' on her own
She don't need no one holding to her hand
And I hate to admit
She's stronger than I am

She ain't crackin' under pressure
First one step and then another
She goes along
And if she falls and skins her knee
She cries a while and smiles at me, and just goes on
So many things that she can teach me
Full of life and so completely innocent
She still says she loves her daddy
Goes on just like nothin' happened
Forgives and forgets

She finally learned to say goodbye
She's sleepin' through the night
She don't wake up cryin'

There I go
Thinkin with my heart again

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then

She smiles at him, he says, ""Hello""
They stand beneath the mistletoe
Embarrassed by the awkward circumstance 

He asks her if she'd like a drink
She says, ""I better not I think
Oh, what the heck, maybe just one glass""

They talk about, oh, this and that
He says, ""I like the way you laugh
And I'm so really glad you're here""

Then suddenly it's much too warm
She feels his hand against her arm
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

The night goes on, the music plays
A moonlight Christmas serenade
A lovers' song that's meant for only two

And they don't even know it yet 
But this is one they'll not forget

The holiday where all their dreams came true
Across the floor he spins her around
Oh, could it be they've finally found
A love worth waiting for

Then in the tender yuletide bliss
They share an unexpected kiss
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

Then suddenly the night is gone
It's late into an early morn
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

I really should be getting home

It must be time for me to go

Does she get her hands greasy up underneath the hood
I'll bet she never listens to Merle

Lee Ann Womack,"When I gave you my heart
It was not what you wanted
Now the walls say your name
And the pictures are haunted
Does my ring burn your finger
Did my love weigh you down?
Was the promise too much to keep around?

I remember your words and I can't keep from cryin
I could never believe that your kisses were lyin
Was there somethin from the past
Buried in a shallow grave?
Did you think that it was too far gone to save?

Please tell me baby
Please tell me now
You say that I should just go on
Now please tell me how

Lee Ann Womack,"I had to leave my life in Dallas
That town will always be you
In every crowd, on every corner
In every face I'd see you

So with nothin' more than a tank of gas
I drove away without lookin' back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
Goin' anywhere as fast as I can

And I'm a little past, little rock further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead, too late to change my mind
I gotta keep my heart out of this and both hands on the wheel
I'm learnin' more with every mile just how leavin' feels

It's a lonely stretch of blacktop out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go or what I'll do
I'm a little past, little rock
But a long way from over you

These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have it my way
I'd go back to where you are

Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
Oh, and I'm still a far cry from gone

And I'm a little past, little rock further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead, too late to change my mind

Lee Ann Womack,"Down at the lost highway cafe
I met a man there with a map in his hand
He said ""I'm a little bit confused
And I'm not sure where I am""

He said, ""I'm trying to find this place
Been trying to get there for a long, long time""
Then he smiled and looked away
And asked me if I'd heard of happiness

I told him that it just might take a while
Maybe some years, and a lotta miles
Go down the road till you hit party ville
Don't stop unless you're lookin' for cheap thrills

Go past love to you hear wedding bells
Stop and honeymoon and rest a spell
You might get lost on the way is my guess
It ain't easy finding happiness

He said, ""I think I understand
I better go before the sun goes down
'Cause it's hard to see at night
And I just don't trust my eyes anymore""

I said ""Good luck"" and watched him leave
He hit the fast lane, then he disappeared
Just another weary traveler like so many
Trying to find his way back home

There's so many stops along the way
You keep on hoping that there'll come a day
I should have told him but I think he knows
So many places where he shouldn't go

So many souls that get turned around
Lookin' and wonderin' why it can't be found
It's a straight shot past loneliness
Why can't we seem to find happiness?
It's easy to get turned around I guess
On the road to happiness

Lee Ann Womack,"I guess he's working late again
I don't need to wonder where he is

I know his job takes a lot of him
There's not much left for him to give
But I need more
He ought a know that by now

It's not like he's gotta read my mind
To know what I'm feeling after all this time
It's just so hard to hold onto what is never around

He used to promise soon things would change
It's been years and it's still the same
And that hurts
He ought a know that by now

I've grown so used to being alone
Couldn't be much worse if I were gone
And in a way I am
He ought a know that by now

Leaving him was hard as hell, but I did

Lee Ann Womack,"Ain't it just like one of us 
To pick up the phone 
And call after a couple of
Drinks,
And say,
""How you been? 
I been wonderin' 
That maybe you've been thinkin' 'bout me.""
And somewhere in the conversation, 
An old familiar invitation always arrives,
An' I may hate myself in the morning, 
But I'm gonna love you tonight.

Everyone's known someone 
That they just can't help but want,
And even though we just can't make it work out, 
Well the want-to lingers on.
So once again we wind up in each other's arms, 
Pretending that it's right,
An' I may hate myself in the morning, 
But I'm gonna love you tonight.

I know it's wrong, 
But it ain't easy moving on.
So why can't two friends remember the good times once again?

Tomorrow when I wake up, 
I'll be feeling a little guilty, an' a little sad,
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad.
An' I guess that's what it is, 
In lonely late night calls like this, that we try to find
An' I may hate myself in the morning, 
But I'm gonna love you tonight.

But I'm gonna love you tonight.",I May Hate Myself in the Morning
Lee Ann Womack,"Like an old abandoned ferris wheel
Time for me is standin' still
And it's you and me in mid July
Underneath the midway lights
And all our friends are standing there
So I was actin' like I didn't care
When you put your arms around my neck
And I barely even kissed you back
But if I'da have known it was the last time
I'da held on a little longer
And let that moment linger
And never let your fingers slip away from mine
If I'da known there'd never be another day
I'da watched you as you walked away
And kept you in my eyes till you were out of sight
If I, If I'da known it was the last time
Now the midway lights have all shut down
And grass has grown up all around
It's an empty field across the track
But I can't keep from coming back
It was another summer night
Carousel and rollercoaster ride
And that silly fight that we got in
Didn't seem so important then
But if I'da known it was the last time
I'da held on a little longer
And let that moment linger
And never let your fingers slip away from mine
If I'da known there'd never be another day
I'da watched you as you walked away
And kept you in my eyes till you were out of sight
If I, If I'da known it was the last time
And if I'da known then, what I know now
I'd never let you disappear into the crowd
Or turn away the way I did
With so much left unsaid

Said you needed to talk to me

Said take that

Cause baby when you said good-bye

I've turned out all the lights

What they used to call the mustard seed
There's a molecule of faith in this room

I don't know where it is, but I hope I find it soon
'Cause nothing else will ever set me free
There's a molecule of faith in this room
And even though it's much too small to see
If I have the courage to believe
I'll find the one who left it here for me

There's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just someone I used to know
Just someone, I used to spend some time with
Just a flame, that's lost it's glow
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you

Just someone, I used to run around with
Just a friend from long ago

You can't hate and you can't hurt

I think I know what got Hank Williams.

[Chorus]
Sometimes the teardrops can't be measured
Sometimes the blues have no name
Sometimes the feeling somethings missing
Grabs your heart and won't go away.

I think I know what took Ol' Johnny
And it wasn't his tired body
He went so soon after losing June
I think I know what took Ol' Johnny

I think I know what killed Keith Whitley
And it wasn't just the Whiskey.",I Think I Know
Lee Ann Womack,"If houses tell stories
I wonder
About these walls of yours and mine
They could repeat any number
Of things
They've heard and seen in their time

All of the angry words spoken
Then the silence that follows for days
All that leaves a home feeling broken
Lord, if these walls could talk they'd pray

[Chorus]
If love lived here you couldn't tell
Five thousand square feet of living hell
And two hearts that need to be saved
It all died here from pure neglect
Is it too dead to resurrect
Lord, if these walls could talk they'd pray

Two little hands folded tight by her bedside
Asking Jesus will my family be ok
A child of five is just too small
Her prayers alone can't save us all
Lord, if these walls could talk they'd pray

[Chorus]

Lord, if these walls could talk they'd pray",If These Walls Could Talk
Lee Ann Womack,"Daddy took my sister's bike
Before I knew it, it was like
He bought it just for me down at the store
And mama bought a Goodwill gown
Added lace and beads she found
So I could wear what Cinderella wore

[Chorus]
So much for used and abused
Abandoned, thrown away
Some things are destined to live another day
It takes a certain kind
To look deep enough to find
The beauty within
And I thank God for those
Who make the old new again

And to my baggage filled with broken things
I threw in all my hopes and dreams
And on my sleeve I wore my broken heart
I thought forever'd be how long I'd wait
Before I met the man who'd make it better
And give me a brand new start

[Chorus]

We're all lost and found, damaged goods
Cast aside, misunderstood
Scratched and dented, needing paint
A sin away from a saint

[Chorus]",New Again
Lee Ann Womack,"I don't ever want to be afraid,
To walk the world in my own way.
I don't want to ever lose my faith
In all the little simple things.
And even if it all falls down,
I know it'll come back around.

I never wanna not believe,
That someone has a plan for me.

[Chorus]
Live every moment as if, its the last one.
Find all the love deep within, give it away.
Be thankful for all that I've been given.
From now on, this is how I want to write,
The story of my life.

I wanna turn the pages of the past.
Take what I've learned and then never look back.
Still I never want to get too far ahead,
Or worry about how the story ends.

[Chorus]",The Story of My Life
Lee Ann Womack,"I recognized your number,
It's burned into my brain,
Felt my heart beating faster,
Every time it rang.
Some things never change,
That's why I didn't answer.

I bet you're in a bar,
Listening to a country song.
Glass of Johnny Walker Red,
With no one to take you home.
They're probably closing down,
Saying, ""No more alcohol.""
I bet you're in a bar
'Cause I'm always your last call.

I don't need to check that message.
I know what it says.
""Baby, I still love you,""
Don't mean nothing when there's whiskey on your breath.
That's the only love I get.
So if you're calling

I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a cheatin' song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, ""No more alcohol""
I bet you're in bar,
'Cause I'm always your last

Call me crazy but
I think maybe
We've had our last call.

I bet you're in a bar.
It's always the same old song.

By now it's almost gone.
But baby, I won't be there
To catch you when you fall.

Lee Ann Womack,"Chances are I took the wrong turn
Every time I had a turn to take
And I guess I broke my own heart
Every chance I had a heart to break

And it seems I spent my whole life
Wishin’ on the same unlucky star
And as I watch you ‘cross the barroom
I wonder what my chances are

Well, I know you’ve been around
And you’ve seen what you needed to see
And at night when you’re dreamin’
You’re probably not dreamin’ ’bout me

Oh, it’s safe to say I’ve stumbled
But I’ve managed to make it through this far
And as I take one step and then another
I wonder what my chances are

I have watched the world go by, hand in hand
And wondered why I’m still so alone
Could I lay down my foolish pride
And maybe finally find my heart a home?

I’ve been sleeping with the devil, arms around him tight
Breathing my hot breath upon his chest the whole long night

I missed it all by sleeping in, And I feel no light inside

And he’s run off with my soul

Lee Ann Womack,"Her head rolls back and forth
Against the billows of her long black shiny hair
As she contemplates the ecstasy
Of some other love that now she wished was there
If she could only realize
That the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly
And pushing back advances with her hands

Every night I see her leaves
A nightmare of illusions when she’s gone
And it leaves a longing feeling in a man
With a pain that lingers on
The gaudy goodbye can’t replace
The girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I’ve made my crumbled mind up
That I’ll never ever let her go

Too many nights I’ve watched her tease
By shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands
That cover up her satin lips
She struts upon the stage
And her fallen victims are callin’ out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly
And exits to her dressing room door

Tonight I’m gonna take her
I’ve infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carryin’
All those scanty costumes that she wore
And she asks a sawed off cigar smokin’ cat
If he would open up the door
Then she told him to load the baggage
Because they open tomorrow night in Baltimore

I’m gonna be there tomorrow night in Baltimore",Tomorrow Night in Baltimore

Said I’ll fill it up every time we meet

Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off
He sold his one man shop to Microsoft

Just ask him how he made it

The chills I get when you lay your lips on mine
That's beautiful, beautiful every time

Well i could hear the music drifting over the dunes
It Sounded like a wedding on the beach
Figured id take a closer look, had nothing better to do
I guess amazing, is always amazing

Do you want to dance all night
Do you want to take a little

We hear the band bang
Roll through the door

Dance if you want to
Do what you came to
You cant ignore the feeling

DJ is really wigging
He got the old school mixing
The fellas heads are spinning
All the girls are finger-licking

We got the bubbly bubbling
I got her shoulders rubbing
I got my game spinning
Kicking it in low

Pulls me to the main stage

Lee Brice,"I grew up on the edge of a cornfield at the end of a long dirt road
Carolina plow boy, ain't had a free summer since I was ten years old
Mama made us pick our own switches so we could feel the sting of doing wrong
That set me straight on the road I'm still on

I am who I am
The product of a good woman loved by a real good man
I've learned what I've learned
By finding the right way in all of my wrong turns
I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it cause I'm damn sure man enough
That's what you need to see to get a picture of me

I grew up on gospel cause that's all my daddy'd listen to
I found my soul in rock and roll when me and my first guitar were introduced
Truth is I've only loved one woman
And she'd have stayed, but I made her leave
She's still hauntin' me in every song I sing

I am who I am
The product of a woman still loved by a stubborn man
I've learned what I've learned
By finding the right way in all of my wrong turns
I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it cause I'm damn sure man enough
That's what you need to see to get a picture of me

Like me or leave me
Either way you know it the second you shake my hand
I'm a long way from Jesus, but I know He knows I'm doing the best I can

I am who I am
The product of the good Lord lovin' a sinful man
I've learned what I've learned
By finding the right way in all of my wrong turns
I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it cause I'm damn sure man enough
That's what you need to see
That's what you need to see to get a picture of me",Picture of Me

It's the touch of her hand
One smile, one tear, one whisper in your ear

What can I say
You've had me thinkin' in circles
In crazy not like me ways
My favorite thing
Lately has been waking up with you
Talkin' ourselves to sleep again

Baby come a little closer
Let me lay some nibble kisses on your shoulder
You said that's your favorite place
Baby maybe we could borrow
Find a way to bag and
Steal a few tomorrows and stay
Here in these last few days

These last few days
Have blown me away
The thought of letting go,
And falling
Is actually feeling okay
I must confess
I need some rest
But with every touch
I swear the better it seems to get

Lee Brice,"Last night, outta the blue
Drifting off to the evening news
She said ""Honey, what would you do
If you’d never met me""
I just laughed, said ""I don’t know,
But I could take a couple guesses though""
And then tried to dig real deep,
Said, ""Darling honestly,

I’d do a lot more offshore fishing
I’d probably eat more drive-thru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If I’d have never known your name
I’d still be driving that old green ‘Nova
I probably never would have heard of yoga
Be a better football fan
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I’d be looking for a woman like you.""

I could tell that got her attention
So I said, ""Oh yeah, I forgot to mention,
I wouldn’t trade a single day
For a hundred years the other way.""
She just smiled and rolled her eyes,
'Cause she’s heard all of my lines
I said, ""Come on on girl, seriously
If I hadn’t been so lucky

I’d be shooting pool in my bachelor pad
Playing bass in my cover band
Restocking up cold Bud Light
Play poker every Tuesday night, yeah
I’d have a dirt bike in the shed
And not one throw pillow on the bed
I’d keep my cash in a coffee can
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I’d be looking for a woman like you.""

She knows what a mess I’d be if I didn’t have her here
But to be sure, I whispered in her ear
""You know I get sick deep-sea fishing
And you make the best fried chicken
I got a hopeless golf game
I love the sound of your name
I might miss that old green ‘Nova
But I love watching you do yoga
I’d take a gold band on my hand

Cussing out the ref but I guess I can't complain,

We were full of bull and natural light
Rock stars, under the parking lot lights
Killing time in a little town
Window's tinted up, tailgates down
Running our mouths, riding up and down
Just looking for a fight

Somebody go on and tell 'em again, ain't nobody gonna mind

Here's to the good old boys, the guitars that made the noise
And all the girls that we annoyed, and the ones we kissed goodnight,
To the trucks that drove us home, secrets we never told
And all the talks on old dirt roads that somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember and the friends we won't forget

Like I still smell the craw fish stand, diving head first in the morning drink
Standing in the lake watching water skis go by,
Got a pretty girl sitting on my shoulders and another pretty girl trying to push her over
My boys on the bank letting the horseshoes fly
Well I can still see it now,
All of us piling in our trucks and heading back into town

Here's the good old boys, the guitars that made the noise
And all the girls we annoyed, and the ones we kissed goodnight,

Mascara running from her eyes
She'd just got the news
This morning her husband died in a head on wreck
I turned around to her and said ""ma'am is there anything I can do?""

She said ""just thank God
For everything you've got""

After seeing her so sad
I need to check my heart
I need to watch my mouth

A little less doubt, it ain't that hard to figure out

By the county line
Whipped out a fake ID
I got from a friend of mine
We made our getaway
Due south to the Gulf Shore sand
You were looking like a woman child
I was feeling like a full grown man

We had a bottle of silver
And a bottle of sapphire
An Indian blanket
And a beachfront bonfire
We watched the moon
Ship wreck on the water
I don't remember, a night much hotter

You, were lying on the hood of my car
And I, was strumming on that old guitar
And we, were looking for the northern stars

And midnight played like a drive in scene
You were doing Liz Taylor
I was doing James Dean
And I loved you as much as I could at 18
With sand in your hair and sand in my jeans
It was so right, all night

And the sunset looked like an airbrushed t-shirt
Sold on the street in Panama City
I grabbed the camera and snapped off the picture
You said 'love, ain't it a pitty,
Someday this moment will fade away,
Replaced by a photograph'

Like the way we remember the words to a joke
But forgot how hard it made us laugh

Honda with the hood up covered in smoke,
Thumb in the air with somewhere to go in a hurry.

She didn't say a thing, she just jumped inside,
Stuck a gun to my chest and told me to drive.
I was scared but she was beautiful, like a movie.

She kept lookin' back like somethin' was comin',
Said we ain't slowin' down, ain't stoppin' for nothin',
My truck was shaking, my blood was pumpin',
But she was laughin'.

I 'bout hit the brakes when we came around the corner,
A mile of blue lights, guns aimed and pointed.
Whatever she had is what they wanted,
And it's all a little fuzzy after that.

All I remember is sirens,
Blue lights flashin' and drivin',
Dirt lane passin' and flyin',
Tearin' through the red lights,
Blowin' through the stop signs.
All I remember is sirens,
Ringin' from the gun shots firin',
One curve away from dyin',
And all I remember is...
Sirens.

The man on the radio reported the chase,
And all about the beauty,
How she cleaned out the bank.
She was armed and dangerous,
She almost got away but they found her.
She was cussin' at choppers,
They were swirlin' around,
Reloadin' her revolver every couple-a-rounds.
Shot off a couple shots,
But they wouldn't back down.

All I remember is sirens,
Blue lights flashin' and drivin',
Dirt lane passin' and flyin',
Tearin' through the red lights,
Blowin' through the stop signs.
All I remember is sirens,
Ringin' from the gun shots firin',
One curve away from dyin',
Baby all I remember is...
Sirens.

We were all outta road and I knew she could tell,
'Cause she leaned across my lap and buckled my belt,
And kissed me on the cheek and said,
""Thanks for the help, and hold on boy.""
Well she yanked the wheel and I held my breath,
We flipped so many times we shoulda been dead.
And that's all I got,
And I just woke up here and I said

Lee Collins,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Lee Collins,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary
Lee Davis,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

Thanks for the miracle of Your Rosary
Only You can hold back
Your Holy Son's hand
Long enough for the whole world to understand

Hail Mary full of grace
The Lord is with Thee
Blessed are thou among women
And blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus
Oh Holy Mary dear Mother of God
Please pray for us sinners
Now and at the hour of our death
And give thanks once again
For the miracle of Your Rosary

You saw her bathing on the roof 
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya 

She tied you 
To her kitchen chair 
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair 
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above but, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

What you've done to me is kinda hard to explain

Like danicin' on the Brooklyn bridge by perfect candlelight

That I didn't even know your name 
And now I cant imagine life without you here, my dear

You were smiling, the wind was blowing in your hair
I think it's been around 5 years,
And everything and nothing's changed
God, I wish that you were here
I know I should have called
I know I should have stayed
I should have said a lot of things
I hope it's not too late
Dear Isabelle, been thinkin' about you
Dear Isabelle, so lonely without you
I pretended I was doing well,
But without you, it's been hell, Dear Isabelle
Sometimes I'm not good with words,
But you knew that so I wrote this verse
In hopes that it would someday reach your ears
And I still wonder where you are ,
But it doesn't matter cause it's still too far
The lake has never looked so clear
I know I should have called
I know I should have stayed
I should have said a lot of things
I hope it's not too late
Dear Isabelle, been thinkin' about you
Dear Isabelle, so lonely without you
I pretended I was doing well,
But without you, it's been hell, Dear Isabelle
It's hard for me to write this,
Is it hard for you to know that I still care?
Would it kill you to forgive me?
Come on, Isabelle, I know that you're out there
I know I should have called
I know I should have stayed
I should have said a lot of things

I don't know your name, but I'll never get over you

I swear I hear your voice, but no I'm just hungover
I keep searchin' out through all of my pockets

But I guess it wasn't so bad

And the only thing that's bringing me in
Is the taste of your lips and the smell of your skin
You're the only thing that's worth breathing in

And my arms are getting tired from carrying my load
And my eyes are getting tired 'cause you turned the lights down low
And your heart's only beat speak under the shades
I'm hearing every word
Would you come fly away at the sunrise of day
Just like the morning broke

And the only thing that's bringing me in
Is the taste of your lips and the smell of your skin
You're the only thing that's worth breathing in

'Cause I will fight and I will beg
I just want to hear you say
That tonight will be alright if you would stay

It's times I feel like you don't know me anymore
And other times I think you know me best
I could love you better but I'd never wanna love you less

I'd never let you run away alone
Before you run too far away I think that I should let you know

Tried to make a living on her own
And then I came along and I took her from her mother
And now my heart is where she calls her home

Tried to give her everything I promised
But things don't always go just as we plan
We built our world and we tore it down
But I can't do this on my own because her heart is where I call my home

And who would've known that I'd ever get to see her in her down
And who would've thought that the two of us would ever give a vow
But just look at us now

Counting down the days, second guessing
It was full of clouds, my feet were cold
I packed my things and ran away
In fact didn't even really lost a day because her heart is where I call my home

So I guess I'll be honest with myself
I'm going down this road I never known
This road has turns and this road has hills
But I know I'm always gonna love her still because her heart is where I call my home

And who would've known that I'd ever get to see her in her down
And who would've thought that the two of us would ever give a vow

Said everything and things I still don't know

On me right from the start
They knew right away a lover was born
I'd be breakin' lovers' hearts

Girl, if I can't love you
A reel can make gumbo
A drunken man don't stumble
A seein'-eye dog can learn to lead the blind

A bee don't deal in honey
The Beatles ain't got no money
And watermelons grow on a grapevine

One day my papa told me
'Son, sit down, I gotta talk to you
Said, don't believe I can't understand
I've been through the same thing too?

Said, ?You think you're pretty hot stuff
And you dig every girl you see
But listen, son, settle for one
It'll save a lotta misery in the long run?

If that don't get it, sonny
There ain't no corpse in the dawn
There ain't no birds in a home
And you can get black from a turnip
If you squeeze and squeeze

Tears don't go with the blues
Chicken wear high-heeled shoes
And Old McDonald's farm didn't have no trees

I'm gonna take my papa's advice
Though it's gonna be hard to do
I'm gonna stop tryin' to prove a point
I'm gonna give myself to you, girl

If I fear you, baby
Ain't no leaps in a frog
There ain't no bumps on a log
And you can get black from a turnip

A egg don't got no yolk

To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Lee Greene,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweeter than the roses in May

There is nothing more I can say

Even though it's gonna hurt me once you're gone
But I can learn to live without you
Give me time and I can make it on my own

Lovin' you to me came easy
Now losin' you will change my life no doubt
In a way I'm glad it's over
In another way it turns me inside out

In a way I guess it's better
Even though there's nothin' good about goodbye
But I know I couldn't hold you
Now you've found the wings and you'll be groomed to fly

It's for sure I'm gonna miss you
But I guess that's what goodbye is all about
In a way I'm glad it's over
In another way it turns me inside out

On the one hand I know I'll be better off once you've gone
But I find a lot of heartaches on the other
And I can't say, I'll look forward to those nights, I'll be alone
And I wonder will there ever be another

Now losin' you will change my life no doubt

Flies so high and sings so good
And he brings to you what he sings to you

Well, he told me if I try, I could fly for you
And I wanna try for you 'cause

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I
Sing to you, love is what I bring to you

Lee Greenwood,"I stood before God, my family and friends
And vowed that I'd never love anyone else again
Only him

As pure a s my gown of white I stood by his side
And promised that I'd love you till the day I died
Lord, please forgive me even though I lied
'Cause you're the only one who knows just how hard I tried

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in my needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

When I add up all the countless nights I cried myself to sleep
And all the broken promises you somehow failed to keep
He can't blame me

He's the one who left me too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison
I tried to make a home
My love slowly died but the fire inside still burned
And the arms of a stranger was the only place left to turn

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in my needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands
","Ring on Her Finger, Time on Her Hands"
Lee Greenwood,"As her key unlocks the front door
 I reach out to find a light so she can see
 Then I wait to hear her story
 Why she stayed out late tonight & she tells me
 That it really wasn't her fault
 If she'd had her ways she'd have been home hours ago
 That's when her tears start to flowin'
 And she swears it's true but in my heart I know

 When I'm sure that I've convinced her
 That I believe her story then I turn away
 I don't let her know she's hurt me
 'Cause the words stick in my throat I want to say
 And I'm so afraid I'll lose her
 If she knew I knew the truth she just might go
 So I listen to her story
 Try to hide the hurt, but in my heart I know

 She's lying, there's not a word of truth in her crying
 And still I've got this awful urge to take her in my arms and hold her tight
 God, I know she's lying, a little more of me keeps on dying
 Oh how I wish that I could be the one that she's been lyin' with tonight
 Instead of me I'd rather be the one that she's been lyin' with tonight
 She's lying",She's Lying
Lee Greenwood,"It's over, I left the door unlocked again
But this time someone new walked in
While she was all alone

And he told her that there was much more life to see
Than she would ever see with me
Now she's going, going, gone

It's over, I never thought I'd see this day
When everything would walk away
That I depended on God, he'll hold her

To make sure she don't change her mind
I've lost her all the way this time
She's going, going, gone

I should have paid attention, there were many warning signs
But I just never thought she'd walk away
Here I stand in silence, just an echo of the words
I heard her say

She said, it's over and much too late to change her mind
I've lost her all the way this time
She's going, going, gone
","Going, Going, Gone"
Lee Greenwood,"Lonely lady living down the hall
 Don't you have any friends at all
 I never hear a knocking at your door
 Could it be you just don't try anymore?
 You've been hurt so seriously
 You act so cold but it's so easy to see
 You're a waste of real good love
 But you can't hide or run fast enough

 [Chorus]
 Somebody's gonna love you, no matter what you do
 Somebody's gonna find all the pieces of a broken heart
 Hidden inside of you
 Somebody's gonna touch you, it's just a matter of time
 And if you're ever gonna try love again, it might as well be mine

 I know exactly how a heartache feels
 It's gonna take a little time to heal
 Why must you hide away inside yourself
 You could mean so much to someone else
 Every night while you're sittin' at home
 You may be lonely but you're not alone
 There's a whole world full of people out there
 Waiting on someone like you to care

 [Chorus: until fade]",Somebody's Gonna Love You
Lee Greenwood,"Oh, oh, oh, oh

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

Fly, fly, so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky

Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings",The Wind Beneath My Wings

AND BULIDING DEFENCES
AROUND MY HERAT
I WAS ALONE IN THE DARK BUT

AND CHANGED MY MIND
JUST BEFORE I CROSSED THE LINE

YOU CAME TO ME

YOU TOOK MY SONG AND MADE IT RHYME
OH I FOUND LOVE IN TIME

DRIVING DOWN A TEXAS HIGHWAY
AS THE SUN ROSE IN MY EYES
I DIDN'T SEE THE NEED FOR ANYONE
NOW IT'S CLEAR THAT I WAS BLIND

AND I KNOW HOW MUCH I HURT MYSELF
BUT I FELT NO PAIN

I NEEDED SOMEONE
BUT I JUST KEPT RUNNING
SO FAR AWAY
IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE, BUT

NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE WITH ME
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I EVER FOUGHT IT
YOU MAKE IT SO EASY TO BE WITH YOU
YOU BROKE THROUGH, OH

And I owe you more than life now, more than ever

If I only knew then what I know now
You wouldn't be sayin' goodbye
But I let you down, I was never around
When you needed me there by your side
I took a perfect love & gave you a perfect heartache
I took a band of gold & made a 24-carat mistake
& turned it into...

CHORUS:
Fool's gold, and I was a fool 'cause I let you go
Fool's gold, yes I was a fool 'cause I didn't know
Too many times I just didn't try
Now all I hear is you sayin' goodbye
Starin' at an empty hand full of fool's gold

If I'd spent the time just holdin' you tight
& sharin' my feelings with you
Then you'd understand what's inside of this man
& you'd know what I'm goin' through
I know that I was wrong now that it's too late
I took a band of gold & made a 24-carat mistake
& turned it into...

Lee Greenwood,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song
Lee Greenwood,"Dawn is slowly breaking, our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting for Santa Claus to come
There's a present by the tree, stockings on the wall
Knowing you're in love with me is the greatest gift of all

The fire is slowly fading, chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting for children everywhere
Through the window I can see snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me is the greatest gift of all

Just before I go to sleep, I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas everyone is the song it sings
So I say a silent prayer for creatures great and small
Peace on earth, good will to men is the greatest gift of all

Give us a forecast snowy white.
Can't you hear the prayers
Of every childlike heart tonight?

Denver snow falling,
Somebody said it's four feet deep.
But it doesn't matter,
Give me the laughter;
I'm gonna choose to keep

Another tender Tennessee Christmas,
The only Christmas for me.
Where the love circles around us,
Like the gift around our tree.
Well I know there's more snow
Up in Colorado
Than my roof will ever see,
But a tender Tennessee Christmas
Is the only Christmas for me.

Every now and then,
I got a wanderin' urge to see
Maybe California,
Maybe tinsel town's for me.
There's a parade there;
We'd have it made there;
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve.
Sure sounds exciting,
Awfully inviting,
Still I think I'll gonna keep

Another tender Tennessee Christmas,
The only Christmas for me.
Where the love circles around us,
Like the gift around our tree.

It's a warm holiday;
It's the only place to be.

Hung around in the dark 
Only make a move or two 
I was just a young fool 

Never been to night school 
Didn't know enough to be cool

The way he stole my love was a crime 
In order to keep the peace 
Callin' out the police 
Find him 'for I lose my mind

The boy I love done gone and left me alone 
He's got a big bad record on the heartbreak radio
A complete investigation 
What's his destination 

Did he leave a trace at all 
Book him on suspicion 
Just look at my condition 
He left me here to take the fall

That boy can surely play it rough 
He oughta be in handcuffs 
Make him wear a ball and chain

Got me climbing the walls

Who'll be the first to let go

You know love just can't be found
When both feet are on the ground
So I'm tumbling heart over heels
After all somebody's gotta take the fall

Somewhere I read a wise man said
The fortune favors fools
I guess that explains how lucky I've
Been to find someone like you

I've always heard it's easier
Than falling off a log
So here and now, someway, somehow
Somebody's gotta take the fall

Somebody's gotta take the fall
Fall in love and risk it all

Your heart goes winging, where birds are singing
And in your heart there's no room for tears and sorrow
That sad tomorrow will never come to you

When you're in love, who cares if raindrops fall

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my condemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!

I saw below me a golden valley

Tellin truths and not your old lies
Seems to me that you care
And I know that you're runnin out of time

See ya can't get away
I'll be here forever and again

Do believe cause you know you cannot win

Spent most your life pretending not to be
The one you are but who you choose to see
Learned to survive in your fictitious world
Does what they think of you determine your worth?

If special's what you feel when you're with them
Taken away you feel 'less than' again
That's right

You gotta mean what you say
You gotta say what you mean
Tryin to please everyone
Sacrifice your own needs
Check in the mirror my friend
No lies will be told then
Pointin the finger again
You can't blame nobody but you

You gotta mean what you say
You gotta say what you mean
Tryin to please everyone
Sacrifice your own needs

No lies will be told then
Pointin the finger again
You can't blame nobody but you

There's a feeling inside
No you cannot change it right away
Gotta make a try
And with time it'll start to go away

I'll be here when you need
That one to sit and cry to
Cause I'm the you you forgot
The only one you know you cannot lie to

Bitter you'll be if you don't change your ways
When you hate you you hate everyone that day

Unleash this scared child that you've grown into
You cannot run for you can't hide from you
Can't hide from you

You gotta say what you mean

Sacrifice your own needs

You could have anyone
Could have anyone
But you're dancing here
With your arms around me
You could have it all
Like candy in the mall, yeah
You could have anyone
But you want
But you want me

Here come the golden boys
Lord knows I don't have their muscle
But what I lack in buff
I make up for with my hustle
Still everybody in the party's turnin wonderin
Why you're not here with someone else
And why you're here with me 'cause

[Chorus]

Sometimes it feels as if I'm dreamin
And if I'm dreamin
Please just let me be

[Chorus]

Lee Hazlewood,"Working on the railroad all day long
Working on the railroad sing this song
Sing about an old love I once knew
Sing about an old love maybe two
Working on the railroad
Working on the railroad
Work...work...working on the...railroad

I drove a hot steel in my time
I drink a lot of stuff they call moonshine
I got me a woman in every town
Working on the railroad, never settle down
Working on the railroad
Working on the railroad
Work...work...working on the...railroad

I draw my pay on a Saturday night
Go in town and had start a fight
Love me a woman a laugh and a joke
Working on the railroad, always a broke
Working on the railroad

Work...work...working on the... railroad

When I die and you bury me 
Alongside the tracks where I want to be

There ain't much you all 'body miss

Lee Hazlewood,"Trouble's little and it's lonesome. 
You won't find it on any map. 
But you can take three steps in any direction, and you're there. 
It's a place to be born. 
And it's a place to live. 
And it's a place to die and be forgotten. 
It's a town called Trouble. 
And Trouble is a lonesome town.

Lord, I'd like to leave this town
Lord, I'd like to leave this town
But I guess I'll hang around
But I guess I'll hang around
Trouble is a lonesome town
Trouble is a lonesome town

Lee Hazlewood,"Don Lowance, the man who plays guitar with me, and I
Were born in a small town
And we kinda think it was a different sort of small
Town because in our town, we had a dragon and people
Used to make up stories about the dragon

Sinse the stories were made up most of them started:
""Once upon a time, there was a very friendly dragon""
Except people didn't have any way of knowing that the
Dragon was friendly so they shot at him with guns and
Threw rocks at him. And the dragon being a sort of a
Poor sport, he ate a lot of those people up

Now, the dragon was messing up their senses, something
Fierce until one day he wandered into the store that
Sold spirits, and after making a fast brunch of the
Owner and four emplyees, he broke into this wine
Barrel
And that did it, from that day on the dragon was not
Only a friendly dragon, he was a happy friendly dragon

And now all he does is walk up and down the streets of
Our small town and tap people on their shoulders and
Ask them for a little change so he can buy some of that
Stuff that he likes better than people

Buddy can you spare a dime
For a little glass of wine
Buddy don't you pity me
Just one drink then I'll be
In a world all my own
The only place I call home
Where no hurt can get to me
And no one but me can see

Pretty flowers dance and sing
Laughter is a common thing
Where no hate has ever been
'Cause I won't let it in
By the warm purple flame
Every little grape calls my name
As it climbs on the fire
And makes the fire burn higher

Higher than it's ever been
Time and space mean nothing then
I fall about a mile or two
So pardon me if I ask you
Buddy can you spare a dime

And that's the story of the little town that Don and I
Was born in and our dragon, fairly strange story",First Street Blues
Lee Hazlewood,"Gather round me buddies
Hold your glasses high
And drink to a fool, a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye

Too late he found out he loves her
So much he wants to die
But drink to a fool, a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye

He needs her, he needs her so
He wonders why he let her go-oo-oo

She's found a new love, buddy
He's a lucky guy
So drink to the fool, 'cause I'm that fool who told his baby goodbye

He needs her, he needs her so
He wonders why he let her go-oo-oo

Hiding in shadows where we don't belong

We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong

Lee Hazlewood,"I know your leaving is to long overdue
For far to long I've had nothing new to show to you
Goodbye, dry eyes
I watched your plane fade off west of the moon
Than I felt so strange to walk away alone

No regrets, no tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again

The ours that were yours echo like empty rooms
But the thoughts we used to share
I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you
Not thinking you were gone
Than it felt so strange lay awake alone

Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place
Can't keep the ghosts away
But just beyond the darkest our
Just behind the dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone",No Regrets
Lee Hazlewood,"We rode on trains with hunger and pain but we didn't cry
Easy and me and some other guy
We hook some rides, stood side by side and watch cars go
By
Easy and me and some other guy

The wrongs and the rights we shared with each other
Then one day last week she kissed my cheek and whispered
Goodbye
Then Easy walked on with some other guy",Easy and Me
Lee Hazlewood,"One night Johnny sang the truth to me
On a northbound train from Nashville, Tennessee
Taught me all the letters, him alone
Saying freedom is where you think it is
But there ain't no train to Stockholm

Received your invitation to the war
I sent it back, so please don't send no more
I'd rather rot in some jail all alone
Saying freedom is where you think it is
But there ain't no train to Stockholm

If I have to ride this train a hundred years
And all I have to drink is my own tears
I'll not kill for you or on my own
Singing freedom is where you think it is
But there ain't no train to Stockholm

Lee Hazlewood,"Four years down and twenty one to blow
Ten thousand more breakfasts to go
Fourteen million seconds of living this way
And I guess it's time I started to pray them bars away

I wonder what you're doing since I don't see you none
Are you still a doin' all them rotten things we done
If you've got some spare time why don't you learn to pray
Maybe you can help me to pray them bars away

Remember old Red Barber we checked out last night
He still hold them eighteen years it serves the devil's
Right
He checked out in a casket he've been sixty two today
I heard that he went crazy tryin' to pray them bars away

Sometimes I miss the women and miss them all I do
Sometimes I miss the whiskey and I miss the good times
Too
Sometimes I miss my mama I saw her Christmas Day
But I never miss a time to pray them bars away

I'm told I should be thankful for everything I've got
So thank you for the rock walls and the brave bulls
Thanks a lot
And thank you for the good job and twenty cents a day
Thank you for the break time to pray them bars away",Pray Them Bars Away

In a cabin not so far
From a river wild, that's friendly as a child
To an old man and his guitar

Spends each lonely night just wishing
On some long forgotten star
Dreaming dreams until only dreams seem real
To an old man and his guitar

Remembering loves, remembering springs
So many loves, so many springs
But there was one he loved the best
She made him soon forget the rest

Now where the sting of times crewel scars
But all his songs aren't sung the best is yet to come

Is that your reflection on the wall?
I can show you this room and some others
If you came to see the house at all

Careful up the stairs, a few are missing

First step is the hardest one to master
Last one I'm not really sure is there

And I come back to hear it now and again
I can't say that I'm certain what you're after

Past the lantern, tiptoe in its glance
In the room the soft brown arms of shadow
This room the hardest one to pass

How much will you pay to live in the attic?
The shavings off your mind are the only rent
I left some would there if you thought you couldn't
Or if the shouldn't that you've bought has been spent

This house goes on sale ev'ry Wednesday morning
And taken off the market in the afternoon
You can buy a piece of it if you want to
It's been good for me if it's been good for you",The House Song
Lee Hazlewood,"I am the sea, you are the wind that comes me when by storm
I am the land, you are the tree I've loved since it was born
I am the sky that holds the stars and love but only one

You are the wind, the tree, the star, you are my little girl

Lee Hazlewood,"This town is a lonely town
Not the only town like-a this town
This town is a make-you town
Or a break-you-town and bring-you-down town

This town is a quiet town
For a riot town like this town
This town is a love-you town
And a shove-you-down and push-you-'round town

This town is an all-right town
For an uptight town like-a this town
This town, it's a use-you town
An abuse-you town until-you're-down town

This town is a losin' town
It's a miserable town
It's a nowhere town
And I am leavin' this town

It's bound to be downtown

I stand on a distant shore
The turning tide
Breathes all the mystery of you...

O my dreams
Are lost with the autumn leaves
That turn to gold
That fall in the memory of you...

Carry my voice on the wind
Over the waters that keep us apart

I weep for the drifting years
And for my soul
That longs for the comfort of you...

Lee Jung Shik,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Moved in across the ridge
She was every thing a young man could desire
Out there in the ranges
In secret we would meet
My heart ran as wild as desert fire

Like a burnin' sun beating down
She sparked a flame on virgin ground
If by chance a fire should start
No one could tame the burnin' heart

Well her father owned the station
Where I rode the boundary fences
And he made it clear for all the hands to see
That a man could easily wind up
On the wrong end of his shotgun
And his little girl was only seventeen

She sparked a flame on virgin ground
And if by chance a fire should start

And work boots on a backdoor step
Scones in the oven and preserves in jars
Talking prices at the sale yards

And sheep dogs bringing the mob around
It's she'll be right and having a go
It's good on ya mate and what do ya know?

A simple gathering of melody and rhyme
Written down and twicked a bit
Ink pen on manuscript
Little town Little song
Lookin' for somewhere to belong
Sat in a bureau drawer
Pulled out then performed
For a governor and mayor
A low clock scratched me down
Next mornin' we left town
And he was hummin' as we rode
And I wondered where we'd go
On and on round and round
Far and wide am I bound
I'm a gift I'm a drifter
Always wondering free
On and on like the wind
I am home I am friend
And you'll always be as close
As a whisper to me

Sang me to Jackie How
First time he ever shoved a hundred in a day
I rode the silver rails
I crossed the mountain trails
They sing my story from the cave to Morton Bay
And send me on my way
On and on round and round
Far and wide am I bound
I'm a gift I'm a drifter
Always wondering free
On and on like the wind
I am home, I am friend
And you'll always be as close
As a whisper to me

As Private Monroe gentle sang
I floated over no mans land
I've seen the tears
Of countless lonely sons
I've crossed the raging seas
Wound up in symphonies
Was there in victories
Been song on bended knees
Of just some notes and verse
Nothing more and nothing less
You find me at the stock camp
As their passin' out the rum
Out near where I'm from
On and on round and round
Far and wide am I bound
I'm a gift I'm a drifter
Always wondering free
On and on like the wind

At seven years of age,
You walked right up and kissed
My cheek and laughed and ran away.

And teased by all my friends,

Down by the river bend,
And we were high school sweethearts
When school came to an end.
But you said you had to travel on,
That Id find someone new,
And as we said goodbye I swore to you

Lee Kernaghan,"He's staring down the barrel
Of another desperate day
Pulls on his boots
He can't walk away

He's running on empty
He's knocked about and bent
But he'll still be standing
When the river runs again

Is the spirit in the rock?
Or pass the hat around
Is it freedom on the Wallaby?
Or a dusty patch of ground
Is it waltzing Matilda?
Or a hand upon your shoulder
Is this, the spirit of the bush?

She stares at empty cupboards
Just like the day before
It's been so long
She can't take it anymore

But she digs a little deeper
And somehow finds the strength
She keeps believeing
There will be better days ahead Chorus

Is the spirit in the rock?
Or pass the hat around
Is it freedom on the Wallaby?
Or a dusty patch of ground
Is it waltzing Matilda?
Or a hand upon your shoulder
Is this, the spirit of the bush?

Was it there when young Ned Kelly
Stood up for those oppressed

Or when the brave young ANZACS
Put their courage to the test

Or is it out there with the battler
When he gives it one last try

Through the darkest moments
You see the spirit shine

Is the spirit in the rock?
Or pass the hat around
Is it freedom on the Wallaby?
Or a dusty patch of ground
Is it waltzing Matilda?
Or a hand upon your shoulder
Is this, the spirit of the bush?

Lee Kernaghan,"I saw the ute
I heard the voice
I knew i had to make her mine
Shiny and red, on the show room floor
I scratched my name on the dotted line

I'm on a mission, the Grand Tradition
there's only one thing left to do
there's a clay pan, there's a big old mud hole
Gunna take my brand new baby right on through

Baptise the ute
Baptise the ute
You won't be satisfied until you do
Leave ya mark
Break it in
Take it to the edge and back again

When she's in my rig
She feels the rumble
She loves to ride in my machine
She runs her fingers, along the console
She says there's no where else she'd rather be

But I'm on a mission, Grand Tradition
And if i play my cards just right
The motors runnin
And things are hummin,
I reckon this could be my lucky night

Baptise the ute

You won't be satified until you do
Leave ya mark
Break it in
We'll take it to the edge and back again

Bugs on the bullbar
Fur on the side rails
Mud on the windscreen
Cause we'll baptise the ute

Well I'm on a mission, we have ignition
We gotta do what must be done
When the ceremony has been completed
We'll start her up and do it all again

Baptise the ute

You won't be satisfied until you do

Got to take her out and see what she can do

Lee Kernaghan,"I get the feeling 
When I cross the border ranges
The odyssey begins
To the floodlands in the distance
Take the path of least resistance
That draws me further in

And I feel so free
This country's got a hold on me
It wraps it's soul around me
Will not let me go

The planet spins a stoney desert in the twilight
The universe unfolds
And the desert shadows flicker
All around this dusty traveler
I close in by the fire

And I feel so free

It wraps it's soul around me

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I've come
To complicate the dead
Are you with me?
I've written out all my vows again

We're almost home
To see the silence break on New Year's Eve
We're only 17
So if love exists I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Just one more kiss
To soothe the pain exists
In a world of lies
Misery take my shame and life

And everything fails a violent death
The smile you gave
Visit me in hell tonight
And say, ""If love exists, I will fall?

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
Almost stop the earth

I'll wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth

So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love

I feel so alive
I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling

So alive, I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling
If love exists, I will fall

When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth

In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Lee Konitz,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Lee Konitz,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night
Lee Konitz,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Lee Konitz,"The song a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
The murmur of a brook at eventide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide
A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me

A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me",Stella by Starlight
Lee Konitz,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory
Lee Konitz,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Lee Konitz,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad

Lee Konitz,"I try to keep  you out of my heart
But somehow I find
Trying to keep you out of my heart
I'm out of my mind
I tell myself ""I'm through with you
And I'll having nothing more to do with you""
I stay away, but every day
I'm just foolin myself

Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it isn't so
I'm just foolin myself

And every time I pass
And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say
""How do you do, you fool
You're trowing your life away""
I'm acting gay
I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend
But in the end
I'm just fooling myself",Foolin' Myself
Lee Konitz,"I could show the world how to smile

Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Lee Konitz,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day

Lee Konitz,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And then it had to be with you

Soft as stars in April skies are,

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt

Lee Konitz,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

A prelude to a kiss

Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Lee Konitz,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Lee Konitz,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start

Lee Konitz,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Lee Lessack,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

That drowns the tender reed""
Some say, ""Love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed""

Some say, ""Love, it is a a hunger
An endless aching need""
I say, ""Love, it is a flower
And you it's only seed""

It's the heart that fears breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one, who won't be taken
Who can not seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Life's the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose

So day after day I stay locked up in my room.

But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.

I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,

I'm trying to disguise the way I feel
But I just can't hide it
People seem to know 
The lonliness will show
I'm thinking of my pride 
But breaking up inside

Here comes that rainy day feeling again
And soon my tears they will be falling like rain
It always seems to be a Monday
Left over memories of Sunday always spent with you
Before the clouds appeared and took away my sunshine

Will lose its desire for you

When you know that my whole life depends
On you (on you)

Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly

It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Lee Press-On & the Nails,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Lee Ranaldo,"I just saw a rainbow fall into the floor
Shattered into pieces, your eyes asked what for
These days I’m all alone out in the middle of the world
These days I’m trying to tell myself you’re just another girl

I can see the red door slamming on the stage
Chaos in the streets, these are the days of rage
These days are so uncertain satellites falling to the sea
These days its all a question of what matters to you and me

Watch me as I fall
Then scrape me off the wall
And take me home
See me as I am
Just half a man
Trying to get home

Explosions in the city, explosions deep in me
Someone in the crowd has me falling at her feet
These days are so uncommon flashing lights and siren’s calls
These days I’m trying hard to keep from falling off the wall

Its written in the sand
The life and death of man
As old as stone
Take me as I am
Take my hand
And take me home",Off the Wall

Men were standing over me
And a lot more with a whip

Lee Rocker,"One more night, the stars all in sight
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright
Lighting everything in sight
But tonight no light will shine on me

Oh, it's painful and it's sad I lost the only pal I had
I just couldn't be what she wanted me to be
I will turn my head up high to the dark and rolling sky
But tonight no light will shine on me

I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true
I had no idea what a woman in love could do

One more night I'll wait for the light
While the wind is blowing high above the tree
Well, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to let her go
But tonight no light will shine on me

I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true
I had no idea what a woman in love could do

One more night, the stars all in sight
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright
Lighting everything in sight
But tonight no light will shine on me
But tonight no light will shine on me

Lee Roy Parnell,"Monday morning six a.m.
Gonna be a hot one again
Put some coffee in my cup
Get in my Chevy and saddle up

And I roll, roll
Got another thousand miles to go
And I roll, roll
Driving down this old four-lane road

I can taste your kisses, see your face
And the faster I go, the longer it takes
And this lonely heart is a heavy load
And it's slowing me down
And there ain't no short way home

Make a stop for gasoline
Ain't got time to wash the window clean
Burning highway, burning tires
Burning oil and burning desire

And I roll, roll
Got another thousand miles to go
And I roll, roll
Driving down this old four-lane road

I can taste your kisses, see your face
And the faster I go, the longer it takes
And this lonely heart is a heavy load
And it's slowing me down
And there ain't no short way home

Lee Roy Parnell,"Woke up this morning and I knew I'd be late 
Somehow it came as no surprise 
I saw the way she was looking at me 
I saw no mercy in her eyes 

She gave me love without mercy 
Her arms don't want to let go 
Love without mercy 
Am I complaining? Mercy no 

I have no trouble sleeping at night 
And I've got a problem on my mind 
But she gives me something precious & sweet 

 
  
 

It solves that problem every time 

She gave me love without mercy 
Her arms don't want to let go 
Love without mercy 
Am I complaining? Mercy, no 

When I feel like this world wants no part of me 
She knows I need love and not sympathy 

Love without mercy 
Her arms don't want to let go 
Love without mercy 
Am I complaining? Mercy, no 

Love without mercy 
Her arms don't want to let go 
Love without mercy 
Am I complaining? Mercy, no

Lee Roy Parnell,"You walked in and found her with tears in her eyes
She couldn't tell you exactly why
There ain't nothing wrong but there ain't nothing right
Try to figure it out boy, you're wasting your time

All it takes is a tender moment
A loving word or the touch of your hand
All she needs is a tender moment
Let her know you'll always be her man
That's the kind of thing a woman understands

It's a fast lane world that we're living in
Sometimes love takes a little test bend
But it don't take much to straighten it out
A little affection's all I'm talking about

All it takes is a tender moment

A loving word or the touch of your hand
All she needs is a tender moment
Let her know you'll always be her man
That's the kind of thing a woman understands

Everyday she needs to hear you love her so
So take the time to let her know

It ain't a brand new house, it ain't diamond rings
Big bank accounts don't mean a thing
Still gonna need what money can't buy
Someone to hold her when she needs to cry

All it takes is a tender moment
A loving word or the touch of your hand
All she needs is a tender moment
Let her know you'll always be her man
That's the kind of thing a woman understands

Then the Angels dropped by and decided to crash
They big but they're friendly havin' a ball
Racin' their Harley's up and down the hall
Teachin' everyone the way to have fun
Singin' born to be wild at the top of their lungs

Sayin' y'all gotta turn down we can't get no sleep

feels to cry, cry, cry
Until your touch started lightin', me up just like the
Fourth of July

Better knock on wood
It never felt so good
I can't believe you're mine

Since I found you baby
I keep coming up aces every time
every card I play seems to fall in line
Guess it goes to show

And to give in to a losing streak you only have yourself

I'm Hunting for the truth
You are what I'm looking for
Please show me the way
Please show me the way
I'll do anything to be close to you
And I'll be anyone that you want

If you let me know
Where you run to
Where you go
All around the world
I will follow

Coz I'm looking for the real thing
I'm haunted by the truth

Sung a lullaby and stole the show from everyone

The ghost of our love, it's making me shiver
It's only small drops of pain,
But even the rain can turn into rivers
Thought I'd be safe, living behind this wall
But the pressures too much, and it's starting to fall

So how do I get over you
How do I survive living half the life that I knew
Oh how do I get over you?
When you take away
Everything I held to be true
I wonder if you feel it too, do you?

Everywhere that I turn, there's something there
Something to remind me
When I sleep it's alone, still I reach out
As if you're beside me
Tried to move on, tried to find something new
But everything that I did

So how do I get over you
How do I survive living half the life that I knew

When you take away
Everything I held to be true
I wonder if you feel it too, do you?

Seems like every place, every person we knew
Every sound every taste, reminds me of you
I thought this would be gone, but it's still so strong
I keep holding on, what else can I do?

So amazed at how pretty you are
I wonder what it is you're dreaming sometimes
Where your mind goes and just how far

I'll guess I'll ask you in the morning
Right before I pack my things and walk right out the door
I'll guess I'll ask you in the morning
I'll pretend we're still in love tonight 'cause we won't be anymore

In the morning, in the morning

Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

Lee Wiley,"Summer journeys
To Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares

I've a cozy little flat
In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan

Lee Wiley,"I'm recalling times when I was small, in light and free jubilee days,
Old folks praying everybody swaying,
Loudly, I chanted my praise.
How I sang about the Judgement morn,
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn.
In that sunny land of milk and honey,
I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day.
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey,
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away.",Hallelujah

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

And say I don't know what I am talking about.

To speak no word and to be not heard
It's maybe the price you pay to modern life

Where innocence is just a word away

Where you are trying to hide all your feelings inside
That's where is shadowland
Where you are hiding your tears and you're sleeping in fear
That's where is shadowland

You search for an answer in the bunch full of lies
And sometimes you see a fool in disguise
What is it good for? What does it mean to life?
A stupid shareware of dreams, a colorful nightmare till your dying day

This world reminds me of a land of fairy-tales

Where innocence is just a word away

Where you are trying to hide all your feelings inside

Where you are hiding your tears and you're sleeping in fear

Would you do the same thing for me?

I want you here all night long

Say it now
I got to know
Tell me that you love me

Now you see
I'm not tryin' to make a big fuss over this
But I'm just sayin', you need to let me know how you feel sometimes
Say it, it's not wrong, expressing yourself?
That's what wo-women like that, you know what I'm sayin'?
You know, you got to tap into your romantic side
Shoot, return the love, baby, return the love

I need to know, I want to know
I need to know, I want to know

And he's happy, there's no drama 
So you can save those hardy notes for the doctor

I'm lovin' him up

Have you ever been in a party, 
Droppin' your sexy and bottles 
Came flyin' in your direction? 
Turned around saw two kitty-cats fightin'? 
Tried to play the good Samaritan, 
Now your face is scratchin'. 
They're gettin' pretty, pretty, gettin' ? 
Someone call security bout to be an outbreak 
Stillettos comin' off ? 
When the cops break it down half the party's in my loff

So I'll be here waiting where we started

I tried but I couldn't fill Your shoes
I went my way 
I bought the lie that I was all grown up 
Didn't need You in my life
The winter left me cold and frozen 
Looking for the truth 
But searching for the sun 
I found the place where I met You

[Chorus]

It feels so good 
To be in Your arms
You never left me

Carry me on your back
Through the storm, Lord!
Carry me on your back
Through the storm, Lord!'

Breaking over the horizon
And I lift my eyes to see

The malicious deeds in mortal life
On what they now redeem
The baneful essence feeds
Growing strong, awaits release

Condemned, they watch it grow

Send shivers down my spine

A distant rumble roars
It rumbles cross the moors

Another town without you

Was it here, was it there?
Distorted thoughts but I don't care
Another town without you

A million miles away from home
And I'm sitting all alone
And I'm thinking about you

Keep you safe and sound from any harm.
I can't seem to function, from this far away.
And every little moment looks so dull,
Without your color in my day.

Oh it feels so good to hear you speak.

This is where I start to miss you, more than I can bear.
I hate this distance in between us, I don't think it's fair.
All my time spent wondering, how I stay true to you.
But you're not here, and now I fear,
I'll never get back to you.

Would have carried you, to anywhere you pleased,
Even if my limbs were broken, and my body was diseased.

I should have stayed.

'Cause I need to pick up my son in the morning

And there's just no time she's touching my stuff
Push and rewind, kush in the grind
Durrr, she's so fine, you could never mind her
I gotta go
Tomorrow there's a late session in the studio
She says no, you should stick around
We could have some fun I won't make a sound

Now she's got her ass up, girl, I need some headroom

See the pain of a heart laid bare
In the strain of a heart laid bare
Dream of death, presentiment
Under a tragic sky
I close my eyes and dream away
To another year in another time
