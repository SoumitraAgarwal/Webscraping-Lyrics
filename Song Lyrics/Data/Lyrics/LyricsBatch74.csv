[Chorus]
California, knows how to party
California, knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin! We keep it rockin!

[Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens,
Lean mean money-makin-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre putting it down for
Californ-I-a

[2Pac]
Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreaming
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
The life of a west side player where cowards die
And its all war
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballies (that's right, uh)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sactown
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Cali-love

[Chorus]
California (California) knows how to party
California, knows how to party (come on baby)
In the city (south-central) of L.A. (L.A.)
In the city of good ol' Watts (uh, that's right)
In the city, the city of Compton (yup, yup)
We keep it rocking! We keep it rocking! (yeah, yeah now make it shake, c'mon)

Shake it shake it baby (uh)

Steady long, steady long nigga

With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin up with funky ass shit like every single day
May I, kick a little something for the G's (yeah)
and, make a few ends as (yeah!) I breeze, through
Two in the mornin and the party's still jumpin
cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the living room gettin it on
and, they ain't leavin til six in the mornin (six in the mornin)
So what you wanna do, sheeeit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what) we don't love them hoes, yeah!
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]

Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this types of shit, happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
who listens, to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
and get to mackin to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
beeeitch, I'm just

Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice
Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]

Later on that day
My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'
And I'll be
 
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice

Dr. Dre,"Wake up, jumped out my bed 
Hung in a 2 man cell wit my homie Lil 1/2 Dead 
Murder was the case that they gave me 
Dear God, I wonder can you save me 
I'm only 18, so I'm a young buck 
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck 
But that's the life of a G, I guess 
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest 
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker 
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga 
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs 
Getting a rep as a young hog 
It ain't nothing like the street life 
Betta be strapped wit yo clip, 'cause ain't no fist fight 
So I guess I gots ta handle mine 
Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time 

[Chorus]
Lil' ghetto boy 
Playing in the ghetto streets 
What'cha gonna do when you grow up 
And have to face responsibility 

Now, I'm 'trolling the dove, sitting on swoll 
27 years old, off on parole, stroll 
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money 
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street 
Things done changed but it's alright 
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right 
But it ain't no thing to me 
Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G. 
The little homies from the hood wit grip 
are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip 
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do 
Didn't know we had a 22 
Straight sitting behind his back 
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps 
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands 
I didn't understand 
How a nigga so young could bust a cap 
I use to be the same way back 
I guess that's what I get (for what) 
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread 

Lil' ghetto boy 
Playing in the ghetto streets 
What'cha gonna do when you grow up 
And have to face responsibility 

Something for the real OG's to get wit 
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play 
Like every single day, really doe 
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie 
No need to be uncalm if you pack right 
And learning just enough to keep your sack right 
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo' 
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo' 
Seven young G's put they serve down 
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now 
Not thinking about what's really going on 
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone 
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me 
But now I'm back at the pound 
And we expose ways for the youth to survive 
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right 
So make all them ends you can make 
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out 
So ain't no need for your mama to trip 
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip 

Lil' ghetto boy 
Playing in the ghetto streets 
What'cha gonna do when you grow up 
And have to face responsibility",Lil Ghetto Boy (Ft Snoop Doggy Dogg & Dat Nigga Daz)
Dr. Dre,"[Dr. Dre]
Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind-state
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck buck, Lights out
Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggas get hauled off

*Barrel one
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh
*Barrel two
Shoots your fucking heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool its your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitating I ain't hesitating
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
Its like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler
Cause I'm a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma
Cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker
(yeah what's up)
It feels like I'm busting a nut
When I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm giving dirt naps
Coming with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
Cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfucking nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways ^in a fucked up maze^
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your living
I'm the unforgiving
Psycho driving
Murderer
Its authentic
Don't panic
I can't stand it
God Damn it
Schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit em with a brick
And I'm dancing

[RBX]
Mass Murderer, Natural Born Killla,
And I don't want to die
I don't want to DIE
I don't want to
I don't wanna die!

[Ice Cube]
I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of Sirens
Terrified screams from the streams
Of Strychnine
Dumping on any motherfucker trying to trick mine
Cause motherfuckers want to violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain
Migraine
Headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'm a pull a fuckin Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana

[Dr. Dre]
Tic Toc
Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keeping niggas in order
Making there live shorter
Ready to slaughter
Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter
Or a dime
Mushroom's got my mind
Hallucination
Ain't no debating
I'm creating an escape
Route to be out without a doubt
Scot Free, so don't even think about trying to stop me
Cause I can't wait
I'm out the gate
On the for realla
A thrilla
Or a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]
They call me dadda
6 million ways to murder
Choose one
Lose one soul
Bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggas going bump in the night",Natural Born Killaz (Ft Ice Cube)
Dr. Dre,"Yes, it is I says me
And all who agree
Are more than three
Cause they are we
(laughter) 
Yes, yo!, I'm in the house now for sure 
Because I want to talk about the hearts of men 
Who knows what evil lurks within them 
But lets take a travel down the blindside 
And see what we find on this
Path 
Called
 
Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit 
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits 
The gangsta type, what I recites kinda lethal 
Niggaz know, the flow that I kick, there's no refill 
I'm murderin' niggaz, Yo, and maybe because of the tone 
I kicks my grip, the mic and kick shit 
Niggaz can't fuck with 
So remember I go hardcore, and slam 
Nuff respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme 
So any nigga that claim they bossin 
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson 
Take a walk through the hood, and we up to no good 
Slangin' on things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten so 
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in 
But ain't no set-tripppin 
Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia 
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin ya 
Ain't nathin' but a buster 
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumpin slugs in motherfuckers 
Now you know you're outdone 
Feel the shotgun, Korrupt inmate cell block one 

No prevention from this mention of sorts 
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts 
No extensions, all attempts are to fail 
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille 
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic 
When I kick up wicked raps 
That the grain will hit the scratch 
With treachery, my literary form will blast 
And totally surpass the norm 
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms 
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms 
In this dimension, I'm the presenter 
And the inventor, and the tormentor 
Deranged, like the hillside strangler 
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler 
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete 
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite 
So what you want to do 
The narrator RBX, cell block two 

Rage, lyrical murderer 
Stranded on Death Row 
And now I'm servin' a lifetime sentence 
There'll be no repentance 
Since it's the life that I choose to lead 
I plead guilty 
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may 
It's just another clip into my AK 
Buck em down with my underground tactics 
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress 
Bed frame there's another dead pain 
Layin' lain with the shame, who's to blame 
Me, the lady of Rage 
On when I'm comin' from the D-E-A-T-Hin 
Are-O-W takin', no shit 
So flip and you're bound to get dropped 
It's one eight seven on motherfuckers don't stop 
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate 
It's Rage, from cell block eight 

And yo steppin' through the fog 
And creepin' through the smog 
It's the number one nigga from the hood 
Doggy Dogg 
Makin' videos, now I stay in Hollywood 
Bustin' raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood 
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga 
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga 
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got 
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a quick one servin' my rocks 
And I'm still, servin' for mines, peace 
To my motherfuckin' homies doin time 
In the pen and the county jail 
Mobbin' with your blues on, mad as hell 
And you say yeah fuck the police 
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace 
And it's drivin' the cops crazy 
But ain't nuttin' but a black thing bay-bee, uhhh 
No I'm not flaggin', but I'm just saggin' 
I betcha don't want to see the D-O double G 
And you can't see, the D-are to the E 
Or my motherfuckin' homey D.O.C. 
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin' DJ 
That's my homey and we call him Warren G 
Yeah, and you don't stop 
Doggy Dogg break em down with the motherfuckin' DoggPound 
That's the only way we'll beat em man 
We gotta smoke em, then choke em 
Like the motherfuckin' peter man 
It's like three and to the two 
And two and to the one 
Cell block four peace Doggy Dogg's done 

Yo, now you know the path I'm on 
You think you're strong, see if you can travel on 
Cause only the weak, will try to speak 
Those who are quiet, will always cause riots 
There's three types of people in the world 
Those who don't know what happened 
Those who wonder what happened 
And people like us from the streets that make things happen!","Stranded on Death Row (Ft Bushwick, Kupurt & RBX)"
Dr. Dre,"1, 2, 3 and to the 4
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
(Cause you know we're about to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together: now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'mma let em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man -- and at the same time burning her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
(Yeah) and that's realer than ""Real-Deal"" Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know: I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope: take a toke but don't choke!
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do

It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh

And who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill, til the next episode

Falling back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P
D O double-G Y, D O double-G, ya see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah!) So Dre (Whattup Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break em off something (Hell yeah!)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton!)

Is where it takes place so, when asked, your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynchin'
Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfucking homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight trippin
And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., ""No One Can Do it Better""","Nuthin But a ""G"" Thang"
Dr. Dre,"You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'
Ya know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya haven't learnt
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (why?)
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now
Tell me what's going on
It make me want to holler, 'cause my dollars come in ozones
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfucking hoes
Seaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint
You'se a flea and I'm the big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfucking paws

Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten 
See my homey Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Life Savors
Ain't that something, talk shit and I'm dumping
I had your whole fucking block bumping
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fucking menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and popping
All I see is green, so there ain't no stopping
I want to see some panties dropping
I'm coming from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
 Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishing out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catching slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be sticking and moving
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head hunting
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murdering with rhymes packing Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fucking with a hog
You can't do me, I'm going out looney like O-Dog

Diggity Daz out of the motherfucking cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Till I die I'm still screaming that (bitches ain't shit)
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about 
The city where I'm from, dumb diddy dumb

I'm the one who needs no introduction
'Cause I'm the world class doctor

I can heal all your ills
And give you extreme delight
But only if you allow me
To turn off the lights

Before you turn off the lights
Let's get one thing understood
If you plan to make love to me
You've got to do it good
'Cause I'm a hell of a woman
And for me it takes a hell of man
So don't you dare turn off the lights
Unless this you understand

Yes, my name is Shakespeare
A world class poet
So kick back and relax yourself baby
Let me pour you a glass of Moet
Darkness will be your blessing
As I bring you extreme delight
But first you must allow me, Shakespeare
To turn off the lights click

Don't turn off the lights
Unless you'll love me right
You hear what I'm saying
'Cause boy I'm not playing
Don't turn off the light
Unless you plan on staying

And of course, I'm DJ Yella
The mixologist of the crew
And I would just love
To mix bodies with you
Your lips I would kiss
Your body I would hold tight
But only if you allow me
Check this out
To turn off the lights

Like a male exotic dancer for you I'd dance
With nothing but a g-string on my hip
Your kiss and touch I'd slowly collect
For they'd be my tip
There's parts of your body I'd slowly kiss
And others I'd gently bite

You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Y'all starting to creep in, everyday its so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say its wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep
When I wrote this,
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breath new life in me
I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me it'll enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon' hug me
But I'm out of options there's nothing else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long

I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle
You come to me with ideas
You say there just pieces so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and its almost like your begging for my help
Like I'm your leader
Your supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more,
I demand you remember who you are
It was you, who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake

I'm about to lose my mind

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said they was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fagots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little crack a jack beat making wack ass backwards producers,
I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they scream Dre don't leave us like that man 'cause

And I'm just lookin' at it all
I'll be right here in Los Angeles
Lookin' like a villain layin' low
Nothin' I can do but pack it all up
Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love
Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight
Actin' a fool and feelin' alive
I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault
Only type of livin' I know

See if it was you you would've killed yourself by now
It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this
And they ask me how I do it
Mothafucka just take a look around

Best believe I'm in the buildin'
I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that but uh
No, no don't mention me at all
Yeah comin' live and direct
And I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh
Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin'
I thought it was all good
But now you mothafuckas crossed the line
Kinda pissin' me off
All the fans and all the fame, and though I gave everything to this game
They still complain
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?
There's so much fuckin' pressure
It's so much pressure
And it's all in a day's work

Work, hard
Workin' so hard
24/7, 3-6-5
365, hard work
It's all in a day's work

My whole life all I ever thought about was grindin'
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus
And that was back when I felt like rappers was true mothafuckin' riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster man
Shit I was still sayin', ""Fuck the police""
Born and raised in the belly of the beast
I had a dream that we was at peace
But I was so wrong so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV talks about pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton sick and tired
Some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate
These bitches thinkin' fame first
I can't knock the hustle, it's all in a day's work
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse
They just thirst

Hard times
I'm on my grind, fuck the part-time
Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line
I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine
It's becoming the only feeling I know
Only type of livin' I know

Gonna go to work
We gotta work
Let's get back to work
On the grind, back to work

Let's work
Rich as fuck, but, guess what, I'm back to work
Overseas, back home, no time to sleep, I'm back to work
So many people that I love, they want my time but I got to work
Some of my friends don't understand, shit, I got to work
Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like, ""Fuck that I gotta work""

Maybe cause I'm a bastard
Or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally
Still tryna figure out, why the fuck I'm full of rage

But I'm a product of the system raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid (whoa)
Just a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents

Gonna fuck around and drown in the specifics
Always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk

Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin' up with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking about no rapping, I was drinking for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No releasing me, I got the beast in me
I gotta holla, keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer

All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body

Probably got fucked up tryna park his tour bus
Not knowing what's what
Or who's who, living in the L.A county zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (boom, boom, boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)
That's when I realized, banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga this is life in my aquarium

New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable
And all I hear is my girl in my ear
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie
I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie
What it came to be, would have never believed, living the life I lived in C-P-T

Dope dealers over tipping and bitches stripping
And any minute niggas start tripping and start shooting shit

Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now it's ""Fuck the Police"" all up in the club
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit
And was like ""What up cuz? Let me show you what this chronic like""
Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in (woo!)

You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter
I'm going in, already got an arm and head
And whoever said word are just words
Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck

And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it

You'll be runnin' outta luck like that
What I mean by that is
Why your name always in these rental records
Spendin' rent money gettin' that bottle service into your section
You leased your car, leased your house, leased your spouse
No she leavin' if you run outta paper
And might be smashin' your neighbor
I know you think you're a star cause followers clickin'
Guess your ambition is to keep up with social tradition
Like sneaker shoppin' summer you niggas are fuckin' sickenin'
Cause you'll take your soul out, just so you can fit in

Simple pleasures, rockstar living
Drugs and mansions, hit the ceiling
Cars expensive, blow this action
True revealing

Cuz, fuck wrong with these niggas
These labels always ask me to do a song with these niggas
Doc, I think its time for you to open up the pharmacy nigga
And change this fuckin' music shit my nigga, you should consider
Nah, I'll be doin' me lokin, keepin' these bad bitches open
And keeping them wet yep, see cause Long Beach right by that ocean
Sippin' that gin and juice my nigga, yep I'm still on that potion
All these random niggas fake as fuck and I'm stil gettin' noticed
God damn man, how we s'posed to handle this shit, cuh
Everything we done built these niggas dismantled this shit, cuh
We gotta get back to that real, that's on the dub
Another lesson from your uncle Snoop, what what what?

I'm just stating the facts
Don't get no realer than that
Satisfiction, attention, listen, play your position, player
Shouldn't be too hard my nigga
Supposed to be like a lay up
It shouldn't be so hard to be yourself
My nigga wake up
Stay up, pay up, straight up, cake up
Thats what I'm made of, high? Yup
My life is all authentic, that's why I'm goin' way up

Real shit, y'all counterfeit, y'all niggas bad business
That's why the game all fucked up
Fuck Glocks, I'm all about Fort Knox, nigga
Ride through your neighborhood
Throwin' money out the window like what!
You about the dollar
(No, no, nothin' bout it)
Yo poor life been without it
My life in the spotlight
Oh no no no, I ain't even got to talk about it, talk about it
Hol' up if you really bout it
Tell these motherfuckers we don't even wanna talk about it, what

I don't know everything
But one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)
Is one day I'ma have everything
It was all a dream
I want it all

I just bought California
Them other states ain't far behind it either
I remember selling instrumentals off a beeper
Millionaire before the headphones or the speakers
I was getting money 'fore the internet
Still got Eminem checks I ain't opened yet
MVP shit, this is where the trophies at
D-R-E, this is where the dope is at
The world ain't enough, I want it all
God dammit, I'm too old, I forgot I got it all
But Andre young enough to still get involved
And Andre still young enough to say fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck you, and you in the corner too
If you wanna beef, make sure that that's somethin' you wanna do
There's some missin' people that felt that way too

I don't know everything
But one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)
Is one day I'ma have everything
It was all a dream
I want it all

What the fuck was y'all thinking?
You let the wrong young nigga link with a legend
'Lotta new niggas talking crazy on the records
I'm the only king here, you can tell 'em that I said it
I'm the black Eminem, I'm the humbler 50
I'm D.O.C., who do it better? Nobody fuckin' with me
I murder rappers everyday, til' police come and get me
And Dre just come and bail me out and then we hit the studio
Ain't no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas
Emotional every song, deserve to have breast niggas
Crying bout my old girl, but ain't how I left niggas
Try and get my Xbox, Red Ring of Death niggas
I'm Kanye raising the diamond on the day of his chainin'
If this was you, your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraising
I'm just talking reckless, I'm just off the record
But I mean it, kept my blessings
We was dreaming, now we close enough to see it

I don't know everything
But one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)
Is one day I'ma have everything
It was all a dream
I want it all

Listen
I've been tryna get it all
I'm just in this bitch, I'ma show em how to get involved
Yeah I want everything, yeah I want everything

Dr. Dre,"I just need y'all to try to bear with me for a minute
While I talk about the pages of my diary
Listen up

I remember when I got started my intention was to win
But a lot of shit changed since then
Some old friends became enemies in the quest of victory
But I made a vow, never let this shit get to me
I let it pass, so I consider that part of my history
And I'm strong, financially, physically
Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level
And don't forget that I came from the ghetto
Sold a new house for my moms, that's special
I let you going shopping till your feet get tired
Then a new Benz just for you to ride in
When I didn't have it, you provided
Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise
And my house got a view of the city like a highrise
I'm just talking to my diary, I'm just talking to my diary

When I open up my book I think about the world later
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind
I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks
I remember how it used to be
Now my money like NASDAQ, my checks you can cash that
I remember how it used to be

I used to be a starving artist so I would never starve an artist
This is my passion, it's where my heart is
It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed
Like the nigga I started with
I know Eazy can see me now, looking down through the clouds
And regardless, I know my nigga still proud
It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks
We used to sit back, laugh and joke
Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters
You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing
Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella
Damn, I miss that
Shit, a nigga having flashbacks

When I open up my book I think about the world later
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind
I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high

Dr. Elmo,"Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe
She'd been drinking too much eggnog
And we begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication, and she
Staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas morning
At the scene of the attack
She had hoof-prints on her forehead
And incriminating Claus marks on her back

Now we're all so proud of grandpa
He's been taking this so well
See him in there watching football
Drinking root beer and
Playing cards with Cousin Mel
It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts
Or send them back?
Send them back

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And the blue and silver candles
That would just have matched
The hair on grandma's wig
I've warned all my
Friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh
And plays with elves",Grandma Got Run over by a Reindeer

I thought I had it made

Moving closer and she kissed my neck

That's when I knew that I was in with a chance
Records were a playing and she asked for a dance
They played
I thought I had it made

We were a swinging to the moody blues
Looked into my eyes I thought I blew a fuse
Music stopped playing the lights went out
Dropped my drink when I heard them shout

Don't time fly when you're loving and laughing
I've said goodbye so many times
the situation ain't all that new.
Optimism's my best defense,
I'll get through without you.
 
When I give my heart again,
I know it's gonna last forever.
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever.
I won't be that dumb again, 
I know it's gotta last forever.
When I fall in love again,
I know it's gonna last forever.
 
Baby Jane, I've said all I want to say.
Go your own way, don't think twice about me.
'Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own.
So long darling, I'll miss you, believe me.
The lesson learned was so hard to swallow,
but I know that I'll survive
I'm gonna take a good look at myself and cry. 
 
When I give my heart again,
I know it's gonna last forever.
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever.
I won't be that dumb again, 
I know it's gotta last forever.
When I fall in love again,
I know it's gonna last forever.

Winding you up with them false alibis
No use you believing everything that people say

That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes 
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards 
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars 
It's as common as something that nobody knows 
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes 
Up the hill in the back of her house

Dr. Hook,"I was seventeen years old that day
I was trying to find a woman for my birthday
So I made up my mind, and I didn't waste no time
And I took my daddy's Caddy down the freeway

Had a pocketful of bait, it was gettin' kinda late
It was bumper next to bumper on the highway
Sittin' jammed up tight, looked over to my right
There was a hitchhikin' honey goin' my way

About four years older than me
Biggest dang woman that I ever did see
But that sure didn't seem to matter
She made me so crazy, that I threw my love at her

And I scored
When I saw that pretty thumb, I motioned her to come
And she smiled and looked at me a little sideways
I said ""Come on jump inside, we'll take a little ride""

And she said ""Awright little man, let's go to my place""
About four years older than me
Biggest dang woman that I ever did see
But that sure didn't seem to matter

She made me so crazy, that I threw my love at her
And I scored
But that was long ago, now there's lots of things I know
And there's been a lot of parties wasn't bad

I've learned a lot since then, but I still remember when
I got the best piece of cake I ever had

Dr. Hook,"(Shel Silverstein)

I used to be a prancer a one-eyed song and dancer
But eyes for true romance I didn't even try
I'd get 'em and forget 'em
But I never could stay with 'em
'Cause I thought my well of love had done run dry

But now it's bubblin' up
I feel it bubblin' up
And you can't hold down this true love
No matter what you do
Because it's bubblin' up
(you can hear it baby)
It's bubblin' up
And it'll soon be bubblin' over just for you
(Get that look off your face!)

I knew that when I met you
You love me and I let you
But I'd gladly bet you that it wouldn't last too long
But I had no way of knowing that this thing would keep on growin'
And now the feeling still is going strong

And yes it's bubblin' up
It's bubble ubblin' up
And you can't hold down this true love
No matter what you do
Because it's bubblin' up
(Surprise)
Bubble ubblin' up
And it'll soon be bubblin' over just for you

Dr. Hook,"Everybody must be on drugs, in this town
Or maybe there's a strange new bug that's been going round
'Cause people are all smiling and waving as I go by
Everybody loves me but I don't know why

It used to be a kind face was a rarity
But now I got friends coming out both ends just to visit me
But it don't make sense 'cause my confidence has been destroyed
Everybody loves me but I'm paranoid

What ever happened to the cold cruel world I used to understand
When every road was paved with wet cement
Back when if I was hanging off a cliff you'd be walking on my hands
Somebody please tell me where all the good times went whooo

Every time I needed something, no-one'd ever give me nothing, it'd never fail
I had to sit right down and write myself a letter just to get mail
But now my ears are singing from the damn ding-a-linging of the telephone
Everybody loves me but I'm comin' home

Neil Diamond sings for diamonds

And here's ole rhinestone me

Well I hear that Alice Cooper's got a foxy chick

To wipe off his snake, and keep him rich

And Elton John's got two fine ladies

And Doctor John's got three

And I'm still seein' them same old sleezoes, that I used to see


Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me

Yeah everybody's makin' it big but me

I've got charisma

And personality

Oh how come everybody's makin' it big but me?


(What's wrong with that?)

(I don't see nothing wrong with it Ray)


Well I paint my face with glitter

Just like Bowie does

And I wear the same mascara

That Mick Jagger does

And I even put some lipstick on

But that just hurt my dad and mom

And then here's John the drummer on the drums
(Where the hell is John?)

Waaaaaaa
(Stop screaming your messing with my rhythm hehehehe)
OK now, this is the way you do it, first you take your hand put it on your elbow

(I got it)
Then you take your knee and you put it up there too
(Oh wait a minute)
Then you take your head and put it down between your knee

(I can't do that)
And when you feel it, then you flap your ears and float on up here with me

Get on up off the floor (I can't that's my problem I can't get up)
That's alright, alright now I want you to do something (I'll do anything)
I want you to raise your right foot (OK)

Now you've got it, now get up, I mean get down
(He he he he he I ain't got it)
I'm gonna get on up here myself, look at me taking off
(You're the only one that can do it)

But before I leave I'd like to say that there is an easier way to do this
(That's a relief)
Now if you can possibly manage, get one of your ankles on the floor
(Wait a minute)

Just one of them
(Wait a minute)
Get down on the floor....

Until you can reach over with your elbow....

On the way to the bottom I met an old friend of mine
He said ""Buddy, I do believe this is the end of the line""
I said ""The end of the line? Shoot, come on and have another round
And if we're headin' for the bottom we still got a long way down""

On the way to the bottom we make a lot of stops
And we'd meet a lot of fools bustin' their hopes on the way to the top
Pass me another bottle and turn down the lights
Forget about tomorrow, babe we're gonna rumble tonight
I'll wear my low heeled boots you'll wear your taffeta gown
And if we're heading for the bottom we'll go laughing all the way down

On the way to the bottom I met an ol' girl of mine
She said ""Honey, I'm scared, won't you love me one more time?""
I said ""One more time? Shoot, about a million more
We had a whole lotta loving and a whole lot more in store""

On the way to the bottom we make a lot of stops
And we'd meet a lot of fools bustin' their hopes on the way to the top
Pass me another bottle and turn down the lights

The tiger, he looked out of his cage and smiled
He said come here boy, I want to talk to you a while
He said I once was running wild and free just the same as you
But it's one step from the jungle to the zoo

Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws, cut your hair, make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo

He said son when you go running through the grass
You bet look out for all the hidden traps
They'll feed you sweets and goodies 'til you're too fat to move
Then its one step from the jungle to the zoo

Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws, yank your fangs, make a pussy cat out of you

I guess the dance is over now
So you just curtsey and I'll bow
And ask the band to play us Auld Lang Syne

Then I'll just take what's left of me
Right back to where it used to be
And you'll go sail your magic carpet, far across the sky

I wish I could have made it
More like the movies for you
Some pretty Technicolor way it's never been
I'm sorry when I kissed you
You only heard me whisper
You never got to hear those violins
Did you girl?
No you never got to hear those violins, no

The castles that you built so high
Were just too steep for me to climb
And I guess these dirty streets of mine
Were just too rough for you

I wish I could've helped you see
Just one of your sweet childhood dreams
But though I tried I could not make not one of them come true

And I wish I could have made it
More like the movies for you
Some pretty Technicolor way it's never been
I'm sorry when I kissed you
You only heard me whisper

Oh and I know, if I change the station I'll get the same song
Hope it ain't on the top too long

'Cause I really couldn't take it but they kept on playin' it
It's too unhappy and too close to home
I don't want to hear it but the singer keeps singin' that song

I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life, but you wouldn't stay
And I hope you will return it to me someday
I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life but you threw it away
And I hope you will return it to me someday

Some days I just sit around and kind of dream and watch the rain
Or I'll pick up some ol' magazine of yours that I forgot to throw away
Then I'll sleep a little or walk the floor, I'll smoke a lot more than I did before
I'll call somebody I used to know, just to try to stay away from that radio

'Cause I really can't take it when they keep on playin' it
It's so unhappy and so close to home
I don't want to hear it but the singer keeps singin' that song

I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life, but you wouldn't stay
And I hope you will return it to me someday
I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life but you threw it away
And I hope you will return it to me someday

I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life but you threw it away.....

Sal from the valley loved Al from the alley and they lived in harmony
Sally played acoustic and Al, he played electric and they both took turns on lead
They sang it for their friends, again and again of the places they had been
But their favourite song of all was called up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Then into the valley came a girl from the galleys, with a strange and smilin' face
Al played acoustic and Sally played electric, and the gal played a hell of a bass
And when they sang their harmonies, the lady dipped right in
She soon moved in and lived with them up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Now Al from the alley is gone from the valley, a sadder but wiser man
And Sally from the valley and the gal from the galleys they live in mortal sin
Sal plays acoustic and the gal plays electric and sometimes they hold hands
Late at night you can hear them playing, up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Hot lickin' and finger pickin'
Say farewell for me

Dr. Hook,"Just a little ol' boy about twelve years old, working on my daddy's farm
Gotta help him build an ol' chicken coop, gotta help him paint the barn

Son let the loose end drag

Papa just smiled and looked at me and said

When I got to be a man I started makin' plans to get me all the love that I can
I was sitting in a bar getting pretty far with a honey on my right hand
When up stepped a stud he was looking for blood 'cause the lady didn't come in stag
When you're caught in the middle you can bet your life that it'll be ""Honey let the loose end drag""

Honey let the loose end drag
Honey let the loose end drag
When you're caught in the middle you can bet your life that it'll be
Honey let the loose end drag

Now my life is almost done every day I tell my son, the words my daddy handed down to me
You gotta hang on very tight to the things you know are right, let the fly-by-night things be
When the Devil calls your name and he says he won the game, and you know there ain't no turning back
When he says you're gonna die, you just spit right in his eye, and don't let the loose end drag

I ain't gonna let the loose end drag

Dr. Hook,"I was sittin' all alone
Watching people get it on with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor
Turning, moving back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me
I looked up, what did I see?

Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you
I wanna move with you sexy eyes

I got up and took your hand
And we both began to dance to the music
Ooh, your magic cast a spell
It didn't take long till we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me
This is how it's gonna be

Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you

Dr. Hook,"Sleeping late, sleeping late

Whenever I sleep late you know I can dream
Some of the strangest things that you've ever seen
I could never tell you the things that I do in my head
Leaving nothing unsaid, sleeping late in my bed

Sleeping late, sleeping late

Sometimes I'm embarrassed by devious thoughts
When I'm undercover let me never get caught
Crazy notions begin with that old devil grin on my face
We're such a disgrace, me and my pillow-case

Sleeping late, sleeping late
Sleeping late, sleeping late

The blissful state of sleeping late has been known to compensate
And sometimes even stimulate
I for one appreciate, sleeping late
Ain't it great sleeping late

Sleeping late, sleeping late

Live and in colour, my wildest of dreams
The best ones are re-runs if you know what I mean
I don't believe I can wait for that clock to stop ringing in my ear
It's so lovely here, I may sleep for a year

Dr. Hook,"I met him in Seattle, he was gettin' down on a bottle
Telling lies in the Blue Moon Bar
His face was hard and travelled, and as the wine unravelled
I saw a man who could laugh about his scars

He said, I got shanghaied in Vegas by a painted woman
I got hog-tied by a hustler in Ohio
I got derailed by a dancer down in Dallas
Oh Lord, he said, women gonna be the death of me but what a way to go

He said a girl named Nancy, once tickled his fancy
And backed it up with a fifty dollar smile
He laughed when he remembered, the pain of sweet surrender
But heartaches never seemed to cramp his style

He said, I got tongue-tied by a teacher in Tallahassee
I got french-fried by a waitress in Idaho
I got way-laid by a widow in Wyoming
Oh Lord, he said, women gonna be the death of me but what a way to go

Stop her mama, she's starting to speak
I'm afraid she might talk me away
Help me mama, I'm getting weak
'Cause I've been through this before and I can't take anymore
Mama please make her go away

Mama, she's getting so close I'm afraid
Mama she's got me feeling that same old way

Help me mama she's touching my heart
And I just can't keep her away
Stop her mama I can't let it start

If nobody minds, I'm gonna let my mind slip away

I don't want to see you cry
Your crying always changes my mind
And we know well
It's livin' hell
Pretending our love hasn't died
Though we tried

Before the tears, I'm leaving
Should've left a long time ago
'Cause it's clear we stopped believing anymore
And I'm so tired and empty
Since I found we've lost it all
And I'm leaving before the tears start to fall

Ooh I'm leaving before the tears start to fall

Sad to say
I'm on my way
And your heart will be breaking at dawn
I'll be gone

Before the tears, I'm leaving

And I'm so tired and empty

I gently kiss her lips, touch her with my finger tips
Searching for the love I miss, you once gave to me
She is warm here by my side, I should be satisfied
It's sad to realise I'm still in love with you

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

She holds me close to her, I love the sweet things she whispers
But only my memory stirs, my heart still isn't free

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

Let's talk about hearts, no two are the same
Some of them are cold as ice, others need the flame
One of them gets comfortable, the other needs a change

But hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Some hearts break too easily, some are hard as stone
One heart cries for company, the other cries alone
Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Won't you rub my body with sweet scented oil, cool me with a 'lectric fan

I wanna come home every evenin' to a great big meal of wine and roasted pheasant
I want you to say to me Ray, hey this is Susy, this is Kay, I brought 'em both home to you for a present
When The Man downs his soul and find my stash, won't you tell 'em it belongs to you
And when you're sittin' in the slam tell all the other chickies when they get out they should look me up too

A no good man that you all know and he was lookin' around for Marie Lavaux

So Marie did some magic and she shook a little sand, she made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled and she said hey hey, I'm gettin' ready for my wedding day
But ol' Handsome Jack, he said ""Good-bye Marie, you too damn ugly for a rich man like me""
So Marie started cryin', her fangs started shakin', her body started turnin', she started quakin'

So sing me a rainbow if you can

Seems like I spend all my time gettin' off and gettin' on

No one sees the fantasies and fears my lady hides
There are those who've shared her love and laughter
But no one hears my lady when she cries, but me
No one hears my lady when she cries
And when she cries she makes you want to run
And chase the sun and bring it back
To brighten up a corner of her dark and troubled skies
When she cries

You may have seen her lyin' in your lamplight
And if you've heard her whispered words, it comes as no surprise
So be the one she shares her secret smiles with
But send me back my lady when she cries, for me
My lady's gonna need me when she cries
And when she cries she makes you want to run
And chase the sun and bring it back
So bring me back my lady when she cries, for me
Cause my lady's gonna need me when she cries",When She Cries
Dr. Hook,"You ain't got the right to tell me I'm not lonely
'Cause you don't understand what I've been through
She had every right to do the wrong that she done to me
And that don't make it easier to lose

And that don't make it easier to lose
I woke up Wednesday mornin' with the feelin' she was gone
I turned to face an empty place and I realised
That I didn't smell no coffee and all her pretty clothes was gone

I cried the first of the many tears you'll see me cryin' from now on
And you ain't got the right to tell me I'm not lonely
'Cause you don't understand what I've been through

And that don't make it easier to lose
And that don't make it easier to lose
I know her list of lovers was just as long as mine

But the sometime plan of a natural man is to settle down
But the one time ways of that woman done busted up my mind
Now she's out the door and she got one more on her list than I got on mine
And you ain't got the right to tell me I'm not lonely

'Cause you don't understand what I've been through
She had every right to do the wrong that she done to me
And that don't make it easier to lose
And that don't make it easier to lose

It's gonna be a long time 'fore I come this way again
I been dragged through school and I learned the rules and it seems to me
That a woman love to do you but she won't always do you nice
She had her turn, I guess I learned

You know she ain't gonna do me twice
And you still ain't got the right to tell me I'm not lonely
'Cause you don't understand what I've been through
She had every right to do the wrong that she done to me

The waitress with the orange hair keeps motionin' me to hurry up and leave
So I gulp my coffee - burn my mouth - grab up my coat and slippin' out
I smear a streak of mustard down my sleeve
And the guy behind the register takes my bread and shakes his head
And looks at me as though I've blown his mind
Hey, I just come here for some coffeeâ?¦hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again

That blue eyed barracuda smiles and tells me she could use some brand new clothes
She grabs my leg and with a wink, asks if I want another drink
She's not the campfire girl you might suppose
But she's so busy tellin' me her troubles I don't think she's got time
For any kind of trouble small as mine
Hey, I just come in here for nothin'â?¦ hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again
Judy I'm slowly movin' back again

Well I'm stopped here on the corner, when the red faced cop says move along your way
But my nose is cold and my toes are numb, I got no feeling in my thumb
I think I just might stop inside that church and maybe pray
But they pass the plate and they look at me when it turns out that I ain't got a dime
Hey, I just come in here to talk to GODâ?¦ hope I'm not wastin' anybody's time

And Judy I'm slowly movin' back to you
And I wish that I could say I'll treat you better than I used to
It's just I'm learnin' lots of things I never knew back then

Penicillin Penny she's the queen of the sunset strip
If she ever gives you any then you better see your doctor real quick
From the back seat of Cadillac cars, to the floor of men's room bars
She's Penicillin Penny and her future's written in the stars

She's Penicillin Penny and ever since the day she came and came
They say she's had so many, she gives 'em all numbers not names
I always call her Hun' but she calls me 1001
And Penicillin Penny starts to boogie when the day is done

She's Penicillin Penny and if you ever see her passin' through
Better run into your house before she stops and lays a little on you
If you ever let her in your door it takes 20 million units
Or more to cure the love that Penicillin Penny's gonna lay on you

Two a.m. and you ain't home yet
I don't wanna think where you might be
Guess I'll go and get me stoned

Oh and how I wish that you'd come home
And put a little bit on me

Put a little bit on me, sweet momma
Put a little bit on me

You put a little here, you put a little there
All I want is my rightful share
Hey momma, ain't you gonna wanna
Put a little bit on me

You used to call me Sweet Daddy Jelly-roll
I used to feel your mind and thrill your soul
And any time I needed you, you cure'd my misery
But those days have gone and passed us by
And all you do is lay around on your ass and cry
Baby if you don't wanna see me die
Put a little bit on me

Put a little bit on me sweet momma

Dr. Hook,"(Hazel Smith)

She'd snuggle up and talk to me
Each night as I'd watch TV
I'd teasingly call her chatter-box
Then one night she said ""Don't be scared,
I see an angel on the stairs
Daddy can you hear the angel talk?""

One more year of lollipops, ice-cream cones and soda pop
One more year of Daddy's little girl
One more year of cracker jacks, bubble gum and sugar smacks
One more year of Daddy's little girl

I took her in my arms upstairs
And as she said her night-time prayers
I felt a fever burning in her head
She gave thanks for Mum and me
And said, ""I heard my angel speak
Daddy this is what my angel said

One more year of lollipops, ice-cream cones and soda pop
One more year of Daddy's little girl
One more year of cracker jacks, bubble gum and sugar smacks
One more year of Daddy's little girl

Her faith grew strong, her body weak
And soon my frightened eyes could see
There was nothing on Earth that I could do
And one year later, to the day
In her sleep, she slipped away
And I knew what she'd said and heard was true

One more year of lollipops, ice-cream cones and soda pop
One more year of Daddy's little girl
One more year of cracker jacks, bubble gum and sugar smacks
One more year of Daddy's little girl

One more year of Daddy's little girl

And love ain't the answer to what's coming down
With more than enough to hold most folks together
We've lost more than average folks ever have found
We can't kiss and make up, make love and take up
Somewhere where we left off, somewhere where we've been
Cause love ain't the question and love ain't the answer
From the beginning it was destined to end
No love ain't the question and love ain't the answer
For two head-strong people too set in our ways
We can't stay apart and we can't stay together
A couple of misfits that love cannot save
We've got love for giving and got love for taking
But there's no forgiving, there's no giving in

Heading towards the sun, taking myself home

When I should be heaven bound

Shattered hopes and broken dreams, all I have to show for life
There's a better way it seems, but I let it slip right by
Oh I wish I didn't feel, all this heavy load on me
Maybe I could fly, rising high like a bird above the sea

Stuck here on the ground
When I should be heaven bound

And I'll love you till life's end, as I love you tonight.

I know this world that we live in can be hard now and then,
And it will be again, many times we've been down,
But still love has kept us together, the flame never dies;
When I look in your eyes, the future I see.

Wanting you years from now, and holding you years from now,
And loving you years from now, as I love you tonight.

Well there's gonna be a freaker's ball (ha ha)
Tonight at the Freaker's Hall
And you know you're invited one and all
Uh oh

Come on baby's grease your lips
Grab your hats and swing your hips
And don't forget to bring your whips
We're going to the freaker's ball (yes)

Blow your whistle, and bang your gong
Roll up something to take along
It feels so good, it must be wrong
We're freakin' at the freaker's ball

Well all the fags and the dykes they're boogie-in' together
The leather freaks are dressed in all kinds of leather
The greatest of the sadists and the masochists too
Screaming please hit me and I'll hit you

The FBI is dancin' with the junkies
All the straights, swingin' with the funkies
Across the floor and up the wall
We're freakin' at the freaker's ball, y'all
We're freakin' at the freaker's ball

Everybody's kissing each other
Brother with sister, son with mother
Smear my body up with butter
And take me to the freaker's ball

Pass that roach please, and pour the wine
I'll kiss yours if you'll kiss mine
I'm gonna boogie 'til I'm cold blind
Freakin' at the freaker's ball

White ones, black ones, yellow ones, red ones
Necrophiliacs looking for dead ones
The greatest of the sadists and the masochists too
Screaming please hit me and I'll hit you

Everybody ballin' in batches
Pyromaniacs strikin' matches
I'm gonna itch me where it scratches
Freakin' at the freaker's ball, y'all
We're freakin' at the freaker's ball

We're at a ball
We're freakin' at the freaker's ball

Hey Lady Godiva, ridin' throughout town
Naked on your big white horse
With your long hair hangin' down
Lady Godiva, you say you're frightened
And so shy
I hate to bust your bubble but you
Sure picked a funny place to hide

Hey Lady Godiva, lookin' for a place
Where no one wants your body
And nobody knows your face
Lady Godiva, you say you wanna be loved
For what's inside
I donÂ't know much about horses but you
Sure picked a funny place to ride

Every man's just a clutchin' hand
Reachin' out to grab you
Every man's a quiverin' lance
Tryin' hard to stab you - don' let 'em nab you

Hey Lady Godiva, lookin' kind of scared
You showed 'em all your talents
And nobody seems to care
Lady Godiva, could it be no-one wants to ride
Come to think it over
You may have picked the perfect place to hide

If I'd only come and gone
The way I've always done with summer girls before
Shared one night with you and never reached for more
Then we wouldn't face this long and painful righting of the wrong
If I'd just come and gone

If I hadn't stayed so long
And merely parked my dusty boots outside your door
Tracked no footprints 'cross your polished hardwood floor
If I'd have left you in your doorway smilin' drowsily at the dawn
If I'd just come and gone

Then I'd be on a shinin' silver plane dippin' into Denver
Or a schooner blowin' down The Biscayne Bay
You'd be safely tucked away among the pleasure I'd remember
'Stead of lyin' here beside me fearin' restless thoughts inside me
That might awaken with the breakin' of each new day

If you'd only stopped to read
Cold hard words I carved on other bedroom walls
And heard the mornin' coffee truths I told 'em all
I'd still be on your lips like some unfinished half-remembered song
You'd never have loved me if I'd just come and gone

If I'd only come and gone
If I'd only come and gone
If I'd only come and gone

I'm gonna throw my grass out the window
Crumple up my papers too
Give away my speed, Cause all I'm gonna need
Is just a little bit of love from you

And we'll be makin' it natural
Ain't it just about time
That old stuff I was so keen on
I no longer have to lean on
Cause your love's enough to keep me high

Now if any you heads want some Panama red
All you gotta do is to reach out your hand
I'll trade my stash for just a little bit of cash
To buy a simple golden wedding band

And we'll be makin' it natural
But don't you ask me how
It's been the cause of all my sorrow
But I think I'll start tomorrow
'Cause I sure could use a hit right now

I'm gonna throw it out the window, some day
Give away my cocaine
Bust my spikes and flush a million mikes
Of acid right down the drain
And we'll be makin' it natural, makin' it natural.......

",Makin' It Natural
Dr. Hook,"(Shel Silverstein)

I didn't say, ""Don't do it babe"" when she packed up to go
I didn't say ""Come back here honey and try with me once more""
And when she asked me if I loved her, I just turned away
She's gone and now I'm hearing all the things I didn't say

I didn't say ""I'm sorry babe, 'cause half the fault was mine""
I didn't say ""We'll work it out, 'cause all we need is love and faith and time""
I said ""If that's the way you want it, I won't stand in your way""
She's gone and now I'm hearing all the things I didn't say

I didn't take her in my arms and kiss away her tears
I didn't say ""My life don't mean a thing if you ain't here""
I thought of all the many games I'd be free to play
But all I do is listen to the things I didn't say

I didn't say ""Take off your coat, I'll make some coffee and a talk""
I didn't say ""The motorway is such a long and lonely, endless walk""
I said ""Goodbye, good luck and God bless you"", then she walked away
And left me here to live with all the things I didn't say

And now I guess she'll never hear the things I didn't say

",The Things I Didn't Say
Dr. Hook,"The mornin' sun touched lightly on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
In her white suburban bedroom, in a white suburban town
As she lay there 'neath the covers, dreaming of a thousand lovers
'Til the world turned to orange and the room went spinnin' round

At the age of 37, she realized she'd never ride through Paris
In a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair
And she let the phone keep ringin' as she sat there softly singin'
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized in her daddy's easy chair

Her husband, he was off to work, and the kids were off to school
And there were oh so many ways for her to spend her day
She could clean the house for hours, or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked down the shady street screaming all the way

At the age of 37, she realized she'd never ride through Paris
In a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair
And she let that phone keep ringin' as she sat there softly singin'
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized in her daddy's easy chair

The evening sun touched gently on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the rooftop where she'd climbed when all the laughter grew too loud
And she bowed and curtsy to the man, who reached and offered her his hand
And led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd

At the age of 37, she knew she'd found forever as they rode along through Paris
With the warm wind in her hair
Ooooohhh yes with the wind in her hair oooooohhhh",The Ballad of Lucy Jordan
Dr. Hook,"(S. Silverstein)

And I remember her on the streets of New York City
As I walked the night needing some place warm to go
As she passed I said ""Hey there's snowflakes on your lashes""
And she laughed and said, ""That isn't snow""

She said, ""they're feathers from a pillow God is shaking in the sky""
And she opened smiling lips to catch a snowflake blowing by
And we both began to laugh and then I looked into her eyes
And it was warm again

But
I never got to know her very well
All we did was spend a little time
You're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell
She's just a passing shadow on my mind

But I remember her as we woke up warm together
In her sunlit room, and she said, ""I'll help you pack""
And she sewed my shirt and I said, ""I'll stay forever""
But she laughed and put some cookies in my sack

And she said ""Leave a trail of cookie crumbs as you walk through the snow
And someday I'll follow after and I'll find you where you go""
And I left her in her doorway but why I'll never know
But I was younger then

So
I never got to know her very well
All we did was spend a little time
You're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell
She's just a passing shadow on my mind

Oh you're waiting for a story but there's really none to tell

",I Never Got to Know Her
Dr. Hook,"Well here I am in the wind again,
Floating where it takes me
Laughin' and a splashin' in the summer sun,
Until the alarm clock awakes me

Then it's coffee and a kiss and two cigarettes,
And I'm back out in the cold, cold weather
Chasin' my dream but I just can't seem to rub two coins together
(Sing it)

Life ain't easy, they never said it would be
Life ain't easy, whoever said it should be
Life ain't easy, and nothing comes free, free, free, free
Life ain't easy, tell me all about it
Life ain't easy, no, no, no, no
Life ain't easy, and nothing comes free, for you or me

That woman she don't understand, the way my mind keeps driftin'
And the Lord don't always lend a hand, when my poor heart needs liftin'
Is home and kids really all there is, or is there something better?
And how much soul must a poor man sell to rub two coins together?

Don't you know that
Life ain't easy, no, no, no, no
Life ain't easy, whoever said it would be
Life ain't easy, and nothing comes free, free, free, free

Life ain't easy, can you hear me

Life ain't easy, and nothing comes free, free, free, free

And she rules this smokey kingdom
And her scepter is a wine glass
And a bar stool is her throne.
And the jesters flock around her
And fight to win her favor
And see which one will take the Queen of the Silver Dollar home.

She arrives in all her splendor

And her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block.

Plays her song as she walks in.

Her sparkling jewels are rhinestones
And her shoes are scuffed and worn

And the wondrous sights she's seen

Rings of grass, crowns of flowers
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Furs that are woven of whispering hours
Gone, gone, gone, gone

She's gone away where the rings are real
And the furs have a warmth that a woman can feel
And 'round and 'round, around goes the wheel
And she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Rings of grass, crowns of flowers
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Castles of sand with seashell towers
Gone, gone, gone, gone

She's gone away where the dreams are small
But the castles are rock and they never fall
And left me here to live among all
That is gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Rings of grass why do they die away?
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Whispering hours where do they fly away?
Gone, gone, gone, gone

And where's the wisdom to understand
That years will crumble all castles of sand
And the flowers and grass turn brown in our hands
When it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Other guys get 'em 'cause they're clever and witty
But the only love I ever get, I get out of pity
'Cause I'm the ugliest man in town

Use hundred dollar bills when I light my cigar
But still you know, that won't get you very far

I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

Hanging from a string in my mama's kitchen, back in the hard time days
Was a little ol' stone 'bout the size of an apple, it was smooth and worn and grey
There wasn't much food in my mama's kitchen, so whenever things got tight
Mama boiled up some water, put in the stone and said ""Let's have some soup tonight""

And I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

It had been in the family for a whole lotta years, so we knew it was a nourishing thing
And I remember mama, as she stirred it in the water, and we could all hear her sing
""Its a magical stone and as long as we got it, we'll never have a hungry night
Just add a little love to the wonderful soupstone and everything will be alright""

And I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

So it carried us all through the darkening days, 'til finally the sunshine came
And the soupstone started into gathering dust, but it hung there just the same
And ever since then the food's been plenty, but every now and then I find
That mama in the kitchen with the wonderful soupstone, drifts across my mind

And again I can taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

And again I can taste the chicken and tomatoes
And the noodles and the marrowbone
But it really wasn't nothing but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful, wonderful soupstone

",The Wonderful Soup Stone
Dr. Hook,"The traffic at this hour is so thick that he's afraid he might be late
Her flight arrives at seven ten and he remembers
How the lady hates to wait and he remembers losing her
And begging her to give him time to change

Now his mind is numb 'cause the time has come
His final chance is coming in on that plane

She fastens up her seat belt
And nervously she finishes her drink
An all night flight from L.A. can give a woman
A little bit too much time to think

And she hopes deep in her heart
That he'll be different but she knows he'll be the same
And she wonders if the stewardess would be
Kind enough to just let her stay on that plane

That plane settling in to the heavy city haze
Where she remembers guilty nights and baby please forgive me days
As she slowly unfastens her belt and he clutches the wheel
That plane screaming as loud as the pain that they both feel

He's one mile from the airport
Damn traffic's backed up all along the lane
She waits five minutes takes a breath
And turns around and gets back on the aeroplane

She'll ride it through to Denver
She's got friends there, they could spend a little time
'Cause she knew he'd never be there
And he knows she never was the waiting kind

That plane rising up into the heavy city haze
Where she remembers guilty nights and baby please forgive me days
That plane screaming as loud as the pain that they both feel
As she slowly unfastens her belt and he clutches the wheel

I was sitting in my basement I just rolled myself a taste
Of something green and gold and glorious to get me through the day
Then my friend yelled through the transom ""Grab your coat and get your hat son
There's a nut down on the corner, givin' dollar bills away""

But I laid around a bit
Then I had another hit
Then I rolled myself a bauma
Then I thought about my mama
Then I fooled around, played around
Jacked around a while and then

I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and it rolled right by
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned oh me oh my

Now it took seven months of urging just to get that local virgin
With the sweet face up to my place to fool around a bit
Next day she woke up rosy and she snuggled up so cosy
When she asked me how I liked it Lord it hurt me to admit

I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and it rolled right by
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned oh me oh my

Now I ain't makin' no excuses for the many things I uses
Just to sweeten my relationships and brighten up my day
But when my earthly race is over and I'm ready for the clover
And they ask me how my life has been I guess I'll have to say

I was stoned and I missed it
I was stoned and I missed it

She was dancing when I seen her, in a Mexican cantina
In a neighbourhood they call La Zona Roja (hahahaha)
She had a child's smile, but she told me, in a while
It would take a lot of gold to get to know her (Oh)

Acapulco Goldie, donde did you go
You said you'd always hold me
But you run away with me Acapulco gold

(Oh that's a terrible thing you did)

I knew there's no-one cuter, then she said she was a puta
I said ""What does puta mean?"" Hmm and so she told me... (Oh no)
Then we went to meet a dealer, we smoked and drank tequila
Then the lights went out and I guess that's where she rolled me (just like)

As I was sleeping warmly in your bed
And it told me, boy it's time that you was packing up to go
But I smiled and shook the leaving from my head

And I never sung no stayin' song before
I've done them blues and good-bye tunes a thousand times or more

Down where the roses cling
Picture that same sweet love nest

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews

She was a red-hot hoochie coocher
She was the roughest toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

She messed around with a bloke named Smokie
She loved him though he was cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
And he showed her how to kick the gong around

She had a dream about the king of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with p-platinum wheels

He gave her his townhouse and his racin' horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them all a million times

Poor Min, poor Min, poor Minnie

O, those weeping times, all of my life's a lie
An endless torrent of anguished tears' o behold my cry

The affliction of a stained creation becometh my tragedy
Lachrymose is the light - touching the buried again
O, this scenery of loss always present within me
Afar into the obscure I wish I now could soar

Even though he stole my pride - I stand above his lies
Even though I oceans cried - and sailed them far and wide
...my star shall ever shine

Drifting endlessly deep in darkened streams;
The inharmonious looms
In my doleful ocean lies the love I've lost...
...for heaven, my sorrow

Devour my soul as I enter the dark and cold
Fallen from heaven's domains - god's vengeance unfolds
This scenery of loss, a ruined empire of dismay;
A pathway of decay leading afar and always astray.

Even though he stole my pride - I stand above his lies
Even though I oceans cried - and sailed them far and wide...
...my star shall ever shine

""Homage he has from all - but non from me...
I battle it against him, as I battled in highest heaven - through all eternity,
And the unfathomable gulfs of hades, and the interminable reals of space,
And the infinity of endless ages... all, all, will I dispute""",A Scenery of Loss
Draconian,"(I Mourn that the Night Passes Us by)
(Lyrics by Anders Jacobsson, August 1998, edited July 1999)

Lucifer:
Oh angel o' my winter;
Grieveth for the pain o' sadness.
A gothic embrace restores my love
God took away...
Ye romance o' forgotten times...
In eras without the sun.
An ocean o' tears I see...
A nightfall o' dreams caresses me.


Deliah:
Thou wert, thou art, thou shalt fore'er be...
Ye nightshade o' thy sorrow,
Stretching out for it's romantic rose in twilights beauty.
In love with ye thousands o' nights...
But weeping in silence... in ebony... for melancholyâ?¦ forever!


Jesus Christ walks the Earthâ?¦
A pitiful shade of Godâ?¦
A cruel conspiracy for the sake of slavery,
And He drags 'em down to the plague of humanity.


Lucifer:
I've killed my holinessâ?¦
Killed my emptiness!
I'm fallen from Godâ?¦
Fallen from guilt!


I've abandoned the light,
The light that blinded so long!
Free from submission,
But still under His spell.
We're in painâ?¦ painâ?¦ pain!
Sorrow turns to anguishâ?¦
And I scream with hate at the tyrant above!


Deliah:
Hosanna de Profundis!
Dethrone the tyrantâ?¦
Take his throne, take the throne!


Astaroth:
Gothic moonâ?¦ ablazeth the eventide so sonorous,
Ye solemn of a lovelorn gard'n o' crimson souls.
All true beauty is sad...
But lost within the clenched hands of God.


Lucifer:
I mourn that the night passes us byâ?¦
Let there be an eternal nightâ?¦ eternal night!
I mourn that the night passes us by!
Let there be an eternal nightâ?¦ eternal night!


..I shall call upon the dragon...!




",The Gothic Embrace
Draconian,"(I am the Light that Leads to Darkness)
(Lyrics by Anders Jacobsson)

""I've cried a river for you to swim
To let you know the state we're in.
I've dreamt a vision for you to see He's dreamt a vision for us to see,
That the night is the only worthy key that night is the worthy keyâ?¦
(and the sound of silent cries
Is heard throughout the skies"".


I have seen Heaven's sleep, We have felt Heaven's sleep,
And I've watched the angels weep, our God hath made us weep
They are slaves of fear and pain
(that is ruled by a god insane).
I know that the night will save us all O Lucifer, O Morningstarâ?¦
As long we praise the dragons call. how we praise your ancient fallâ?¦


Eternal seems the time,
But the only true love will remain,
And darkness shall rise up to Heaven
To embrace the last, final prayer...
Cause the grace of His word once spoken
Is now shattered by a promise broken.


""So curse the tyrant, curse the light,
For we are free here in the (endless) night. How free we could be in the nightâ?¦
So embrace the sorrow, kiss the tearsâ?¦
Follow the wind to erase your fears, Follow the wind, follow the signâ?¦
For the fires burn bright, the fires of blue,
And in the end it will burn in all of you.""


The war will come,
Apocalyptic storms of a tortured silence
As God oppresses His last, final soulâ?¦
And eternal seems the time,
But the only true love will remain,
And darkness shall rise up to Heaven
To embrace the last, final prayerâ?¦
So deny God's light and His words spokenâ?¦
We regain Heaven and crush His skull wide open!


""I've cried a river for you to swim,
To let you know the state we're in.
I've sent a message throughout the stars, He's sent a message throughout the stars,
For His kingdom is full of scars. God's kingdom is full of scars.
I am Lucifer, the angel of light He is Lucifer, O Luciferâ?¦
Come with me and love the night!


And legions of angels out from Heav'n flyâ?¦
Oh, how they soar above the mountains high!


I am the Lightâ?¦
That Leads to Darkness!
I am the Nightâ?¦
Behold Pandemonium!"" Behold Pandemonium



",The Morningstar
Draconian,"(The First of Seraphs in Anguish Bereaved)
(Lyrics by Anders Jacobsson 11/3 - 1996, edited & rearranged 5/10 -1998 and 20/7 - 1999)

Lucifer:
And the fires burn'd inside my eye's
As ye fall's ascending like a moment o' joy. Spirit of Night:
My thorns where sown in ye light o' Day, His thorns were spawned from the grasp o' God,
And the windsâ?¦ they blewâ?¦ and the painâ?¦ it grewâ?¦
Until my winds, they blew no more. but holiness grew no more.
I scream'd out into the dawn!


Grievance; fro' the horizon she comesâ?¦
I wonder if I could stay in His world, Grievance:
'cause sooner or later this pain must end! Pain must end!
My lifeâ?¦ it cries to be free, His life cries, but soon to be freeâ?¦
But legions of starsâ?¦ the stars suffers with me! Thou art the star o' Venusâ?¦ Oh Seraphim!


The Holy Spirit:
Thou must obey thy father, thy God!
Bow down before his eyesâ?¦ before his very eye'sâ?¦!


Lucifer:
My Godâ?¦ 'father'â?¦ hear us cry!
Tell me whyâ?¦! Thou wilt die!!!


Astaroth:
Oh, Enslaver of Souls;
Thou can not be our father!
Oh, Avengeful God;
Thou hast brought us agony!


Lucifer:
Into heav'n our sorrowâ?¦ Sorrow
Ye beautiful moment o' tragedyâ?¦ so beautifulâ?¦
Falling fro' the lies of His 'perfect world'. They are fallingâ?¦
Takest us away, so far awayâ?¦ falling!
Here is nothing but pain. God is smilingâ?¦
Farewell now as we enter our darknessâ?¦ smiling!
And we love her, the realization! Salvation comes but pain
Behold our salvation!



",Serenade of Sorrow
Draconian,"The cold winds blew into life, my adored. 
A bleeding heart we share, now on Azrael?s wings. 

I fall like autumn rain? 
You are my everything. 

This lovelorn kiss of death in lugubrious silence? 
Dawn breaks open like a wound? and the dreadful sun 

Two souls entwined together, 
Still so alone. 
Both you and I are shattered 
And frozen in stone. 

You begged for air from within this cold tomb 
With pain sharp as a knife. 
I now lie resting like a child on thy womb, 
Gave back a part of my life. 

For a while it had disappeared, but nothing was changed. 
A haze fell forever with her fading life. 
I leaned my head back? then drank of opaline. 
The emerald goddess came to me? she craved my soul. 
And just for a while? I had forgotten. 

Yes, it was all forgotten, but nothing was changed. 
Suddenly a cold breeze blew across our room? 
It felt like I wanted to leave? this world with her. 

Come; drink with me the divine nectar of Olympus! 
Sit beside me and help defy our adversity and loss? 
This adversity and loss. It all ends with you! 

I kiss you in your dying breath; sleeping quietly now. 
Swept away by heavy eyelids; forever in my dreams? 
And you will be safe in my dearest dreams? 
My love? forever in my dearest dreams.

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything

Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?

Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go 
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Everyday for years 
The day that he died
I swallowed my tears
With a tip of the bottle
And a wish you were here
I'd trade forgiveness for a beer
I sat with my grandma in her rockin' chair
The sun felt so warm through her light blue hair
From the pages of her bible
And a fresh breath of air
I'd trade forgiveness for a beer
I know my beliefs they ain't right
It's the only way I can 
Make it through the night
I pray the lord to keep me asleep
So I can dream of the promise land
'Cause my dreams are the only time I can 
Sleep never makes it round here

I love chicks with they braids pushed back
That look like four racetracks, now chase that

Can't stand another brother humpin mine only we can bump and grind
I don't care who was there before I laid there
For now I play here, and if she want me too I shave there
I'ma be around until there's gray hair, okay dear

Won't have to worry about Drag at night

Caught him while he's snoring right next to his hoe

For free
I just wanted to hear the hoe scream
That's my pleasure

Who that?
Room service
Ran to the peep hole
A lil nervous
Then I broke down 20 yards 32
Then he looked at the box and I told him those are 2's
I ain't want to pop this nigga so I played it cool
Lift them up and down showie rum just a fool
Cause he could of brung the police to get me
Or even worse, somebody sent him to hit me

And this nigga they want me to kill
Is worth ninety bill
So I raised the stakes, this job cost a mill
This ain't gonna be no quick shit
Cause they want the chip
So I dip quick stop
Pull out the lab top
Tapped in the Window's software 
You know one of biz
Then I put a few of my codes in front of his
Tell em to load the stuff now
System shut down
Snipe a few guards, dead before they hit the ground
Soon as I got to the door to pop the lock up
My vest got popped up
I dropped then got up
One of the guards that's I hit up I picked up
Put his face to the camera for a picture
Soon as they brunged him in
I put another slug to him
That put the blood on him
Took the chip
Blugged him
Yo my vest was full of bullets to I tore it off
Never thought somebody was behind me saw him off

[Chorus: x2]",Snipe Out
Drag-On,"[Swizz Beatz]
Double are
Right Now
We ain't playin' wit y'all
We ain't playin' wit y'all
Stop playin' Drag

[Drag-On]
A-yo I spit these bars to make ya head shake
Fuck bitches 'til the bed break
Let's see how much lead you can take
Never let a nigga pay for what I give away
We can all share
Clip to my waist it's all spare
So run dammit, run 
When I bust my gun
I miss none
Put y'all in critical condition
I'm the talk of the town when it comes to fuckin' bitches
Or layin' niggas down
Drag bust the most rounds
While y'all niggas dibble and dabble
The shit I pull up wit
It'll feel like it grabs you
We ain't fuckin' I had you
Shit I know Drag'll be glad to
If I had to
Soon as she in the bathroom
I'm in her ass too
Gotta six shot shooter
That'll pop through ya
Glock ruger
In case I call my block movers
State troopers on my ass
Shit let me see them touch 160 on the dash
My Z look pretty when it's fast
I bet 50 I'ma juice the city before I pass
And if you want to catch fire better step on the gas
The opposite of H2O
Want to be a hero
When the fires on
Y'all won't even see ya moms
Even if she was screamin' at the top of her lungs
Niggas either burn to the bone or leave the shit alone
In case of a fire never take the elevator
Walk 2 flights hold ya breath and take the steps (Uhh)

[Chorus: Swizz Beats]
Do my ladies run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my ballers run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my mamis run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my dogs run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh

[Drag-On]
A-yo I only fuck bitches that's flexible
Ankle touch neck sex incredible
When Drag about to spark cats
Ain't no barging wit that
When my gun spit it say ""Where The Target At?""
'cause I'm fire so I speaks wit heat
So let me walk that walk
'cause like a teacher I'ma talk wit chalk
That'll outline y'all like a fresh pair of Nikes
Stay wit those 
Even if I'm bare toed you see the stripe
I leave blood stains on sponges
Cum stains on comforters
I leave rooms foggy
'Til where y'all can't find me
Keep a bad mami
Twisting up the green scent
Like tangerine face out of a magazine
Like ebony
On the block I pump the ivory
Never pay for show
I only fuck wit those that never ate before
That means no food, no cars and just skip bail
The only thing on they plate is no more than fish scale
The blow you only know about is the air outside
I have nightmares before I sleep I pray y'all fry
For a pie I lay out guys
'cause what I keeps layin' on my dresser
Keeps layin' niggas on top of stretchers
Lightweight but I give off pressure in all measures
Never chase treasures
Flame niggas for pleasure
Red/Gold vest
Bullets go through tef
Got better double are
2 letter (Nigga)

[Chorus: x2]",Spit These Bars
Drag-On,"[Verse 1]
Listen up, yo, shit I get upset if I see a nigga, layin' in his sweats
With blood comin' out his head like sweat, knowin' I could be next
So, what about all the babies that ain't fully born
That's less fortunate, like that man walkin' with one arm

They tried to throw me up in a orphanage, with all the kids
But I stayed up in the offices 'cause they couldn't get me, off a kid
It's sad when a good mother put hard work
Like wash clothes, off the shit we played on and got hurt

Why she gotta pay for the dirt
'Cause her only son is up the street with the whole block sour
'Cause you know bodies lay for 'bout for eight hours
Want to talk about our chrome whips

There's niggas out there don't own shit
While we sit at home and bone a bitch while niggas is homeless
See niggas get piped over dice, wiped out, over 4 digit price
Damn near broke my heart, made me so sick, I had to go shit

Found her up the steps a bloody mess, hopeless
It wasn't cops 'cause only street niggas empty the whole clip
Ya know this

[Chorus: x2] 
People come, people go, that's the way life is
(and I heard that)
I don't know what to do, guess I'll just handle it
(and we heard that)

[Verse 2]
Yo bullets don't have no name
Or maybe y'all niggas should get better aim
And stop puttin' these innocent people in pain
It's a damn shame that life ain't, nothin' but a game

And we all at the 4th quarter, 'cause our time is shorter and shorter
'Cause y'all got time to tap our phones and hear the orders
And stop the coke from comin' across the waters
But y'all can't stop the slaughters

Or the people from starvin'
The guns is not standin' still, they still revolvin'
Uptight and still mobbin'
Blacks still sling cracks and know I know why they call it

Fishscale, from Colombia to New York on a boat the shit sells
Tell a weak whore, and when I score
I'm a open up my door and give to the poor
Til they tell me they don't even want no more

Y'all keep raisin the rent, then tell us how to raise our kids
And categorize us on, where we live like by on Broadway
It's all Dominicans and blacks that's packed in projects serious
And why Y'all call it a project, are we an experiment?

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I wasn't tryin to be a slave
Or encaged up with braids
I was saved by a guy with a older age with grades
Told me the other ways to get paid, than lettin my gun wave

We know you brave, get yo' shit tight and here's a pen
It's much lighter, like click click, that's a gun sound
Blau! That's a round now hit the ground
That's what Drag learns 'cause his pop's back was turned

Now call the cops, what about that gat that just got pungin'
Or that kid that got it 41 times, you call that justice?
If it is, then what the fuck is this
Somethin' I must have just missed

Maybe Christmas and get a nut off, we get our hot water cut off
Off my Timbs I wipe the mud off, 'cause I put the stomp in it
Pretty rivers, and lakes and ponds, Drag was in a swamp in Bronx
Well death is where I could of gone

'Cause where I'm from the bullets long
Y'all see the news, but why my block gang got no footage on
'Cause my life is like a movie, when you die, ain't no comin' back shit
So if one of y'all get shot, nigga handle it

[Chorus: x4]",The Way Life Is
Drag-On,"Yeah, Opposite of H2O why'know

what's it all about [Repeat: x5]

Its about Drag copping the bank or copping the Range
Laid up some where I ain't gotta be poppin them thangs
'cause I already got the cash
So who would ever think you'll see Drag without his mask
Waiting for a vic to past
Its about Drag off the strip out the orphanage
Of course this is same kid
Coughing off the nics
What you see something different
All I keeps different is my woman no kids so a nigga chilling
Stay peeling, what are you kidding money stacked to the ceiling
Chicks wit a frown see my rims spinning grinning
Fiends on the block
Still see my cane'll cop
Cause traffic on the block
Red, yellow, green top
While I'm bumping at the light in a mean drop
Turn it down cops coming burn the rubber now
Grimy nigga just want to see the better thang
See what this cheddar bring
And listen to my niggas sing

[Chorus:]
what's it all about (say it, say it)
What's it all about (party people)
What's it all about 
What's it all about [Repeat: x2]

Its about what coke to flip what chick to hit
What bus to split 
While y'all worry who whips the sick
Shit, I'm a trump type
Gimme a Denali and I'm happy
Wit something sitting in the seat sassy
And for me wouldn't mind getting her knees ashy
And for beef first on to get the heat to pass me
And its not about you acting like you God
'cause I find that mighty hard
If you walking wit a bodyguard
Y'all cats is like ice when y'all stepping out ya Rols
Y'all see me in my over dressed clothes its like y'all froze
Listen, I swear I won't take the white gold
Strictly platinum, I mean that's what y'all said was happening
Like when y'all talk about ya Rolie
And how its shining
But when Drag get it consider it bad timing
This is Drag rhyming, okay
I only paid attention to what Big said
For now its what my nigs say

[Chorus]

Its about Ruff Ryders staying number one in the charts
We don't pop much Crys but we pop a lotta clips
We gone stay street that's where gotta eat
Y'all see us thirty deep motorcycles murda weeks
We make throttle sounds till they track us down
Than pop wheelies till our back touch ground
People on the side say ""here go the action now""
What you talking bout we don't do no crashing now
We be in and out catch you back at the spot
Tank top, bike hop, bank stop
Block hot still got knock from last week shots
But y'all know Drag never cry to the cops
That just give fiends time to detox
Long as I got air in my lungs I'm a blow out my ops
I'm a Ruff Ryde till enough fry
I'm stronger than mudslides
I'm fire, so can't nobody touch I

Drag-On, n****s act on
Messin' wit' the team - it's gon' be a sad song
X will bring the day and the night
'Cause we get it right, get it right, get it right, spit it right

[DMX]
Moves is made, n****s is paid - that's just how it is
When my time is up, I'm a be out, but I'm a try to live
I'm eatin' day by day; ain't nothin' sweet about it
Act like you don't know what I'm sayin' then you read about it
Built for war like a armadillo
Smokin' yo' a**; put two through the pillow
Hear my s*** through windows
Manic depressive, and my head hurts
Soon as the dead thirst, I'll wet him first
Now wait a minute; it gets worse
I can't control what I own inside
So I take it out on the soul of that kid that died
Spit fire, cross n****s like barbecues
Mobbin' crews, strippin' n****s, robbin' crews
And put him speechless when I made him eat this
Hollow tip, and you can follow grip
You be like Kim and ain't gon' swallow s***
Don't know the half, couldn't know the math
To understand the wrath of a man split in half
But he got what he wanted; shot for three hundred
S*** is tight, and a n**** that's right gots to run it
Ain't no question; that's how I get down
N****s know gimme yo' dough and yo' ho, and, here, take these fo'
Hot things; I got things that make n****s spin
Put n****s in the wind where you never see n****s again
Bless a n**** with fifties - the thin types
And a straight blast that'll put pinstripes across your windpipe

[Chorus x 2]

[Drag-On]
Drag opposite water more than a spot order
My flows cause fire then bring holes
Takes more than a pump to out this little punk
'Less that pump is a twelve, and I get popped, still I burn to Hell
Call the police, and whatever they don't seize
And put in they mouth, and catch freeze; tell 'em throw Drag some keys
Don't care how many oyeas I gotta make believe
If you nervous, you don't deserve it poppi, please
Cats stealin' gats; y'all probably will get hit
Well, I'm the future; let's see y'all copy this, stopping this
Since a tiny kid like, ""mommy, buy me this.""
Since she always told me no, started stealin' on some grimy s***
Like look at that, now look at that slide - it in my book bag
I'm who parents point they fingers at, ""get from that hood rat.""
And put it back; f*** tough while y'all cook crack
I'm cocaine; throw me in the pot, I rise to the top
With your 5.0, go 'head, look ma, I got four more pegs
Still put them holes in yo' head, till it's mushy like dough bread
'Cause that vest only protects that chest
And if I decide to get ice, don't get to fascinated
Or it's my bullet, your brain, mashed potatoes
Double R got me comin' hard on you haters
'Cause we the streets black, and y'all belong beneath that

I'm a pop them guns, hit them n****s up
Switch that buggy, Drag; get that bigger truck
Watch Drag split a n**** like he split his dutch
And if y'all love him much, let me see y'all dig him up
Cop that Benz then dip them rims
Wait till money leave then tell her hop right in
See the buggy no tense see something
Beats thumping; pump stuff in the trunk, and
If worse come to worse, I'm gone and for good
So first things first: get my moms out the hood
Front when you see the face, and you see me everyday
That's okay, Drag brought too many bullets anyway
Look y'all the Sunday; that means it's football
While when I picked the gun play, y'all n****s picked the runnin' play
All you do is run in late, double R last long
E to the V E with the Drag to the dash On

[Chorus x 2]
Here we go, doin' our thing again
Climbin' them charts again
Stoppin' your flow 
(Y'all n****s isn't makin' no money)

Yo, shorty, flip this game; b****es ain't the same
Surface ride or die, now you never hear they name
'Cause E-V-E got it locked down tight
B****es ball, watch 'em fall, made it mine for life
Killin' it with Drag-On; I mean dash On
Y'all n****s complain while we get this cash on
Get our blast on and mash on anyone tryin'
Too late, luck turned bad; you left dyin'
And I got no fear; f*** it, don't care
Know my n****s, then you know that we gon' blast in the air
Weak shots, not; change you for block
Stop game; no pain down from the dock
Take out who, invincible crew
Got n****s that don't even hang with us with tattoos
Most influential
N****, please, who sent you?
Smells like enemy 
Take you out, it's essential

[Chorus x 2]

[Drag-On]
Yo, yo, I got bullets to give to ya
And a fast way to send 'em to ya
You might not be able to live with that or give it back
Hold it for now
Aiyyo, Eve, I'm holdin' you down
'Cause they know our pockets is swollen now
It's over for the clowns

[Eve]
Aiyyo, crazy if they think we lazy; got the bankin'
Us all stop that, maybe leave 'em stankin'
B**** of the litter and how you gon' rid of her?
Never shy, speak to the public after we hit 'em up

[Drag-On]
Drag'll come through your town, sunroof down
Guns is packed with rounds
Drag ain't stupid now
I'm smart, but y'all can get the dumb dumbs in a lump sum
'Cause you know they all come when run come

[Eve]
Aiyyo, ride shotgun; crowds scream how come
Cops lay; chest plate blown outcome
How you gon' try snatch our fame without none?
Muzzled mouth lights knocked out; we 'bout done

[Chorus x 4]",Here We Go
Drag-On,"Life is crazy man, it's fucked up. 
(You a half a nigga)
You was never there for me, you know. You know, take care of yours. 
When I get mine, I'ma take care of mine. 
You can believe that, for real.

You know what you did was wrong
But still, life still goes on
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

Let me ask you a question
Even though I was your reflection
You showed this nigga no love, me and you was no connection
You flipped on my moms and she had your ass arrested
But still, when you was there, my eyes was lit up like flourescents
So I read up on my lessons
Now, I'm fed up with your prescense
You yellin', be	's is screamin', ""Man shut up and get the message""
Things I used to do
Which reminded me of you
But I'm gone, and I'm doin' it and I'm doin fine dude
Look at what you did by and started
You had a mind but you was heartless
You shouldn't have spit me out dog, now I'm going to shine regardless
Supposed to leave me high, but I was already above it yo
You hated me to the point I was the way you loved it yo
But fuck it though
I wouldn't care if you kicked the bucket yo
My dick you can suck it yo
But it wasn't for nothin yo
You was here to leave a new chapter, Drag-On baby
Thoughts from now will live on, til I'm dead and gone baby
You was wrong
But now I'm older spittin' the bomb
Gettin' lit on
Just livin off this written from the arm
I was given from the mind since you wasn't there nigga
Can't believe you had me cryin', you wasn't worth a tear nigga
I used to be in the crib, no money, no food, hopin' for you
Now you and yours peepin' at my bocu's
My lyrics, going to haunt you
You feel this one don't you
Why don't you kill me with precaution
You should have just had an abortion, for real

You know what you did was wrong
But still, life still goes on
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

You never taught me the streets,
And didn't know what you mean to me
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

I guess there's ways of life I have yet to learn
Like Drag-On, and how many niggas I have yet to burn
With no rice on the shelf 
That's when I learned life itself
Only Chow, that's why I hit the mic for delf
Fear no one
I was taught to care for no one
Hard-hitter
Little nigga, cause I ain't hittin' no one
All I heard was me tellin' bitches to get in that bed
Gettin' that head
Me and my niggas gettin' that bread
Shit wasn't right because during that I didn't know you
I guess it's true 
Things you don't know, you're gonna go through
On the phone, tellin' my man, ""I'm about to blow dude""
Moms on the other line, saying, ""You about to blow who?""
""Oh, ain't nothin' ma. Yo, I'll call you later"" 
My moms, was zoned out
The days to the froze was blown out 
Cut the stove on the days I was alone in the house
There was a lot of shit missin', talkin' about she loaned it out
It was thug livin', and there was nothing I could do stop it
Shit was hard like a kindergarten kid in college
Started makin' profit, that's how I built my wealth
And what I did, shit ony the fools will quit up on hisself
I didn't know how I did it by myself
Sometimes it drove me to drinkin' so I spit up on myself
And you know what, out of all that, I'm about to blow up
Til I'm six feet, I'ma tear it up from the floor up
Nigga what

You know what you did was wrong
But still, life still goes on
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

You never taught me the streets,
And didn't know what you mean to me
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

Life still goes on
But you was wrong
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

You still was wrong 
But life still goes on
You wasn't my daddy, daddy",Life Goes On [*]

Rigga n****s want to see the Dog n**** bite
But this kid Drag strike a light
F*** five mics; my fire burn the wire
'Cause we the n****s that plug
Wrap 'em in the rug
Flames mini blowing on my hands like dust
Chicks want to slurp?
Ya guaranteed I'm a make 'em burp
Just push your teeth to the curve
And hum a word
Some nerve, cats think they can touch the torch
You don't know about my gun just for me to toss
F*** with the cars
I don't care what kind of drop ya pushin'
I put my fifteen through your top and dump bullets
Yeah, I see y'all cowards like to wear vests
Well, I'm a aim a little higher, like for your neck
I puff lye
I'm a lift blunts till my arm look like Popeye
Till the day is bye bye
Till then, three hundred G fly by, rented
So foggy windows look tinted
We just be lookin' at your Roley, at dem hot shows
So go 'head, boy, get drunk, pop that Mo'
Until I pull ya to the side
See the nine, kid?
And since you got that nice watch
You know what time it is

Bet'cha n****s always wonder
Why Drag always spit fire?
Why y'all always pop s***
About how I burn n****s till they chocolate?
'Cause I'm the opposite of H2O; now ya know
Fix your wrinkled face
My iron press more than clothes
And girls - I love 'em when I meet 'em
Might eat 'em
But when they act up, it's like Turner Tina
Don't me get the burner
Catch me in the low key Pontiac Sun, sippin' Con-gac
Y'all know how that affects blacks
So you know I clash that
No way I'm a blow all these gats and crack stacks
I'm a lil' n**** so you know I run fast
But don't do much of it 
Do a lot of gun busting
'Cause when I let off a clip, I get a kick
Outta seeing n****s run eyes open, hoping they don't trip
Ya hear the echoes blocks away
Type of bricklayers that hear shots today
And give your blocks away
Run up on papi 
Hey, drop the yay
And if he don't stall
This world be popped tomorrow
Drag-On speaks with a stutter, but I rhyme well
So like a dead snitch, it's hard to tell

We race out; but first blow the place out
It gets outrageous; to all my thug n****s - throw your sets up
And spit y'all razors
I hop in to spin out; I'm the opposite of H2O
So in the year two thousand, the lights would a never went out
Plus I rock ice, it drips on my boot; I shake it off
'Cause I'm fire, so every few seconds I take it off
I'm lightweight; I let y'all throw them dumbbells
I just throw back them dumb dumb shells to make y'all run well
I shoot dummies, blast backs
Money ga**ed up while I'm a open this tank
Yo, pa** me the shank
I blackout, swipe 'em like a credit card till I max out

I don't care about y'all hatin' n****s; my moms is part of this
She looks at herself and says I got all this
'Cause I drop them hits that make y'all chumps don't drop s***
Drag straps up when he get up in his women
Put somethin' long in the booty have 'em switchin' different
I snatch n****s wife to show 'em the light
Give 'em dick, then I'm hittin' the switch
And while she snorin', she don't know I'm gone by the mornin'
Back to the corner till that blue van come up; my hands is cuffed, uh
Whose fingers stay numb from rollin' up
Who finger f***s chicks till they throwin' up
Whose fingerprints cops keep showin' up
'Cause who that kid always ride and is throwin' truck

[Chorus x 2]

Yo, yo, I just take a strong pull and strike the match on n****s
I spit lit candles and drop hot wax on n****s
My middle name Jason
That means I'm capable of throwin' a ma** on and axe n****s
Y'all better ask n****s
First name: Mel 
I mean that's what them checks say
When they come in the mail, make bank tellers cum on they self
Count it fast, ma; we all professionals here
How's it feel knowin' I'm walkin' outta here
With what you get in a year?
I'm rude to a b****, but y'all n****s get out the street
Act like you don't see this black jeep, and get some flat feet
Y'all rock gators; we straight problems
We rock our Timbs half O's, laces like our dogs got 'em
F*** it, for two minutes, let 'em play wit' a new pair
I got enough spares to flood the block with footwear
Pockets like a blimp; s***, it's been a good year
Where my Ruff Ryders? 
We still in here

[Chorus x 4]",Pop It
Drag-On,"[Styles Paniro]
Yo, yo, I could keep my eyes closed still reading the signs
Young n****s think they hungry then you feed 'em a nine
Might kidnap they a**, start feedin' 'em swine
So I don't feel bad when I gut 'em like a pig
Beat him down, stomp him out, cut him like he big
You hear the attitude; I say f*** being humble
You act like a animal; you stuck in the jungle
N****s don't care if I'm poor or rich
So I don't care about these n****s, and the law, and s***
And I'll probably get shot for being a wild n****
You'll probably get shot for being a foul n****
Let's talk about slugs and the drugs we deal
Boys fight, men kill, get they money and chill
Real recognize real; I ain't sayin' a word
Doin eighty in the M - that means I'm stayin' in third
With a b**** playin' shottie AK in the third

[Sheek Louch]
Don't worry 'bout what I make; worry 'bout can you escape
'Cause when I bust my guns, bring more action than roll take
Nickel your hallway, I got aim from far
Y'all can't see me like the tints on the president's car
I know n****s don't like me, and my friends want to flip
That's why I'm on some extra all about Sheek s***
Your money: Sheek s***
Your b****: Sheek s***
Only thing I'm gonna share is these bullets here
B**** a** that's for frontin' 
Now don't say I never gave you nothin'
I'm greedy; go 'head, don't say I never saved you somethin'
Pack gun n**** but don't want no stack
I drink straight liquor till I forget where I'm at
I don't play no games, n****, drugs my 'cupation
In a building hustlin' - that's Sheek's Playstation
Motherf***ers want to ride by and ice grill
Change that to ice, dick
Show me, motherf***er, that you can kill

[Chours]
Seventeen shots in a clip, twenty-eight grams in an ounce
Everybody bounce, twenty-six inch hues on a truck
Thirty-six O's in a key, everybody free
Murder One felons with the glocks, twenty-four hours on the block
Bodies gettin' dropped, five thousand n****s actin' live
Five thousand n****s gotta die; everybody better ride

[Jadakiss]
Y'all n****s better find out who's your man
It don't work in the hood; you could fool your fans
Few bullets in your jeans soon to ruin your plans
Then I show up at the wake and boo-hoo at your fam
If you're like me, you never'll fail
Live by the three rules you make it, or be dead, or in jail
And I ain't really got much, but I'm up on cats
And Kiss don't just spit, I throw up on tracks
Double R now, b****; you see the princess cut
I'm in a two thousand big boy; the tense is up
Y'all n****s is soft; catch me with the semi
Underneath the Fendi, sweater, skully, and scarf
Make sure you don't say nothing to Jay
And keep your dirt; I don't smoke nothin' but hays
I'm a do this the old way; get it while I can get it
As much as I can get, then I'm a go my own way

[Drag-On]
Aiyyo, I keep my guns like laundry
I dump a load, make n****s fold, watch 'em die, and let 'em drip dry
Gon' spill pints from n****s; my rapid fire put n****s in black attire
Stuffed in the hearse, then dumped in the dirt
I live eternal, 'cause if Drag pa** away
I'm a come back with wraps on my face, blastin' an eighth
February eighth - that's the day
You better cop like it's crack, or get masking taped till you suffocate
B****es, y'all gettin' your feelings hurt
Two thousand, I ain't f***in' no more
I'm makin' b****es jerk till I squirt
All my b****es work, like upside down from the poles
Lift that skirt, give this dick what it's worth
Double R, see the icicles on the chest
Hungry n****s come snatchin'
I throw bullets; run catch 'em

But we could take it swingin' them irons till the bangs is flyin'

My floors mostly sand so you ain't gotta bring ya shoes
My crib is half house, half beach
Sit yo booty on this king size and see the sea
I'm a lil' freaky-o, I might lick ya toes
I got more zero's on my one's than Cheerio's
See your stilleto, shoes, your mac lip gloss
And ain't a dime chick that Drag didn't floss
Shorty booty bangin'
Tell me what you thinkin'

am I cocky coz I only play my shit and listen to myself
or am I striving for perfection? answer that
ah fuck it I cocky and I about to perfect rap nigga!
and I roam these streets
that's why my songs is deeper than death itself
I went from no food in the fridge to a platter on my shelf and I watch it
and y'all ain't gotta give me that but keep ya hand out my pocket haters!
coz you makin me nervous it ain't worth it
we don't want no accident when I flip on purpose
coz we don seen so many tradgeties done
September 11th, 2001 remember
like how could I forget I lost my man pop in that shit
help me get a grip
I think I'm losing it doo
because between life an death I be confusing the two

[Chorus:]
And sometimes I don't give a fuck if I live or die
but I think if I don't give a fuck about myself who else will I'm stressing

guess I was raised the wrong way
that's why I walk around with the long eighth
and dun shed so many tears I have none left
sometimes I sat and prayed for death
I feel like its 11:45 a quarter to 12
15 minutes to my days is over that's why its hard to stay soba
so I drink in the rain and smoke in the sun
and create my own clouds not have'n to think of the pain
sometimes I think I'm going insane
I get mad and shout God's name in vain
forgive me for my sins he got me laughing again
he got me back rapping again now help me choose my friends
my gats the closest one to me
but if my gun could take the stand and tell
ill be doing life in jail
like judge he made me do it
it ain't the gun its the nigga behind it that shoot it, that's ruthless

[Chorus]

you see a lot of niggas don't want drag to shine
instead they want to see drag locked up like my nigga Shyne
so you know what they try to do, leave a nigga behind
You know what it is, they envy me
motherfucking niggas held me back for 3 fucking years
and motherfucking niggas left me for dead
hopin that the world would forget but you know what?
they didn't forget, they bought me back
and now I'm in the greatest shape of my life
so now I'm on some shit like fuck y'all
all I give a fuck about is my niggas and my niggas only
I'm on some shit like

cause I don't need y'all to succeed y'all nigga
I know you like my word play early
like nelly got country grammar like er day
I can go cold and still sell out shows
and make enough dough to get your feet chopping not about your toes??
for coming at me half stepping
talking like gangsta shit and ain't have no weapon nigga
ah I got the best flow I be the best in the bronx
cause I don't walk through the swamps
striving through the alleys of death
recognize my destiny in life
even if it takes my last breath nigga
I walk in places where it could've been my last step
but god got me out of it
I love him and I'm proud of it

I buy thousand kicks and give to the young orphanage
When I was young I was a soft kid 'till I snap
And they couln't get me off a kid 'cause he sold my mom's crack

In order to feel that a real life shit and still rap 'cause
My rhymes still here so I done fried a few punks
My mom still here but she'll die in a few months
That's real life cancer and doctors ain't got the answer
I hope y'all felling this 'cause I ain't supposed to be telling y'all this shit
Like I ain't supposed to be selling y'all this shit but this is real life
Like I ain't supposed to be crying over this shit but I still mind
Shit just don't feel right but I'm gonna hold on
Till the hole in my 44 long
I'm gonna hit the gym and get my swoll on
Sometimes my head gone
And I don't give my pops props 'cause he was dead wrong
Pops was up, you know what, I don't give a fuck
The only thing I'm happy that you did was bust me out your nuts

But nigga this is real life it makes me clutch my glock real tight
It makes me want to fight but I get it off when I write
So these last few months my moms could live right, in new clothes
They said she might lose her sight fuck it she saw me blow
I reminisce sometimes I pull out old 40 year olds
It gets me stressed so I could smoke up like 40 of those
Sometimes I feel like walking with a mean bout
Busting till I see cops snowing till I see slot
Throw on a pair of flip flops take steps to the roof of the ledge
Till my feet stop but I need not, I got a life ahead of me
I got a wife in back of me, at least I gotta see my seed drop
Probation got me on a detox, so when I die, bury me next to the weed crops
So when I'm in heaven I can give weed to Pac and smoke trees with Big L

I did this I created this

Ain't no time for being a savage I gotta push a carriage
But some rapped in soft fabric this is deeper than marriage
Chip off your old block, your chip off your old pops
But you to young to hear my storys bout how I sold rock
But just yesterday I cut your umbilical chords
Doctor said you had several purports I guess you shook it off
Bless my god my first child my first born
I feel so rebirth like this my first song
I held you helpless, I couldnt help it
How could a nigga abandon his child?
I could never be selfish
Sometimes I feed him too much, throw up on his bib
I just gave birth to another one of God's kids
He can't see me yet his eyes closed
I love his baby smell, his baby size clothes, his eyes open, my eyes froze

With open arms I spread my wings to give you life

I never let you go, right without you here with me I never be the same

Carried you over my shoulders, you my little soldier
And I love you some more
It's never the same, first time you walk you fell on the floor
Circus score
First words now what's my name? ""DADA""
And you almost look the same as ""DADA""
I could never be mad dat, infact I'm glad dat
You know your Dad Dad and where your Daddy at
Cause when I was your age son I hever had that
I'ma be there for my little nigga, you just a little nigga
Old enough to get potty trained no more dypers changed
I named him El Kwan so he could have a righteous name
And know who Allah be, and eat Halal Salami
And know how to salaam me, wa-alaikum as-salaam
Know who my babysitter I take him straight to my moms
Love it when I pick him up he comes straight to my arms

[Chorus]

[Drag-on]
The first day of school I tought him respect so he had a little manners
So he pledge allegiance before he sung the star spangled banner
Walk with a bop, just like his pops
He wore his cap to the back coz he seen his Dad do that
Musta had his ear to the door cause he heard his mom's moan
Cause the first day he got the keys to the crib he brung a chick home
Okay time for the talk, you know what these is for?
Life support and I placed about 4 in your drawer
So what ever you do boy, jus don't go wrong
Whenever you need some more just come knock on your pops door
Cause you know I got em
I raised him, I dressed him
He dress himself now Allah blessed him he study Allah lessons
And I pray that the streets don't arrest him
His friends are pass him a spike lee joint
But I'll pass him the message
Sometimes I think like did I do right or did I do wrong?
Cause I made her have an abortion, now I wish that he was born
Because he would have been my first child, my first born

I got major plans, you get in the way
And your throat is the place where my banger lands
You don't want to anger me, upset me or startle me
You don't want a part of me, I'm going for the arteries
And I'm a colt-45 user, G-Host to the game of death
You about to die loser
This is Holiday and Dash-On
We burn a whole fucking house down so I don't need a mask on

[Chorus: x2]
You don't respect my flow you gon respect my gangsta
Or get stabbed with this motherfucking banger
Tell 'em P
You don't like my shit you could bite my dick
I got a case I'ma fight my shit
This for the streets

[Drag-On]
Nigga don't think cause you hot today you can't be in the fridge tomorrow
If you a family man I'll send you back your kids in a jar
You bought your soldiers, nigga I was raised with mine
I got three kids, four, five, but I raise my nine
I'll have y'all niggas missing your moms
Then let you find her wearing long sleeves but missing her arms
And ain't nothing for me to twist ya wig
All I gotta do is puff some weed then listen to B.I.G
Then come back and level the city
I got my money up, my band is thirty, my bezzle is fifty
My vest weigh fifteen, banana hold sixty
So I can run slow and hit you up swiftly
Extort rappers, they break me down half of their check
I keep a banger that'll break down half of your neck
I done been through hell and back, jail and bail me back
Drag and S.P.'ll blow off half of your chest

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
It's like a Kodak moment come capture this
How I motherfucking fracture shit, y'all niggas talking blaphemis
Motherfuckers we make classic shit, matter fact I'll mash ya shit
Y'all niggas like potatoes to me
And I might be high but you look good with a halo to me
And I ain't got a problem wit a problem
Fuck 'em cause I know he gon die with a nine in his noggin

[Drag-On]
Yeah, Drag back with the Ghost
You know what that means, more vests and a lot more toast
I'm a lot older plus a lot more violent
Tip of my guns covered, it's a lot more silent
My niggas pop off off imposts
Murder ya kinfolks and we ain't even fucking start wilding
So be cautious nigga or be in the coffin nigga
Cause we'll bring it to the hardest or the softest nigga

My gat is solid metal, my bat is heavy wood
Drag is under rated, my coke is heavy weighted
Why'all want to be a blood, well that's wut I'ma soak your face in

Coughin' up blood, I soften up thugs I make a nigga show me love or throw me slugs
I'm in the club with groupies, and groups of threes So getting ran up on the block by a group of Dee's
I've been shot three movies, my deal comin soon I'm past sellin crack I got pills comin soon

And I'm not no dancer, my moms got cancer 
So I ain't celebrating shit, until these doctors get the answer
Prolly never get a Grammy never get an Oscar But I got a twelve foot fish tank with Piranhas and Oscar's

I ain't gonna ask who shot ya, nine times out of the ten I know who did 
I know your bitch, get at 'em Kiss

Especially when your team wining like the Lakers 

[Jadakiss] 
Fall back respect, learn how to love a nigga
You only alive, on strength of another nigga
I've been nice all my F'in life
A big house I only slept in twice

Rhymes so dope, that it should be kept in rice
The mistakes I've made, shall be corrected in my second life
Nigga I be in the booth relaxed, I seduced the track
And beat it up like I produced the track

So another line bout a gun motherfucker 
And I'm a pass one to you, blast one through you
You don't got adrenaline, ass run through you
I run through cash, cash run through you

I could do the job myself, only way I prolly ever be broke if I rob myself
I don't know whats worse a hate or a fag
Double are D-Block daddy, Jada and Drag

[Chorus: x 2]

[Drag]
I was hated by many, loved by few
But respected by all, so fuck all why'all
Why'all doubted my skills, I never relied on this deal
I don't give a fuck what why'all feel, foreal foreal

This rap shit is nothing but fake love, alotta fake hugs
I rather go do a jook's , to feed my thugs
'Cause I could look through a nigga, like a glass shield
See he ain't real, my flow is like acid pills or pcp I'm like Morgan Freeman, 

The way I make tracks lean on me
I got a house my walls is plush, my floor is plush
Drugs by the barrel, in case it all get flushed
Spring is back, along with Drag

I just coped a light jacket and the longest Jag
I'm who you nigga love to hate, but glad I'm back
Why'all heard X is retiring, but Drag is back

Tell your friends, I'ma tell your friends (my friends)
We can be friends, on the weekends (be friends)

Dragonette,"We get a little faded the colours go
Running out of all our clothes
And the flash don't light when the battery's low

When you could stamp a foot down through the floor
It's a better plan by far
To blow off the roof and let in the dark
So we better get started

And if I were you, I'd let go
And feel it all over inside like a chemical
'Cause to tell the truth
I don't know
If it's ever over

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
'Cause it's floating round in the universe
Just swing it like it's tied by a string that you hold
And let it go

We could dig a hole right down into
Somewhere as deep as black and blue
And fill it with a crowd and the sound of right now

And we could carve a tunnel under
And find out just how low it goes, it goes
And we run out of dirt on the other side when we see the light

Well if I were you, I'd look up
And find a place there in the sky where there's room enough
To spread it out, and look 'round
For where to land when you come down

We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
'Cause it's floating round in the universe
Just swing it like it's tied by a string that you hold
and let it go

Hey handsome, we got it good 
Hey mister, we gone and done it 
Just because we could 
Because it?s cloudy out there 
Staying in like we should 

?Cause I like your head on my shoulder

And we both know the weather will get better 
So let?s get lucky, let?s go all the way

I don't miss your company
I just want those hands on me
To touch the places underneath

You can keep me out of your sight, that's alright
You can keep me out of your mind, even though
I know we're done you keep on turning me on

At night time when it's dark outside
I go to where I know you're hiding
Look up at your window from the street
You're up there, with somebody
Finally getting over me
You got something up there that I need

It's the only thing that I've been missing
I don't want your conversation
Come outside here for a second
Pay me some of your attention

From the station
How can I resist

Second floor and I?m in trouble
Gotta get me back down to street level

Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no
Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no

Quietly slide away off the mattress
Find my clothing on the bed post
So I tip toe out of this mess
As I slip back into last nights dress
I get around

Put a little lipstick back on my face
Blow a little kiss to you from the doorway
Walk the hall right past the stair case
Take the elevator back down out of this place

I never got that particular feeling
I’m doing better now than how I’ve been
Then again I never really ever get anything right

I‘ve got a scab that I can’t stop picking
Things that I though I’d forgotten
Things that I thought got better over night
So what’s shaking, a complication

I though by now I’d be 5’11”
I’d be hanging out with the top banana
Executive access to upper classes
Run and get me some of them big sunglasses

Better gather up what I left for dead
All the pieces needed in a level head
All the information that I’ve taken down all on my own

I was only lost in another life

I'm picking fruit and I choose you, you're so cool

Saint Thomas was vandalized
And I'm sorry but I'm not surprised

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of

Oh Cherry Cherry I'll read your fortune
It says here you're too serious and such
But I learned one thing Cherry you should understand
That nothing really matters very much

So we went completely wild
We were married in the Vegas style
And our families were scandalized
And I'm sorry but I'm not surprised

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of

Yeah we started the fire, it's out of control
Painted the town til it was up in smoke
So tie a ribbon round it, let the fighters drown it
And we'll go down in the books
Yeah we started the fire and it's burning up
Everywhere around us, take a photograph
If they ever found us, they'd have us surrounded
So pick up
You know you gotta pick it up
Cherry pick it up
Pick it up

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of",Pick Up the Phone

There won't be any warning
First thing in the morning
I'm gonna tell you see you later alligator
Instead of all my loving, you won't be getting nothing
That's tough, wake up and smell the muffin

You're looking out at a future that might never exist

I'm not sticking with it ‘cause of thick and thin

Shake like in the movies
Gotta use it

Call in the professionals to get it right
And if they hate us
Maybe hair and make up
Gonna save us
Blow it out and catch us looking famous
Then show you how to keep it up all night

But let’s pretend that we rule the world
We’ve got the superhero costumes
Know how to change our clothes in a phone booth
So let’s pretend that we, we rule the world

We got the know-how
Kick up the kind of stink you're hearing about
Give us a kiss and then we punch your lights out
I'll eat a fist, I'm hungry for a fight
It takes an army, looking good and booking it
We’re ready
A little muscle, little cuddle, little lady
Listen don't be chicken, pick a side

There's got to be some cha cha ching and g-g-glitter
We're gonna see some ba-da boom before we finish
We get knocked down, we get back up in a minute

Over the dark horizon sky
With twisted tales of sacrifice
To imagine or believe all the glory of the free

Hunting all day an endless cry
The things I've seen I can't deny
Sinners, saints, all mixed in one
The dawn of time has begun

Why can't you see what they're doing to me
Is it fair that I'm dying in vain?

Once in a land of sacrifice now only valleys of demise
Shadows of a pale blue moonlight ride the waves of entity

Why can't you see what they're doing to thee
Is it fair that you all die in vain?

Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forevermore
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire

Through the day and through the night, with dragon's heart the warrior strikes
This is the day that they'll be known as my enemy

Why can't you see what they're doing?
To what we believe in we rise through the pain

Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forevermore

In minds of society we all live in harmony
Truth is that we all die in vain
You stand for what you believe
I kill for what I concieve
Is there then a title for this game

Far way in the wastelands of hell full of torment and pain
Demon knights riding over the heights where fallen are slain
Violent fury of firestorming death now no life will prevail
Now you live all your days in the fires of hell

Lost in this world a total stranger
Death by the sword a common danger
You know that everything is not what it seems

Daylight ahead is only lurking

DragonForce,"Burning fires, burning lives
On the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless
So far away from home

Crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high
Forest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonight
On towards our destiny we travel far and wide
Journey through the darkness as your hearts refuse to die

In the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come
With the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun
Far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword
When the time has come for battle now we follow with the horde

We will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
In the land of long ago forever in our souls
Fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
In ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again

Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
We're all lost in the darkness so far away from home

Fallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawning
Sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice
As you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair
And they die in their sleep for the world that will not care
You feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay
There's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day

Can't you see the history the suffocating madness
In the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to go
I have traveled far and wide across this wasteland
Still searching for the answers for the right to understand

Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
We're all lost in the darkness so far away from home

Riding through starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky
A shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have died
Our only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding done
Blasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come

We will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
In the land of long ago forever in our souls
Fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
In ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again

Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago

Still lost within the misery and pain that lies inside
Here alone the fight to breathe still searching for the truth to be
Blackened by the burning fire held deep inside my mind!

Far beyond the lost horizon standing on the shore
Across the seas their hearts will bleed
There's laughter waiting for?

Taste the steel in pain we live
For glory we defend
Their fallen souls will rise to fight again!

Stand here with me, this night we'll be together
Future in our hands we'll fight with freedom glowing here
Stand here with me for we will live forever
Tonight we'll stand and face it all

Falling rain will hide the pain that lies beneath the burning flames
All hope is gone so carry on before the world will fall
Rise again to die in vain now life can never be the same
Our own salvation drawing near, I hear the darkness call

Skies are falling, thunderstorm and stand before the world
We're banished now to barren wastelands, fight the demon, oh
Riding on through black and darkness, cross the endless sands
We sail away, our victory at hand!

Together we'll be stronger
Side by side we conquer lands
And storm across the seas

Locked in the world by the fallen evil souls
Torn right apart from the roughly seam
Breaking my mind now to bring my life to war
Reach out and die with the flames
See through the lives of the red hot stabbing eyes
Now is the time to defend your crown
Destiny will call to remind us all
We fly free so far from here there's one thing we'll relay
And dreams of everlasting pain the fallen now rise again

Through the fire, through the flames like the sun we'll rise again
Lost in time, lost in space to the end of other days

See their endless ways: insanity
The quest will rage, not meant to be
In flames of hell forevermore eternally

In the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside
Now feel your soul lost in scenes of all eternity

In a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal pain

So alone in the world far away, memories of the dream will remain
As the world's falling cold and your life's all in vain

Fire in your soul will forever rise again
Nothing in your mind to remember now
Held here by the fear of the dark land calling
Fly free on endless seas, the final curtain falls
On the ground from down below, the time to lock and to load

Through the fire, through the rain, far across the distant plains
Feel the wind beneath the steel as your mind becomes insane
Save the hate of all humanity, their eyes belong to destiny
For freedom now we rise alone again

In the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside
And when the memories are all left behind

To the heavens above
Who descend unto their lies.

Running back through the mid morning light,
There's a burning in my heart.
We're banished from the time in the foreign land,
To a light beyond the stars.

In your blackest dreams see to the need, that destiny is tied.
And endlessly we're roaming free tonight.

And on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality.
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone.
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind,

Silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland,
Rise through the lost ages, hope they will bring,
Free forever more and the dream will never die.

Devil's station, the lost connection, the beatdown man returns,
So confused and alone for one more time,
Crush defeated, the force surround me, the prisoner trapped inside,
System down field with intimate tonight.

Time after time, promises of freedom,
We'll leave the past behind and strike for the first time tonight,
Still mystified, my life all creation they show,
After all of the tries we've been through,
These memories and empty words were all lost in vain,
And the scars never heal.

Cast away can it fall on the wastelands.

Send the soul from the forgotten sickness, and save his life,
Challenge the dream before the long departing, your mind is right,
Hear the burning thunder roar,

Still lost in a fire storm,
Tonight we feel the past return.

Lost inside the dream, beside the life we'll live forever,
Still the wasted time that burning we love,
One thousand shattered voices, lost inside an endless wonder,
Tonight her voice will take me home.

Shine glorious we ride, we stare into the blackened sky,
Save the last command, the virtue blinding,
So far beyond the sun, still blinded with the fire inside,
Once alone again, silence stands for our last journey home.

Ever lasting lifetime in beyond the world,
We'll travel endlessly, they're moving, he's jointed,
One man can understand his sad misery.

They've taken my heart,
They've taken my soul,
And now we stand below in sanity.

In time we'll see the past unwind,
Alive, still wander in a fallen land,
One more time we stare into the blackened sky,
For tonight, in our hearts now we feel,
One last time see our destiny reveal.

Save the last command, the virtue blinding,
So far beyond the sun, still blinded with the fire inside,

Trapped within my fierce desire, resistance is futile
Screaming for your life, nowhere to hide

Falling down, my life fading now to the end

Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me
But is it all a waste of time?

Lost in a misery, the fatal demise
Forced to a living that no one can understand
Hiding behind all the lies

Lurking around the shadows until the end
Fearless in fatal disguise

Wake from the dream, the life you left behind
Time to understand
Lost in the laughter, life ever after

And through this madness a new day will rise
We shall remember the pain she held inside
Fear the pain inside my heart, our sacrifice in vain

Voices cry out through the fear and the doubt
As we wait for our lives to be better

The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So leave the past behind

The dark clouds fading from my mind (fading from my mind)
No pain will last forever (last forever)
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So let the past now burn down in flames
Burn down in flames

Oooooh
Woah",Seasons [Acoustic Version]
DragonForce,"Outside of this world,
There's a life force still burning
Outside of this land
There's a star shining free

In silence we stand,
On a golden horizon, calling
This time there's a light for us
Still shining so bright for us
Again

Trapped inside this paradise still bleeding
While there are so many faces in this mask of lies
Blinded by the promises and the life in pain
Now the time has come for all of us to rise

Through the fires of hell between us
Through a lifetime of our dreams
Endless tears still burn inside
Beneath the sadness of our screams

And the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing through a thousand year storm
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered for the power of the steel

And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,
For the last time we cry now for freedom

Cast aside, this dying world forsakes us
Break the chains of our creation now to save our lives
Blight of all eternity and the curse of steel
Like the winter rain will tear the blazing skies

From the wastelands of destruction
With the fire we hold inside
Rise again, still glorious
For the power of all mankind

Through the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel

And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,
For the last time we cry now for freedom

Through the trials of fire behind us,
In the dark and burning skies
Fallen tears still lost inside
Within the memories of our lives

And the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel

And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,
For the last time we cry now for freedom

For the last time we cry now for freedom again!!!",Wings of Liberty

And it makes a fiery ring

DragonForce,"Her dream was to shine on the screen
Felt that was why she was born
Left all behind without a fear inside
But sometimes there's no lucky star to help you

Sun will go down, and she's all alone
Can't help but feel insecure
She'll never stop, the way to the top
Is more than she had bargained for

Her quest for the glory was real
But somehow it turned out all wrong
Heartache was never a part of the dream
Can't find a reason to keep on trying

Turn out the lights, 'cause deep in the night
Just like the thousands before
Hold up your hand, there's hope at the end
But be careful what you wish for

Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Welcome the night, 'cause not all that glitters is gold
Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Keep up the fight, and you'll find your kingdom of gold

Another night out on the streets
Finding a way to survive
Wasting your chances, destroying your dreams
Counting the tears that you cried

Hiding the pain that drives you insane
But still you're craving for more
So give me your hand, hold on till the end
And you can have what you wish for

Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be

It's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill that inside the magic holds
Seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies
And the shadows of the night will no longer hide all their mysteries come undone

When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

DragonForce,"Lost long ago through the ages of time
Once ruled immortal, the guardians of light
Bonded together, they stood side by side
Storm winds brought darkness, the world in decline

Quest for their hammers to reclaim the throne
Three brought together by warriors unknown
United to vanquish all hell from the earth
Conquering glory, the kingdom's rebirth

Raise your swords, sound the final war cry
Stand, fight, fight for your lives
Thousands will die but their deaths not in vain
Now reunited our world may be free once again

Three hammers high, in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
Three hammers high, for the world we unite
Fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high

Long have we travelled through forgotten lands
From coldest valleys to burning red sands
Restless we ride through the depths of all hell
Triumph and agony, death will prevail

Raise your swords, sound the final war cry
Stand, fight, fight for your lives
Strike back with vengeance, 'til death we defend
Until the day that the dragons will rise once again

Three hammers high, in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
Three hammers high, for the world we unite
Fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high

Strike down the unbelievers
March on for justice we now stand
Once more the path for glory
Take back the power in our hands

Long years of terror and the long years of pain
Still marching onwards 'til victory's ours once again
Victory's ours once again

Three hammers high, in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
Three hammers high, for the world we unite
Fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high",Three Hammers [Live]

Drake,"This is why I do this shit.
I think they call this, uh, venting.

Yea
Look
Uh

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein.
What up lil' braw.
What up slumville.
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That ain't how it works.
That ain't that how it goes.
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprized.
And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

Don't believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isn't new.
So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.

Don't take this the wrong way but
I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value,
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And I'll be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And Ima keep it honest.
Am so tired of being subtle.
It's just me, Forty, O, and Nich standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this from million dollar scheme.
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

Don't believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isn't new.
So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uh.

Look.
Fuck all y'all.
We ignore feelings here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killer here.
I should be on top of the world here just chillin' here.
Uh.
But it's funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance,
And build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just so real at home
People think I've changed just because my appeal's grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I'm never actually am alone, I just always feel alone.
I think I'm scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think I got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call the dream.
Yeah.
And my uncle ain't even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isn't one of those forever things.
It's funny how money can change everything.

Don't believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isn't new.
So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.

Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on

Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on

Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Drizzy, oh yeah Trey I fucking feel ya,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamilia',
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave, I always come right back here,
The young spit it that everybody in rap fear,
A lot of y'all still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Shake the lines in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no H-D,
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it,
Dis me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know that it's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.

I just wanna be, I just wanna be, successful.
I just wanna be, I just wanna be, successful.

Yeah, I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin' in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2, and forty eight hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things, hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So what's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want

I want the money, (money)

I just wanna be, I just wanna be, successful.
I just wanna be, I just wanna be, successful.

Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin' spree to get whatever is in store, yeah
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr. Damn He Ain't Copin' That Is He?
And fans of this freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin' that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much all I want is

I want the money, (money)

I just wanna be, I just wanna be, successful. (ful ful)

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it, to you

Uh pardon the swag, but bitch its cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't, miss a woman like I can't miss court dates,
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait,
Yeah life's fine but I do not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow, I want the glory,
And I'm a fuck the world, but this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cow shit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit,
And that's word to Toronto, so high up I got birds in the condo, ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell god,
Weezy baby go real hard, no further details boy.",Successful
Drake,"Uh, I'm just so far gone
October's on, Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong, where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be OK and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't 'cause

You know
Everything gone be alright
I promise
Apologize to you know
To put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but
40 Mom always say
Don't ask permission, just ask forgiveness, you know, so
Forgive me
Yea
Yeah I say

Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I've became,
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed like
How I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain

Me
Yea
Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like
Man.",The Calm
Drake,"Hey there, pretty girl, you know exactly what you got, and I don't blame you at all..
You can't resist it..
Especially when the lights so bright, and the money so right, and its comin in every single night
She don't wanna leave, she just stuck in..

Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta..she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
And she dance..to this song..and she dance to this song..and it go:
""Hey now now watch her go down""

She doesn't ever worry, if she wants it she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life, and she's scared of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air, throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air, 'cause the ones you throw will get her out of:

And she dance..to this song..and she dance to this song..and it go:
""Hey now now watch her go down""

We all got dreams and we all start reaching, all start peaking, all-star weekend..
One hotel room and all ya'll sleeping, housekeeping knock to see if all ya'll decent
Young girls envy the life ya'll leading, never satisfied with a nice calm evening
You be at the games looking right all season, but you always with me on the night ya'll leaving
Low, low, I always request you
You go get ****** up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside get you some water and undress you
I give you my all, and the next morning you'll forget:
Who, or Why, or How, or When
Tonight is probably'about to happen all over again
'cause she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, its impossible to lose you
Uh..because I never had you...
Although I would be glad to..
I probably go and tattoo..your name on my heart,
I swear
I start,
To think,
That I'm going crazy

Throw your ones up in the air, throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air, 'cause the ones you throw will get her out of:

On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping

I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard

And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard

First off
You know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out
'Cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business
So button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though, I'm so Sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and bucking when the hook drop

I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard

Hold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan
I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said ""I'm goin' in"" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club
Then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands
And I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room
Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, ""I seen it all""
I said, ""no you fucking didn't""
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said ""I can't feel my legs""
I'm like ""bitch, me neither""
I'm goin' in
Where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this life end
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in!

I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in

And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Drake,"It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,

Last name ever,
First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with,
It started off local but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
In your city faded off the brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo,
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah nigga I'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness,
Bitches,

It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,

And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,

Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams,
Big fame, big chains,
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came,
I went hard all fall like the ball teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin',
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't,
You're such a fucking loser,
He didn't even go to class Bueller,
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back,
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap,
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back,

It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,

OK, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordan's,
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden,
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target,
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops,
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top,
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention,
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas,
No brake pads no such thing as last,

It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,

There they go, packing stadiums,
As Shady spits his flow,
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow,
We can make them look like bozos,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
Fuck no go for broke,
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashing in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion and the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot,
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin',
And spit true feelings,
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face,
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake.

Drake,"All night I've been staring,
Can you tell I want you?
Can't be too wide open,
But there's nothing I wont do,
Oh, just thought you should know,
That when you start to laugh, oh
See, I just want what I can't have, oh
Want her to give me a chance, oh
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you,
Shawty if you only knew,
This is serious.

Uh, I wish I, wasn't famous,
I wish I, was still in school,
So, that I could have you in my dorm room,
I would put it on you, crazy,
Cause when you start to laugh, oh
See, I just want what I can't have, oh
Want her to give me a chance, oh

Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady rackin' up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better

And enough money to loan us, a little something extra

Drake,"Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh!t
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own, but its lookin' like July 4th
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks

Today it begins
I missed them before, but won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means.

All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh

I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me
Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious
Their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming you just get to see it go
Yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks!

Today it begins
I missed them before, but won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means.

All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh

Everything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city I let her explore
Ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
Searchin' for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, Fireworks

Today it begins
I missed them before, but won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means.

All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks

Drake,"Things have been so crazy and hectic, I should have got her back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it, It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go, if there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Farther than I've ever been
So if you gotta go, if there's any way I can help

Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner?
And tells me that my life is too much and moves to Atlanta? Damn
Of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry about you there alone
And that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories about his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
You were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous",Karaoke
Drake,"I've been up for four days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talking to themselves hoe, hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit' you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell home girl to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

Ow, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
(Uh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps feuds tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Uh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do

Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down

'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it (Ah)

And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I probly still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin' I'm a quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin', man?
Man, nobody's never done it like I did it (Ugh)

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

And this what I'm a do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne

Drake,"Yesterday when we were getting high, you were invited.
You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye,
But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.
You can stay but shawty here I go

Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it.
I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it.
I am, still here with who I started with.
The game needed life, I put my heart in it.
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit.
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.
Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.
It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a florist,
And that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous.
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.
I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.
Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.
I'm trying to do better than good enough.

What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.
But people I don't have the time to hang with,
Always look at me and say the same shit (they say)
You promised me you would never change.
You promised me you would never change.

Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.
But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,
That I barley know at all and,
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is,
I'm holding on by a thread it's,
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now,
And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.

What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.
But people I don't have the time to hang with,
Always look at me and say the same shit (they say)
You promised me you would never change.
You promised me you would never change.

Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.
The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.
Which made me question when I went missing.
And when I start treating my friends different.
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.
Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.
I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.
I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?
I just need some closure.
Ain't no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.",The Resistance

Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you are pretty
Heard that your a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what your doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

And if he say you ain't
Girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't

Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And put you in the louboutins,
What you want

Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets.
I could bring her through and shut them down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin
And your cousin fine, but she don't have my heart beating in double time
You just shut it down, girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found The One?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around its obvious you shut it down

Drake,"You could thank me now
Uh, go 'head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's o-okay,
You could thank me now
Uh, yeah, well alright, here I go

Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Aloha's to women with no ties
To men that I know well
That way there are no lies
You could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential
I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch,
What a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got the resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
And we just wanna party, patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
O-V-O clique, Red wing boot gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who'd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
I could relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time that your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
'cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
Yeah so on behalf of the demanded
And the entertainment that you take for granted
You could thank me now,
And oh my goodness you're welcome
You're welcome
At this point me is who I'm trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
But drink up because everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, that's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around

You could thank me now
Uh, go 'head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's o-okay,
You could thank me now

Uh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latte's
And low fat muffin's, do I?
Or is missing what we had outta the question
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe's who's there before it all
I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons or focus on your pro's
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow
Into women that are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allow
Where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching so I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning
You'll find it next to me
And tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas who am I to disagree
They say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
It's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the A-T-F in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
I'm sorry, poolside drinking
Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in the world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

You could thank me now
Uh, go 'head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's o-okay,
You could thank me now",Thank Me Now
Drake,"Let me know, let me know
Ooh, let me know, let me know let me know

Uh, yeah this is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven't slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I'm single thinking about what we had and missing you
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your motherfucking heart out, its Drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can't escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I'm good I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgetting from where I came
And no matter where I'm headed
I promise to stay the same (yeah, look)

I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I'm the realest nigga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest

(I just really hope that) You'll think of me
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me
(I'm doin' my thing) 'Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable

This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life, y'all say fo'ever (fo'ever)
It's hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gone get to this is a Pac T-shirt
The names young, baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I'm gone need a thug wife
Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm (yeah)
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Sayin' shit in the streets so whats the dilly
You done everything in the A but fuck Chilli (haha)
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her names the game

I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I'm the realest nigga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest

(I just really hope that) You'll think of me
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me
(I'm doin' my thing) 'Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable

Got my top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife

Drake,"Hello, yeah I just walked in, yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now? 'Did I go out' yeah I went out, I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit' wine or water
You should see someone about a cold drink, I don't know, I'm delirious' night'

Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy wit a good guy
But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around oh
(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on

""Well I'm sorry""
""Are you drunk right now?""

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

""You're not going to come?""
""Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then""

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said ""you niggas crazy""
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble",Marvin's Room

Drake,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall

It doesn't even matter",Medley: Cameras/Good Ones Go (Interlude)

Listen, listen, whoa, yeah, listen, ooh

What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fuckin' sing along
So girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C-4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C-4

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like fifty k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say ""your lyrics do shit for me""
I told my story, it made history
Tell em I'ma need reservations for twenty
I never really been one for the preservation of money nah

Drake,"All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessey and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?

Drake,"All we wanted was opportunity
Just Blaze, Lord Knows!

It’s your worst nightmare, it’s my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I’m going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don’t trust these hoes at all
But that’s just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple porn stars that I’m ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models
Heffer and Jordan my only role models
That’s why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it’s whatever if somebody wan’ make it a thing
I’m more concerned what niggas thinkin’ about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields they’re making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I’m workin’ overnighters right by the motel
Drug money, outfit record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin’ team
Matchin’ Rollies for real, matchin’ Rovers for real
Places they say they’ve been, we’ve actually going for real
I’m really killin’ shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin’
I’m going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin’ for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that’s living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they’d ever survive in this era
In a time where it’s recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin’ fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yup
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I’m a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven’t figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I’m hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin’ emotion don’t ever mean I’m a pussy
Know that I don’t make music for niggas who don’t get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I’m heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost the rate up, it’s time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin’ spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That’s why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

You know I love this
Yolo, ""You Only Live Once""
I’m going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal

I fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink
The hustle’s an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I’m talkin’ Carnival cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It’s the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every by week, shit, I’m bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R
Headlights flickin’, lookin’ like a fallin’ star
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' ye' like anime
I run the game but the ladies think I’m running game
Mink coats making women wanna fornicate

Drake,"I hate when people say they feel me man, I hate that s***.
It'll be a long time before y'all feel me, if ever

You won’t feel me until everybody
Say they love you, but it’s not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you f***ing hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered
Then forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend a** keep getting
Thicker than the plot does
And when you forget her, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for n****s dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions
About all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and gla**es of Dolce
That s*** right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
B****es smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, n****

Yeah,
It's been too long
Been way too long

I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it start? The ride
Why won't it start? The ride

You won't feel me 'til you want it so bad you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you that your paper work is finished
And steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute, you got it
You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment fifteen o three, some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But s*** you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a n****
And come out every night to let the city see the n****
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel ya n****


I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long

Why won't it start? The ride

I haven't been inside terminal one and three in so long
I'm driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking what's good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young n****s poppin' M's and sippin' dirty jones
Problem children that all be reppin' Octobers Own
Brand new girl, and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah and she just praying that it heals good
I'm bout to f*** and I'm just praying that it feels good
I really don't know much but s*** I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my n**** don't believe it
I mean sure there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading
But I blew six million on my self and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them b****es still scorching as if I didn't notice
You n****s gettin' older, I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these n****s
That couldn't f*** with my freshman flow
Look at that f***ing chip on your nephews shoulder
My sophomore I was all for it, they all saw it
My Junior and senior will only get meaner

Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it

I've had mine, you've had yours we both know

To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know,
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream

How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing ""walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah""
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance

And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don’t do nothing, I'mma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah, I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga

Drake,"Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die

But neither was making it and here I am
In the presidential do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aliyah's precious life go too soon,
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing

The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?
Well f*** let's get it then

I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say no

Loved you until now, but now I'm the n**** man
You keep talking that ""You was this and you had this
And you deserve some f***ing credit how did anyone forget it.""
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner it's my motherf***ing time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now.
I wouldn't doubt it cause these b****es all about it right now
Let's be real about this s***, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said ""you're such a dog"" I said ""you're such a bone.""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying ""Show me something.""
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then f*** let's get it then

I'm trying to let go of the past

It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry

You’ll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don’t lie
She’s losing it right now, cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit, I put you back in yo place
She tells me ""I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face""
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

I say I'd rather be with you but you are not around

Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random n**** that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to f***
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello' or ‘happy belated'
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's f***ed up, girl, I'm still f***ing wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all

Get the f*** up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like

Do you love this s***?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you f***ed your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them n****s you with is wit' you?

Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad b****es in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
B**** if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this s*** gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
S***, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions

Having a hard time adjusting to fame

I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on

When I got it I was greeted by an alien

That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz

We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as.. myself
And it didn’t help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I’m breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go

I never really had no one like you man this all new, she
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, to you got to me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's goin' through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounce but we bounce back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't where I'd really be without that,
It worked out man, you deserve it

This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done",Look What You've Done
Drake,"How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself ""why do you hurt me?""
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you love me baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club, mm
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah, you know me well nigga
Yeah, I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me, paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

I know, I know that you love me baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
'Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
But shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin' funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before huh?
I still got ten years to go huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
These kids wear crowns over here
And everything is all right

I know, I know that you love me baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body",Over My Dead Body
Drake,"People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I’m just proud of the fact that you’ve done it your way
And the weekends here started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends
That you said you might bring
If they’re the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just may already feel like I know the real her
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

They keep telling me don’t save you
If I ignore all that advice
Then something isn’t right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekends here started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too. There’s things we might discover
Cause you got a path and I do too, we’re perfect for each other

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just may already feel like I know the real her
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

Cause to her I’m just a rapper, and soon she’ll have met another
So if tonight’s an accident, tomorrow we’ll recover
And I know I’m not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don’t wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I’m with it, and I’m with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won’t know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain’t your first, but it’s better than your last, Tunechi

You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colourblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, 'cuz
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them ""that ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell ""Girl, that shit crazy!""
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies",The Real Her
Drake,"Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even steer straight, I can't even steer straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me about my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Reppin' bitches, reppin' bitches bitches
And reppin' reppin' them bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important and what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that term-end papers they won't get me paid
If I don't nothing I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga

Drake,"Yeah, uh, yeah
These are my one St. Thomas flows
Me and my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins
But trust they down to go
Discussin' life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds flow
Fine dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low

I'm in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'
These other rappers gettin' that inferior feelin'
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'
If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant

People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays
I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days
Damn I guess it does what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because
But Weezy I'm just out here reppin' us
'Til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us

Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up

Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that women is the next one on my list
I should call it a night but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all my niggas from my city tryin' to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the shit
I swear, aghh pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up
So your just wastin' your time your just only makin' me better

Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch
Now we just fuckin' all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time everything has clicked
What if I dont really do the numbers they predict
Considerin' the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
'Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect y'all to get

I'm nervous but I'mma kill it, 'cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwin' up in a huddle nigga Willie Beamen 
We're still throwin' touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Man is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions

For every one I cook, I make two clones
Mary Kate and Ashley, Tia and Tamera
Two in the Four like the Porsche Panamera
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Vision clouded by the coke, ain't making it clearer
I make it look easy, I rap it up greazy
Bandanna round the brick, I make it look look Jeezy
But I push a ton of it, get the name right
Who else could fly it in and land on the same flight?

I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!",Kitchen

That told them niggas, 'Bout you
Chuck the deuce, while I'm ridin' through
Tityboi I might sign a boob
Your nigga hatin', tell your nigga that's hatin'
That if he gettin some paper I might sign him too
'Best believe I'm just slidin' through
Put your panties to the side let me slide through
I can see you niggas from a side view
I'm in and out the pussy, drive through
White coupe, with the white rims
I like to crank the top and let the light in
You know she dark skin her friend light skin
Put us together, and it's Ice cream
Sandwiches she can't manage it
I know her man Is sick, she can't handle it
She need some time alone I told her call my phone
And when she call my phone I didn't answer it

Okay I'm in motion, I'm rollin' and smoking
And smoking and rollin' like I'm locomotion
I'm walking outside and I'm causing commotion
Got perp and champagne that's a real nigga potion
I'm burnin' bread toasin' and joking
Cause I went from views of my moms house to views of the ocean
Niggas talk shit, But that's free promotion
I'm living my life like the end is approaching
Man fuck these niggas with a passion
I'm gettin' paid from the cradle to the casket
My Grandma said boy you need to read a bible chapter
Till I bought her ass a house bigger than the Pastor's,Hallelujah
Your now fucking with a bad bitch connoisseur

Baby you don't still think about me, wet dream about me

About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
'Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford tuscan leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit

Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo

Off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow
This for shorty up on glen grove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

As hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoying yourself?
If we may we'd just like to close off with something a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all

Bitch you better have my money when I come for the shit like O.D.B.

Worst behavior

Who's hot, who not
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
Same old pimp
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed
With these funny style niggas we done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave and its back to L.A.
Open the mail, staring at the check
Enough to make you throw up man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could be Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it looks like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead of time I'm coming back on my worst behavior

Remember?

Motherfucker
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us

She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off

I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit, and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, ""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest, y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales, I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners, I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances, I just got paid like eight advances

I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets

Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out

How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with ""this time will be different"" oh

Oh the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time

Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swangin'
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume 'cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe, yeah swangin' eh

She just wanna run around the city and make memories that she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
Yea she just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler and I'd allow her,
Talk about pussy power
She used to say ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
'Cause you would learn to love people and use things and not the other way around

Swangin', eyes closed just swangin'
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking

I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe I'll be here just swangin'

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east and
Exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late 'cause this nigga's creepin' and I like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours""
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit

Drake,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that

'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn’t
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I’m living I just hope I’m forgiven
It seems like you don’t want this love anymore
I’m acting out in the open it’s hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment

Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now?
Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now

I can't help it

My mama told me this was right for me
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more

Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement

Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""

She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talking that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country and then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna, you know it

I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state

And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the east side of the city that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from your man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion

Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Yeah, looking back on it at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said no strings attached and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion

She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion

Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me

Done saying, I'm done playing
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet but I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing
Look, I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, ""Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit""
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

Drake,"I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure

How you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure",Wu-Tang Forever

Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (Need the kitchen)
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up

Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real

Done saying, I'm done playing
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet but I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out

She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it make sense why you work at the head office
In 2007 I sat in a lobby in Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like ""Nigga we made it!""
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my ladies
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
Imma just hand her a business card and say ""Nigga we made it!""
And she gotta come to the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like ""Girl he got some good dick and money""
Her friend hit her back like ""I know that already, that nigga's amazin'""
Then I send a message to both of they asses like ""Nigga we made it!""

Kinda makes me wonder
Why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down.
Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it

My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in the face and say ""Nigga we made it!""
I swear that we made it, sell out that thing, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no favors

And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited
I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans
Rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it?
Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush  and I sign at the bottom
Like ""Nigga we made it!""

Aye
We made it

Damn we made it

How long spent in the hood
Tellin' my partner
And my momma, everything gonna be all good

Now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch,

Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said ""The first mill gon' change you""
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together

Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine Coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work, ay

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you

We're sorry, you have reached a number
That has been disconnected or is no longer in service

Yeah

I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East 'cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah
They did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone

Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco but it was written

Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, hoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Wooh, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy

They don't love you like they used to man

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch

I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night
Girl I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet
Girl I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault girl 'cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should come for me when I’m lonely
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spend your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house
That you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun girl, but I hope it was worth it
'Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it I’m not here to love
Everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell I ring
You and I got options bae

But name another woman ain't no other woman
That should come for me when I’m lonely

Drake,"Having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said ""I heard you back with you know who
I told her ""Girl I'm always back with you know who""
And she like ""Who are we kidding
You're 27 you just being you
You're your father's child, man thank God you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better
Like that girl from that gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I don't pretend with this momma
I'on joke with this momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma
I'm ""Game of Thrones"" with it momma
I'm "" Home Alone"" with it momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma
It's just they cloning me momma
Them niggas wannabes momma
It's like, I'm the one they wanna be momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma
I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma
What more they want from me momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma
I'm not condoning it momma
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma
Know I don't call enough momma
I just been working with so little time for personal momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life",You & the 6

That looked just like a Bentley I
Always saw you for what you could have been
And even when its business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now were meeting out end

You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me

And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

Your so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm goin' through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you 
You judged me before you met me yeah it figures
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align

When I needed you you couldn't give me any advice
You always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving tomorrow like I'm working minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment

Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten

I'll kill somebody if they give you problems

Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you

Drake,"One of them ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza 'cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, runnin' to store for Century's
And bring 'em back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin' at they first week numbers like ""what are those""
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender love and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with depression
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinium like wrappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to St Maarten
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about they bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sowed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to back peddle
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs, arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white Hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But 'money can't buy happiness', Jelly talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
Yeah",Weston Road Flows

Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the MIA
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl, oh

Breaking you off, it's so real

I'm with you

Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping in to your emotions
Dry cry 'cause I'm hopeless
Choosy your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?

How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more 'cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son tho
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds tho
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at
How they feel about you, where you're from, where you're bed at
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time tho
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine, but I do know

Oh, you just went and turned your back dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me
Based on what I got it's hard to think that he don't hear me
Hidden like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted
Whole lot of 6's but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6 point star, lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, and now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Drake,"What these bitches want from a nigga?

On some DMX shit
I grew weak from my exes
I told 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we're not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marcus Houston
Cut's too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing to never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mind games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send them, all you text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin' make sure to tell me

What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?

Remember you was livin' at the London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career of reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade that they be throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this go
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow

Ah man, fresh up out the sand
February 10, it's the boy, but I'm still the man

It's a joke, but you say you real
I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to god, shout to Buffalo
Never ducking low
I don't stop, man I'm stuck on go
Always hug the row, fuck a Opp
Make his body roll, yeah a lot of those
Started out doing college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen

I went off in the '16, give me '17

Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything

Y'all better hit the ground, god damn
Be forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open ended
Had me all for a minute
Had you all since beginning
Damn, I must be coaching 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fucking lights on in the building
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, god damn

Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything

Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave 'em back a clean plate
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin' always duckin' my release date
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, “Are we straight?“
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face, damn
Ol' triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face
Y'all fucking hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up and scaring us
Y'all niggas is arrogant
Y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassing
Tell your big homie I'm all for going there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank Of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, east side, all that for my area

You know hun
I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone
That I'm hearing in your voice these days
I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from
And you have reason to question your anxieties
And how disillusioned you feel
As well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust
But that attitude will just hold you back in this life
And you're going to continue to feel alienated
Give some thought to this because I'm confident in you
And I know that you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals
Much more quickly without this confrontation
That I'm hearing in your tone these days
When others go low, we go high",Can't Have Everything
Drake,"Yeah
Styling though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smiling, though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though

Used to be at Silver City Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom playing dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleeping at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO
Yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when the shit gets old
Baby, it never get old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, calling plays on a rotary phone
I take a glass it don't mean ""nah, don't go with me home""
Might move our annual shit to the dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah
Ducked a lot spiteful moves
I was a angry yout when I was writing Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose but I never do
Steady doing double shifts
1da doing the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealy the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but she never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can’t describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Waking up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quite nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Can't get no sick days
I leave for like three months and six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil updates, texts in my inbox have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge watching
Went from club Paltzo in the bridge to Club Live
To not even showing up to a club unless we doing bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuing this
Distractions will do you in the truest sense
Especially people who want to lecture me and frame it like they just want the best for me or the check for me
Whatever splits it up so there's more for them and less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always trying to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like taking my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
I swear I told you I'm in this bitch for entirety
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause theres other shit that's concerning me
There's real ones around me, I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is set around competition and currency
Taking summer off 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life",Do Not Disturb
Drake,"Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain
Using you high to be reaching

So watch how you speak on my name, you know?)

You couldn’t buy the real thing

Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me

In the city life

Miracles have died in her mind
She knows the world, is deceiving
Everything is wastin' her time

It's time to get your things together

And drive away

Breathe out

You feel today it treats you better

That's what they say


Another day

Gone without a sound

But it's okay

If you turn around

And feel the memories bringin' you down



And in the end

Are you stronger

Do you no longer

Need to recover

And where have you been

Since it's been over

Over my shoulder

Under my skin

Will you ever return again...


Wake up

The monsters in your head have left you

all to your self

It's alright the

fuggly little things around you of how it felt


Another day

No one tells you what it means

what's in your way

poison in your dreams

the darkest place that you've ever been


And in the end

Are you stronger

Do you no longer

Need to recover

And where have you been

Since it's been over

Over my shoulder

Under my skin

Will you ever return again...

Drake Bell,"She stares at the moon 
Her ribbons out of tune 
Memories of the past 
At the bottom of her glass 
And resting on her cheek 
The imprint of his ring 
A symbol of the weak 
Commissioned by the king 
Did he tie you down? 
Did you make a sound? 

[Chorus]
She falls to her knees 
Screaming God please 
Make something of me 
Cause I never wanted anything like what I wanna be right now 
An angel again 
An angel again somehow 

She remembers his old boots 
And the shotgun that he shoots 
And all she could take 
Lies at the bottom of a lake 
So lift your cig and drag 
As you figure out a plan 
To hide it all away 
How could she ever love this man 
Did you weigh him down? 
Did he make a sound? 

[Chorus]

And when you carry weight in your life (life) 
And all the plans you make in your life (life) 
The original decision was right

Did he tie you down? 
Did you make a sound? 
Did he weigh you down? 
Did he make a sound?

Of saying that I love you (I do)

Now I know that life is hard
I know that love can break your heart
That's just the way that it is
Well baby that's a load of smack
Don't you know I've got your back
What's important is the way that we live
And like that way you like this song
Because it makes you hum along and tap your foot
To the beat
Well that's the way you make me feel
When we're doing it for real
I can feel it from my head to my feet

Whoever said romance was over
Roll over
So I can give you one more change to believe
And hopefully see that I still want you
Don't you want me to be the captain of you submarine

And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again

Leather and lace, denim and pearls,
Whiskey and wine, they go just fine, like you and me, girl
When you smile at me and say, there ain't no better place
Than you'd rather be than right here loving me

Drama,"This song right here, 
Is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, 
Lost city of New Orleans, we call him this

(Georgia)

Now
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard the explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965, I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now
But it's president (Georgia) Bush

We from a town where (Georgia)
Everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby I'm still praying which ya
Everybody crying but (Georgia)
Ain't nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush

Now
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the white house hating, trying to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still moving then he holding it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tch-es

Countin money all I seem to hear is benji talkin
Countin money all I seem to hear is benji talkin
Hater we ain't conversatin' it's just semis talkin
Used to be the boul
They said they have a penny on em
Now I walk around with twenty chains with like a milli on em
Lace up my boots
Put on my strap
And go lookin for that paper I'm like where it's at
They lookin at me
I'm starin back (I see you)
Feelin like I'm superman
Every time I wear this mac

Monday
It's probably 106 & park
Tuesday
Probably in the hood where it get dark
Wednesday
Probably catch me swimmin' with the sharks
With blood drippin' from my shoes
These lous coated in my heart

See dreamchasin' is a occupation
Those with the job understand the process and manifestation
A dream starts as a thought
And it's nurtured, achieved and sustained
Then we go back in our minds for more work

Let me out my cell
Right back on the mission
Fresh from off a bail
Right back in the kitchen
Who the fuck gon' pay my lawyer
I got
And like eighty grams of crack
He said the feds probably come for ya
I'm like oh lord
Copper said I tried to kill I'm when I go to court
I hope they don't find me guilty
It's my word against they word
And I won't get a chance to speak
I caught my case with nine of my niggas
And I'm the only one they beat

I took one for the team
Even though I had a dream like Martin Luther King
Who thought that I'd be cover of these magazines
Cause I be spittin' fire flow on kerosene

Lemme talk to em
Uh
Fuck y'all niggas gon' say about me
My north niggas they don't play about me
South Philly niggas that'll spray about me
A million dollar bail in a day bout me
Ain't gotta sound real cause they'll tell you that
I'm on the top floor, I started where the cellar at
Self made, bitches

I had a dream one time
It was that I was gon make a lot of money
Doin' what I wanted to do
I went after it
And it was a struggle to achieve
But you know what
I caught that bitch

One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy,
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me.
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin',
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach.
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit,

And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um.

Bet that baby.
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes.
Get back get back boy this a set back,
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap.
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone,
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones.
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on,
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on.
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush,
And when it comes to that paper I stack books.
You heard what I said,
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head.
Life ain't cheap,
You're better off dead.
If you can't pay the fee,
Shout out my nigga fee.
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key,
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see.

Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again.

If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him.

Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada.

Tie up your brother.
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you.
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'.
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will.

But I got a.. couple of dollars.. that you can borrow
Nigga, go
You're 'round my door.. you're drawin' heat
You can go.. but on this porch you destroyin' me

Have your bitch next to me in a Corvette

Around tha second line stun'n with tha loud pipes (vroom vroom)

Drama,"So I'm watchin' her fine ass
Walk to my bedroom, and thought to myself
That's the shape of things to come
She said, Why you in the club, you don't make it precipitate?
You know, make it rain when you can make it thunderstorm
I'm like, why?
The world needs sun
The hood needs funds
There's a war going on and half the battle is guns
How dare I throw it on the floor
When people are poor
So I write like Edgar Allen to restore, got a cord-
Umbilical attached to a place that can't afford
No landscaping, Or window draping
This old lady told me,
If I ain't got nothin' good, say nothing
That's why I don't talk much
I swear it don't cost much, to pay attention to me
I tell like it is, and I tell it how it could be

Requesting my services, Oh don't get nervous it's
Step yo game up time, These ain't them same old rhymes
Designed to have you dancin' in some club

A swell mood
A rather swoll' mood
Until she told me that she told dude
That she'll be back, she's going to the store
I didn't know she had a boyfriend, so the door
I pointed her to
I said, Call me when y'all break up
I don't fuck nobody bitch
And never own a Jacob, know what time it is
Nigga just tryin' to live
Like a Nigga supposed to live
If I still drink that malt liquor
I pour the beer
On the ground for niggas not around
I started off starvin'
Now they got me out here Brett Farve'n

Not a leader,
Got her 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th string
I didn't need her.
I didn't mean to treat her
Like she was the main feature

To the situation, more like a hassle
Because she had no keys to the castle

Yo Drama, take that shit back for 'em one time (uh-oh!)

Ha ha, cocaine in the flesh
Been in the game since Brand Nubian was spittin', reign of the tec'
I done spit lyrics for DJ Jam Master Jay and Kid Capri
Now it's DJ Drama, now you all on the dick lil' mama?
Where the fuck was you at when a nigga was on the block? (where you at?)
When the nigga was drivin' dirty Nike's with no knot (where you at?)
Before the Billboard number one spot
It was so hard to get a bitch to get down and suck on a cock
Before rockin' the Bentley and I got so popular
Thuggin' with the G.D.'s you wouldn't see me even with binoculars
Steady actin' like you ain't been ran through
Never gave a nigga no pussy now you sweatin' and talkin' 'bout you a fan too
Before the Vin houses and the trucks and Impalas
Tell me where was you at when the nigga needed a couple of dollars
I remember her off the block, now I can't fuck with lil' mama
Walk off on that hoe, I'd rather let another bitch holla

[Chorus]
Spend the rest of the life in the trap bein' grimy (oh yeah)
On the grind tryin' to stay out the county (oh)
Limit ties when I ain't had no money (oh yeah)
Got bread now, these bitches all on me
Cause underneath all the cars and clothes (cars and clothes)
The lights, the bling, and oh
Oh oh oh, diamonds and gold
Underneath all the diamonds still cold, yeah

Yeah, L.A.D., uh,
Bitches used to say ""ugh,"" now I got pull
My life like Ace, from ""Paid in Full""
Low like a turtle, my queen mad fertile
Run a marathon, same time, jumpin' hurdles
Put a broad on a plane, brick in her girdle
Why I'm still here, got my life in gear
Fuckin' a rich white bitch like Britney Spears
Runnin' in her hard like a car hit a deer
Live life no fear, boxed in like a square
Two Coronas with lime, sip my beer
My vision's so clear from the front to the rear
That's why I'm reclined in a La-Z-Boy chair
Can't see me like I'm air, but I'm there
Mean I'm here, like Ray Lewis or Steve McNair
Real Hall-of-Famer, real big gamer
Semi-automatic or a four-fifth flamer, blaow!

[Chorus]

It's a blessin' to be still in the game
Considerin' where I came from the music changed
Some would continue to hang
I'm, right where I oughta be
Whatever obstacle in the way, won't let it bother me
Grindin' since the early teens in my dirty jeans
Now I'm on the scene fulfillin' my worldly dreams
So get yours, I'll get mine in due time
We'll be able to survive some lunatic rhymes
But nowadays you gotta find different ways
To keep your pockets on fat, who got it? Where it's at?
Shit, you gotta go get it
The road you gotta hit it, the show money's splitted
Yeah, and if everybody wit it we can make somethin' happen
With the push of these buttons and some cut-cuttin' and scratchin'
I've been rappin for years, and I think I'm gonna
Sang or do anything other than slang on the corners
I'm gone

Drama,"Yea I'm gettin' money is my exclamation
The Lambo's milked out, no expiration
And I ain't ask for a estimation
I just pass the cake off, no hesitation
Ya see I'm nothin' like y'all guys
I just do the stuntin', y'all niggas fall guys
And everyday I get the benny washed
It's deja vu like denny wash
Budget too big, billionaire a hurt a label
Play it tight, spray the creed on the purple label
Pie vay settings, Jacob got me linked up
The Bentley wag bulletproof like a brinks truck
C.b.l, we don't care what ya homies sell
Rubberband around the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a hoe sweeter than Damita Joe
She act conceited tho and I'm a get deleted yo
I'm not a musician, but I play a instrument
The ragin' bull handle any kind of incident
The black latex, D's can't get the print
The flyin' spur so fly, I had to get the bent
Got initials on the door scrap, initials on the floor mat
I ain't braggin' homeboy, dis my format
The 22's look like they ridin' on four flats
Young octopus, I carry arms
I draw to challengers, with Cavali carry-ons
Freck billionaire, I'm the 1 with the bling
Got canaries on the wrist, not the ones with the wings
A real hood nigga, I got a lavage flow
I could push you into theaters like magic tho
You don't want beef, you just want raps
I get ya lil' ass smoked like a blunt wrap
C.B.L spray, what da fuck did you thought
I tote the cig, but I don't mean Newport
I wash my money up the laundry way
I stay Gucci'd down even on my laundry day
The linen clean, splash ya ?
Double blue 62 smash ya limousine
You could set trip, but I get the ammo near
Like a bad alibi, switch up the lambo gear
These other rap niggas, they could'nt hold a candle near
They got it all screwed up, like chandeliers

I'm gettin' money is my quotation
Family man, so I need the lambo station
Slick talk, I'll put a chamber into rotation
Director style, I shoot em on location
My hoe's haitian, trenny and croatian
Ass clap louder than an oprah ovation
Double d's on her chest like daredevil
I shoot dames at a 900 a pair level
I'm in perotta, the color of ricotta
Cheese, please you can't tell me not a
I don't share keys, nor do I give her codes
I set run through records down on river road
Then I switched up, posted on palleysay
The denali stay, smellin' like cali grade
I come through bar, numba 9 squirts
Osama rich, that's the hard to find shirt
Ya rocks keep 2 they selves, well mines flirt
They 2 clean, board of health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch, and I'm screamnin' it like ashy larry
They call me brinks boy, maybe it's the cash I carry
Rubberbands pop, you gon' need a scrungee for me
She a jump off, bet the chick a bungee for me
I came a long way, and I still stroll the avenues
Move and style, louis v roll and travel
Local nigga, you never been to poland have you,
So you couldn't judge me if you was holdon gavels
And I used to get the raw from olivia
That was back when raven symone was olivia
I did the take-out, meanin' that I ran orders
I had the transporter sittin' by the land borders
The rocafella a make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin' in June, it's comin' back with grand-daughters
So homie if you got a weapon tote it
You can't jump ship, niggas won't accept you boated
When I was doin' it 4 t.v, I kept it loaded

Summertime in apartment 409,
Had to clean up the kitchen with 409,
It Was cookin' up work, while my granny at work
My big cause he ain't understand me at first,
He said, the court room or the casket,
I'm like dude, either way you need cash and a nice suit,
The street lights where I found my strength
Be with four rich men, and you bound to be the fifth
Let's go

I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, so I won't have to live this street life,

No more, no more 
No more, no more no

Just gotta learn to deal with problems,
If you're young and from slum with no father,
Got killed when you was little, still got mama,
She try to tell him go to school, but why bother
When gettin' paid is the only way to solve 'em
Seems the stars get farther and farther
Out of my reach, out of these streets,
Will they ever make it big

Told my mama don't cry for me,

Thinkin bout my dad I wish I had him back,
I'd give up everything just to have him here,
After this storm and rain I have no fear,
Gotta keep holdin on, hold my head up strong,
I know it won't be long until we'll be together again, foreal

I'm livin' for the moment
If I could turn back the days
Sure, you could turn this back
Hey, I was born with the hustle, never been a sucker
Daddy wasn't in the crib, dat made me tougher
Momma struggled with the bills, dat made me stuff up
Powder in a sack, which made me dumber
Now I'm standin' on the corner, bag full of Marijuana, Crack
Pistol my pocket for anybody who disrespect
In the trap chillin' where robbers and killers, kick it at
My arms up in the feds for ten, they say I'm goin' in
Ha, bet dat I'm a stretch that, backish to this rappers
Show these niggas what I'm best at
Get a lil' check, flip it and invest that
Years later, oh now you see what my heads at
Like meals chasers, we be everywhere the bread at
You keep on hatin', you'll be layin' where the dead at
You rappers suckers, you can tell them that I said that
If nothin' else but the hustle, you gon respect that

Oh yeah

Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday,

Takes everything you've got.
Taking a break from all your worries,
Sure would help alot.

Wouldn't you like to get away?

All those nights when you've got no lights,
The check is in the mail;
And your little angel
Hung the cat up by its tail;
And your third fiance didn't show;

Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came;
You want to be where you can see,
Our troubles are all the same; 
You want to be where everybody knows your name.

Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead; 
The morning's looking bright; 
And your shrink ran off to Europe, 
And didn't even write; 
And your husband wants to be a girl; 

Be glad there's one place in the world 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came; 
You want to go where people know, 
People are all the same; 
You want to go where everybody knows your name. 

Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came;

And forgot to tell me twenty five to eternity.
Now picture me, in a GS3 with all my fold
Versaci Coat, and Armani lobe from slangin' coke.

My occupation clockin' six figures so deal with it.
My mob be cannon, pealin'? over Teflon protect my belly
From nine millimeter cannon while talkin' on celly's daily

Hey who the man who supply the man who supplying you with a couple grand?
Interracial freedom for some luxuries This ain't the bet.
Nigga materialistics can't substitute for your happiness.
Life's about how you feel about you and what you do
When you waking up in the morning you seeing who?
I think you niggas done bit off more than you can chew
Cause you don't even know why you do half that hot ass shit you do.
Why I'm trappin' 'cause it's the only job with fair taxes.
Keep a nigga in tight to death in Polos and air maxes
I'm blastin' these niggas daily whenever they try to play me
Baby you wanna lay me, but baby you gotta pay me.
Nigga you owe me cheese, that's ground for beef
I'm rollin' with the P$C with a pound of chief.
Hey if this rap shit don't work, I'm stuck slangin' drugs, 
Until I make enough money to go and buy me a club.
I got thirty six ounces that I got to move 
And twenty keys comin' to me on the fourth of June.
Soon as the school year ends, I pick up my keys
So crank the V12 to down to females and place em with cheese.
Two hundred G's for the package, but they 10-5 a piece now.
On the streets they goin for 21-5 at least
21-5 times twenty Look that's 4-30
But listen closely cause the dope game get more dirty.
If I cut em into ounces, 28 grams for 800 a piece
Hey thirty six of them in a key, more cheese for me.
Now there's 28 G's and 800 cash just for one key, 
And I got nineteen more stashed.
Two hundred and eight G's at eight hundred times nineteen more, 
Come out to 5-4-7 comma 2-0-0
That's 547 G's and two hundred
Forty seven G's you can ball 200 get blunted
The other 500 G's invest it in keys
So I can triple my cheese and have a million at ease.
