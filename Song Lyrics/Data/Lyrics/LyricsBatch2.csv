Aerosmith,"Stagecoach lady, hourglass body
Makin' thinks glow in the night
Well, she would if she could
And she'd be good if she would
Only tell her lover she be out tonight

'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad can't get me none of that
Salt lake city, salt-lickin' bitties
Bogies turn, stinkin' of gin
Well my daddy was hard
His face was pretty scarred
From kickin' ass to playin' poker to win

'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad
Can't get me none of that
It's too bad
It's too bad can't get me none of that

New sold lady my mama Cady
Chivalry was born at her feet
Well she should have thought twice when pa showed his dice
Imagine put my daddy to sleep
'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad can't get me none of that
It's too bad
Lord, it's too bad
I said it's too bad
Lord it's too bad, yeah
I said it's too bad
It's too bad
You know it's too bad
Ah, it's too bad",S.O.S.
Aerosmith,"Flatbush boy cruisin' sheepshead bay
His boardwalk mama just a sniff away
Underground D.M.T. ridin' thunder train
The Coney Island whitefish boy is on the run again

Ooh, runnin' with the pack
Ooh, never lookin' back
Ooh, knows just where he's been
That Coney Island whitefish boy's been there and back again

Sixteen years with his boardwalk queen
And at Steeplechase she used to wet his dreams
She combs her hair, that flaming jewel, streaked with Chlorox bleach
Coney gettin' down and dirty, snortin' up the beach

She'd be screamin' Coney
She'd be dreamin' Coney
Go get 'em Coney
Coney

Bone to bone screamin' Coney
She'd be screamin' Coney
Get back in town
Get back in town
Get back, get down
Get back in town

She'd be screamin' Coney
Best believin' Coney",Bone to Bone (Coney Island White Fish Boy)
Aerosmith,"I met a babe in a backseat drive-in
Back in the saddle she'd sit
Pulled on the reins just to keep me risin'

She loved to chomp at the bit
Daddy do it, ooh, just do it
Daddy do it, please let me see
Do it, please just do it daddy
Do it, do it, drivin' me crazy

She always walks with her eyes down on her bootlace
She lives to give it away
She don't believe in the right time or the wrong place
She's always liable to say

(Cheese cake) Looser than her sister
(Cheese cake) Mmm, her sugar gets me high
She knows I can't resist her (cheese cake)
Got my fingers in her pie (cheese cake)

(Cheese cake) Sneakin' out the back door
(Cheese cake) Rollin' down the lawn
Everybody's kissed her (cheese cake)
At the crack of dawn (cheese cake)",Cheese Cake
Aerosmith,"Ooh, on the beach at cartegena
She, salty baby with the name-a
Oh, chiquita
Oh, love chiquita

She, takes to walkin' in the sunshine
She, she'll be lovin' till the moon shine
Love chiquita
Oh, love chiquita

She, got the poppy-eyed desire
Tease, till the boys put out the fire
Love chiquita
Oh, love chiquita

Oh no no, now don't you wake me up I'm dreaming
No no no, if you shake me I'll be screaming
Love chiquita
Oh love chiquita",Chiquita
Aerosmith,"Hush-a-bye my baby soft and new
Ooh her loveliness, gypsy dance in the rain
Hush-a-bye my baby what you do
Ooh, the baby cries, the wind she's a-callin' your name
Mia

Where you came from you ain't alone
Live and loved from the old jaw bone
Ahh don't you cry, you're home sweet home

Rock-a-bye sweet lady gypsy blue
Ooh, the nightingale's singin her song in the rain
Hush-a-bye sweet lady soft and new
Ooh don't you cry, the wind she's a-screamin' your name

Come too soon that sunny day
You give your heart away

Aerosmith,"Nineteen seventy one
We all heard the starters gun
New York is such a pity
But at Max's Kansas City we won

We all shot the shit at the bar
With Johnny O'Toole and his scar
And then old Clive Davis said
I'm surely gonna make us a star
I'm gonna make you a star
Just the way you are

But with all his style
I could see in his eyes
That we is goin' to trial

It was no surprise

The boys kept kickin' ass
As usual time would tell
But some bitch in the choir
Threw water on the fires of hell
She loved to show and tell
Lord she loved to tell

But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial

And it was no surprise
No surprise
No surprise
No surprise

Midnight lady
Situation fetal
Vaccinate your ass
With a photograph needle

I say
Look it here
Friend of mine
Scratch like you need calomine
Flamingo boots
Sole's a creakin'
Still in love and Puerto Rican too

Ridin' on the wheels of hell
Smokin' in our axle grease
Oh the backstage is rockin'
And we're coppin' from the local police
That's right the local police
Or the justice of peace

But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial

Baby it's no surprise
No Surprise
No Surprise
No Surprise

Rock and roll
Junkie whore
Got my foot inside the door
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock
Nobody's keepin' score

Bad times
Go away
Come again some other day
Topaz and sazzafrazz
Will keep the blues away

Candy store
Rock and roll
Corporation jellyroll
Play the singles it ain't me
It's programmed insanity

Could ever make a mountain fly
If Japanese can boil teas
Then where the fuck's my royalties",No Surprize
Aerosmith,"I got a reefer headed woman
She fell right down from the sky (good Lord)
I got a reefer headed woman
She fell right down from the sky

Well, I gots to drink me two fifths of whiskey
Just to get half as high

When the good Lord made that woman

Aerosmith,"Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away 'cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me

It said that we was through
She found somebody new
Oh, lemme think, lemme think, what shall I do?
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no...

(Remember) Walking in the sand
(Remember) Walking hand in hand
(Remember) The night was so exciting
(Remember) Her smile was so inviting
(Remember) Then she touched my cheek
(Remember) With her fingertips
(Remember) Softly, softly we met with a kiss

The girl that said she'd be true

When will the good people have their say

Take a while, think about it

Who can be the king or be the clown

That which is now, will be again
Who can decide who is insane

Aerosmith,"Take a walk in the warm New England sun
Ain't no time to look for clues
You get the point from Uncle Sam's loaded gun
Who be the hand that light the fuse, ah

Take a look, take a look at my old billy goat
He used to raise all kinds of hell
He took a dose of radiation dope
Back in the barn is where he fell, like hell

Aerosmith,"Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy

Got to get back to the real nitty-gritty

Yes sir, no sir

From a J Paul Getty and his ear
With a face in a beer

Get out in the field,
Put the mule in the stable
Ma, she's a cookin'
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city and my love's in the meadow
Hand's on the plow and my feet's in the ghetto

Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothin'
Ain't no good when bossman's stuffin' it
Down their throats with paper notes
And their babies cry while Cindys lie at my feet
When you're rockin' the street

Mamma take me home sweet home

Aerosmith,"Backstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the cover
'Till I talked to my daddy he say
He said, ""You ain't seen noting
'Till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways""

I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I can reminisce
Ah the best thing lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Started with a little kiss, like this

See-saw swingin' with the boys in the school
With your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You be swingin' like you just didn't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
Taught me how to walk this way
She told me to

Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Ah, just give me a kiss

School girl sadie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt climbing way up her knees
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me

I was a high school loser
Never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbour
With a daughter had a favour
Took me just a little kiss, like this

See-saw swingin' with the boys in the school
With your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You be swingin' like you just didn't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?

Told me how to walk this way

You gotta dance to the tune of Bolivian Ragamuffin

The wax museum and nobody gets to see themselves
There's others care to see what nobody wants to be a baby

Never make third base like a toilet bowl cleaner
Like a squawk eight fool in I don't know orogotus

Aerosmith,"What a stormy night, when I met the pony,
It was so dark, that I could hardly see,
It smelled so sweet, you know who and Joanie,
So many butterflies, one could not see...
We all could feel desire, took off in flight,
It was hotter than fire, then came the light.
I smell the heat, the dancing ponies,
Unwrapped his wings, to dry off Joanie,
The pony he grew in size, the thunder and rain,
And finally realized, what was, what it does, and what it come to say.
Love to kiss the cheek of mother nature, nobody here can deni such things,
Make the ladies you love come honey, no butterfly should be denied its wings...
He was kick ass rocking horse! He was like a hell bent tied to the Gavin pole,
He was a one time fantasy, I got the bare bones riding to the Holy Land,
Bare backed, riding like a running man, nightmares,
And he can't hold the candle to my dreams!
We rode the night, and took to wing, it was so all right, it was everything,
We flew into burning skies, the thunder and rain, and finally realized,
What it is, what it does, and what it come to say!
No, no, no, no, took off in flight,
No, no, no, no, then came the light.
Flashback, somethings coming over me, no sweat one time fanatsy.
Bare bones all in the wind it seems, hell, who's the chick,
That rides into my dreams?
No Libury,
No stablize,
No one try to please,
Nobody's eyes.
We'll never see us again, tell me when it passed,
Let it all begin, but all of that time, somebody shot an arrow...
Being tempted by the time is never,
Breaking me cause your cold sometimes...
Being seduced by your own pleasures,
Being king on your own time...
He was a kick ass rocking horse, he was a...
One horn, unicornucopia,
Two, two in utopia,
Three star, verge in to infinity,
Four, four, ya... yaa hoo...",Joanie's Butterfly

Blades gonna flash when streets gang clash

And the combat zone it's your means of survival
Gonna get last licks on a suicide blitz
With a broken dagger knife

'Twas the biblical cord of life
Then noticing 'twas connected to his head

How strange, not to believed

And you know who pushed and gushed
The waters of life
First two hooved feet, then the shine of his fur

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you

With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Aerosmith,"Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write it today
I'm goin' away

Well, I've been away forever
Suicide's crossin' my mind
But I'll never get so far behind
I said, the ways of the night are evil
Without that Lord of day

But I'll never get so far away
I said write me, write me, write me

Well, there's nothin' I can see
That'd ever make me want to be without her
She good, she good to me

Said there's no way to explain
The kind of feeling that you get out in the
She good, she good to me
She good, she good to me

I love her
Well, I've been so many places
Hidin' from the wind and the rain
But you could write me a letter
For to save me from a-goin' insane

Aerosmith,"Kickin' down the road
Feelin' mighty slowed
With the likes of you
Gettin' mighty spaced
Never had a taste
Of what you're goin' through
I can't bitch
Went from rags to riches
Then to ragtime screamin' the blues
I want to know why
Everybody's good intention
Try to make a fool out of me
I want to know why
Everybody's good intention
Gotta make a fool
Gotta make a fool
Try to make a fool out of me
Swing low
Sweet cherry o
When a strange love showed me the way
Ya see more
Can't keep a score
When the whore's comin' on for the play
E. Poe
Eatin' crow
Wonder if he knowed that the raven was mad
Time passed
And words lost the last
Of the best thing he ever had
Oh play rough
Can't get enough
So they try to make a fool out of me, lordy
Ain't foolin' me
Ya ain't ghoulin' me
Ain't foolin' me
Ya ain't ghoulin' me","I Wanna Know Why [Live Version from Texxas Jam Concert: Cotton Bowl, Da"

Now I'm feeling low down
Even slow feels way to fast
And now the booze don't work

We fell asleep out on the lawn

Aerosmith,"I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through
The pain

When I lost my grip
And I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave, but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired
Of livin' a lie
I was wishin' that I would die

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

That one last shot's permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street,
Just a tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light

When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
Oh, it's amazing

I went to night school for the blues
I took some stuff they said would cool ya
But nothing seemed to light my fuse
But it's all in the past
Like a check that's in the mail
She was a tall whiskey glass
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail
Until I met a blind man
Who taught me how to see
A blind man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm gonna make you come with me
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away

I've had some lovers like a joy ride
Some things are never what they seem
My heaven's turned into a landslide
I thank God I woke up from the dream
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds
The way bees chase honey
And drink all the flowers dry
We'll be saving us a little money
And if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why
Don't make no sense lightin' candles
There's too much moonlight in our eyes

Know what I was thinkin'
(What?)
I, I really don't think that the animal cracker
Qualifies as a cracker
(Why?)

Well, 'cause it's sweet which is an in suggest cookie
And when you put a cheese on something
It's sorta the finer characteristic
Of what makes a cracker

Why I thought of that, I just
(Baby, you have such sweet fill-up talk)
Ya got like a little animal cracker, Discovery channel thing
Watch the gazelle as he grazes through the open plains

Now look, as the cheetah approaches
Watch as he stalks his prey
Now the gazelle is a little spooked
He could head north to the manless peaks above or south

The gazelle now faces mans most parlous question
North or south way down tune in next week
(Baby, do you think it's possible)
That anyone else in this world
Is doing this very same thing at this very same moment?

I hope so
Otherwise what the hell are we trying to say?

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Taught me how to walk this way

Little skirt climbing way up her knees
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me

I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbour with a daughter had a favour
Took me just a little kiss, like this

Were ruled by lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold they dared
To bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines 
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws 
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive
Oh I know I 
Lived this life afore
Somehow I know now 
Truths I must be sure
Tossin', turnin', nightmares burnin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships, the Viking spits
The blood of father's land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death, fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries

Follows true to all who do or die
Screams of no reply
They died
Screams of no reply
And died

Aesop Rock,"Verse One:

The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season
I imagine sloppy seed handling avoke the stroke of tardy planting
And the crops we'd have harnessed in mid November
It only brushed the blossom bracket then soon sacrificed
Lives to icicle jackets when the frosted
I sunk to find the walk beneath the mosses
Where the planted tunnel pass after the rains have run their courses
But alas the portraits of these frosted corpses tortured in the grass
Off of distorts or pour the one tall glass and nauseous
And I'm asking you, why's this spy supply hiding in strangers
When they know atop the food chains I could spot biters for acres
Now be gracious, these minstools turn a bully's psycho civil
By dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels
Yelp bringing the self-stop freedom brigade investors
And the studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors
Puts it down, and it's down beneath your sappy sing alongs
So stick it further down where the daunted decide which ring I'm on
Nova yell just took positions and advance march
Parts playing a scheme parking the rain in my canteen now I'm like
Point I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads
Counterpoint during my famine I never got broke your bread
Well equation of intrigue, yes, yes, let me fed sit for a bit
These 'tensils need soaking before I hand out token
""Shut the fuck up"" drama like Kabuki with a heart of dirt
Skull fucked cross bones hence my birth it hurts

Must not sleep must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers

Sometimes I take it all and still can't feel this pitfall in my gut
And I'm like must not sleep must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers

But it's ridiculous at times that's why I tore 'em with this warning

Verse Two:

Wanting the glory of our advance fire ants to water beetles
Free masons adjacent debasing on pins and needles
Pupil turned pedagogue benedicts into my dream
Beam in a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine
I pluck the pedals off a classic blood rose one at a time
Gripping the stem and right invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline
A metaphor for nighttime, ante up the slight cost of exhaustion
To salute the moon of our paradise lost and you're a spectator
Stringent, inch by sacred inch shoveling colon in my earthworm soul
Borough up through the dirt with bloody digit lick my knuckles clean
Noting the corporate clusters holding hands round the abode of the dam
And what's your poison? Starlight and amaze her with a nicotine chaser
Sip it clean savor the taste then sit and dream later
The ollage pay their back upon they hinges twenty miles
Across the glassy eye window of one less to passes by
Now I'm six foot four with a sick flow walk up just to recline
With no free time, the alarm storms at nine
My daytime's on some, yes sir, okay sir, right away sir
Sir do you mind if I breathe sir oh you do? Well excuse me sir fuck you
I breathe slow, I'm running with these fantastic amalgams
Painting casket bound careers to pierce gunning with classic albums
Security's the javelin, catch it; labor
Clocked in at seven six and haven't clocked out ever since

But that's got a ring to it so my swill welcomes the flood

Via the study of post-adolesent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self pride at Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the hot that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self pass the word, eyeing stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And someone, I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics

They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine

For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel heartstring Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding ""Gimme that""
So we can retain baby fat

Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, you'll turn, squeeze, ending
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It can roast my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
'cause every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away

Now we the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general 
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pasttimes 
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the landshark
Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
They're out there being slaughtered
In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the waterbug
Cockroach utter thug specimen
Your response, dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in 
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
God it's the year of the underpaid employee
Spitting forty plus a week 
And trying to rape earth on my off time
You bought dizzy, I can't keep myself busy enough
So you can run run run
And I'ma let you think you won
EVERYBODY!

We the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general 
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine to five day-in day-out
But we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pasttimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
If I never make it home today, God bless

Yo
I take 10 steps with a bed lamped vision
Study the disorders we've absorbed inside the village
I understand the plagues and shake hands with my grimace that remain up in
My face like top to bottom train car feelings
Lets question the ascension of a broken social icon in various domino affect
I'm blow this hex over the mission
Just to administer the indoor sucker punch to it's pitiful condition

With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
That's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots
As the truth hits your ears begin to cry
'Why Is It Like This!' Why the fuck do I care?
I don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear
City lights look like bright groups of fire flies
Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies
Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries
Spit sparks speak to the streets
The skid marks are replies
Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals]
The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you)
As I walk out my door, step into the pollution
(I breathe in the problems) exhale solutions
Physically the situation's hard to stop
I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks
Casualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle)
Abnormal abdominals (push-ups phenomenal)
Relaxin drinking my 6-pack maxing
Faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue (push it)
Table talk, salt and pepper conversation
Integrated sectors, metropolis and mecca
It's a conspiracy (you know), I can't lie dukes
Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do

[Chorus (Aesop Rock):]
It goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its stagnant, act of development first of madness

Thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
 
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its hurtin, act of development first diversion

A new universe in ancient, so I stay patient
In a gravel pit, travelin thoughts and ravelin, pacing
Embracing light of America, and found a shade of darkness (underground)
The train car used to be my apartment
Sick of people rushin in the doors before I get out
Conductors closing the doors before I get in, I shout
'The Biz is Coming, The Biz is Coming!'?
Don't get worried now (We've been in a cold world!)
We just getting flurries now?

Yeah, its like slow down,
You're movin much to fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass
Its delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang
But we like 1970 something twenty clicks outside your name (tear obedience)
I apologize for the faulty academics
But they placed us in a miserable stasis
I let bygones be bygones
But tryin to see eye to eye with the face lift
Just ain't working the way the manual paints it
See I soak in a blue note factory
While most cats hassle bandits lamping solo
And when the last red brick topples over the earth
To intercept your crooked little mess
I can be found in a social coma directly to your left
Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath
Regarding how to document the shady baby steps
I bounce checks like a modern
Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
Together specimens from the promise land
This for the thinkers
This for the merchants allergic to they own stingers
This for the absurd verdict linkers
This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions
But can't remember where his drink is
I'm wallowing, shrugging I'm plugging your corporation
'Cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation
Answer this: when all that's said and done
Are you a memorable troop or just a lab rat on the run
Choose one

Aesop Rock,"Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was joshua, age 10
Bully of the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree, and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler on her weekly trip down to the bingo
parlor
And she drew
Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew
Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passers-by
They'd ask her why she passed her time
Attachin lines to concrete
But she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
""Hey little Lucy, want to come jump double dutch?""
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
""I'm busy, thank you much""
Well, well, one year passed
And believe it or not
She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk,
And she stopped-
""Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today??""
She said:
""I'm not giving in, I'm finished,"" and walked away

(Chorus: x2)
1 2 3
That's the speed of the seed
A be	 see
That's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream
Or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it
'cause dreamers always chase
But never get it

Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
And she drew
Little bobby who would come to sweep the porch
And she drew
The mailman, delivered everyday at 4
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
But she found it suitable, and she liked it that way
She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on saturdays to share the pictures that they drew
(Look!)
Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
Just one of the neighbors,
Actin nice, although she was a strange girl, really
Say, ""Lucy, want to join me for some lunch??""
Lucy would smile and say ""I'm busy, thank you much""
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
And lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
'cause while they spread their rumors through the street
She'd paint another masterpiece

(Chorus x2)

Lucy was 87, upon her death bed
At the senior home, where she had previously checked in
Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest
Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen
And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn
Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
Lucy pinned up a life worth's of pictures on the wall
And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all
No Rico, he had passed, 'bout 5 years back
So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock o' nothin
She'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside
And she said:
""Look, I've never had a dream in my life
Because a dream is what you want to do, but still haven't pursued
I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
So i've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!""
Well!
The nurse jumped back,
She'd never heard Lucy even talk,
'Specially words like that
She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind
Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures
And she died.

(Chorus x2)

When they asked him what he pled he said, ""You're fuckin' up my color!""

[Mr. Lif]
Okay, Jose is working in the slaughterhouse
Said he's living in the hood, but he wants to get his daughter out
Slipped off a ledge, and fell into a machine
Another dead immagrant, that's the American Dream

[Aesop Rock]
Miss Molly, helpless, made a penny with a data entry temp gig
Overqualified by the rent sticks
Red brick bash with a texted green screen
Like, ""I entered my data right into your screen""

[Mr. Lif]
Jane went insane, she's an anchorwoman
Sick of pusing skewed information
And abusing the nation
Had a few options:
Either jump or run
Critical ways or waving a gun
Time for see-H-A-N-G-E
Held a knife to the VP on TV
She demanded that the format be expanded
Beyond fair, everybody clear, understand it?

[Aesop Rock]
Billy was a coke fiend
[Mr. Lif]
Maggy was a cop
[Aesop Rock]
Like a dope he stole green
[Mr. Lif]
She patroled the block
[Aesop Rock]
Banking off his old scheme
[Mr. Lif]
She recognized his plot
[Aesop Rock]
He thought he was home free
[Mr. Lif]
She knew that he was not
[Aesop Rock]
Now it's off to the jail in a blue squad car
[Mr. Lif]
She pocketed the crack before they got far
[Aesop Rock]
Billy watches Maggy from behind steel bars
Like ""Where the crack went?""
[Mr. Lif]
 ""I'ma smoke it tomorrah""

[Aesop Rock]
They call him Larry Luck
Blackjack, big spender
He was married once
Till he bet her ring finger
Seen leaving Las Vegas
With a pick up truck, diamond
forty large, and beautiful wife piece
Than what he came with
Itched to get rich found nickels in the couch
Hitched back to the casino with in an hour
Said ""I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents""
And was immediately shot to his death over debts

[Mr. Lif]
As Colin died, his mother cried
By the EMS survived
Said that he could be revived but they lied
Afterlife realized that water from the skies
Washes pain from our eyes so our hopes could rise

[Aesop Rock]
Now, J.J. punch drunk, acts like a dumb fuck
Bum touched girls looking young enough to thumb suck
Once sought a life thought it right to write about
Now gets raped by aryans in the big house (OUCH!)

[Mr. Lif]
Ted did 20 years for growing some weed
Though he used to snort coke and dabble with speed
Welcome home, homie, here's a blunt with that
You know the rules, bitch, take two and pass

Some cats grow by the laws of the wild
Some learn slower and lag in the mud
Some stand up in defense of a style
Some let the big dogs eat them up
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st I fell asleep sound
At exactly 11:35pm on Januray 21st some shit went down

[Aesop Rock]
I got one Jack or Jill
Jill won't, Jack will
Jill didn't, then did it
Jack fell
No cellophane secrets, be	
I guess I sense two felt bumps in the tar
No cell
But hell, you jump the bar so well
Parted your partners veil and dipped
I'm New York harbor
Tale of a sail, ripped sorta
Stuck on purpose for tha love of birthplace
But would have carried you home inside of my teeth anyday
Turns out I wasn't cast in the master plan anyway
He holds no grudge, holds his tongue, wow
Same one she used to hold in both smiles
? instinctual last shout if it killed me
So you can ride up in the sun city guilt-free
One year passed, the table is wobbling and your hollerin' back
Sippin the fits you skip when shit cracks
They never missed it
Not a long haul, bullshit, kids kicked into the sink
Shoebox, with a flicks of lipstick
I'll love you forever, 'cause you know me better
For the record, at one time, would have married you in a second
But killed all our kindling dreams, and never get the friendship
Or else by the time the stress wears out we'll both be dead and friendless",11:35

Hot I gotta be cool
I was on the brink of fiends truth
Livin in the green room
Made a brother the same color but beyond neon
Pushing me to peon
Barking at dreams to be gone
???talent and many they haven?t any
Was especially a challenge 
When you be like goddamnit
Can he lift his vocal
As he?s cuffing it, how my mic sound?
Thinking on the low, it?s perfect when he put the mic down
Clown stand steady, willing wanting subservient
Sound man blurting in thinking I?d fucking murder them
Steaming when I?m watching duke
Scheming on some hot pursuit
Gotta win as these cats be modelin? what not to do

In a getaway car, car, car, car

Six in the morning
And the walls close in
High noon calls
And the walls on him
Kings at the ready
Now the walls won?t win

Aesop Rock
Storms on the harbor, like a harbinger of bore
Gore?s my harbinger, pardon the art of war
Get your door?s darkened by the house of card carpenters
Who never thought a slave could be a Spartacus or
Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
Take important conference calls
In corner office walls
Stealin buckets
A bunch of these punch numbers
Five punch just say no to company functions
And I duck into the dungeons
Nothing says kill it 
Like a day of pinching paperclips and staplers for the privilege
Two lives, one is chores for whores
One is where I wanna be when you begin regretting yours
And I?m boredom with a large coffee
Tardy every morning
To a man who authority beyond what it was for
How you gonna pay the rent?
Day job great
Make rap records matter fact thanks!
Peace!

Aesop Rock,"[Dead men tell no tales.
Up push the daisies till the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale
Mr. big sleep with the carp and kelp]

Once upon a time in the days of yore
When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore
There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang
Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same
Peg leg navigator starboard to port
By the nautical star of male an the harbor is yours
And you should tell them where you situate the gold
That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy j-j-j-Jones.

Like ""walk the plank"" for whom the shark thank
Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs.
Come all the shiny spoils piled higher every year
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer
Ten summers prior on a night like this
Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west
Swore it blew him a kiss
When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a
F-f-f-fish.

""What the heck!"" grabbed for his telescope
Shatter gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder
To deck circled the vessel the 360 swiftly
Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey.
Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar,
He'll be the laughing stock of the barbary coast war
Like this dude either got two glass eyes
Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side

Now he knew what he saw
But had to prove he was raw
So he raped and he pillaged and
And he'd feud and he'd brawl
Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke
And battle always find him though he never told cutthroats
Meanwhile, back in the now, Got a brand new skeleton crew
On the move out When they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow
They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth

Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease
Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed.
And he was aching from his boots to the feather in his cap
Till his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map
One look down and lept off the dock,
See if you can guess where X marked the spot
The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave,
Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid.

Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much.
Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched
But see the vitamin deficiency was strong
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog
Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand
Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand
An area high tide so grand it's the one that put the one that put
The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land

I wish I could tell you that it ended happy
Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water.
No lie, scout's honor, got a million more
From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores
Before your visions of grandeur go to slow those sails
Remember that dead men tell no t-t-t-tales",The Harbor Is Yours
Aesop Rock,"(for want of a name the shoe was lost)
(for want of a shoe the horse was lost)
(for want of a horse the rider was lost)
(for want of a rider the battle was lost)
(for want of a battle the kingdom was lost)
(and all for the want of a horse shoe...)

There is a hole in front of the shovel, shovel in front of the brawn
Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
Each withered his mule-ish days to choose his tool of trade
Dueling blades that cue the cruel charade and fuel the flames
If you would clue the crew into the civil
Just get the food and land like you the man who flew the coop over the pit-bulls
Dash back flashy to compassionate nano police
Sat beneath an avalanche and jagged and nautical seas
And I would stop the violence more than I was Pontius Pilate
Cops and robbers riot by the vows of noxious sirens
A is gullible he figure all man equal no brainer
Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
Moms raised the babies through a very church-y eighties
Sunday mornings reinforced the waiting gates of Haties
And he brazen but apparently infernal bound now
For when a man had coughed recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunner's deck
Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous in you
Observing how the giveth is disproportionate to the taketh away decide to maketh his day
All the stoic odium glowing a coal holster
When he coulda stood easily in the tub juggling toasters

[Chorus]
No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
To treaty to sign
No city to guard

I pick the phone up with a grown-up mode approach
Skin crawlin off the drawl and now it clawed the awkward tone up
I'd known it wasn't roses but hoped it was less corrosive
Coast in to the focus of the grossest diagnosis like
Holmes, the barnicles that chew upon the flesh of man
Have clued into suitor's capital to a beggars hand
Comfortably, sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood and meat
Umm, what? !?
The chinny chin up and the city picked her sinning pen up let her numb the spitting stigma
Along came a spider sold her eggs to any buyer
Now the shooter in back is six legs wider than the driver
If you make no friends on the way to the top rung
There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck
But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your cannons
All kings hang em for the cliff side drip dry
Will he clip to zip line or slip for his final dip dive
If he live, will he survive the milligrams of middle ground
They pump into the pinstripe pentagrams over tinsel town
Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out as sickles
Dipped in military hells bells and whistles
Riders to the east
Now the wild tribes
Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miled high

No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred

Aesop Rock,"Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, ""I'mma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt""
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, but the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, ""That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!""

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass

Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
'Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, ""Wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready, go""
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass
None shall pass

Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this
Duty and death; anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, ""Enough's enough!""
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.y. Chew through the machine

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast

Assimilate into a culture of post morality, from what I've seen, I hate humanity. 
Rot with repulsion. I'll write the world a brand new song. 
Look upon your bleak creation, 
but is it truly me that's to be the human blasphemy? 
I'll set the world on fire and,
in burning light I'll write my first love song and I will feel warmth. 
Hide your eyes in heaven, in the lies.
Believe. Relieve. I'll end the world tonight.

Was something called the Bay Street beat 
People would gather from all around 
To get down on the Bay sound 
You had to be a renegade those days 
To take a man on the dance floor 
Like Afrika Bambattaa and the Soulsonic Force 
We're talking about Mr.B, Pow Wow, G-L-O-B-E 
Was a renegade, yes, a renegade of the atomic age 
So many renegades 
What's that 
It's a hand clap 
The renegade 

Just jam sucker 
Say jam sucker 
Say groove, sucker 
Say groove, sucker 
Say dance, sucker 
Say dance, sucker 
Now move, sucker 
Now move, sucker 

Everybody say 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk

Somebody say, what it look like

And everything is closin' up
And yet again I come in last

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
And everything was blue
Everything was fine

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

Rise above it, rise above it, rise above it

I see her on the ceiling
She's staring down in her gown
I had to make allowances
Between my love and goin' out

Now everything is closing up
The last call is well asleep
At gigs I danced with a Blue Nun
Now heartburn is goin' cheap

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
Everything was true
Everything sublime

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

Aber bitte wer schafft es nur so ungefähr
So wie wir? Mikrofone brennen weil wir Funken spucken
Alter, wir sind nicht wie jeder machen's nicht mit jeder
Besitzen mehr Größenwahn als'n Ami, schwingt bei uns die Feder
Wie das größte Schwert Auf dem höchsten Pferd
Durch die Industrie kommen wir in Frieden wie Ganja oder Gandhi

Ferris was geht ab?
(Ey yo, Afrob was geht ab?)
Hast du Bock? (Ja, klar)
Komm wir rocken jetzt die Stadt
Yo, macht euch locker

Sag mal hast du Interesse (an Rap und fette Bässe)
Afrob und der Ferris ist die richtige Adresse
(Haben Spaß dabei) Mikrofon-Check (eins, zwei)
Unsere Augen haben rotes Licht, stehen immer auf stand by
Alle Leute kommt seid ihr mit?
Afrob, Ferris MC ist der neue Hit
Wir machen's vor ihr macht es nach das ist der erste Schritt
Zusammen rockt die Action spüre diesen Augenblick
(Und unser Überblick wird geschickt rübergeschickt, vergiss den Standard
Scheißrapper stellen Arbeitslosenantrag
Denn wenn wir hier sind seid ihr besser da
Und ihr wisst wer besser ist in diesem wie in jedem Jahr)
Vielleicht ist unser Rapstyle euch viel zu kompliziert
Das ist mir scheißegal, auch wenn ihr uns voll ignoriert
Ich lieb den Scheiß steh dahinter eintausend Prozent
Jeder der mich kennt, weiß ich bin der Rapper der wie Feuer brennt
Und das zeichnet einen guten MC aus
Er versteht sein Werk (und macht das beste draus)
Gar nichts fordert ihn heraus
(Wir haben was zu erledigen, uns hier zu verewigen
Kolchose und die Mongo Clikke können dir das bestätigen?

Alle wollen den Rapper sehen
Rapper kommen, Rapper gehen
Entertain, Rapper Fame
Netter Song, fett im Game
Beat droppt, mach ihn laut
Rap' auf, pack es aus, achtet auf
Den Afrokamm, kämm die Matte aus
Power look, power Hook
Angespannt, Dauerdruck
Aufgebaut, aufgesaugt
Eingekauft, ausgespuckt
Yeah, pump diese, diese
Pump, pump fiese Beats
Rick Marvel macht es und ich Hip Hop Musik
Sechser in Mathe, aber nie in der Lotterie
Hart auf der Bühne bis man die Schweißtropfen sieht
BRD, Übersee, überall überlebt
Ich steh' im Schatten, deshalb bin ich leicht zu übersehen
Ich tret' ins Licht, um das Mikrofon zu übernehmen
Der Rest lehnt ab, ich bin grad zu unbequem
So echt, so fresh, so back, so Rap, so ?

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Ich liebe diesen Rap Shit, so sieht das aus
Oh ja klar, oh ja klar! (Was geht ab?)

Es ist wieder Zeit und ich schließe den Kreis
Hip Hop braucht mich mehr denn je, ohne Scheiß
Solange ich das Gras Rauch und nicht in das beiß'
Roll' ich mit Hip Hop, ihr wisst ab jetzt Bescheid
Hatte reichliche Fehler für peinliche Hater
Doch jeder der mich fühlt, ist ein heimlicher Neger
Es gibt kein Lager für mich
Aller, ja ja, bla bla, laber
Ich hab diese Nummer drauf, so wie kein Zweiter
Es ist dieser Eifer nach Beifall und Neidern
Im Backstage die Cypher, es geht immer weiter
Mir fällt immer etwas neues ein wie MacGyver
Echt mal, echt mal
Egal Lan, wie lang ich weg war
Hab Hunger, Kannibal wie Hannibal Lecter
Test' und fress' diese sogenannten Rapstars
Als Rentner im Rollstuhl, mit Pampers

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf

Denn es geht immer weiter

Ich liebe diesen Rap Shit, so sieht das aus
Oh ja klar, oh ja klar! (Was geht ab?)

Ich bin ein Rap-Vet-Veteran
Mach den Track fett du hast mich verpasst
So wie die letzte Bahn
Der Elefant im Raum
Bin elegant zum Sound, bin penetrant, redgewandt
Ich habe einen Traum, raus aus der Matrix
Fernsehfanatisch
Bringe euch den Frühling (let's go)
Auf Arabisch
Merhaba, Selamat
Der Boss ist da
Egal, welcher Wochentag
Ich bin hart im nehmen, ich bin klar zu sehen
Guck' mich genau an, ich bin ein Problem
Geh mir aus dem Weg, ich mach keine Gefangenen
Ich kill' sie alle, wie ein nach dem anderen

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf

„Eines hab ich gelernt, das in ´ner Beziehung immer
Jeder seine eigene Wahrheit hat
Is auch vollkommen okay so
Das schwierige daran is nur, zu wissen wann Schluss ist
Das muss man immer wissen wann Schluss ist
(yeah, check this)

Als ich dich das erste Mal sah, war ich wie verzaubert
So wie jeder Mann, Augenaufschlag, Let´s Go!
Ich dachte ich wär am Ende meiner Suche
Gute Frau, gutes Haus, selbständig, gute Schule
Es war Liebe auf den zweiten Blick
Eigentlich könnte das schon Fail sein, ich weiß es nicht, wer weiß es?
Wer will schon den Partner seines Lebens spät treffen?
Man setzt sich unter Druck, ist vom Gedanken besessen
(Ey)
Die Zeit rennt, und du hinterher
Der Spagat zwischen Frei sein und Beziehungen ist immer schwer
Wie dem auch sei
Das Wasser ist geweiht
Der Priester steht bereit
Und die Braut kommt in weis
So wär´s gekommen, ich hätte dich fast gefragt
Heute sind wir beide froh, denn es kam nie der Tag
Ich hatte
Viel für sie übrig
Die Freunde war´n von Anfang an gegen mich, wie üblich
Denn
Der Afrob-Faktor ist Fluch und auch Segen
Sie tat sich damit schwer, und konnte nie damit leben
Zweifel kommen früh, doch die Einsicht sehr spät
Besser als nie, jeder geht seinen Weg

Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein
Seinen Weg

Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein
Seinen Weg

Manchmal gehört etwas einfach nicht zusammen
Du kannst es kleben, nageln, schweißen, auch ein Kind
ändert nichts daran
Hast du schon wieder in mein Handy geguckt
Mit wem ich skype, twitter oder app auf facebook?
Man verliert sich im Kleinen
Bei den großen Sachen waren wir miteinander im Reinen
Komm
Frisch aus dem Knast, ich verließ meine Stadt
Albträume in der Nacht, Kopfkissen immer nass
Was, das zwischenmenschliche mal hilft
Wenn es einem nicht gut geht
Das heißt noch nicht das man als Partner alles durchsteht
Man trennt sich und kommt wieder zusammen
Um sich, wieder zu trennen
Um dann
Wieder zusammen zu kommen
Was für ein Schwachsinn, on und off wie 18
Stürz mich ins Nachtleben, muss was von meinem Saft geben
Geben, geben, geben, geben, geben
Besser als nie, jeder geht sein Weg

Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein
Seinen Weg
Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein, seinen Weg seinen Weg seinen Weg seinen Weg
Jeder geht seinen Weg seinen Weg

Hoffnung ist ein schlechter Ratgeber
Ich war Opfer, war Täter
Wurd´ schwach, war sch…
Es vergeht kein Feiertag ohne Streit, geh ich weg oder bleib ich?
Was kommt bloß danach, man? Ich weiß nicht
Es kann immer schlimmer kommen
Ich suche Gründe für die Zukunft in guten Erinnerungen
Ich tapp im Dunkeln
Topfschlagen hasste ich als Kind
Denn ich hab das scheiss Ding nie gefunden
Mein Herz aus Stein, und ich wein nicht, nicht mal heimlich
Man redet es sich schön, nur wenn man allein ist, yeah..
Besser als nie, jeder geht sein Weg

Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein
Seinen Weg
Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein, seinen Weg seinen Weg seinen Weg seinen Weg
Jeder geht seinen Weg seinen Weg, seinen Weg",Jeder geht
Afrob,"Sie gaben mir einen Namen, ich trug ihn lang mit Stolz
Ich ging den harten Weg, die Anderen dann Gold
Viele meinen rappen sei ein Zuckerschlecken
Morddrohungen, Haters, MCs, nicht gleich über Mutter sprechen
Es gibt viele aus dem Game, die in der Klapse sind
Man ist unzufrieden, obwohl die Kasse stimmt
Ich hass den roten Teppich, geh ungern auf den Echo
Alles Borgs, voll auf Koks, Widerstand ist zwecklos
Immer mehr sehn die Radieschen von unten
Es ist der Krebs, er hat seine Kunden gefunden
Spar dir den Spaten, um Afrob zu begraben
Ich bin euch etwas schuldig und zahle in Raten
Kokain ist sehr, sehr gefährlich
Es ist ein geiler Turn, jetzt ma ehrlich
Und deshalb wirst du es auch immer wieder tun
Einmal Kokser, immer Kokser, es lässt dich nie in Ruh

Ich denke außerhalb der Box, nicht ohne Grund
Ich denke außerhalb der Box, komm schau dich um
Ich denke außerhalb der Box, ich halt nicht den Mund

Der Apfel fällt nicht weit vom Stamm
Ich heb ihn auf und beiß ihn an
Beim Schreiben führt der Teufel neulich meine Hand
Ich komm nicht in das Paradies
Weil ich das Para lieb
Gottverdammt, es ist Haram
Als wenn ich auf einen Pfarrer schieß
Einige hätten es so verdient
Bei Ritualen kleine Kindern die Roben überziehen
Frag die Grünen, denn alle Teenager sind voll auf Linie
Glauben an CO2 und hassen Familie
Ich tu mir nie einen Gefallen mit dem was ich sag
Der Verfassungsschutz, ein Mittel wegen Letzter seiner Art
Ich glaub an keine Theorie, ich glaub an die Verschwörung
Der Königsmacher ist der King, auch ohne Krönung
Ich brauch die letzte Ölung, vor der Versöhnung
In letzter Zeit träum ich sehr oft von meiner Tötung
Ein dünner Wichser der sich jetzt mit Rap zu Helfen weiß
Rap hat mich gerettet, mich erzogen, mir die Welt gezeigt

Deshalb sag ich

Ob Ratingen-West oder Frankfurt-Nordweststadt
Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg oder München-Neuperlach
Mit dem Haze überwinden wir die Schwerkraft
Die Polizei agiert auf Demos wie die Wehrmacht
Bis vor paar Jahren glaubte ich noch an den Staat
An die Medien, an die Politik, den ganzen Apparat
Wah! Es sind Barbaren am Werk
Hörst du was ich sag? - Sie haben den Satan verehrt
Keiner sagte mir, dass ich der Bank gehör - Fick dich!
Keiner sagte mir, dass sie das Land zerstörn
Herzlich willkommen in der neuen Weltordnung

They shine through the cracks till they way out

Well, I was standin' on the corner sellin' rap cd's 
When I met a little girl named Jan.
I let her ride in my Caddy 
Cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Klu Klux Klan.

Fucked so long, I grew a fuckin' afro.
Then I fucked to the left, fucked to the right.

Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet.
I ran, I jumped out the back window, 
But her daddy, he was waitin' with a 2 x 4.
Oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right. 
The mutha-fucker whooped my ass all night.

I fucked her once, I fucked her twice.

I met a woman in the heart of Australia.
Had a big butt and big titties, too, 
So I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo.
See, I met this lady from Hawaii. 
Stuck it in her ass, and she said, ay!
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch, 
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch.
Met Colonel Sander's wife in the state of Kentucky.

And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, 
Singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, 
Sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.
Hey, wait a minute man, check this out.

I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee. 
Her titties were filled with Hennesy.
That country music nearly drove me crazy, 
But I rode that ass and said, Yes, Miss Daisy!
Met this lady in Oklahoma
Put that pussy in a coma.
Met this lady in Michigan
I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again.
Met a real black girl in South Carolina, 
Fucked her 'til she turned into a white albino.
Fucked this hooker in Iowa. 
I fucked her on credit, so I owe her.
Fucked this girl, down in Georgia; came in her mouth. 
Man, I thought I told ya.
Met this beautiful sexy ho; 
She just ran cross the border of Mexico.
Fine young thing, said her name's Maria. 
I wrapped her up just like a Hot Tortilla.
I want to get married, but I can't afford it. 
I know I'ma cry when she gets deported.

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.
And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, 
Singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, 
Sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.

Have you ever went over to a girl's house to fuck, 
But the pussy just ain't no good? (say what?)
And then you're getting' upset cause you can't get her wet, 
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood?
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy, 
But it takes her so long to cum (say what?)
Then a dude walks in. That's her big boyfriend, 
And he asks you where you from? (Where you from, man?)

So you wipe your mouth, and you try to explain (I don't bang.), 
You start talkin' real fast.
But he's already mad, cause you fuckin' his wife, 
So he starts beatin' on your ass.
Now your clothes all muddy, your nose all bloody, 
Your dick was hard but now it's soft. (what?)
You thought you had a girl to rock your world, 
Now you still gotta go jack off.

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.",Crazy Rap
Afroman,"[Intro]
Yeah I be actin' crazy, rappin' nasty
But don't get me wrong, I got sense
I'ma thank God on this song man
This song is dedicated to all the homeboys that almost died
But for some strange coincidental
Ironic reason you lived through it homeboy
But I'm here to tell you man
It's not a coincidence and it's not ironic
God got a plan and purpose for your life man
The Quarter Peace Quartet gon' help me sing it right about now, uh
{*chicken cluck*}

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has (come on why'all) smiled on me (yeah)
He has set me free (like when them bullets just fly past you)
Ohhh God has smiled on me and He's been good to me (yeah, uh)

[Verse 1]
Before I was a wild juvenile
I used to be a mild Christian young child
I used to seek and seek, search and search
Analyze everybody in my church
A 1-2, I've seen a lot of hypocrites, religious fakers

Deacon whore mongers and offer takers
When I turned thirteen I thought church was fake
I took all I could take so I took a little break
I went to the world, bought a geri curl
And some crack to slice so I can do my own thang
The street life I didn't understand good
So I started gangbangin' to prove my manhood
Yeah, had fun packin' the gun
The baddest kid on the block was a Christian son
Went to the county jail not once but twice
Gamblin' with my life with the dealin' dice
{*chicken cluck*}

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has smiled on me (yeah)
He has set me free (haha yeah)
Ohhh God has smiled on me and He's been good to me
(uh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I got released in '94
Told my mamma I don't want to get in trouble no mo'
I want to find a job, obtain some wealth
Be independent like you and take care of myself
{*chicken cluck*}
I stopped bangin' (yeah) I really quit
But not the people I got into it wit'
Back in the day from Palmdale to L.A
They got beef wit me homie up until this day
To make a long story short I stepped out the tub
Walked around the corner to the local night club
Sittin' at a table, just doin' my thang
This when I got approached by this rival gang
His gang and my gang just got into it (just got into it)
I tried to explain I didn't do it (uh)
I told ya bro, since '94
I been straight man, I don't mess around no mo'
{*chicken cluck*}

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has smiled on me
He has set me free (can you sing it again?)
Ohhh God has (yeah) smiled on me and He's been good to me

[Verse 3]
You know what he said man? he got smart with me
He said call the mortuary, order some flowers
You quit your game but we ain't never quit ours
{*faint chicken cluck*}
It got excitin', we started fist fightin'
Like Mike Tyson I was scratchin' and bitin' {*chicken cluck*}
A bunch of them started mobbin' me (mobbin' me)
Threw me on the floor and started robbin' me (robbin' me)
The things that they took from me wasn't nothin' major

Wallet, walkman, cheap little pager
They took my food stamps, took my knife
Took me and tried to take my life {*chicken cluck*}
I tried to fight back but my efforts was useless
Ain't know need to makin' up excuses, hey man
I was on the ground (ground) gettin' beat down (down)
Eight different people kickin' me around
I thought about all the bad things I did
When I ran from God as a little bitty kid
No sign, no reason, no clue, no warnin'
No fair nobody cared, 2 o'clock in the mornin'
Heavy licks they was layin' on me
But at the same time my momma, she was prayin' for me
Lights from the helicopter filled the air
And the police cars came everywhere, uh
I told Jesus ""I don't deserve You
But let me live and I'll serve You""
God has smiled on me

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has (come on why'all) smiled on me
He has set me free (can you sing it again?)
Ohhh God has (yeah) smiled on me and He's been good to me

[Outro]
Yeah man, uh, sometimes when I'm drinkin' man
I think about my close calls, you know what I'm sayin'
Times I almost got shot
Times I was commitin' crimes, almost got caught by the police
Man I think about car accidents that never happened
I think about homeboys I speak to one day
Next day they catch 50-60 years
Maybe even rest in peace, you know what I'm sayin'
So check this out man, yeah, we still alive, right?
God ain't through with us
So let's put it down man, stop all this madness
You know what I'm sayin'
Go on take care of some situations we need to take care of
And to all the homeboys that robbed me, hey man I'm still alive
So if why'all be so kind, go down there and buy my tape man
That'll make up them food stamps why'all took from me right

Let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Let's all get high tonight
Maybe nobody will die tonight
Let's all sell yell tonight
I hope I don't go back to jail tonight
Let's go to the club tonight
Find a woman that want to make love tonight
A yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Let's get dumb
Drink some rum
Make my teeth and gum feel real numb
We'll be thinking bout survivin
While we're drinkin and we're drivin
Hope I don't wreck when my vision gets blurry
Sober up lookin at an all white jury
Judge don't like no drunk like me
Punk might give me strike number three
Cause when I'm drunk and when I'm high
I don't give a damn bout a DUI
Let's just get lit
Dance like a nitwit
Try to talk to the women that we can't get with
Me and my staff make everybody laugh
If the beer runs out we can all go half
It's Friday night got the perfect weather
Let's get drunk together

[Chorus]

Bacardi, Colt .45
Let's party we still alive
Tomorrow brings pain and sorrow
but tonight, we're all right
Drink that beer till your belly can't hold it
Tell the homeboys we fittin to get loaded
Rollin through the Ante-dope Valley out there
Hope the cops don't smell that beer on my breath
Cause if the sheriff
Catch a whiff
Of that fifth
It'll probably knock him stiff
Don't look dumb if my breath on hum
Stick your hand in you're pocket please, pass some gum
So the cops can't tell my breath smell
We won't go to jail
We'll go to Palmdale
With the beautiful women and the beautiful weather
We can both get drunk together

[Chorus]

Baby I beg your pardon
But your outfit's givin me a hardon
Maybe some way, maybe some how
You could dance with me, right here, right now
Been lookin at you all night long
That DJ's playin my favorite song
Everything's splendid, don't mean no harm
Don't get offended when I pull your arm
I ain't felt this good since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again
It's Friday night, beautiful weather
Let's get drunk together

Just like bums, we used to stay
In the slums of LA, by the way
Gang-bangers killin' each other for reps
Sellin' rock cocaine on my doorstep
Had a ball to bounce plus a bike to ride
But my mamma never would let me play outside
But when I got enrolled in elementary school
Started bangin' like a fuckin' fool
So cool, throwin' up gang signs to the gangster beat
Shot an enemy from across the street
Mamma came home, said she got a good job
Daddy did too, now they don't squab
Financially, we improvin'
2 months later, ""son, we movin""
No more duckin' from shotgun shells 
Bought a two-story house in East Palmdale
Give it to me now

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me

Check it out, check it out, check it out
No more rats and no more roaches
Livin' next door to football coaches
Now I got a new place to sell my crack
Now I got little white kids to jack
I stopped wearin' blue, wasn't trippin' on red
Too busy squabbin' with the skinheads
Stupid questions, distract the class
Rubbin' little white girls on the ass
I didn't really care if I passed or failed
I knew I was headed for the NFL
Until the playoff game, shoulder got hurt
I thought about my future, layin' in the dirt
I can't jump, I can't flinch
Superstar player, ridin' the bench
Graduate from school? Don't make me laugh
I got an F+ in basic math
Give it to me now

Palmdale, (Hell yeah) come back to me
I gotta do one song for my neighborhood (chicken sound)
Palmdale, come back to me 

Uh, uh, check it out
I knew I couldn't make it in the white man's world
So I bought me some khakis and a Gheri curl
I knew I couldn't make it to the NFL
I went to East Palmdale and started slangin' yell
Fo' sho'! I was makin' crazy dough
Shoulda dropped outta school a long time ago
Bought a cell phone, like a nut
Now I deliver like Pizza Hut
I drunk whiskey and Bacardi
I sold dope to anybody
Me and my homies sold dubs and dimes
Took turns bustin' rhymes just to pass the time
A white man drove up to my spot
He said, â??Hey homeboy, what you got?â??
I put a fat rock inside his hand
About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van
â??Get down, punk.â??

Palmdale, (Hell yeah) come back to me
Uh, I need you and I love you baby
Palmdale, come back to me

Check it out, check it out, check it out
Can't get drunk, can't get blunted
LA County, 95 hundred
Crips want to take my All-stars
Bloods want to eat my Snicker bars
Them peckerwoods don't want none
but the Mexican's straight own one
Them Essays, ???
That Essays always try to test me
So I jumped off the bed, cause I ain't no punk
Jammed his head up against the bunk
Socked that Cholo in his chin
Black mother fuckers scared to jump in
Sheriff broke it up when we hit the floor
I kept talkin' shit cause I want some more
Back in town, we get along with the brown
Now I'm in jail, they tryin' to beat me down
Jail is hell, but I'll adapt
Won't hesitate to get in a scrap. 
Cause I'm down for mine, and that's for certain
Sittin' in the hole with my knuckles hurtin'

(Palmdale) Palmdale, (Hell yeah) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me

Yea, check it out homeboy
Now I got a fucked up life
Two bad kids and a naggin' wife
Dead end job at the airport
Check too short to pay the house note
Turn on the TV, then I see
Different homeboys that went to school with me
Playin' in the NFL
We used to kick back in East Palmdale
Rodney Williams, Lorenz Tate 
Zeno plays for Colorado State 
I wish my homeboys much success
But at the same time, I still get depressed
Walkin' through the wind with a cup full of gin
Thinkin' 'bout things I coulda, woulda, shoulda been
I wipe my tears, sip my beers, wish good luck to my peers

(Palmdale) Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began
Palmdale, come back to me  
I need you and I love you baby 
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began

How long can sell?
(You see life is like football, you know what I'm saying?)
Before I have to go to jail
(You gotta hike the ball and just make something happen man)

Can I possibly get real?
(I mean you know you might get tackled, you know what I'm saying?)
Before somebody go and snitch
(Then again, you might fuck around and make a touch down)

I'm so paranoid, stressed, stressed, paranoid, paranoid
One false move, I can be destroyed
I avoid the cops, I use a decoy
See my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

I'm so paranoid, stressed, stressed, paranoid, paranoid
One false move, I can be destroyed
To avoid the cops, I use a decoy
You see my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

All my life I did nothin' but dealin'
Learned to rely on my gut feelin'
Yo name is what? What? I know you from where? Where?
I don't mean to seem vicious but you look suspicious

Stop talking 'bout drugs on the telephone
Stop walking with a bunch of thugs to my home
Stop fuckin' up, call me before you come
Stop telling these bitches where you got it from

How long can I sell?
The Sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock

Can I possibly get real?
Pass the tabs the turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go snitch
Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges

I'm so paranoid, stressed, stressed, paranoid, paranoid
One false move I can be destroyed
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
You see my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

I'm so paranoid, stressed, stressed, paranoid, paranoid
One false move, I can be destroyed
I avoid the cops, I use a decoy
You see my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

As I bail down the street with my khakis creased
Everybody looking at me look like the police
Havin' conversations with my gang assailants
Do you think, we under police surveillance?

Asking questions giving suggestions
Pulling Smith an' Wessons on strange pedestrians
Cookin' crack up, dollar bills stacked up
Hope the cops don't backup, here they come man

How long, stop runnin', stop runnin', can I sell?
The Sheriff department's right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock

Can I possibly get real?
Hurry up, pass the tabs, turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go and snitch
Before the DEA kick the door off the hinges

Maybe I oughta stop sellin' water
Spend more time with my son and my daughter
But my drug life drug me away from my wife
She couldn't deal with the stress and the strife

The cocaine rockin' and the hood rats jockin'
The late night knockin' the drive way blockin'
Late at night I fantasize 'bout rappin'
But I gotta sell dope till it happen
For how long?

Hey, who is that, who is that man?
See you all fuckin' up, I got these looks
Yo man little rich kids comin' over here
That's what I'm saying now

You know they gonna snitch, they can't even lie to their parents
What the fuck you think they gonna do when the police pressure 'em?
Get to crying and shit, Afroman sold it to me mommy
He stays over there

How long can I sell?
The Sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock

Can I possibly get real?
Pass the tabs the turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go snitch
Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges

I'm so paranoid, now God lay me down to sleep
Before the cops rape, please give me a beat
If they accidently kill me and I don't escape
Pray some white person, gotta video tape

Twinkle twinkle little little star
That looks like a police car
Shining on my dope spot
A police raid

I hope not
Little little homie hold my gun
I'm gonna fuckin' run
Where I run, I don't care

Throw that dope, anywhere
Cops chase me, through the hood
Straight in to the woods camera
Fly like lepord's

I hear, German Shepards
Freeze, hold it right there
Drug dealers, nightmare
Busted crack, criminal court
No black support

Handcuffs very tight, Baptist jury all white
They could never be my peers, sentence me twenty years
This rap so damn real, I'm glad I gotta record deal
If I don't sell a mill, this could, could happen still

Afroman,"Yes! Yes! Thank you for inviting me here for my final speech.
Ladies and gentlemen, homosexuals, lesbians, and transvestites,
Allow me to introduce myself as the Hungry Hustler, Afroman.
I am the American Dream. Even though the government tried to experiment with me
By placing me in the projects, I'm still the American Dream.
Surrounded by drugs,
Jeopardized my life by living around thugs,
But I'm still the American Dream.
Kicked outta Palmdale High School
Because I was considered a distraction to the educational process.
I've traveled through the complete metamorphosis of the justice system,
And I'm still the American Dream.
Entered Juvenile Hall as a tadpole;
Hopped outta prison as a bull frog,
But I'm still the American Dream.
The most rejected, disrespected,
When I went for a job I was never selected,
But I am still the American Dream.
And right about now,
I find it quite serendipitous to see that all of you some-timin',
Wishy-washy, two-faced, back-stabbin',
Coniving hypocrites have accumulated here in my midst to persecute my character
With such flagrant slanderousity,
But I counter-attack by calling it constructive criticism,
And all of your negativity has been recycled into motivation,
And I am still the American Dream.
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found; was blind, but now I see.
There's a lot of people out there who can identify with me.
Young lady right here, you may be a single teenaged mother,
But you are still the American Dream.
The lady next to you, yes. Your breasts may not be as big as men think they should be,
But you are still the American Dream.
Young man, you may not be a baller, shot caller,
With 20 inch blades on the impala, but you are still the American Dream.
Young man right here, you may have spent all your money on a hood rat bitch
And didn't get no pussy last night, but you are still the American Dream.
Yes sir, I am just like Ham. I'm for the black man,
The mexican, and even poor white,
All human beings that have no rights. So put down your past, pick up your future,
Follow me as we journey through the Red Sea,
Cause I have been to the mountain top,
I've seen the Promised Land,
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the Underground Category.
My mind has been delivered.
My spirit has been reinstated from the Corporate World's modern-day slavery.
I've been emancipated. Free at last! Free at last! Fuck a drug test,
I'm fittin' to roll some grass. Love, peace, and Afro grease, Fro-ever! Buccooocc!

When I went to visit my granddaddy down there in Mobile, Alabama
He stayed in this place called Trendy Garden you know what I'm sayin?
He used to grow his vegetables right there on the side of the house
And every now and then he'd get me to help him out know what I'm sayin?
And as he was like weedin out his garden and everything
He'd sing all kinda tunes and hymns know what I'm sayin?
And sometime he'd sing the same one like over and over and over again
You know what I'm sayin?
He'd get tired of singin the words
Sometimes he'd take a sip of his water outta that glass jar, set it back down
And while we was plantin them collard greens, he'd hum it
Just like this right here, help me out 'cause, you know how we used to do it)

{*humming*}

It gets all in my hands
It gets all in my feet
It makes me want to sing my song
To every little girl I meet
It gets all in my heart
It gets all in my sole
It comes straight out my mouth
And then I lose control
Cause I, I got this feelin, that everything's gonna be all right
Be all right
Be all right
Be all right",Hush

(Palmdale was like the peak of my life
But Palmdale over with homeboy
I'm fittin to go home cuz)
Please take me back home (you know what I'm sayin)
To Mississippi
(I got my Greyhound ticket right here man
I'm fittin to go back and kick it with my family cuz)
Please take me back home (take a couple pounds of this weed)
To Mississippi
(You shmell me homeboy
Yeah, take them fools back to '82 cuz)

Before South Central, Palmdale flossin
I stayed in a place called Palmer's Crossing
Hattiesburg, Mississippi
Smokin marijuana like a Woodstock hippy
All my homies in Laurel
Beg borrow
Buy my rap tape tomorrow 
Tell DJ Pumpkin ?Keep it crunckin Clyde?
Request my tape when you go inside
So I can take Jane and girl
To Waynesboro
Fuck their little homegirl
Make her toes curl
Rock their world
Leave with their Auntie Sheryl
She sucks me sucks me
Fucks me fucks me
Cries every time I leave Biloxi
But I hops in the Coup
Cause I gots to go
Scoop another ho
From Tupelo
Hit it once hit it twice, then I hit it again
Hit it in Meridian
Make that bitch rub her clit again
Pinch the nipples on her tit again
Suck my dick until she spit again

[Chorus]
Please take me back home (Hell yeah)
To Mississippi
Crooked letter crooked letter hump-back hump-back
Afroman's the bomb, bump that
Please take me back home (Hell yeah)
To Mississippi
From the delta to the coast
I'm doin the most
Grab your 40 ounce, let's toast.

I sold rock cocaine down in Ellisville
Baseheads hit the pipe, they can tell it's real
Kept my dope stashed with this hoochie
Way down yonder in East Bouche
Cops be sweatin outta town dog
Sniffin my car with a hound dog
Separate me from my bitch and shit
Tryin to get my bitch to fuckin snitch and shit
Officer Roscoe P. Coltrane
Runnin warrant checks on the Afroman
But I can't be no hip hop star
Cuffed in the back of some police car
Did you find the gun? NO!
Did you find the dope? NO!
Open up the back door ?Well son, you're free to go?
A-F-are-O marijuana cargo
Flossed like a cholow
In a clean low glow
Come on let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Get nervous
As I swerve this
Cadillac through Purvis
Hope I don't crash when I hit Petal
Get my ass kicked in the white ghetto
Prejudice police won't let me go
So I'ma drive slow
Hide my fro
I was dumb, now I'm dumber y'all
last summer y'all
I fucked all the little girls down in Sumrall
Grabbed my guitar and started pickin a tune
For Nikki and June
Down in Picayune, baby
Just like a shovel I be diggin
All the pretty young women in Wiggins
On the boat
Gulfport
I got my dick down some girl's throat
I can't help it I'm a Crip baby
I think you need to wipe your lip baby
Hula Hula Hula
The whole house ruler
What's up with all the bitches down in Pascagoula
Small towns, small cities
But they still got big ole asses plus titties
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?
It's the hungry hustler Afroman
Flyin through the air in my underwear
Geri curl activator in my hair
I'm in control like Janet when I hit Jackson
Always gettin plenty panty action
McClaine, even McComb
Tell the whole world Mississippi's your home
Yazoo, Columbia and Natchez
I got the weed brother, who got the matches?
Who got the funky DJ that scratches?
Depend on me like my name was patches
First it was a black thing, just the big Willies
Now I roll Phillies
With all the Hillbillies
Never ever thought I'd see the Klu Klux Klan
Buying front row seats for the Afroman
Confederate flags tobacco in their mouth
It's a beautiful thing jumpin off in the South
Afroman, I'm a part of it
Hattiesburg hip hop I'm the start of it
I'm the latest
I'm the greatest
And all you haters, I'll mash you like potatoes
I'll make your girlfriend holler and scream
Then cook me some cornbread and collard greens

[Chorus]

1982, '83, '84
Erin, Broste, Carlos, and Tonto
Tryin to break dance in my be	-Boy stance
Micheal Jackson glove, parachute pants
Calvin Gary, Garnett Jones
G-dog 'cause, I don't believe we grown
But hey G-dog, you and me'll see dog
Whatever happens 'cause, it's you and me dog
Or should I say loc
Cause you my folk
So let's take a toke
Till we croak
I'm a locsta locsta
Hundred spokesta
Drinking everyday like I'm supposed to
Bottle after bottle dog in my lip-a
Flowing on the mic like the Mississippi river

Afroman,"Hey sugar, how you doin'?
Your pretty face don't match that nasty attitude
What do you mean where my girl?
Probably with your man, can we fuck?

She won't let me fuck, baby, yeah
I really need to bust a nut
She won't let me fuck, honey, yeah
I really need to bust a nut

Hey, check this out
It's so frustrating, yeah, being a man, yeah
All these sexy women don't understand
Things we need to do, yeah, every other day or two
Like take you home, baby, yeah, and make sweet love to you
But you, you won't let me fuck

She won't let me fuck
(You say the mood ain't right)
I really need to bust a nut
(I know that pussy's tight )

She won't let me fuck
(Give it to me, baby)
I really need to bust a nut
(Yeah, give it to me, baby)

Her heart is still broken, her emotions are sore, yeah
She is trying to recover from the man before
Her ex boyfriend, he probably can't see
That it was easy for him but he made is hard for me
'Cause she, she won't let me fuck

She won't let me fuck
(Give it to me, baby)
I really need to bust a nut
(Yeah, give it to me, baby)
(You know just what I need, yeah)

She won't let me fuck
(Girl, you eatin' all my food, girl you drinkin' all my beer)
I really need to bust a nut
(Come on, you smokin' all my weed)

You rub your ass against me on the disco floor
Asked you for your number and you said, ''Hell no''
You always hang around me everyday
Different women wanna kick it, but you scare them away
Now, I get offended when you come around
'Cause I'm tired of my organs going up and down

She won't let me fuck
(Give it to me, baby)
I really need to bust a nut
( Yeah, give it to me honey)
(Don't play with my head again)

She won't let me fuck
(Let me hit it baby)
(Yeah, let me hit it, baby)
I really need to bust a nut
Are you a lesbian?

Oh, let me lick it baby, yeah
Let me stick it honey, I'll give you my money
Girl, you can have it all, go ahead and have a ball
If you want, you can take them both, baby

In the year 2000, I see thousands
Of pretty young women I find arousin'
Grocery store shopping, magazine browsin'
Many different ways they keep their hair styles

And full of boredom, I walk toward 'em
Get 'em close to me, 'cause I'm supposed to be
Be male aggressor, female impresser
Say the right things, possibly undress her

But that's the post game, this is still the pre game
Silly woman she game, baby, what's your name?
Even though I'm a freak, I play it off like a college geek
Crack a smile and politely speak

With intellect to the woman I select
Hoping that she won't detect
My egotistical, chauvinistical lust I thrust
'Til I scream like Mystical

The wrong message I hope I'm not sending
Laughing and pretending my dick's not extending
Can't be overzealous, she might discover
She's walkin' away, blew my cover

She won't let me fuck
(You know I love you)
I really need to bust a nut
(Please don't change the subject)

She won't let me fuck
(We coulda fucked all night long)
I really need to bust a nut
(But, but, but, but your telephone number is wrong)

She won't let me fuck
(Girl, you got a lot to give)
I really need to bust a nut
(You dress, you dress, so provocative)

She won't let me fuck
(I can see your lingerie, from real far away)
I really need to bust a nut
(Bitch, you must think I'm gay, yeah)

Oh, don't make me beg, baby, let me rub your leg
Don't make me cry, look into my eye
Girl, you so damn pretty, stop actin' so

That ain't the first time that I got confronted

You filled an empty space in my heart
And that was rather special 'cause I never thought someone
Could make me fall in love from the start

Girl, you know the second time I saw you
I knew that I had been wooed, I could not get you out of my mind
And ever since that moment girl, I haven't been much good
I won't rest until I know that you're mine, oh mine, oh mine

Don't you hear me cryin for it?
Don't you see my heart's on fire?
Don't you feel me dyin' for it?
Give me my heart's desire

The first time that I saw you, I knew that you were the one
You were everything a man could desire
And I've always been the kinda man to get just what he wants
So please, don't make me out as a liar

The second time I saw you, I just had to have you girl
I'd never seen someone look so good
And ever since that day, I just haven't been the same
I want you girl and I want that understood

Don't you hear me cryin for it?
Don't you see my heart's on fire?
Don't you feel me dyin' for it?

Don't you feel me dyin' for it?
Give me my heart's desire

And I won't be any good if I can't have you now
If there's any way you could, come to me now
I'd give you anything and I do mean everything
And that means anything that your heart desires

Don't you hear me cryin for it?
Don't you see my heart's on fire?
Don't you feel me dyin' for it?

But if you don't, then go on baby
With yourself and do what you want to do with your life
And leave me alone

I've got this damn thing called love
I've got it for ya
But it just ain't enough
So I just watch my heart break
With every chance I take with you, with you
I'm out of my mind for love
Giving you all just ain't enough
What am I supposed to do
To get with you, baby

Yes other girls have been good to me
But they never did the things you did for love
I guess you must have had to love me a lot
To spare the pain that you could rid me of
We've grown so far apart
From used to be so intertwined
No more love you baby
In the middle of the night

If you love me, well then show me
But if you don't, then go on baby
With yourself and do what you want to do with your life
Just leave me alone

I'll be giving up this good thing
To my honey
I'll be giving up this good thing
To my honey, all my lovin

It feels so good it makes you
Moan and sigh
It feels so good it makes you wanna say

It's so good, so good

That gets so deep, and all you do is
Roll over and go to sleep
Come on in and close the door
I'll fill you up with love

I can't wait another minute
To get in you, after we make love

And again and do it again

After 7,"I guess i figured out
That something was wrong
And that things have changed
Cause girl i sit by the phone
And i wait for your call
But the phone never rings
So i picked up the phone and called you at home
You're on the other line,
I wanna talk to you maybe
Even see you, you say you have no time

You started doing things that
You never did before, how could
Something so right turn out to be
Something so wrong

You thought the grass was greener
You thought the well had water
You thought that you could find a
Love another place
So how could you leave this good thing

We use to take long walks
And have long, long talks
On the telephone
You use to hold my hand in the
Shopping mall, i felt i was your own,
We stopped going out as much
I started feeling all alone
Girl you stopped telling me you loved me
Saying that you cared
But i still carried on

I thought we could work things out
But i just don't understand why
How could you leave someone patient
Like me for something so wrong

Even though you, broke my heart in two
I was just hanging on, trying to do what
Was right and you were already gone

When love came you went away
And if i see you again
Girl i would ask you how could you
Leave this good thing


",How Could You Leave
After 7,"Wake up in the morning to our song
It's torture 'cause I left the radio on
Don't wanna turn it off reminiscing about you
I guess I'm gonna leave the damn thing on
Cause it's sitting across the room

I've gotta spend my days working hard
To come home to myself
Trying to get you out of my mind
Thinking of the things we used to do
I try to compensate for you
But nothing seems to work
Baby, can I ask you

[Chorus]
How did he love ya
Does he want ya
Does he wake up in the night
Just to stare at you asleep
Does he hold ya
Does he flaunt ya
Does he do it, do it
Like we did it back at home, at home, at home

Just thinking about the way
That we made love
Just layin' all day and squeezin' each other tight
I miss those days, oh baby, would you bring them back
It's not right for me tonight baby

How does it feel
To know you hurt someone so bad, now baby
How do you live with yourself
You're probably out there having fun with your other man
Well I don't give a damn, baby
Come back to me girl

[Chorus: x2]

I don't give a damn where you are, oh girl
Baby come back home to your man
Home to your love
I must be a fool girl oh
I don't understand why you left, no
Please justify your reason then come back
Please come back

Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
But will pray for her

I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If only I could see her now

Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razors edge

Still, you made your mark, here in my heart

One day I'll fly away

What more can your love do for me?
When will love be through with me?

After Forever,"I'm in a spiral of thoughts,the past,the pain, it all comes back
I see but now I see more,even feel their side of this tale
I realize their fate,no one's to blame, two sides

My life's a mirror that no one sees
so if I could show them my own vision to this world
My life's a mirror I need them to see,
so they would open up to me and fill up my emptiness

I still really try to feel, a strange experience to enter the other side
I feel there's so much we never said
It's all misunderstood, the emotions that we had

My life's a mirror that no one sees,
so if I could show them my own vision to this world
My life's a mirror I need them to see

Voice in the back of her head
Maybe if you would have the guts to open up
maybe the world would do the same,maybe,maybe
You can still be a part of this world,still be the queen of the ball
not of your own empty paradise where no one sees the beauty inside

Face the world outside my safe shell
I must face reality for once
I've never felt the passion of a warm life
Games, TV, I know they're not real, they're just a substitute

This could mean
the breaking point in these three lives
The moment of insight that could change their misfortune

After Forever,"Ground is shaking
Waves are breaking
The wind has lost control

The air is shifting while
It's lifting force fools gravity

A huge eruption
Vast explosions
As it bursts the earth

Water's pounding
Waves are sounding
Deadly and extreme

""But we are equally destructive""

Equally destructive as we are
Don't you think we've also gone too far?
We are just a part of this machine
And it's endless stream

Alarming silence predicts
The violence that is yet to come

We are senseless
Proud while blindness
Is catching up with us

We must measure while
The pressure of nature's force expands

We feel minor, punished and meager
Betrayed by all our gods

""We are a part of it
We are equally destructive""

Equally destructive as we are
Don't you think we've also gone too far?
We are just a part of this machine
And its endless stream

",Equally Destructive
After Forever,"Cry with a smile
My heart is bleeding, bewildered, I'm here alone
Why is there pain in a beautiful moment?
Why do I feel so lost, so empty?

Cry with a smile
My heart is healing from pain I knew that would come
Why is there luck in a deeply sad moment?
Why do I feel so calm, so peaceful?

Take my heart and set it free
Take my heart and give it time to heal
I know in my memories you'll live
Take my heart a little while
Take it with you to the place you'll go
I know we will meet again someday

Cry with a smile
My heart was dreaming of time I knew would come to an end
Why do I cry about a beautiful memory?
Why do I feel so hurt, so lonely?

Take my heart and set it free
Take my heart and give it time to heal
I know; in my memories you'll live
Take my heart a little while
Take it with you to the place you'll go
I know we will meet again someday

",Cry with a Smile
After Forever,"You fake, you give nothing but misery
You are reluctant in your vanity
Your eyes are blinded by your conceit
You turn my fire into negative energy!

You are estranged by your jealousy
A weakness in your personality
Your lack of social skills annoy me
You fuel my hate by your negative energy

I see a false alliance causing all this pain
I see a sick relation ending up in vain
I see a world at war because of pride and might
I feel we're all getting de-energized

I am amazed by your ability
To make me feel all this insanity
I am discouraged by your falsity
You sink so low to get things done your way

I see a false alliance causing all this pain
I see a sick relation ending up in vain
I see a world at war because of pride and might
I feel we're all getting de-energized

Unwilling, absent, dissenting
Conflicting, adverse, annoying
You're cureless, painless, disgusting
False, ruthless, blinded, recusant

You damage, injure and destroy
Unbalanced, troubled and unfaithful
You're senseless, heartless and fearless
Cold, hostile, distant and empty
You're a freak

You won't get closer to my dignity
Something you've lost, just like empathy
I won't degrade to your pathetic ways
Nor let you take any more positive energy

I see a sick relation ending up in vain
I see a world at war because of pride and might

After Forever,"You need to get out of my sight
A lonely heart can beat
You're too dangerous
A lonely heart can bleed

I cannot stand it, to be enclosed and isolated
A lonely heart can be enclosed but isolated

You're too much
A lonely heart is weak
Too dependent
A broken heart will seek

You take the life out of me
No heart is broken forever
It's broken promises
But my faith is broken forever

Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The power that was given light now seems to freeze but why?

A lonely heart will break
Pressure will make me forsake you
A lonely heart won't forsake me
As if we're both the same

Wounded and beaten but still not defeated
A lonely heart can be wounded and beaten but still not defeated

'Cause I won't let you in
So if it's all for real
Your weakness will be my strength
Your heart should be melting

You might be lonely
But I am not beloved and bounded forever
Because we're all the same
Beloved and bounded forever

Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The smile that was given light now seems to freeze but why?

Won't you believe?
Won't you embrace it?
Can't you believe
The power between us?

Oh, discord, see them fail, oh

Won't you believe?
Won't you embrace it?
Can't you believe in the power between us?
Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?

After Forever,"Welcome, and wake up
This is not a dream but something in between that and reality
Wake up if you dare
This is not the regular nightmare

Before your eyes the world will change
Slowly take you down to unknown places
Welcome to a world that's only yours
Wake up if you dare and just follow me!

Leave me alone
My dreams speak to me or am I still awake?
Leave me alone
I'm my own threat, I'm a victim of my mind
Let go

I fooled you, I warned you though
I won't let go before you've dreamed all your dreams
I'll play you
You want me to
You ask for more
You want to know

Leave me now, I need to know I'm in control
Leave me alone
Leave me be within my private fantasies

I told you you, I won't let go
I want to show you what dreams can do for you
They'll free you, they'll open doors
They show you all you want to know

As some is light and some is dark, dreams can be both
They have two sides

Fear
I am your fear deep inside

Fear
Face all your fears deep in this dream
We are the dark side of your mind
Pain
I am your pain deep inside

Pain
Feel all your pain deep in this dream
Feel it's a part of you
You are like your dreams, both light as dark
Come with us now and explore

Silence, I'm here
No words, no sounds, no pain or doubts
I'm floating
Even time itself can never touch me
I am free

Silence, I'm here
No voices, no music
I'm roaming through this soundless place
Leave me here where I am free

Doubt
I am your doubt deep inside
I am all you try to hide
Hate
I am your hate deep inside
I am your mirror, your fright

Energized by nightly views
You are the dream, the dream is you
Aah

So face it, you know I'm right
You have no reason to resent me and fight
You are me and I am you
The other side of the sleepy truth

Leave me please, how can I rest with you inside?
Leave me alone, I'm too tired for these crazy theories
Let go

I'll leave you, but won't let go, for I am part of all you'll ever do
I'll help you, I'll open doors and show you all you need to know
For I'm your dream energizer

After Forever,"Here, here in this heart it's cold
Cold as stone
Must welcome these memories
As shallow as my eyes have slowly become

Hearts, frail heart left broken
Cold and known for its bitter agony
Here are the memories as empty as my life has slowly become
Sting, crush and bite in my soul
My heart bleeds

Times changed forever that night
Leaving only empty memories
Empty memories won't heal the pain

We know only sorrow
There's no future in tomorrow
All our hopes were buried too young
For the years that should have followed

We know only hatred
There's no future in our anguish
For all hope is buried with life
And reprisal will be ours

It's empty
We're empty
They're empty memories

Here, here in this heart
Cold as stone, for no feelings there to warm
It is as empty as our dreams and hopes
Now our future is gone
It stings and bites in my soul

Leaving only empty memories
Time was changed forever that night

His feelings go way beyond my own

Just envision, the only way to relate

We try to
We say so but we can only imagine
We want to but can't empathize

She's lying there crying
For the truth was stronger than her pain
Her feelings go way beyond my own

Only sense it
Only imagine their fate

Lashing winds, hot suns and rain

The elements are just as vicious

In the future as in the past
But our memories are strong
And will outlive all circles of time

On until the end of time, on and on
Live before we waste our time, before we run out

We won't win this fight
Until our hearts collide

We were running away from nothing fast
Falling down until we finally crashed
My god, oh my god, can you help me feel anything?
I'm lost in a city of vultures, moths, and pigs
Eating away at everything, oh well, yeah, oh well

Sometimes I wish I was never born in Hollywood

I don't know how to walk
I'm always running unprepared

I'm losing my hope
I'll sell myself for an hour of fame, I know, it's a shame
But I don't care
'Cause you forget who you are when you come to Hollywood

This party never seems to end
When the drugs that kill are our best friends
Keep showing up and acting out
Even though we thought we threw them out

Hello, hello hospital
Look up to the sky
It's time to go

I wanna be buried by your side
Underneath a tree that's hard to find, oh well, yeah, oh well

Averti
Se chiudo I miei begli
Occhietti spenti

E cerco su di me
La tua pelle che non see'è
Poi ti entro, in fondo

Dentro, lo sai
Soltanto per capire chi sei
Forse sei un congegno che
Si spegne da se

E puoi maledire
La tua bocca
Se sbagliando mi chiama
Quando lui ti tocca

Yet fail to display it

Tourniquet to keep the silence secret

Bending with every breeze, you're a
Tall desperate flower, you're a
Waving suicidal desolate hour

Pantomime is your tragedy
It's a thin line here between you sorrow
And your cunning

Desire, desire froze here
Just looks like love from a distance
Desire, desire froze here
Just the path of least resistance

With the winter and the splinters

Broken blades and shards
Just remember that the ending
Is the greater part

Thrown into a hole
Dust to dust there
Dug with your own bones

Through the seaweed there's a hero
Feeling pretty down
Longing only to surrender
But no-one can be found

Every dawn now from this moment
Brings a deadly dew
But nothing undermines a minute
Of the me and you

You gotta be perfect
Whenever you fall
You gotta be perfect
Whenever you fall
You gotta be perfect
Now you're in free fall

Desperate, stoned and scrambled, broken
How beautiful you seem
You know you gotta betray somebody
To get back where you been

Don't you let the road and journey
Devour your skin and heart

Is the greater part

Sai già come sarà, ma non sai più chi sei

Quench ya thirst, but first my journal high seas

Stash fifty, in the world of bird city the warranters

Invest in free markets, cream cheese and pockets

Firearms make fireworks, I wonder where lies lurk
We bloodied up your shirt, all you saw was the fire spark
I'm one of too many, who get amped off Henny
Puttin' cowards in cemeteries, kill willies for pennies

They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody

They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody

Crank that shit amplify the whole scenario
Off the level live or in stereo
Young hustle to stay ahead of step

From where your best bet is to rep yours, repetitiously
'cause this veteran will thrash to wreck yours, repetitiously
If ever you get at me on some bullshit, flash quick
Exactly who the fuck I got pull with

Autographed it for big number one with a bullet
Expressin' black glove love hood it down, how I put it down
This style ain't never been shit to me, why would it now?
I come forth with gun smoke, no petty read ya bound by honor

That I mark you in the hunt for a dollar
Alive on the strength of power you
Divine karma, Allah's armor see you keep fraudulatin'
I'll sick my wolves in your basement, with loaded shell casings

We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody

Conjurin sandstorms, I'll freeze ya then I'll melt ya

These [Incomprehensible], I'm wieldin', straight echoes through the building

Enemies efforts are foreseen in the mental
I make steel wrinkle at the blink of a eye
Terminate, unrighteous conscious states
Imitate the stars while they constellate
The heart rate of my social eloquence makes sense
Intense, with the roughage, you couldn't budge this
Mountainous, type of figure
So check it out, now you know when you lookin' at a real nigga

You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

You eggshell niggas get cracked in half
My armed force throw a road block in your path
Beats smash from True Mast, my shots blast
Shatter glass, crowd watch, the sound sets clash
Quick fast, I let the darts off, with no doubt
Your bitch ass, you head north and break out
The snakes out, hissin', shots missin', observe and respect and listen
And if you get stung twice, that means he's rollin' wit loaded dice
It's like gettin' stabbed with ice and watch the evidence melt
Immediately the blow is felt

Commissioner revoke the belt, the microphone
Microphone flower, fresh shower
Of the rugged garments, break the bread like Noah
I'm holdin', ride the 808 rollin'
Write til my hand's swollen, your no comp ya
Huh, I stomp ya, the monster

Fury portrayed, sharper than the fuckin' cactus
Conquerin' globes and universes with Galactus

Tongue lashes, it rattles, never sliver
Optimus Prime, fatal bites as I deliver
Lyrically deadly, mic flow heavenly
In dwellin' intelligence, choose my weaponry
Battle strategy, bishop cover angles
Knights move next, L shapes, the vortex
Forces break down, now I got the nitty gritty
You think it's a stalemate but now I'm yellin' checkmate
Ultra rhymer, stop breaths like anacondas

You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus

You see these lyrics they gonna laugh at ya
You want to take it to the streets movin backwards
Straight up and down, you get slapped up like Cassius
And if they want holes hook 'em with a catheter
Mental manipulation like Blackula
Controllin forces knockin soldiers off their horses
Whether the Benz or the Rolls Royce's
Ain't nothin close to kilometer Testa Rosa
Body barometer, pop just like a toaster
I heat and freeze it off simultaneously
Instantaneously, ain't no one worthy but me
I hold my head like a sire for a second
The state of hip hop in my head went through blizzards
Now I hokus pokus regain my focus
I got to keep it movin move smoother than Braggadocios

Inferable, impenetrable, mineral, serial
Spiritual, visuals, sprinkle mics with my lyricals

Peep the flames from my orifice, I'm off wit this

ain't goin far my friend
Insatiable unstoppable, syllable, module
It's logical the diabolical after my molecules
I had to enhance my thought pharmaceuticals
Lyrics is literal paintin pictures daily rituals
I like to free verse from coast to coast
On boats and boast, files be dope and dope
Open scopes, Afu is like hope on a rope
Goin for broke, I make sing somethin I wrote

Peep this modern day follow through, nothin will boggle you
Suggest I hit them with the darts, now they jiggle too
Now ladies taste a lick, and lick the lyrical liquor
Takin a swigger, checkin her figure, countin her figga's
Some roll through on that real type Perrelli 'ish
Some roll through on that meet me at the telli 'ish
Evidently, evidence stains for centuries
I carve my name in your head like I'm a memory
I'm composin with the Beethoven slogan
Year 3000 on the run like I'm Logan
Change the gases, switch my anti matter
You see I spent about ten life times as a rapper

Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

S-T, supreme teacher, read you like a preacher
Seat you down, make you pay close attention to my ether
My aura illuminates, removin' the snakes who lay awake
Lovin' to hate but we still elevate

Massagin' the brain, utilize the wisdom contained
Through the knowledge of my circumference and how to maintain
Some nights I walk with the understanding, build cypher
Like Charles Bronson, vigilante ready to snipe ya

Ignite the marijuana, roll a cigar from Havana
Tony Santana, smokin' in the Coco Cabana
Or in the sauna, after doing my Calisthenics
Universal metrics, reversin' the hex, cursin' the sexist

Accepting my blessings, remembering my lessons
Take my dog's suggestions
When he told me keep my smith and Wesson
For protection, the streets is watching and they testin'
They know when you're frontin' and when you're representin'

It's not where you be or how you be
Or who you be or what you got
Unique sounds, grounds is hot
We comin' through, we tidal waves in this rap shit
Now how you be, now who you be and where you be?

You wanna get with the brothers, that's the illest
The microphone have sex with my lyrics
Hit shit off, first move is doggy style
No premature ejaculation, last for a while

Flippin' and turnin' and splittin' it, all type positions
Grabbin' and tuggin' and yokin' it, all type of missions
Crazy, nah, I'm not that type of brother
My verses, when they out in the streets, they carry rubbers

I heard you're drippin', your rap style got gonorrhea
Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Seven days around the clock ass all in the videos
I know you like it, I do too, love the cheese, yo

But this is hip hop, stop it, go make a porno
Not player hatin', on the mic I'm player scrapin'
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to Zeniths
I bounce styles that's sexual, plus I'm intellectual

Thoughts transverse to physical, I keep it spiritual
I got the motts, you bust the dutch, I got the hydro
I just sit back on tracks and let it flow

Feel this, feel this
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

I give you agony, agony, agony, you wanna rump with me?
Constantly, constantly, constantly rollin' a phonta leaf
You know it's beef when you gettin' stomped losin' teeth
Because you sweet and ain't got no claims to the street

You'se the type to get shot and go explain to the cops
Come to court every day, make sure a nigga get locked
But I thought you had that big glock that you bust a whole lot
Then why my nigga's sittin' up in that little cell block?

I'm tellin' ya, ock, the world is a spot for snid-akes
Niggas who hid-ate, do anything to get the pid-apes
Love to see me down and out, blood in my mouth
Steez all sweated out, tied up in my house

Can I live and still give, take my team on sprees?
Twistin out skeeze out of custom drop-top v's?
You know the pedigrees, always stay blowin' the dick
When B.G.S. is the squad, the dice stay on the six

Nuff of dem still in di valley of dry bones
Dem ah search dem seven seas, dem, ah, throw stick and stone
M-mh, dey gonna melt like snow cone
Da minute di countdown say dis ah di final showdown

Well, some ah said dem ah star, dem love car
Dem at war and a blur, dem nah really reach far
But nuff ah dem ah bafoon, dem ah goon
Cartoon, dem nah put out no conscious tune

A-fi warn dem, if dem nah listen, so we scorn dem
We gonna steer far from dem
I know that we are kings and we love nice things
But we not sell out fi no diamond ring

Yo, I got da Lord in ah mi mind
So any which part mi come, mi ah go shine
Trust me, we don't fear nothin
So don't boost up yourself like you are gon' do me somethin'

Mi turn dem off like mi turn of mi light

Travel through eons, mentally to spit it viciously
Slapping up these red-eyed devils, speaking fictitiously
They slipping be	, snippin the, mic styles they slippery
A golden aura, it backs the voice you can't ignore the
Monumental essence, which crowds wish to adore the
Shimmering stone, lace like stylish, luscious, Tiffany
Sages when they meditate, prism filling my imagery
Subliminally, thoughts I set it, Synchronisticaly

Let me kick it most importantly trick-nology
Leave that similac alone, breast feed your seeds

Defense against sickness, unwanted virus
Realize we came to this land by savage pirates
Never migrated, forced dehydrated
Instrumental tools, so knowledge dilapidated
Forced to bring it back, the most high heals the wounds
From the time you conceived, to the day you lay in tombs
Reeducate thy self from spoken fables
Descendants of the kings and queens who made it stable
Whose anatomy contains royal genealogy
You're no the minority, the unseen majority
Communicatin brother to brother before a dialect
Developed longevity, built the first community
Understood the science of healin through herbology

Walk it iller, stalk a sinner, walk beginners

[Afu-Ra]
You can't stop the shiverin, quiverin, while I'm deliverin
Unique stacks, put wack back, I came to bring
Microcosmic author, comin forth here, killa
Mess around, you get stuck like Orca nigga
Frontin like you was the boss and illa
Britches got too big, don't make have to walk a sinner
Next day maybe they have to come and chalk a winner
One to tens is straight ate for dinner
I don't devour, straight restricted to my roughage
Bang like Yamaha, hooker to 1200s
Stealth mode, cloak my dagger like a Klingon
Soul Assassination, bring it on, yeah

[Chorus 4X]

[Afu-Ra]
You catch a mind bleed, eyes bleed, your ears bleed
Your nose bleed, battle wit me, rhymes bleed
My ship is stainless, orbits next your Uranus
AS long as you know, train freeze likes of Pluto
My wordplay firm-lay, in Zero gravi-tay
I be the dentist and you, you be the cavi-tay
Or neurosurgeon, brain work pathogen
Fro your consumption, first thing is oxygen
Throwin out 4 pages to be box ya in
Lock ya in, rock ya sin, you'll see directions in
Lifestyles, young urban perceptions
Don't seek exception, touchin all side of the waters
I dominate, accelerate, illuminate
Exuberate, and motivate, exasperate

[Chorus 4X]",Soul Assassination
Afu-Ra,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Now it's about to be talked about

You're gettin' slapped by my grammar
Vocals like a hammer with roots from Alabama
I'm under cover, make moves like no other
In dark alleys, you're gettin' opened from your belly

I rock spots for blocks, I knock you inna Skelly
I know you're jelly, because Fame, Billy and I be
Mashin' out crews of bad dudes for nothin'
Or 'cause they frontin', they corny style, I show 'em somethin'

A buck fifty ear to ear smash and fear
I'm scrubbin' down, this hip hop shit's infested
Too many niggas sexin' the mic, they not protected
Don't get infected, like a child that's been molested

The surgeon general rap shit just hit your section
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me
It's picture perfect, blaze your mind like it's chronic
'Cause M.O.P. and afu-ra, shits bionic

It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me

It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me

Brownsville slugger, put it on, come on, bring it on
It's a new way for this hip hop shit, sing a long
Who it is, nah bitch the question is, what it is?
It's that back yard bangin' shit, that I rocked for the kids

Clack clack, move son I got nothin' to lose son
There's a million and one ways to die, choose one
Hit or miss, it won't matter to peel yo ass
I'm still left with a million ways to kill yo ass

Now afu-ra split 'em in half with the sword
You heard it from yours truly, chairman of the board
Fizzy Womack, I blow back they whole strap committee
We live and direct from New York City

I'm a stretch a nigga, so you better get your weapon
Stop yappin' with ya dick in your hand and start steppin'
Ghetto warfare, heavy metal warfare
This is war here and we gettin' it on all year, biatch

It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me

It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me

Let's take a trip down burner bark lane
Where the innocent get slain
And what you visualize will ruin your brain
A lot a blood sweat and tears, pain

Nobody stop a murder, as a dealer does it's muthafuckin' thing
Bang bang, just like that, the man'll slit open you
And put two under your hat
And as you lay flat just another nigga whacked

Before he stepped, he threw three through your chest through your back
And your outta here, lights out, game over
You said, you wanted to live life as a soldier
I told ya, we on shaky grounds, a lot of ups and downs
We on force, to run a crash course and blast off rhymes

And of course we have emotions inside, yeah
That's just some shit that we been trained to hide
You hear, be cautious, nigga walk slow
Talk low, this ain't no muthafuckin' talk show, this is

It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me

It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
It's warfare, against any that come up on me
Even in your dreams asleep you couldn't do me

Parallel to my thoughts, tryin' to get

Hey yo, Preemo, should I hit 'em with the rope of dope
Sea shells, sea shells by the sea shore
But now I'm slap, tap and a rap an' attack your jaw
Summertime, ladies at the bus stop
When I roll without the drop, they yellin'
'Shimmy shimmy, Coco Pop'

And I'm thick like yoghurt
Quick to quick to quick to bust a fast word
I know you like what you think what you like

As a matter of a fact
I take it back, in the days
If you wack, in fact, you get the bozack
And the chickens, are thinkin' they finger-lickin'
Tryin' to get the party kicking
But really they should be stinking
Crack the asphalt, while doing lyrical somersaults
Slang slay your head, bang a boogie
I got a think-tank, that's lighting up with the blinks
Move and sway but I'm compared to mint
Some cats can't forget the spiritual and mental
Straight up, yo, I slap 'em with a miracle
Expressing everything, including the kitchen sink
Building on topics from aluminium and zinc
So while you fix your kicks, I do triple axels
Get in your bath or round the rink

I'm Master Marvel, scribble the illest novel
80 more albums, I got more pages than the bible
Never allow my energy through Leviticus
As I rebirth my soul, glowing Genesis
Eyes tearing through the fog
Shout my brothers and sisters

From a path of hip-hop
Shall arm in a synagogue
Dinner china mushroom song

Verse 1:
See whatcha like gimme the mic
I'm rippin and flippin and grippin it tight
Say whatcha like, don't play with me right?
I ride your chain from day to night
Head first with a verse
You see my excerpts got eskimos in igloos sweatin and seek in search
In self-worth, through the knowledge that all age enter the earth
Till the devils and his dogs I fool I'll be the fuckin curse
Spit fire more fire with my nigga Fire
I backflip blindfolded on a highwire
Then fall back on my team and dream of lividcism
I met Noah before the ark and started rhymin with him
If I wanted to flow with him reactin like a cataclysm
And shockwavin my rights into the system

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
Now set trippin and sweatin the aesthetics
The chick's beef hits your ass up like diabetics
I bet it gets, I wrestle it, second album be the predicate
No mismatches, no maxin or relaxin
Toast with the awesome two, break it like your fractions
Peep the equation, these Pythagorean thereom
I know the science for the metals and all the plenums
Until you hate it, young children have been mutilated
It looks good and some of y'all be desecratin
Incineratin wastin your state in the outer space
It's wicked right I hit it right slice doors with a butter knife

Verse 3:
Tippin you off bringin it forth, knowledge be the jump-off
Wax on wax off, liquid form-I turn to hot sauce
While some may want they salad tossed I can bust like Matatov
Now get your saddle off, quit bustin, no towelin off
Some pip squeaks in the game night ride like Hasslehoff
Stand back to your skin and feel my G-force
Tic tac toein I keep it flowin and flowin
No need for detonators my shit be mind blowin
Blind the sights likes of Ihmotep
Flippin the script ring the alarm like Ghengis Khan
Who rocks all takes all kick it like Win Chaw
Or ping pong crackin the mic, the dreaded King Kong

It ain't about talent, it's all about the currency

As we haze through the haze of enslavement
While the sweat's beatin millions of feet pound on the pavement
I know it's nine to five, or five to nine
Forget about the thoughts that I'm wastin' my time
Just use the tutelage, of your legendary fore-fathers
'cause right now, we now the struggle is ours
It's not too complicated, just combinations of pulling our resources
Of our sisters and our brothers
Who be a alike, that's a little insight
The strength be coming in numbers it's like dynamite
No riddle right, spit it right, about some real life
And are we really rich, at peace and settled?
When everyday homeless people peddle for nickels
While Easy Mo Bee strikin' a chord
Of this hip-hop oracle, desires for life
And what? You know what I'm coming to
It's just my point of view

Magnificent filament I represent

Dressed in all white, sparking up my tire
It's Brooklyn dance y'all that have me in a trance y'all

I slid my way, right up in a jam
Skated on the dance floor like I was Peter Pan
Put style's together, I inspired Dapper Dan
Plus I'm down with the Wu-Tang Clan

No bodyguards, I'm just a dred rolling dolo
Looking for an empress and not a ho, yo
I made my way to the bar, the DJ shouted me out
To kick that Shogun slogan

I ordered Hennessey mixed with Captain Morgan's
And made my way right to the booth, to bust a flow son

Nobody move, nobody get hurt

And all my big body medium and slim body Chaka queens
A hip hop nigga rocking in reggae scene
Arms out, skin out, synchronized as he rock to the beat
And can you stand the heat

And can you wind your waist without moving your feet
And if you don't like sweating, you should take a seat
Yeah, yeah, I mixed it out with my homey, Robbie Gandis
Pulling a cigar from Havana, like a don dada

While lil' ma's eyein' me up in the corner
I talk to bartender and order two corona's
I slid on over, the way she look made me sober

I held a taxi and hopped up in the backseat
He told the driver, 550 Jay Street
And by the way, I'm taking you with me

I focused to spit it right, my songs are an offerin'

Knowledge first, over beats, producers are samplin'
Myself and creations, on the line as I offer in
It's kinda sad that the toxins are smotherin'
Youth in the hood, poisoned by instant messages

Materialism, barbarianism, all types of isms
And schisms by tainted vision
I watched you grow from a seed into a forest
I watered you and watered you but your flowers are dyin'

I'm loving your music beautifully, I feel you slippin' away

Come here girl, uh-uh, can't have my love gone
It's like En Vogue, I guess I gotta 'Hold On'
I wanna drop it for the cause, I know you righteous
Spit something from the heart, help clean up the virus
Decapitate ferocious, peg leg rap pirates

They only flowing now, 'cause the dough flowing now
Who, what, when, why, where and how
I'm sorry baby, that you've been used and abused
And served like hell, some they say I'm a tattle tale

Although I'm optimistic, balance it with being realistic
Is paradise is part of the plan or scribbled in some book and shit

It all goes down as rain drops on my neighborhood
Love my hood and motherfucker this ain't good
Crack heads selling dope to dope heads
On blocks that's rented by house niggaz

That's all getting rich off of the bloodshed
And as I experience, none the lesser
And it's high and it's high as I got off of the reefers
The balance levels of horror, yo, ain't never disappear

I put the pedal to the metal, heavy metal in the ghetto
I ain't got to raise it, cause hell is the grimy ghetto
I guess that's the catalyst for so many fantasies
We can fantasize and happen to be surrounded by misery

The daughters and sisters, the little bitties
Princess inside ya beautiful
But mommy can't afford the sparkles and dresses
As a matter of fact, kids around here
Need to be walking with a vest on

'Cause the quietest streets around here, can be a war zone
And I'm in such disgust, 'cause the police
Instead of protectin' and serving, they serving us

They brutalizin' and battering, as a matter of fact
They play ghetto, officers, I see them laughing
Trynna pick up girls in uniform
Hanging out them college dorms, we need some inform
Why is he a ghetto? 'Cause society divided by nothing but money, hello

From Brownsville to Russia, through Somalia, through Croatia

Demons coming for your hide but there's no where to run
Straight up, and there's no where to hide
Guess what, 'cause negative situation is winning by a landslide
And if you living this life, there's the worst schools
And the worst doctors, guess what? Society got ya

Afu-Ra,"I'm a problem child, I'm my own worst enemy
No matter what happens in life, precise and nothing scares me
Even the bombs is exploding all around me
I be the type of man, who stand his ground, firmly

I'm compulsive, psychotic in the mental
A walking fear factor, seven thirty, it's that simple
I've been exposed to a universe of negative fallout
The fact that I move on nothing, it makes me wanna ball out

Instead, I put vocals to the beats and get it popping
The harm glare right through the track, I feel like rocking
But back to the program, damn
My evil and is taking over like I'm sinking in some quicksand

Really I feel like going up in a blaze, hot damn
I'm a cross of Jack the Ripper and the Son of Sam
It's like I'm living five lives and of five guys
With five million ways to bust heads, so forgive my slide

I said yo, yo, do you wanna rumble?
Come and rumble with me
I've been working out these problems in my mind

Imagine yourself free falling, falling and falling
A thousand story's, after diggin' some stars in scrolls
That's how I feel, 24 hours a day
From Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday and even on Saturday, it's like I'm trapped in a box

Uh-huh, going to war with myself
So I can't stop thinking about killing myself
So I do what I do, to do what I do, to break the rules
Only form of therapy is to spit it for you

Charismatically drastic with this rap shit
Thoughts are falling off but send them back like elastic
Get the politic sorrows in the music game
I'm trynna make sense of corruption in my brain

I hope this part of my life, don't want war with my seeds
Masturbation of pornos, wrapped in best flame
The little things, that's gon' drive me insane

I said yo, yo, do you wanna rumble?
Come and rumble with me
I've been working out these problems in my mind
Yo, do you wanna rumble?
Come and rumble with me
I've been working out these problems in my mind

I'm in hell, raised in lyrically blazing
To make a long story short, I'm half man, half amazing
Sometimes I don't know whether I'm coming or going
So I dive head first into the track and keep flowing and flowing

My hearts on my sleeve, my loves growing and growing
That's how I like, from the music I make rumble
From the forty come licks, that's right I watch 'em crumble
Survival of the fittest, this business means business
Gotta say what I mean, gotta handle to my business

I'm one soldier fighting against a whole army
I'm little with bullets, yeah and none of them harming
My third eye, six stones, the eyes on the prize
Going from knowledge, build the wise

And if I ain't successful
In the back of my mind, I gotta wonder why
I keep my nose, yeah, fit to the grindstone
Going and showing and growing top of these fucking poems

I said yo, yo, do you wanna rumble?
Come and rumble with me
I've been working out these problems in my mind
Yo, yo, do you wanna rumble?
Come and rumble with me
I've been working out these problems in my mind

Afu-Ra,"Rap stack, spectacular with the vernacular
Stealth from a killing spree, they call be Blackula
Step back, get your neck fractured by the rapture
Get choked out to the beat by the manufacturer

And I ain't here to laugh at you, I'm just here to mash
Like potatoes, flush your fucking flow down the drain yo
Let's get it on, let's get it gully, get it ugly
East New York nigga, we get it muddy, feel this

I'm hittin' with sound, with the sound of a tre pound
That knock niggaz down, then run clowns outta town
My malls taller than skyscrapers, you catchin' the vapors
You only got a pair of jacks, I got a pair of aces

As a matter of fact, I left a pool of bb's on your girl's face, kid
Slap the taste out your mouth from the Boogie Down
To the southern most tempted down south
There's six million ways to kill a pussy, wanna count?

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

When I step up in the studio, rollin' dolo
With the bolo, mandingo, stunnin' mojo
Que paso? I be the sharpest capolo
I ride over the ruggedest tracks like a Tahoe

Maybe a bronco or even a durango
I MC for life, that's right, I do my thing, yo
Bang bang yo, back 'em on the chain gang
Yo, I wanna spit it for my people so I can let 'em know

I never ripped it to show off that I'm nicest
My instinct, is in sync plus it's timeless
And the light I shine dog is ultraviolet
A night catch a sun tan man where my rhyme hits

My soul glow is unstoppable, unrockable
I'm light weight but I can put you in the hospital
Hittin' up the collective or individuals
I'm like an eighth covered in crystal, I'm gonna hit you

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me, do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing

Oh, oh, so I'm the shit huh, now I'm Down like a Black Hawk
Everywhere I go, like I'm walking on the catwalk
I wax it and tax it, I'm doing the kungfu kick
Holding my dick like Michael Jackson

Yowser, yowser, yowser, the more you can bounce to count
That everybody feel the power, you know
I step on the stage, my mic like a light saber
Blast through the Seran Vega then I jump off the wall

As I take it to your face like Vega
Now who wanna contest the champion sound
With the crown from the underground ready to fuckin' put it down
Parallel or perpendicular, you couldn't get with the

Lyrical elixir, I be the victorious
And bless the mic so glorious
And go 'head and dust off your rust
I leave you stiff as a statue boy, standing in the dust

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing

There I go on my way through the crowd up to the podium

Smile for the camera, boys, gold record in hand

All of our lives dedicated to shoving it right back in their fucking face

Against Time,"When I was a little kid my friends did never care, no matter how I felt or thought they just where never there, and so I spend my days alone at home thinking about how it would feel to have a friend who is a friend without a doubt. My life has been a struggle, my life has been unkind, forgot about my past pushed everything aside. The world I used to know was not the same not anymore, the first time I felt free was when I opened up this door to your mind suddenly I saw the things I searched for but could not find, in your eyes. Was I blind to realize you've always been there by my side? The pressure was released out of my head, the pressure pulled out by regret I don't neglect I run away! So now I'm facing up to a whole new life no longer more am I afraid for whatever comes within my way. From day to day I keep on going forwards through the pain. Hey can you hear me laughing standing naked in the rain. And I am cleaned from every single feeling that was locked inside my head; the raindrops wash them all away. I will make my own decisions, not to fake my time away again. I have kept some self-expression and I am still your friend to stay. ",Friends
Against Time,"Do you believe in a full-scale majority? They try to rule our lives in ways it should not be. We try to resist them we try to restrain them we try it all in our own ways, but our fake machine doesn't seem understanding they're fucking things up anyway. Live your life today so they can't take it away from you, don't believe their political games. Don't let them steal all your dreams. Today. They violate our society confidence.

Agathodaimon,"Where the wind blows over the mountaintops into the ancient sky 
And the flowers whither in the shadows of an autumn night 
Misty fog arises from the valleys and hides the face of the moon 
Underneath the ground lies a forgotten wisdom deep entombed 

As long as ravens ride the nights 
As long as the spirit of the earth takes seat between the spheres 
The path beyond was locked behind the gates of consciousness - the mirror of the soul 

Time is passing by the mist, is creeping through the deserted land 
And all the forests throw their leaves into the growing realm of sand 
A whispered cry which told the tale of earth is hurt from above 
It drowns the night into bright light and breeds a paradise beyond 
And the wind unveils the hidden treasure from the soil 
A sweet melancholy fills the plain with a lovely sound 
Unleashing the key to the gates of consciousness 

Take my hand I'll show you heaven 
And walk the path beyond with me 
Together we will stand the night and flee from the void",Paradise Beyond

Agent 51,"

Here I am a soldier, slowly sinkin' in the
Quicksand of the past
Got no recipe. Muffins won't rise
And the margarine's goin' fast
My walls are blue
Colors won't with the red door still in sight
I think of you
The sky caves in and my eyes are stabbed with light
Hurt me
Hate me
Help me
Who's gonna save me?
Walk a thousand paths and Babylon itches
With the shifting of the social scale
Like a castaway
Rabbit yells back and the register rings ""no sale.""
Don't nail the lid
I'm still breathin' and my heartbeat's goin' fast
Not givin' in
Maybe I'll get lucky and I'll find
Inner peace at last
What's my destiny
Whoa no that can't be
Just look and you'll see
Want self sufficiency
Whoa no that can't be
What's my destiny
Slavin' to the grind, workin' overtime
Whoa no it can't be

Agent 51,"

Back in the days when I burned out
I wondered to myself just why I never got it figured out
I'm a hero on a mission in a protoplasmic sphere
In another couple minutes I'll up and disappear
Naivete is the key to getting caught up
In a side of life that brings you up and tries to keep you down
In an effort to suppress the most ecclesiastical of beings in

the modern town
We used to be the ones who said:
No way, No way, I'm never gonna take that
No way, No way, I'm never gonna touch that
No way, No way, I'm never gonna do that
Finally one day you'll give in then you'll be a burnout waste of
(fucking) time.
My time is up, my mind is spun
Sitting without direction and I can't get nothing done.
With a zero facing upwards and imaginary friends
On a downward moving sidewalk on a street that never ends.
Got no time for thinking, no time for reasoning
I'm just a screaming siren in a world that has no sound.
My feeble mind is set on autopilot
With a socket wrench with which to pound me right into the ground.
Syncopated and serrated, go a ride-accelerated,
Got it right in front of me, right in front of me.
You know that I got it and you're never gonna take it away!

Was just a hidden tragedy

What do you get for your anger
And what do you get for your pain
Its how you live this life in danger
Your always on the go
Still only scars remain
Well its been so long since I have tried
Yea its been so long since I have cried
So life goes on
Yea its been so long
Yea its been so long sice I've felt the pain
Well I'm movin east bound on the west bound train
So life goes on
Its been so long
I try to do what is right now
I don't try to do what is wrong
The lies of guilt are comin out now
And I sit here alone
And sing another song
Just take a look in the miror
And tell me what do you see
Down play the croud to the guily
And make believe, and make believe you don't need me

everybody stop asking me 
i'm telling you i'm not in love 

there's no such thing 
it doesn't matter to me i know 
there's no such thing 
isn't that a relief to know 
there's no such thing 

hey you, snap out of it 
it's time for you to act your age 
no you're never gonna get your way 
so break into a screaming rage 
a good excuse t start a non-stop teenage romance 
turning love into lust 
i'm only looking for somebody to talk to 
or somebody that i can trust

Let's get away for a day or two
Send some money, send some fame
Without you it won't be the same

I need time to pick up all the bits and pieces
Of these broken dreams

Well, I guess that you might say
That we've come a long, long way
But I say it's too soon to tell
If our scheme will win or fail

So get the toolbox out

To fix these broken dreams

Agent Orange,"It was something you said about the way it goes 
That was making me think, ""I'm jamming the controls"" 
I need something to help me see 
How fast I'm moving now 
I can see it all clear, but I don't know why 
'Cause I know in my mind, I've got to try my luck 
I've got nothing left to lose 
Now I'm watching my whole life flash before my eyes 

I can picture myself on the edge of a desert plain 
It's the sound of my voice 
Through the force of the wind and rain 
As I open my eyes I can now see the sky transform 
I'm looking into the eye of the electric storm 

I've got cranked into overdrive 
That's all that's keeping me alive 
I need more than couple thousand volts 
To keep the thunder rolling now 
I'm hoping these clouds won't dissipate 
And I'm praying to god that it's not too late 
I've got to make my way up to the top 
To the place where the lightening bolts 
Come crashing down 

Now I'm standing up tall 
With my hands reaching towards the sky 
I'll be searching for something more until the day I die 
The rain on my face feels cold but the wind is warm 
I'm in shock from the raging power of the electric storm",The Electric Storm
Agent Orange,"It's like a form of addiction
It's a fear that I just can't hide
Although it seems like a gift from god
It's a pain that I feel inside
I know I've got to move quickly
And I know I've got to do it right
Always feeling reckless
Always searching day and night

'cause I just can't seem to get enough
I've tried - but it's just no use
I just can't seem to get enough
I've tried - but I just can't take any more abuse

let me tell you something
If I could, you know I'd sell my soul
Every time I hear that sound
You know I lose all self control
Sometimes I feel like a hero
Doomed to die in a raging war
Sometimes it seems like it's over
But I know there's got to be more
",Just Can't Seem to Get Enough
Agent Orange,"I propose that we devise a plan
Down to every last detail - we cannot fail
'cause the only thing that's standing in our way
Is disastrous betrayal
So let the driving force prevail

now I'm falling back on all the dreams we left behind
It's a lesson that I never thought I'd learn
Tonight I'm gonna sacrifice something I really love
Feel it melt into my hands and
Let it burn - all night long

ever since the day it all began
Massive walls surrounding me - on every side
Now I hear a crash - they all come tumbling down
As memories collide - I'm living for that wild ride

could it be that I've forgotten what I came here for?
When I leave this world, I never will return
I know the only way for me to save my soul tonight
Is to light the midnight lamp and
Let it burn - all night long

what can I say? you know what it means to me
I would kill to be where I belong
I know this thing could live endlessly
But I can hear them saying



",Let It Burn
Agent Orange,"You know you don't have time to sit around
Waiting for the perfect chance to come your way
And you'll never find the answers to the questions you ask
By listening to what other people say

You've got to let originality be your inspiration
You know plagiarism is a crime
(Dexter!)
Even if it turns out to be a miserable disaster
You will live to try another time that's why I say

Make up your mind and do what you want to do

Well you've got to be joking, if you say your thoughts
Have fallen into someone else's hands
And you've got to be crazy, if you think your life
Is just a mess of threats and tough demands

Well you just can't be that far away from what you want
To think that nothing's gonna get you there
'cause the truth is you were born with everything you need
No, you don't have to be a billionaire all you have to do is

Make up your mind and do what you want to do

If you're gonna do it, do it right!
In the end you're gonna see that it was worth your time
The results are gonna make you smile
There's really nothing to it, if you use your head
And concentrate for just a little while

All it takes is just a twist of your wild imagination
New ideas will come tumbling out
Can you feel the time slipping?
Don't keep the world waiting
Listen up, if you can hear me shout

Make up your mind and do what you want to do
",Make up Your Mind and Do What You Want to Do
Agent Orange,"Let me remind you all again
That there is never any room
For any doubt
I feel it in my heart, I shout it out
And if I decide to change my ways
It's not because I've found the latest craze
It's just that I've got more to lose this time

you know that you can count on one thing
I would never let you down
As crazy as this world may seem
The thing that keeps it spinning 'round
Is always there
So close and yet so far

and you can believe it's true
A reason behind everything I do
A twist that makes it different every time
There are those who say ""it's all been done""
There's nothing stopping us
From having fun
And that's why I'll be coming 'round again

you know that you can count on one thing
I would never let you down
As crazy as this world may seem
The thing that keeps it spinning 'round
Is always there
So close and yet so far...

...away - but it gets a little closer every day
And I will hold it in my hand before I die
You know there isn't any way that we can lose
And you don't have to be confused
By hollow words that never mean a thing
When tragic things keep happening
To everyone around you
You don't have to be the same
This is the song that begs to set you free
A sparkle in the night
When we come face to face
Don't close your eyes
Don't ever turn away

because the only way you'll ever know
Is if you ever really try
So find out for yourself
Then you won't ever have to wonder why
As crazy as this world may seem
The thing that keeps it spinning 'round
Is you because you're always there
So close and yet so far



",So Close and Yet So Far
Agent Orange,"All I want is to be mesmerized
And you know what does those things to me hypnotized?
Look deep into my eyes
Look deep into my eyes and you will see

That I'm the one who walks the tightrope up above
The heads of many who would love to see me fall
But when I'm feeling right, the music never stops
I'm breaking bones, but I can feel, no pain at all I know that

This is all I need this is all that I desire
I'll tell you this I'm coming right down to the wire again
This is all I need and this is all I need to know
I'll be lost until the music takes control

It seems to me there must be more to life you know
Than racing up and down these dead end streets
I've got to try out here it's do or die
And I'll be leaving nothing incomplete

This is all I need this is all that I desire
I'll tell you this I'm coming right down to the wire again
This is all I need and this is all I need to know
I'll never stop until the music takes control
",This Is All I Need
Agent Orange,"I've got to tell you
That you are the last people in the world
Who will see me jump because I will never
Ever, ever jump again, I am through

I believe that every inch of smooth cement
Upon this earth is sacred
That he who sees it blur beneath his feet
Will always be one step ahead

I can see the only way that we can change
Our future is to brainwash and manipulate
The minds of those who draw the lines
That form the city scape's

What moves beyond these walls
Won't get far without abusing all the laws
I'll tell you why
We are unsafe at any speed

You're lost, now shut your eyes
Get ready for another big surprise
All at once you're blinded by the flashing lights
A blessing in disguise

Every time you stop to think
You waste another precious moment
And every time you draw another breath
You're one breath closer to the end

Somehow I'll survive, I've got to live
'Cause that's the only thing that makes me feel alive
We are unsafe at any speed

Something new would change your life?

That mattered long ago
And if you had your way
Would everything be like it was before?
Could it be that you would never ask for more?

I know that I'd never last a day without you
I wouldn't last a day without you

would it be too much to ask
If we could save a little time?
It's such a precious thing
That seems so hard to find
And if we get the chance
Let's hope that you and I won't change our minds
We'll twist and tangle as our destinies unwind

I know that I wouldn't last a day without you
I couldn't find my way without you

And then he died

Yeah! I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life
I'll decide not you

Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for livin' in
Yeah! I will start again
It can take forever, and ever
Whatever, whenever, but I'll still win

How many like him
Are they still

Agent Steel,"I hear a voice
It calls my name
It once was simple now the complications reign
I recognize
But I won't change
This coldness that you serve
Will only cause you pain

It isn't easy since I understand their ways
My hate endures, you waste your trust
We sit in silence and I turn my eyes away
I'd give anything for yesterday

I voice my anger
I voice our shame
We've poisoned all our lives
We've no one else to blame
We had our chance
To turn them away

Agent Steel,"Rot in cages we crouch naked
Waiting for the rest to land
Extended faith they betrayed our friendship
Imprisoned us by our own hand

Time for us to wake and rise up
May be too late but we must attack
Either that or we'll know forever
We're born cowards and we can't fight back

Prodded punctured probed and tested
Is this the way man was born to live?
Bred like cattle and raised for slaughter
Without a soul we've nothing more to give

[Chorus]
And the war begins from behind cages
Feed no more, rot, we're useless dead

The only way to win is to starve them
The way to win is to end our lives
Our sacrifice renders our flesh useless
Our death is life for the few outside

The future for these struggling rebels
Who gather armies for the final fight
Without strength our captors weaken
We do our best to do our best and die",Fighting Backwards
Agent Steel,"The god sighed and silence was born
A tortured life is spared of vision
And it's painful when it's worn
The cloak of shame spares no protection

His world is made of steel
In his hands he bent the fire
To mold a thing so real
A burning world born of desire

[Chorus]
His hope was not enough
To fill an empty cup
He simply let it drain into the nowhere
There is no reckoning
There is no bargaining
In symbol rain will fall as he lays weeping

We stand below rinsed by the tears
Unlike rain they bring no healing
Rust corrodes the souls
Of children wrought to match his image
Abandoned with all of his cares 
No choice but to wait for the kindness of time
To erase us one and all
To flow like a river with no beginning

Head in hands and weary eyes
The failures scratch and carve the lines
Into the face of one
The lines into the face of none
He sees the world 
He sees his dreams
And nothing's ever as it seems
The promise was so real
Now all that's left is crumbled steel

No prayers are said in his name
Nobody knew that he ever existed
Alone he accepts all the blame
Plaintively wonders how dreams become twisted
And he waits for another to come
Another, a chance to revive from the nothing
The fabric to weave once again
To forge from the fire his vision of man",Into the Nowhere
Agent Steel,"Something's wrong with the world
Something's wrong with the view from here
It's so hard to explain
The visions I see are rarely clear
Just below the lie I am sure of hides the real
Reality, we feed machines, with minds in need of worth

Contact made with the truth
Through lines of code on my computer screen
Binary diamonds of proof
Shining stars unlock doors made of dreams
Beyond required imagination hides the hive
Born from AI, we live the lie cocooned in lieu of life

With dreams we feed reality
Your fantasy a fallacy?
Imprisoned by your memory, a memory?

There's no promise of peace
There's no comfort and no guarantees
Once the system's been killed
We'll have no choice; we'll have to rebuild
And life won't be the pretty picture you recall
But it will be reality and you'll be free

With dreams we feed reality
Your fantasy a fallacy?

From sleep comes the secret held deep in the psyche
Restless vision
The pain of regaining the truth in the message

Descendents of creatures so cruel and self serving
Infected again and again

Know your master
You're not equal
Know your master
Face your father

Beneath the ruins
Revealed before time might destroy all the remnants
Predecessors
Creators of space and lords of dimension
Godless fathers
Transcribing the answers
Written in mind and in body, in gene, the code that erodes with your humanity

The change is upon us
Arranged with the dawning
Revealed to us all

No escaping
Shape-shifting reptiles our fathers and true gods
Wait inside us
Dormant but fertile and aching to spawn
Once it's happened
It won't be reversed as the plan is the blueprint
Designed to decree by the powers that be 
that we hold in ourselves keys to their destiny",Know Your Master

Feel the ground split and crack and crumble beneath you
Calamity serves a nightmare
Never to wake from these dreams of destiny

Struggle to cling to your mind
Grasping at twines to hold your world together
Replacing the truth
Breathe in the proof
And pray your god is forever

[Chorus]
All are silent 
Full with old dirt
All are stifled
Earth's hand turns to fist
Forget, erase, the monster you made and the hate that you save
In time, you'll find, you'll learn to grow in the new world

Ushering in the sun
Barren earth smiles and greets its warmth with awareness
Gathering clouds, earth drinks the rain

Did you buy it from a dealer,
Did you get it from a healer,
Or did you steal it from my imagination

Bright lights on a starless night
Burn a hole in the dying day

Tryin' to trick a girl like it's an art
Here today but he's gone tomorrow
Tryin' to get with this, I don't need the sorrow

Wants, why are all the guys all
Big smile, sweet talk
While checking out my body parts

My boy is makin' his move slow
My boy knows how to make a girl glow
My boy he doesn't come late, no
Always comes when the time is right though
I don't need no fast love I need a love that last so
My boy won't you come and rescue me
(Won't you come and rescue me)

Talking 'bout your car 'bout your cash 'bout your game
Everybody's sounding the same it's a shame
They are promoting when I need devotion
You need to slow it down show me some emotion

Why, can't they see what this girl
Wants, why are all the guys all
""my love is your love""
The first night you meet them

Agnes,"We had the right love
At the wrong time
Guess I always knew inside
I wouldn't have you for a long time

Those dreams of yours
Are shining on distant shores
And if they're calling you away
I have no right to make you stay

But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours
Will come to see
That you belong with me

Sometimes good-byes are not forever
It doesn't matter if you're gone
I still believe in us together
I understand more than you think I can
You have to go out on your own
So you can find your way back home

And somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours
Will come to see
That you belong with me

Letting go
Is just another way to say I
Always love you
So

We had the right love
At the wrong time
Maybe we've only just begun
Maybe the best is yet to come
'Cause

Somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again

In grey stockings, in all might
It was no loss
The only God of mine

He fell down, just to drown
In a sea of delight
To tame champagne
And creatures of the night

As the water took him over
Filled his lungs inside out
I sold his gold
For flowers and rice

Speaking fire, he would hire
Pawns and peasants just like me
To feed upon the conquered ones
But now we are free",Philharmonics

In the holly red in the night
Dirt under my shoe from the old at heart
Right under you, grinning in the dark

To bury the wave in the tide
You carried me onto the fields

There is a grove, there is a plot
Deep in the snow, breaking your heart
One step ahead, a thousand miles
A trail ablaze to the Aventine

You carried my heart in the night
To marry the wave with the tide
You carried me onto the fields

Will you ever let us carry on

Swaying like the children,
Singled out for praise
The inside out on the open
With the straightest face

The final dying joke caught in our hands

Oh, darling, will it bring me sorrow,
Will you let me hold you in this way?

Hold you close without a soul in sight

Keeping you up,
Hunting for treasure

Staying up late,

But you've got a date.

But you've still got the itch,

You can't mix, you can't switch,
Just a case of a face and a place, no disgrace
It's just a rhythm a syndrome
It's a feeling you crave,

Move at your leisure
Make tracks leave no signs,
Like a fire in the desert
With winds from behind,
You're getting hot and live wired
Using down time,
All for business and pleasure

Agnetha Fältskog,"I talk to my mirror now
Why does it have to be me?
Oh, listen to the rumours now
Pick up the pieces and see.

Oh, but I'd never hurt you, I wouldn't want to,
Why does everybody look for troubles when there isn't any?
No one listens to me, so I'm talking to you.
Go walk in your sunshine now 

I'm standing here in the rain.
And it's a misunderstanding now
Nothing can cover my pain.
I'm here in the darkess, down in the shadows,

Why does everybody disappear when you need somebody?
No one listens to me, so I'm begging you to.
Why don't ya save me, save me, save me, save me, save me?
Tell me you love me, it'll be alright,

Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me.
Tell me you need me, it'll be alright,
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to love without you.
Tell me you want me, say that you need me

Don't want to live without you, so why don't you save me?
Why don't you save me?
Save me, why don't you save me?
Love and devotion now

That's all I had in my mind.
Oh, but sorrow and heartache
That's all I seem to find.
I'm in the middle and I'm losing my grip

No one there to catch me when my world begins to slip,
No one's looking for me, so I'm talking to you.
Something to treasure now
Don't often happen these days.

Why often you pick up the pieces now?
Don't watch them slipping away.
I need someone to hold me when my feelings are low
Somebody to tell me when I need to know,

Won't you listen to me, when I'm begging you to?
Why don't ya save me, save me, save me, save me, save me?
Tell me you love me, it'll be alright,
Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me.

Tell me you need me, it'll be alright,

Agnetha Fältskog,"(Edelman)

Now you and I descended
On a world with innocent hopes
We traveled that criss-crossed highway
And cascaded down the slopes.

It's time to look at who we are
And let the feelings show
It's time to leave the past now
And grow.

I've listened to endless voices
I've proceeded with endless tact
I've figured in endless numbers
And I've worked on the traits I lacked.

I've come too far, the time is right
The devil's made his pact
It's time to stop pretending
And act.

I turn the world around
Change the things that need changing
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of sight.

Oh, turn the world around
Don't you limit your ranges
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of sight.

And there were feelings
I was inclined to believe they would never fade

How things don't always work that way

There was something in the air
Maybe it was magic
And there was something in your voice
When you used to call my name
And there are moments in my life
That I can still remember
And there are places in my heart
That I cannot forget

And there was music
We danced in the sunlight and glittered like gold

Agnetha Fältskog,"Must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned.
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came.
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away.
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came.
Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see.
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came.
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof
I must have heard the sound of rain

It's just a long flight home,
The last touch in the morning
Is forever gone,

Mmm, oh baby, I want to hold you once again
Mmm, baby, it would never be the same
Never again, will I look into your eyes
Never again,

Never again, will I hold you late at night
Never again.
Tomorrow's waiting,
It's time for me to go,

You don't have to say a thing
'Cause we will always know,

Yeah, baby, we had it all for a little while.

One way love - it pulls you in, it takes you down
And I wish I knew what I had to do
To get into your life, to get close to you
But, baby, it's a one way love
One way love, if you could only see me as I see you
One way love, you'd feel the way I feel tonight
And I can't go on living other lives
Making other plans to keep the tears from my eyes
Oh, baby, it's a one way love
So don't turn away, and don't say it's over
I'm falling like I never knew
And I can't pretend, for I keep remembering
Everything that we've been through
One way love - it lives in shadows, cold and lonely
One way love - it lives alone, it breaks your heart
And I don't know how I can take the pain
Hurting over, and over, and over again
And, baby, it's a one way love
So don't turn away, and don't say it's over

Agnetha Fältskog,"School bag in hand
She leaves home
In the early morning
Waving goodbye
With an absent-minded smile
I watch her go
With a surge of
That well-known sadness
And I have to sit down
For a while
The feeling that I'm
Loosin her forever
And without really
Entering her world
I'm glad whenever I
Can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers
All the time
I try to capture
Every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
Do I really see what's
In her mind
Each time I think
I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers
All the time

Sleep in our eyes
Her and me
At the breakfast table
Barely awake I
Let precious time go by
Then when she's gone
There's that odd
Melancholy feeling
And a sense of
Guilt I can't deny
What happened to the
Wonderful adventures
The places I had
Planned for us to go
Well some of that we did
But most we didn't
And why I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers

Sometimes I wish
That I could freeze
The picture
And save it from
The funny tricks of time

Schoolbag in hand
She leaves home
In the early morning
Waving goodbye

When winter rains, I'll be your friend

Agnetha Fältskog,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All

'Cause I couldn't take the heartache again

Wouldn't compromise, it's never the same

And suddenly, closer to me

I wake up in the morning and I wonder 
Why everything's the same as it was

Why do these eyes of mine cry?

Here's a new one for you

A most unusual colouring book

These are the eyes
That watched him
As he walked away
Colour them grey

This is the heart
That thought
He would always be true
Colour it blue

These are the arms that held him
And loved him
Then lost him somehow
Oh, colour them empty now

These are the beads
I wore until she came between
Colour them green

This is the room that I sleep in
And walk in and weep in and hide in
That nobody sees
Oh, colour it lonely please

Whose love I depended upon

I need someone who understands
Who leads me through the haze

It's only when I'm dreaming
That I fall in love for real
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming

And it's now
That I need a friend
I reach out for the phone

Though it may not be right
To give up the fight
I'm sailing away
Now I'm on my own, alone

What now my love?
Now that you left me
How can I live through another day?
Watching my dreams turning to ashes
And my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see
Once I could feel
Now I am numb
I've become unreal
I walk the night
Without a goal
Stripped of my heart
My soul

What now my love?
Now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars
Tumbling around me
There's the sky
Where the sea should be

What now my love?
Now that you're gone
I'd be a fool
To go on and on
No one would care
No one would cry
If I should live or die

What now my love?
Now there is nothing
Only my last goodbye
My love

I can feel a glowing sensation taking place

Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room

Baby it's a dream come true (dream come true)
Standin' right alongside of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stand and stare
I can feel a something pounding in my brain

Agnieszka Skrzypek,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

I'm holding onto time,
and time is holding on to me,
I'm holding onto love,
But our loves not what it used to be

Verse 1:

I'm holding onto time,
and time is holding onto me,
I'm holding onto love,
But our loves not what it used to be,

Pre-Chorus:

We're crying all,
Of the time,
On the shoulders of each other,
Is it Worth it?
And we're lying all
Of the time,
To each other,
And my baby is it worth it?
Is it worth it?

Chorus:

Is it Worth It?
Staying together,
Is it Worth It?
When we don't love each other?
Is it Worth It?
We're just hurting & fighting,
Is it Worth It?
Bringing each other down?
Is it worth It?

Verse 2:

There's nothing left to say,
Except it's time to move on,
I don't want you to turn around,
And see my teardrops fall
To the ground ound ound,

Pre-Chorus:

We're crying all of the time,
On the shoulders of each other
Is it Worth It?
And we're lying all of the time,
To each other,
Oh my baby is it Worth It?
Is it Worth It?

Repeat Chorus 2 Fade:",Worth It
Agoria,"She wants to get rid of it, you know
It's true that it doesn't fit, and through
It all it falls at her feet
Though it's nice, though it's cool, she just can't have it that long.

When she goes out in the streets she takes
Her two kids with their grinding teeth, in case
Someone would dare to touch it
For it's nice, for it's cool, for she's got to take it off.

No matter who she kneels
She wants them at her heels
For boys like those cheap thrills
She's the fucky fucky sucky sucky tiger.

No matter who she kneels
She wants boys at her kneels
And for they pay her bills
She'll go for the classy Baboul Hair Cutting.

She walks as a street godess, you know
It's true she can afford it, and through
It all she's a hairy teen
Though she's nice, though she's cool, she just can't bear it no more.

For she is the Baboul Queen, and she's
Willing to make every man look grim
Compared to her beautiful hair
Boy it's nice, boy it's cool, boy she's got to take it off.

No matter who she kneels
She wants them at her heels
For boys like those cheap thrills
She's the fucky fucky sucky sucky tiger.

No matter who she kneels
She wants boys at her kneels
And for they pay her bills
She'll go for the classy Baboul Hair Cutting.

Somewhere, he's waiting scissors in his hands
For the girl who's got the golden classy hair
When she comes around she will be shaven
Her booty body beaten, that's the Baboul Hair's Cut!

No matter who she kneels
She wants them at her heels
For boys like those cheap thrills
She's the fucky fucky sucky sucky tiger.

No matter who she kneels
She wants boys at her kneels
And for they pay her bills
She'll go for the classy Baboul Hair Cutting.",Baboul Hair Cuttin'
Agostinho Dos Santos,"Chora que a tristeza
Foge do teu olhar
Brincando de esquecer
Saudade vai passar
E amor já vai chegar

Entao canta que a beleza
Volta pra te encantar
Num sonho tao pequenho
Que o dia escondeu
Guardando pra te dar

Como é bonito gostar e querer ficar
Com alguém pra quem possa dizer
Olha quantas estrelas
Nascem pra te encontrar
Depois do céu azul
A noite vai chegar
E eu pra te amar",Chora Tua Tristeza
Agostinho Dos Santos,"Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 
A felicidade é como a gota 
De orvalho numa pétala de flor 
Brilha tranquila 
Depois de leve oscila 
E cai como uma lágrima de amor 
A felicidade do pobre parece 
A grande ilusão do carnaval 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro 
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia 
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira 
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira 
Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 
A felicidade é como a pluma 
Que o vento vai levando pelo are 
Voa tão leve 
Mas tem a vida breve 
Precisa que haja vento sem parar 
A minha felicidade está sonhando 
Nos olhos da minha namorada 
É como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo, por favor 
Pra que ela acorde alegre como o dia 
Oferecendo beijos de amor 
Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim",A Felicidade
Agostinho Dos Santos,"Eu amei e amei
Ai de mim, muito mais
Do que devia amar
E chorei 
Ao sentir que iria sofrer 
E me desesperar

Foi assim 
Que da minha infinita tristeza
Aconteceu você
Encontrei 
Em você a razão de viver
E de amar em paz
E não sofrer mais
Nunca mais

Pois o amor 
É a coisa mais triste
Quando se desfaz",O Amor Em Paz
Agota Eisenberg,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

Agression,"You who are fighting the endless war
Told by generals to kill some more
Wake up in the morning, march over the hill
Whatever's inyour way, you've got orders to kill

Got to get that body count
Remember kids and chickens count
Get that body count

The platoon got an order to attack a village
After you're through, you can loot and pillage
Rape all the women, murder the men
Fuck all the sheep, butcher the hens

Napalmed a village, hiking into sea
If anyone survived that clamity
Mutilated bodies, blown in two
Count both halves and be glad it's not you",Body Count
Agression,"Ever find yourself awake
In the middle of the night
You've got insomnia
Grab a glass of water
Or a cigarette for your insomnia
But I know something that's so much better yet

Just grab the bong and numb your brain with pot
Watch Cal Worthington and his dog Spot
Insomnia, yeah it's so boring
Nothing to do at three o'clock in the morning

You can get dressed, go out for a walk
For your insomnia
But that's just asking for hassles
From your neighborhood cops
You've got insomnia",Insomnia

Floating on the sea of purity
Knowing I can dive in the love that rescues me

The bass was fast, but then again it was slow
Soul, house, rhythm and blues 
It doesn't matter what music you choose
Strike up a dance, is your chance 
To come with me and do the tribal dance 
You've got to move it with a temperature
Into the rhythm that the fire burns
So get into it-- get into the trance
This is the rhythm of the tribal dance, the tribal dance

It started with a tribe who discovered the vibe
Who moved to the rhythm just the way they liked
You hear the treble, you hear the bass
The are-a-why, yeah is on the case
Feel the fire, feel the flame
Do your thing now, don't be ashamed
I have to go now, no offense
I've hooked you up into the tribal dance

Get into it 
Get into it
Get into the trance
You've got to do the tribal dance

Check it out (come on!) 
Take your chance! 
Check it out (come on!) 
Take your chance! 
Check it out (come on!)

Ahmad,"Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little niggaro
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go taggin' along
Naggin' if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hood rat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was nineteen eighty-five
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggaz singin' the blues
That be always tryin' to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin' ""Yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and want to scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playin' ding dong ditch, when that gets
old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearin' Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sportin' BK's
and, all the girls had they Turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is eighty-seven
Eighty-eight that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In seventh grade, I hated school wish it'd blown up
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminiscin' and tellin'
'Bout when girls was bellin' tight corduroys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eatin' pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad 'cause when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies, had poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes, had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces, 'cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishin' all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore

Well, it's the niggaro, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holdin'
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbin'
You steady bobbin your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A.
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but
Sometimes I still sit there reminiscin'
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Niggerole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old and guess you could say I'm holdin'
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbin'
You steady bobbin your head and I'm paid, so I got it made

But, didn't always have clout, used to live in south central L.A
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first

So Ahmad and the Jones is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but sometimes I still sit and reminence
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore

I remember back in the days when I just a little niggerole
I looked up to my bigger bro begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go taggin' along
Naggin' if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggas singin' the blues
That be always tryin' to bag with the shag and karate shoes
(Back in the days)

Sayin', ""Yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playin' ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cuz they bell wearin' Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sporting BK's
(Back in the days)

And, all the girls had they Turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school wish it'd blown up
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out
(And be a grownup)

But let me finish this reminescin' and tellin'
'Bout when girls was bellin' tight courderoys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Court Airs, and footsie socks
And eatin' pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad 'cuz when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hooches, had poison airbrushed on they asses
(Back in the days)

Dudes, had on Nike suits, and the Puma's with
The fat laces, 'cuz it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishin' all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then

Ahmad,"Heh whassup?
Here we go, here we go, here we go
One two for the money
or the show then three for the S-E
Hah hah, whassup?
It's Ahmad, my man Mau' made the track

Well it's the niggerole, pump one more time
The jeeps I rock will never stop playin for keeps
And got more soul than a ghost I have mostly EVERYBODY UP
The masses movin asses so let the beat hit
And it ain't gon' quit 'til you stop and say (no)
Cause I get more (ho!) than +Hip-Hop Hooray+
I rock steady, steady rocks don't want to box with God
Because I'm cool, givin props to the old school
And the West coast, who just toasted the return
of the funk with the fat beats for your trunk (so)
I walk and I stalk and I caulk(?) and I blast
Then I dip to the party, find me a honey and tag that ass
I saw a Puerto Rican freak who was all that
Tight pants for dancin, told her we gotta lambada
No restin yet black, cause here I am
Askin the question - can I party if I need to jam?

So can I party if I want to?  (Yeah you can party)
Now can I party if I need to?  (Yeah you can party)
Can I party if it's essential and necessary
I'm addicted, I gotta have it, then I gotta have it (Say what?)

Now can I party if I need to?  (Yeah you can party)
Can I party if it's essential and necessary
I'm addicted, I gotta have it, then I gotta have it (Say what?)

It's the return of the incredible man
who stands firm and rips up fakes without a cape
I'm great, I paid dues, kid how dare you respect me not
I had to get a tetanus shot cause fools bit but
now I'm back on deck, ready to wreck
and swing at every pitch til I'm rich (whoo!)
And that's not long because I got a new song to sing
Throne the king cause all the fools just stepped loose (ooh)
Back to the party at hand, I want you movin and groovin
Workin that ass, havin a blast
I'm fast on the feel so pass the pill
to the kid that rocks, everybody jockin stop then
throw your hands up and wave 'em from left to right
If you like the niggarole say (HO!)
But you know, no restin yet, cause here I am

Kick it what did I say? (Get up!) Think you better (get up!)
Part efficient in circumfrence and if you don't jump
touch the ceiling with the center of your palm, use your right arm
Everybody standin, should love my sound cause it's too down
or three, might be four, fifty-six, maybe one more
To blow, might I flow, can I go, I'm that one so
Bumrush the doors, keep the doors locked
All I need's a small flock of fans, hands move to the bam-boom
of the bass drum, when you hear the thump of the bass
Jump while you're actin dumb, yell where you come from
(West coast) with the new soul scenario
(Just fo') us to control your stereo
Ahmad I flip and rip kids and crews to shreds
Mau' will lay a beat down like the Feds
I guess all should say yes y'all cause here I am
Askin the question - can I party if I need to jam?

Whassup?  That's Ahmad and the Joneses
We on this mic, for the ninety-three, to the ninety-four
and more",Can I Party?
Ahmad,"Don't let the Jones' get you down

(Get you down)
(Don't let the Jone's get you down)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Thinkin well it's the niggaroe back with my crew
Now what you want to do
The Jones', we on this, mic
So we'll fight to the finish
But I don't need spinach for me to do this
Pride in givin niggas pop-eyes, I'm large as buddhist
Rappers want to be down, cause they think that I'm better than
They, but I'll be OK-Solo like the Letterman
Use my common sense to boom-shalaklak-boom
Then lock the room, get busy as I get busy
Sayin ""Don't let the Jones' get you...""
But I'll hit you where it hurts, made you relapse in curves
When I throw verbs and nouns, any sound that I spit up
I have battle rappers usin they clappers because they don't want to get up
They all want to be like me, and so they re-write
Them wack-ass raps that they make and try to fake
So I break bones and holler ""Jones' forever""
Cleverest shit around
But don't ever let us get you down

[ VERSE 2 ]
Well, everybody says, ""'Mad, what are the Jones'?""
Well, let's see, it's a posse, true, and it's a crew
But not really, so what I'm gonna do
Is combine em all and find a title that'll fit
We're a group of money makers from the west that be runnin shit
Fly like a discus, don't miss this, cause it's me, and
I win fights with more mic energy than a pre-amp
They listen to Ahmad and the Jones' in here rock 
And roll with soul, then want to copy like a Xerox
Cause I mic-check and never once sound like Das at all
>From a superman crew, so I do the impossible
Droppin y'all wack crews like missiles, then I whistle
Kendal'll bring the 808 until the party say, ""the great
'Mad is the king of the ring,"" because I bring
Funk that shakes the ground
But don't ever let us get you down

(And everybody want to be like us
I think it's cause we on this mic
We're the Jones', so)
Don't let the Jones' get you down

[ VERSE 3 ]
Kick it, I'm back, never can lose, I'm the man when I want to
Might gruff on rappers get ran like Jackie Joyner
The Jones' everybody want to be us, they be jockin
Cause we rockin the boat and in control like a remote
So I pack a 38-page rap book, put your gun away
And yell 'truce!' before I have to get loose and run away
With the title I've already won, don't mean to brag
Kendal blew up like a rocket, and I get down like a sag
I nag rappers that don't follow my lead, and if they need
Assistance they get dragged the distance in a bag
The Jones' for life, throw up a J if they ever say
Who's runnin this town
But don't ever let us get you down

Don't let the Jones' get you down",The Jones'
Ahmad,"Ordinary people

Oops, I guess I should stop singin and start bringin the funk
The niggaro sings a rap and have you clappin 
I gets busy, cause I never fall, I excel 
Never takin no shorts, so here's my tall tale
Once upon the clock 
It was hard growing up with no pops
But moms did the supernatural, very
Extra-ordinary 
Person that she is
She finished college, three kids at home cryin
But never got fed up, and kept her head up
'I shoot for the sky' is what she said, it
Got embedded
In my skull 
That's how I got soul 
To reach ya through your speaker
My mother alone helped me to be me
So that's my role model, not an idiot on tv
Used to do it like this
And like that, and like this
But since she never let me join a gang 
I couldn't g thang
So for all her prayers at night under the church steeple
I give thanks to my mother, one of those very extra-ordinary people

Now dig it, 2-(4)-6-8
I guess that I appreciate
And consider that niggas who work hard is the superstars
(Ordinary) people with families, that have kids
Should be put on a pedestal, not average
Treatment for our mother and fathers, and if you ask me
I'll say: you put your family first, before an athlete
But everybody want to be somebody special, who
Can grab a microphone, or put a ball through a hoop
And it's okay to like Mike
Even I would, if I drank Gatorade
But I'm too busy funkin your trunk with all this 808
To worry about that, I'm worried bout this 
If you agree, then pump your fist
If you're proud (Say it loud!)
To show you're pissed
Off at the news and media, because they swear
That all black people are menaces and holler and cheer
But since there's so many others that want justice, I know we will 
Start respectin others as brothers and come together, all of the
Ordinary people

Ordinary people make the world turn
I learned that if you work hard in life 
Then it counts the way the balls bounce
I wrote this to give a message, I'll be glad if it 
Switches your goal from bein a gangsta to a graduate
And if you listened close to what I said, you learned a lesson, and
Heard that all the average Jones' are no greater, or no lesser than
Stars, cause all we all are is equal
So shut off your tv set, and show respect to some of the
Ordinary people",Ordinary People
Ahmad,"Aiyyo what's goin on it's Ahmad on the microphone
Bout to tell y'all about the Palladium
Me and my boys, the Joneses crew in the house
Kick it

Yo it's the end of the day and it's Friday (hey)
Ahmad how bout a show to the stadium (what) you know what the Palladium
(It's cool) We can't get faded, oh that's right you don't drink
but there's a better incentive, it won't cost, you know the hoe swing
Well I said guess I guess
It's better to flex than be at home watchin ""Chips""
I'd rather watch chicks
I flipped, looked to the right of me, tons of honies
One was a Playboy bunny, but I left her
Hugh Hefner's no joke, he's too heavy for my kind
I play blind and went out lookin for my type
That's right, my type, a cute fine girl named Sabrina
Coolin at the bar with her friend Tina
Way I was dressed, they thought I was ballin like Bobby Bonilla
Bought a pina colada and got another
Reached in my pants pocket, (??) riches (?) on paper
Saw a cutie 'cross the room, went on another caper
I approached her, she started havin fits
It was the pits - cause this chick thought she was the shit
My homey Kay said let's go
Ahmad ain't even fadin it y'all, cause it's cool at the Palladium

[Chorus]
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium is where everybody goes {repeat both lines 3X}
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium.. word

[Ahmad]
Yo it's Friday the Palladium (whattup) what a great show
Kids chillin like nerds couldn't get in so they sittin on curbs
Cars rollin by deep, you couldn't miss 'em
Tempers start stowin so brothers start throwin fists at fights
I seen night lights hit skulls and glove boxers
Rock stars in limos stretch, smokin cess
I walk in and see brothers and broads causin havoc
Havoc and mayhem both straight from the West coast
Most of the dancers are housers
Some a few freaks freakin, guys playin to get laid this weekend
Speak of the devil, better put in my bid
But first get rid of this chick, she's on my testicles
Cause Ahmad is the God, I don't test no hoes
I just maintained and step in the vestibule
Be reminiscent of disses
I'm throwin body blows to weak rappers and tossin 'em to the fishes
Then callin Mrs., Bla Bla Blah
Mrs. So-and-So, your kid was blowin smoke so I choked him
Uhh, I'm just givin my respects, leave my condolences
Like when I'm bowlin, I'm bowlin strikes, I never miss
yikes - I gotta go cause they flowin I think it's my day
So chill and let's groove at the Palladium Friday

[Chorus]

[Ahmad]
Kick it yo I'm still cool at the Palladium show
Yellin out yo's with my bros and steady clockin the hoes
But now it's two o'clock I'm ready to split
Ready to get in my Chevy to get home and start hittin it hard w/ Betty
Smith or Johnson, fuck it it don't matter
Just want to climb inside a bladder like a ladder cut the chit chatter
Cause I'm smooth, never obnoxious, chillin
That's why ya never live to hear me rushin while I'm bustin
Got honies if you got dividends or in a Benz, and I got both
So now you see me, taggin asses like graffiti
And on the next day I'll be rested, exhausted
Because I was naughty, but damn, that was a hell of a party

[Chorus]
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium is where everybody goes {repeat both lines 11X}
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show

Dig it, if you got the feeling, then jump and rip the roof up

Never fake, I be real, so what you gonna do now?
Battle? I don't think so, look, I got your noose tugged
Did ya, now standin there, daisy with your dukes up
Who's up next to watch me get loose, then bruise necks
And niggas who stink
Then go hang out like a link
I'm the brink of the blow up
Sink and watch me go up
Another level, let the bass boom
As the treble tunes up
My too rough style
I'm too tough
I'm gifted, ovin the crowd
I make em get up, then I get down

Well, the king of the hill's back, blew up like a well
Got a leash and I go in and out of style like your bell-
Bottoms, say shit that's real like 'I'm nuts over midgets'
Pitch, then make my mic throw a strike like a picket
Not really into baseball, but I'm an all-american
Still act a fool
Breakin rappers like a rule
I'm cool, mostly peaceful
Kick it with my people
But if I go insane
You can jump and do the same
Thing, I gotta sing
La-la, if you got that swing
Follow me, get wreck
I make you bounce like a check
Mic-check, 1-2
Stand and watch me run through
A crew real easy, but that's only if I want to
Murder if I want it, stand and watch me flaunt this shit
I'm like the mafia, I keep on makin hits
I know which way is up
And won't stop 
Till I hit rock bottom
That's the truth
But for now smack the roof
Then groove to the

King of the hill, knock em down when they get up
Westcoast kid, they got the goods, and can get - ehm
Busy on the mic like this
So pump your fist
And never hit the FF button on my cassette
Just sit stunned
Dn't give me no props until I'm done
Your mouth's wide open cause you're hopin 
That you might be able to be label-

I'm just down with the king, and you're not it

That's my clan, that's my posse
The niggaz with the funky tunes, turn up the volume
All you ballers, with your six-four Impalas
And bass comin' out of your trunk, you better holla if you want the funk

[Repeat x4]
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
{We want the funk!}

Word now everybody get up, then sit back down and yell (ho!)
The niggarole's back with a verse and it gets worse
By worse I mean better than you and I can do
Crews and never lose in fights because I write
And flip scripts I rip up punks and do a cheer
Think I'd ring the funk bell yell (party over here!)
Now peep what I wrought and maybe I even got
A million funk styles for ya bay-bay
In stacks so when I rap the claps come
Through I'm new but been hearin' cheers for years and
Fear is a mind state, I rip up raps and do up dance stuff
The great Ahmad, if you agree then nod
Your head like this or like that I can rap with anyone
And still won't fall, I do it all
So y'all kids with tapes on your shelves and
Twelves boomin' out of your trunk, you better yell if you want the funk

[Repeat x6]
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
{We want the funk!} 

Well I'm still kickin' the funk, don't believe it you don't have to
But, bet a buck, you gon' believe it when I leave it stuck
Imprinted, through a rhyme I invented
To indent your skull cause I got SOUL
Everybody get ready, then set go and when I let go
Of the microphone, get your jam on
But one more thing before I sing cause I'm fat
And ask for you please get off your rump
And scream if you want the funk

[Repeat x4]
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
{We want the funk!} 

[Repeat x8]
{If you didn't come to dance, then you don't want the funk}
{Party over here, bust you over there} 
{Party over here, bust you over there}

Ahmad,"I used to be a stick-up kid

Everybody in the ghetto tell me
Is it a lie that I must be a ruffneck
And wear a frown just to be down?
I kinda don't agree with bein (tough)
But you gotta be (rough)
It's either you claimin your hood, or you're not a gee
Forget about respect, I refuse to be the next guy
Fitted for a casket, either with it, or get blasted
I choose to gangbang, they give me a chrome-plated trigger
Say, ""If you got any heart, go rob that Mini-Mart, nigga""
Now look what I done did, damn, I had to be the big man
They're lookin at me shifty, better shut up 'fore I get slammed
Man, I'm not a thief, good grief, and I don't want to act hard
But then they said if I didn't do it, they was gonna gat, far
As I could see (I was gonna be)
The next new member of the crew, cause it's 8 of them and 1 of me
I don't want to do it, but I will 
Cause I still want folks to think that I'm hard and tough
Cause you gotta be (rough)
Cause you gotta be (tough)
Cause you gotta be (rough)
(I used to be a stick-up kid)

Well, it's the niggero, again, right back in where I left off
Still tryin to make a decision, I might go to prison if I don't step off
But if I don't rob this store, then I'm not sure
If I'm gonna be considered as a gee
And you gotta be (rough)
Cuffs are temporary, homies are for life
So I grab the deuce-deuce and go inside
I decide to prove in the Mini-Mart, ""Don't nobody move
Start fillin up the paper sack with loot, or I might shoot""
But things didn't go as planned, cause this man had his own gun
We're standin toe to toe, eye to eye, so I figured why not 
Pull the trigger? Put this nigga on the ground
It'll show that I had poise, then my boy'll know I'm down
But I didn't do it quick enough, or he thought of it first
Cause he blasted to the chest, and now I'm restin yellin, ""Nurse!""
And holdin on to life, or at least tryin to hold on
In a jailward wearin cuffs
Cause I had to be (rough)
Cause you gotta be (tough)
Cause you gotta be (rough)
(I used to be a stick-up kid)

And everybody, everybody gotta be rough, y'all
(I used to be a stick-up kid)
And everybody, everybody gotta be tough, y'all
(I used to be a stick-up kid)

Well, that's the end of my tale, but before we know
Fools'll just forget what I said, and the story go
On and on, until you're up to no good
And back throwin up your hood 
And still doin what you shouldn't 
Niggeros, come together, cause divided we fall
So stall that gang shit, stand up
Quit standin in handcuffs 
Really hard's when you got loot 
And you ain't gotta shoot
Damn man, enough is enough 
So why you gotta be (rough)
Cause you gotta be (tough)
Cause you gotta be (rough)

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,

Do you know what it means when there's no one to bring you good news?

Do you know what it means to cry alone?
And what it means to cry by yourself?
Do you know what it means to love a woman you can't own?
If you do, then you know the meaning of the blues

I've been weeping and weeping,
Moaning and moaning,
Crying and sighing all the day
I've been hiding my tears

And do you know what it means when the lord is taken away?

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

That you'd hardly know it's me
And late in the evening when I'm mellow

It's a world full of cocktails at nine
And dinners and wine very late shows
And where the crowd goes

I'm a girl with a world of her owna queen on her throne
Till everything's gone and then
I wake up to find that I'm a stranger
In a world where I have never before

And doze on the sofa 'til eleven then get up and pour myself another drink
While back at the party I'll be hardy while I'm waitin' for some better news

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

A heaven that I've never known.

Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live

Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night

We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us (Didn't we run)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again

They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses

And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for rainbow coloured weather

Before you were mine
And I was dying to be with you
Now you've gone away
And I'm in this place

The shadow you cast just grows larger than life
How can the past cut two hearts like a knife?

I can't walk away
But how can I stay?
Any way I step I lose
My back's to the wall
I stumble and fall
Trying to live my life without you.

You weren't a saint
So what are these chains
You hold on both of us
You give it your best
But you can't forget
And my love's not strong enough
To put out a fire that someone else lit
Or walk in the footprints that never will fit.

Ever since the hour of our meeting

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me
Ahmad Jamal,"Oh, give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me
Just a little something, meaning love cannot die
No matter where you chance to be

So I'll pray for you, night and day for you
It will see me through like a charm 'til you return
So give me something I can remember you by
When you are far away from me

Have to get off from this ride
Gotta get hold, gonna get
Need to get hold of my pride

When did I get, where did I
How was I caught in this game
When will I know, where will I
How will I think of my name

When did I stop feeling sure, feeling safe
And start wondering why, wondering why
Is this a dream, am I here, where are you
What's in back of the sky, why do we cry

Gotta get off, gonna get
Out of this merry-go-round
Gotta get off, gonna get
Need to get on where I'm bound

When did I get, where did I
Why am I lost as a lamb
When will I know, where will I
How will I learn who I am

When will I know why?",Theme from Valley of the Dolls

There's a thrill that words cannot express

Gone as you can see

To blame for this catastrophe
But my one wish on Christmas Eve
Is as plain as it can be

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could with you
""Merry Christmas.""

""Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!""

If I could only whistle (thh)

You've come to make this my last night home.
I promised everything.
The necklace and those things you made will go with me everwhere I go.
Well, it's not the end.

I won't pretend it's impossible to fix what can't be broke.

Take my breath away, wake me up today, 
I will return for you.

Was there something I missed?
Can you replay this kiss?
And the ghost sought by my side.

Cutting our silhouette,
Waking up nights again.
I am afraid because I'm open and undone.
I won't (I wont) forget (forget) those things you said,

Killing without an end.

Their soul will change the future
And that's where the beauty in death resides

Do you wake up and cry at night
The evil inside
That breaks right through the light
With hard times and long goodbyes

Take me
Into your dark dream
And scream so loud this place
Fills with misery
Suffer the kiss
And take me out alive.

We are those things that you despise
(We will sing)
We are the suffering alive

Burn! Your! Friends! [Repeat: x4]

Shadows and hearts
In which to carry your rule aloud
Can you believe we are
The shock of existence now
Something's amiss
And this generation has been found
We're brought to the underground

Waste me to your dark dream
And taste me until all I see
A thousand sparks we fake
Love futility
I see the rain

We are those things that you despise
(We will sing)
We are the suffering alive tonight

We are those things that you despise

Aiden,"She walks the line into her deathbed rings
I say she's all alone begging for forgiveness
I won't teach her to lie or make a plan
That clairvoyant stare and grin
God won't forgive me for this I know

Tragedy unfolds tonight as you sever my skin apart
Take this sadness and close your eyes, love

Hey, call the angels
This razor blade was meant for me
Hey, call the angels
We'll mutilate insanity

She cuts a vein although it's much too dull
I say she's all alone fighting for redemption
I know a little pain, a little lust
I lose myself at night to feel the rush of tearing my skin apart
Now take this sadness and close your eyes, love

Hey, call the angels
This razor blade was meant for me
Hey, call the angels
We'll mutilate insanity

Go deeper, I feel it
I see your ghost appear
Go deeper, I see it

I will say goodbye tonight, we'll sleep forever

Hold on, hold on tonight, love

Hold on, hold on tonight, love

I saw the mark as she passed though the door
I saw the truth, you're a whore
Distill the scene and don't lie to me no more

So what's killing you, is it the demon inside?
My God, you're turning blue, a suffocating lie
You're all I've got, you're all I've got

And to wake up, she fucks the pain
And wears makeup to hide the shame
Her sedative lies low
And self esteem won't grow tonight, she'll miss
And all she knows and all she knows
All she knows is bliss

So what's killing you, is it the demon inside?
My God, you're turning blue, a suffocating lie
You're all I've got, you're all I've got, you're all I've got

The black eyes filled with the love
She wrote, 'I'm not insane, I'm sorry, I have to go'
And these walls are painted red
She put a bullet in her head

?Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye?
That's all she said

So what's killing you, is it the demon inside?
My God, you're turning blue, a suffocating lie

In a world of lies

Visit me in hell tonight

To the fire that blinded who we are, silence
Take a picture let it breathe alright, remindless
All with words and the fiction in your eyes
I'm taking off my disguise with you all alone 
Cause I'm empty, are you empty? Are you empty tonight?

Now kiss me one last time

Became a witness to the suffering
Skinned alive, even took their soul
Close my eyes

By the moonlit darkness legend grows
Torture only child's play
Sworn to pledge and gather peasant slaves
Close my eyes

Hey, I wanna live forever
I'm in love with the dark horizon
In the moonlight I will bathe

She placed her hand on the heart and swore
Every last one of them
Will bring me youth, beauty, bliss galore
Close my eyes

And the basin was filled every night she dined
In the den of iniquity
And my sorrow filled reverie
Close my eyes

Hey, I wanna live forever
I'm in love with the dark horizon
I'm in love with madness

Hey, I wanna to live forever
I'm in love with the dark horizon
In the moonlight I will bathe

Death comes for us all, I won't wait

She bathed in blood that much you know
Of the demon Countess Bathory
Through these cemetery gates we go
With my eyes closed

Elizabeth, she will not bathe alone
Elizabeth, she will not bathe, will not bathe alone
Elizabeth, cannot save your soul
Elizabeth, will not bathe, will not bathe alone

Tapasin illoin sinua silloin

Tutustuttiin ihastuttiin

Sytytit menthol-savukkeen

Kadut hiljenevät aamun myötä
Valvoo kuu ja tahdon sinut unohtaa
Ei uni tule vaikka käsken
Huomasin sen vasta äsken
Soittaa tuuli yöllä biisin hiljaisen
Pois lähdit mukanasi liikaa
Vain seinät ikävääni huutaa
Odota, miksi karkuun juoksit niin varoen
Heräsin tähän kylmään aamuun, nyt palelen
Odota, miksi karkuun juoksit niin varoen
Heräsin tähän kylmään aamuun, nyt palelen
Sinä vielä junalaiturilla
Piiritit mut pikku suudelmilla
Toivon sun vielä joskus luoksein palaavan
Jäi välillemme liian monta
Kilometriä tunteetonta
Ei saa ne meitä ikuisesti erottaa
Pois lähdit mukanasi liikaa
Nyt turhaan ikävääni huutaa

Kerro kerro kuvastin nyt voitko tulevan näyttää
Kerro kerro kuvastin nyt voitko toiveeni täyttää
Aaa - magiaa, magiaa

Vielä kohtalo meidät yhteen johdattaa

Pois tunnit käy
Ajan tahtoisin kääntää
Kai totuuden
Kohta korteistain nään

Aim,"It's just some of the things he said
Keep going 'round my head
I'm gonna save my soul
Before things get impossible
I should've seen the signs
And they were right before my eyes
He could've saved my soul

A fog across the bay
I think I saw him sail away
Now like those before
I'm just another body washed up on the shore
A curse on my bones
We made a pact among the stones
He could've saved my soul
He could've saved my soul

Take me in your arms

Do you recall the time
I think you just must have lost your mind
Affected by the sun
And how the heavens lined up as we made our run
Blood stained the lanes
And I could barely feel the pain
I loved you so much more
I loved you so much more

Take me in your arms

We saw gunpowder paint the sky
Demons hung out to dry
How many hours to go
Before the next ice age suffocates the globe
Sandstones remain
A sea of angels crossed the plain
They never save my soul
They never save my soul

Take me in your arms

Pact among the stones
Save my soul",Sail

""You ready?""

Yeah yeah yeah
I'm like a lightning bolt, I'm fast and hot
Do a show, tell the promoter, pass the nut
And I don't really care if I'm last or not
Overweight brother, still get ass a lot
5-11 dangerous, behind the smirk
In the club in the corner, behind the skirk
On-point got my mind at work
And even at the office I get head, sometimes I work
Flow's corratic charismatic and I don't play those games
I fold you back like the craftmatic
Bowed out but I'm back at it
And you gon' have to live with that, like an asthmatic
Whole crew is plasmatic not the real
Thought you had soldiers but that's not the deal
Try to act brand new once you got the deal
When you see me in the street you oughta stop and kneel

That's right, that's right, Diamond D

Yo yo I'm like shaynmoze I'm quick with mines
Get it right, see me in new kicks and shines
Only cop hundreds no licks and dimes
And he still chasin' after old chicks of mine
What's the deal daddy, couldn't keep it real daddy
Yo what happened to you, lookin' ill daddy
Used to eat steaks now it's cornmeal daddy
I don't hold my tongue is how I feel daddy
You look a little baddy your fun's alone
I watch flicks, stretched out in a bungalow
And you found out you hon's a hoe
Livin' of a SS sidechecks cause you son's a slow
I'ma call it how I see it and do the same
You mad at the world, but you to blame
I'm big D I stay true to the game
And next time your mouth full I put two in ya frame

Diamond D, Diamond D

A lot of why'all are here today, born tomorrow
Rhymes you spittin' you gon' have to pawn tomorrow
Got you hand-out like you was born to borrow
Starin' at the diamonds on the arrow
L-E-X and I hits the hash
Feds want to know how he gets the cash
In the club, surrounded by tits and ass
And some wild kids that gon' kick some ass
And you broke kids make me laugh
When I see you in the street you gon' have to break me half
I don't want to hear about, yo I'm short today
Or who you had to bail out of court today
Cause there's a thin line between love and dough
I always put business above a hoe
Chicks tell me they love the show
And you keep messin' up packages cause you love to blow
Holla at me

And on your way up north
Canada is so far from where you want to be
Be in California, with sunshine in your heart

But you know there are people
That you have to be
Have to be
Have to be what they say you are

What you always wanted to be
Wanted to be
Wanted to be just a man
Fulfilled but a little more free

A little more free
You are, you are in a hotel
And in your room alone
Lying there, but not knowing where you're s'posed to be

Be thinking of be-3s and Leslies going round

You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

After it brought my lover near

Could there be smiles like yours,

And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream,

I got my empty bottles from here to the door
Stacks of bills that I forgot to pay

But we never grow old here in Hollywood
shit is getting drastic, running up my plastic
Good times, good living, I'm on automatic

So I sold my soul to Rock and Roll
Jimmy and Janis they never grew old
Round here we are buying our time, 
We just want to get out of our minds

These are the good times, good times, everything's fine
These are the good times, good times, get out of my mind

Don't matter if we just sleep in all day
Don't matter if we just get high
