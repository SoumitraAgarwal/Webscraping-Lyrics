Paul Westerberg,"I'm blinded
What a day for a night
I'm finding
My way around in morning's light
What a day for a night
What a day for a night

I'm winding
Through the streets, through the towns
I'm finding
Good morning boys, good night gowns
Sunset toys and sundown clowns 
What a day for a night now

When we play it's alright
What a day for a night

When we play, it's alright What a day for a night 
So I'm moving
Beneath my feet it just feels right
I'm used to it
I hop aboard another flight
No end in sight
On and on we play, alright
What a day, what a day for a night",What a Day (For a Night)
Paul Westerberg,"Well, I swear last night
Baby, I rose another yard
Yeah, I swear last night
Baby, I rose another yard

Did you ever think
That you'll ever need?
By the evening
You'll want the national guard

'Cause I'm wild and lethal
A mile deep, though
There ain't no bank that
Can hold me back

I'm wild and lethal
A mile deep, though
A river runs over
Whatever it wants

Shootin' the breeze, baby
Just like a common thief
We just shootin' the breeze now, baby
Just like a common thief

I get you everything you ever need
But by this evening
You're gonna want some relief

'Cause I'm wild and lethal
I'm a mile deep, though
There ain't a bank that
Can hold me back

I'm wild and lethal
I'm a mile deep, though
When a river runs it
Goes wherever it wants

And I'm wild

Baby, I'm already
Way up to your knees
Get your sandbags
Go on, call your police
Do you no good!

I'm wild and lethal
I'm a mile deep, though
There ain't a bank that
Can hold me back

'Cause I'm wild and lethal
I'm a mile deep, though
There ain't a bank that
Can hold me back

Yes, I'm wild and lethal
I'm a mile deep, though
When a river runs,
It runs wherever it wants

I'm flowing down",Wild & Lethal
Paul Westerberg,"She wore them cowboy boots
Couldn't ignore, she looked so cute
She was one that I liked best
Couldn't believe her two buck dress

I'll go downtown and we'll find ourselves a judge
And I'm your $100 groom
Promise not to leave the room
Even if I gotta vomit
Oh I'm your $100 groom
Baby, I'll hop the broom
V Although I'd rather limbo underneath it

She spent all of my cash
And I broke out in a rash
As long as I can make you laugh
It's been awhile, might say it's high time
It ain't getting' better, let's go for a ride

Go downtown and find some crooked judge
And I'm your $100 groom
Won't leave the room
Even I have to vomit
Baby I'm your $100 groom
Baby I'll hop that broom
Though I'd rather limbo underneath it

I've let you down in the past
I can't let you down anymore
Yeah, $100 groom
Baby we're in that room

She's my better half
When she makes me laugh
When she don't, she ain't
The one that I like best
With the two buck dress
She ain't no saint

Go downtown and we'll find ourselves a judge
And I'll be your $100 groom
Promise not to leave the room

Rather limbo underneath it
Baby I'm your $100 groom",$100 Groom

Paul Westerberg,"Come and feel me tremble
Feel my marrow in the bone

Paul Westerberg,"Now I wonder when we’ll be there
Will it be long
Now I wonder when we’ll be there
Even you’re along

Now I wonder when we’ll be there
When will we arrive
Now I wonder when we’ll be there
We may get in time

The vices of the parents
To reveal themselves in the sickness of a child
Divine intervention was not my intention
But Jesus Christ please save us from his smile

And we’ll get down on our knees
And we don’t care who sees
And to hell with them who laugh
And we’ll tell ones that asked

That we’re damned if we do
And we’re damned if we don’t
And one thing is two
If I’m wrong I’m not alone

Makes me wonder when we’ll be there
When will we arrive
It makes me wonder when we’ll be there
Will we be there in time

Paul Westerberg,"When you cried as a little baby
Mom and daddy let you cry
Thought that that was the best way maybe
To make you grow all strong inside
Now that you're older
You need someone's shoulder
What about mine?

Growing' up your mind was closed
For repairs for a long long time
You could feel the loneliness in your hairstyle
Just like mine
Now that you've grown up
You still need that shoulder
What the hell are you waiting' for?
It's mine

I promise not to chase you
Only to embrace you
I promise not to bug you
Only just to hug you all night

Paul Westerberg,"You shoot me glances and they're so hard to read
I misconstrue what you mean
Slip me a napkin and now that's a start
Is this your name or a doctor's eye chart?

I try and comprehend you but I got a dyslexic heart
I ain't dying to offend you, I got a dyslexic heart

Thanks for the book, now my table is ready
Is this a library or bar?
Between the covers I thought you were ready
A half-angel, half-tart

I try and comprehend you but I got a dyslexic heart
I ain't dying to offend you, I got a dyslexic heart

Do I read you correctly, you need me directly
Help me with this part
Do I date you?  Do I hate you?
Do I got a dyslexic heart?

You keep swayin', what are you sayin'?
Thinking 'bout stayin'?
Or are you just playing, making passes?
Well, my heart could use some glasses

Paul Westerberg,"Men without ties don't dress for dinner
Do the Friday night frozen pizza thing
Don't want no wife or no beginner
You're the Friday night frozen pizza king

Everything you buy is soon expired
Some neighbors they're a-thinking that you're gay
Others they assume that you've been fired
See you smoking cigarettes all day

Men without ties don't dress for dinner
Do the Friday night frozen pizza thing
Don't want no wife or no beginner, with a knife
You're the Friday night frozen pizza king

On Saturday they won't catch you in your yard
You're dreaming of tonight's fine cuisine
With a microwave and a library card
It'll taste like plastic, but it'll be faster!
Ha, sing it!

Men without ties... it's about time

Men without ties don't need a thing
Don't want no wife, show to cut by

Paul Westerberg,"I stay in every night of the week
They try but I won't speak
To be my friends
You'll see me once I'm on the mend

Oh, man once around the weekend
Oh, man once around the weekend

I watch myself fall apart
I watch the rabbits in my yard
There goes another round the bend
I gotta sweep this floor again

Oh man, once around the weekend
Oh man, once around the weekend

Better
You I know, I stay in five, six
Sometimes seven days a week
But ever so often I get that empty urge
To go chasin' a rabbit
Go chasin' that long black hair

Oh man, once around the weekend
Oh man, once around the weekend

But I won't go out to relax
And if you look hard you might see my tracks
They call and try and be my friends
I gotta sweep this floor again

Oh man
Oh, oh man
Oh, oh man
Oh, oh man

Paul Westerberg,"Used to think it was the only part of my life
Now I realize there's a whole world outside

Paul Weston,"Time and again I've longed for adventure,
Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure,
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!",All the Things You Are
Paul Weston,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

Paul Weston,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Paul Weston,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms

That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura

Know the wonder of your spell",No Other Love
Paul Weston,"April showers, overhead offer me a chance
To protect her from the rain and cultivate romance
It's an opportunity, something to enjoy

To hold her hand and then it's ten to one

Paul Weston,"Somebody loves me, I wonder who

Paul Weston,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Paul Weston,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You)

Paul Weston,"The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love",Dancing on the Ceiling (He Dances on My Ceiling)

It's a lovely night, Emaline, to meander with me,
Have you told your friends, 
Have you told your people, Emaline?
Hurry up and write them a line 
'Bout a weddin' to be, 
In the church there's an old bell ringer,
Just waitin' for the time when I place a ring around your finger, 
makin' you mine,
All I do is pray for that Sunday mornin' sun to shine,
When I promenade down the line

Paul Weston,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Tell me, do you love me too?

Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet,
And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter parade.",Easter Parade
Paul Weston,"A fine romance, with no kisses.
A fine romance, my friend, this is.
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes.
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes.
A fine romance, you won't nestle.
A fine romance, you won't wrestle.
I've never mussed a crease in your blue serge pants.
I never had the chance.
This is a fine romance. 
A fine romance, my good fellow.
You take romance. I'll take jello.
You calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean.
At least they flap their fins to express emotion.
A fine romance, with no quarrels,
With no insults, and all the morals.
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France.
I never get the chance.
This is a fine romance.

A fine romance, with no kisses.
A fine romance, my friend, this is.
True love should have the thrills that a healthy crime has.
We don't have half the thrills that ""The March of Time"" has.
A fine romance, with no clinches.
A fine romance, with no pinches.
You never give the orchids I send a glance.
No, you like cactus plants.
This is a fine romance.",A Fine Romance
Paul Weston,"There's a sunny little funny little melody
That was started by a native down in Waikiki
He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it
And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit
Funny little gay Hawaiian Chant
Ow way tah tualan Me big bad fightin' man
Tho it started on an island down Hawaii way
It's as popular in Tennessee or Ioway
If you wander into any cabaret
You will hear this gay Hawaiian Chant",The Hawaiian War Chant
Paul Weston,"I must sit down for a minute, I'm ready to fall in a heap
Willie's been fed and I've tucked him in bed, thank goodness the darling's asleep
He's a wonderful boy and a joy and a boon

Bang went the bridge lamp, down went the table, crash went the china tray
But he said ""I couldn't help it, my rocking horse ran away!""
Rip rip went the curtain, wham went the window, crunch went the new buffet
And I heard him tell his daddy ""My rocking horse ran away""

Somehow Indians got into our front room
Our cowboy grabbed for his gun and went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Slam went the screen door, smash went the mirror, looks like I'll soon be gray
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some Mother's Day
I'll remember when his rocking horse ran away

Got up early this morning, wore a flimsy negligee
Had to hurry to fix the breakfast and get daddy on his way
Figured I could get the paper, so the neighbors wouldn't see
So I sneaked out on the porch, very, very quietly
Wham went the dish pan, then came a holler, up went the neighbor's shade
It was Mother's little darling, out on a commando raid

Came home late from a picture. I was tired, my shoes were tight
Took off my stockings, dropped my girdle
Got undressed and pulled the light. boy!
Slipped into my night gown, then tiptoed across the floor
Better have a look at Junior, so I peeked into his door
Clang, clang, clang went a cowbell, whee went a whistle, I nearly had a stroke
It was mother's precious baby, just havin' his little joke

Always just when I'm breathin' a peaceful sigh
There's G-Men, coppers and robbers and hi-yo silver!
Bam went the book case, boot went the fruit bowl, boom went the glass bouquet
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some mother's day
I'll remember when, bang went the lamp, down went the table
Crash went the tray, rip rip went the curtain, wham went a window
Clang went a bell, whee went a whistle, bam went a pan, slam went a door
On that eventful day, when his rocking horse ran away",His Rocking Horse Ran Away
Paul Weston,"Day after day I'll always love you
Where just to say I'll always love you
Dear one, your nearness is my treasure
Dear one, your kiss is rich as wine

Yours, love is yours, because I love you

With every beat repeating I'll always love you so

Paul Weston,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm, I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring
I keep I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a guy I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be spring
It might as well be spring.",It Might as Well Be Spring
Paul Weston,"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da

That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

Paul Weston,"The crowd sees me out dancing
Carefree and romancing
Happy with my someone new
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love with you

They see me night and daytime
Having such a gay time
They don't know what I go through
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love with you

No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry
The tears are in my heart

My darling, can't we make up?

Let's walk a-that-a-way not a-this-a-way
That-a-way we can be alone

Notice that we're coming to the crossroads
Should we turn to left or right?
Mother is a-rockin' and a-waitin'
But it's such a lovely night

Well, don't you think the valley road is shorter?
We could save about a mile
And now and then the short road can be longer
If you linger for a while

Can't you see the night is just beginning
And the moonlight weaves a spell
We can take the road among the daisies
You know daisies never tell

And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast but now the clouds have passed

The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Paul Weston,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

I can see that this love was meant for me

An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little coloured boy.

You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.

You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.

Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,

Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,

That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?

Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,

And up until the present day,

What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Paul Whiteman,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longin'
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove, dear
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

'Cause the moments that I can't recall
Are moments that you treasure
Better take another measure for pleasure

Memories don't mean that much to me
Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me

Now you're here, I'm here too
Could be this easy for me and you

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

For 'tis ever then I am pining

The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Paul Winter,"Here we are
Alive and free
Far away in time from our darkest day
That took our young and brave

From the cradle to the grave
70 years ago on July one 1916 on the Somme
The enemies had never seen fighting like this before
Such a simple plan--

How could any German man
Survive through that ordeal?
Company 'A' to Company 'be	'
""Morale is high here, sir, but I don't think it's safe to go""

Company 'A' from Company 'be	'
""Mister you have your orders and you must obey""
So the first line rose, and the first line fell
And a poet who survived later wrote about

A ""Sunlit vision of Hell""
And ""Larks singing""
Because after all it's just another summer's day in France
And the Tommie's on the Somme sang

""We are fighting to turn no-man's land into a common ground""

Borne on the sound of the sea in my blood
Washed in the waters that carry me home
Filled with the glow of the light of my spirit

Ocean Child
Come now home
Holy wonder
Wholly one

Ancient song
Call me home
Ave Maris
Ave Om

Come now home

Come now home

Come now home
(Come now home)
Come now home

Come now home

Paul Winter,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air. 
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair.",Scarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair)
Paul Winter,"Coisa mais bonita é você
Assim, justinho você
Eu juro,eu não sei porque você

Você é mais bonita que a flor
Quem dera, a primavera da flor
Tivesse todo esse aroma
De beleza que é o amor

Perfumando a natureza
Numa forma de mulher
Porque tão linda assim não existe a flor
Nem mesmo a cor não existe

E o amor
Nem mesmo o amor existe
Porque tão linda assim não existe

A flor
Nem mesmo a cor não existe
E o amor
Nem mesmo o amor existe

Paul Winter,"Podem me chamar e me pedir e me rogar
E podem mesmo falar mal, ficar de mal que não faz mal

Podem preparar milhões de festas ao luar
Que eu não vou ir, melhor nem pedir, que eu não vou ir, não quero ir
E também podem me intrigar e até sorrir e até chorar
E podem mesmo imaginar o que melhor lhes parecer

Podem espalhar que estou cansado de viver
E que é uma pena para quem me conheceu
Eu sou mais você e eu

Podem espalhar que estou cansado de viver
E que é uma pena para quem me conheceu
Eu sou mais você e eu",Você é Eu (You and I)
Paul Wright,"The city lights shine so bright in the sky at night when the sun goes down

Oh oh things are getting brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter

'Cause some men only lust

What a woman wants and if he can appreciate her and not deface her

Verse 1:

Back in the seventies life was heavely Jesus freaks in the streets singing melodies long haired hippies walking in birkenstocks became prophets rockin in coffee shops 30 years later the musics changed but the message is the same from the san francisco bay they made a move to the city of Eugene where the grass grows green if you know what I mean I received my dream back when I was a teen and at a show I saw a man rock a freestyle flow so I grabbed my guitar and taught myself introducing you all to folk-hop from the west.

You're making it hard for me I mean it's hard to be walking around you're bringing me down when I don't wanna be and is it hard for you I mean is it hard to do livin life like a broken record doin the things you don't wanna do cuz it seems to me that we should not be together but then I miss your company.

Come around come around no please don't come around you always bring me down whenever you come around. Come around come around no please don't come around you always bring me down.

Well it's a new day and I got a whole new way of livin forget about the bad decisions and how I give in. Listen to my heartbeat but don't be beaten like an athlete cheatin and later is defeated. It's bitterweet thinkin I can do it on my own kid I need some friends to help me when I'm struggling and when I'm stumbling, fumblin and my world is crumblin being humbled and in need of something.

Paul Young,"He has had the secret sold to him 
The door was open and you're shaking in anticipation 
Let your down just when you let him in 
Now you only have to dance away the night again 
Lately, lonely 
He was old but never felt so young 
Like a lion to the slaughtered lamb 
He watched you crumble 
Walked away before the dance begun 
Still he says that he has loved you 
Like he loved no other 
The best kept secret hidden years 
Is still wrapped up with pride and fear 
Standing on the edge of love, moving round in circles 
Turning 
Standing on the edge of love, moving round 
Back to safety, back to well worn womb 
Back to someone who is nothing more than passing time 
Back to dreaming all that love lost grooms 
Does it make you want to scream in anger, cry with rage

Is still wrapped up with pride and fear 
Standing on the edge of love, moving round in circles

Then why do we lose so many tears
Oh, and so you go again
When the leading man appears
Always the same thing
Can't you see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on

Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free, yeah
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
It doesn't mean that much to me
I can't go on sayin' the same thing
Just can't you see, we've got everything do you even know we know

Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you, oh
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you

I can't go on sayin' the same thing
'Cause baby, can'tcha see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on

Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you

Looking at the pieces (Every time you go away)
Be careful (You take a piece of me with you)

Paul Young,"The sky doesn't know whether to rain or shine 
Doesn't know whether to laugh or cry 
We stand in the middle looking both ways 
We don't know whether we live or we die, caught between two fires 
And while the fires burn brightly both sides of the sea 
The man in the middle says that he's been had 
Yet they sing ""We're safe! We're safe!"" to a sweet melody 
And here we are in a world gone bad 
Caught between two fires 
Our history calls us and tells us beware 
There's a lesson to learn in what we did before 
Do we blindly walk on as if we don't care? 
Do we sit here and ask for more? 
Caught between two fires",Between Two Fires
Paul Young,"I've got a certain feeling
I certainly can't define
But one thing is for certain
We walk the same line
The strangest early chapters
A pair could ever have
It could have ended quickly
It could have ended sad.

[Chorus]
But there's a beauty in the passing
In the passage of time
And a certain kind of passion
A certain kind of passion that shines in our prime
You try to understand me

As much as I do to you
And I see Joan, she's searching
For salvation and for truth
But boy blue sings a blue song
He's puzzled and he's sad
Is he living in confusion?
Or just a little mad

[Chorus]

A friend is there to help you
And maybe he'll understand
If not, well know he's trying
You can feel it in his hands
As the days and nights are reeling
As the money pit goes down

We two will be around",Certain Passion
Paul Young,"I see the finish before me
I feel the hurt of the lonely

The pain won't ever last 
And I'll feel myself reaching the end 
When I hold you again; carry me. 
In the long run, 
Fate will turn the key to tomorrow. 
Oh, the memory holds me, 
Of the love that you sold me. 
Sold for a heart that is battered; but true! 
I gave it to you; 
And our lips were so close 
But they never quite touched 
As you listening to me tell you 
""I will return in the long run
Fate turns the key to tomorrow"".

Captain of my soul

Captain of my soul 
I said that I'd found my matching heart 
And that's a start to build upon 
Foundation strong, so strong, it never should go wrong 
If I see a break within these walls 
If it's too small, we can repair 
But if it's much, too much I'll break the hurt and break the despair

Paul Young,"Woe is me, the press gang came
And forced my love away
Just when we named next morning fair
To be our wedding day
Like a silent explosion ripping into the heart
And the hurt and the anguish do tear you apart
With a swiftness of hand that I cannot condone
And discardance of life that is not of your own
Then a small piece of hear say becomes a big deal
But that is not the issue, the issue is real.
When a turn of the page can turn love into hate
Don't forget that's the power of the fourth estate.
And a tall string of words keep me tied to the chair
Where before I was blistfully unaware
And my skin becomes thicker so I never get hurt
I'm a man without feeling and I wish that I weren't
Though you're long dead and gone there is still no escape
Just forget it, just forget it, you'll never cut all that tape
And once you're a victim, your love will turn to hate

Even though I try to get by oh why, why does a man have to be strong?

And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you, right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
But something's lost and something's gained
In living every day

From win and lose and still somehow

Yours will learn a lesson

And when you hear him say
""I don't want your love""

A broken man, that's what I am

Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame.

I'd be pleading for you to come back
Begging for you to come back to me.

But tonight I've got a heart full of rain

Unkind words blindly spoken
Faith was broken
And you walked away
From this world out love created
Hope has faded
Return your flame
To this heart full of rain

A heart full of rain
And memories
Love's not in vain
Even if you should say
You no longer need me
I'll keep believing
Until all that remains
Is your memories
And a heart full of rain
Your memory
And a heart full of rain

Were down by the pond
Looking for something
To plant in the lawn
Out in the fields 
They were turning the soil

This water will boil
When I look through the windows
And out on the road
They're bringing me presents
And saying hello

Singing words, words
Between the lines of age
Words, words
Between the lines of age

If I was a junkman
Selling you cars
Washing your windows
And shining your stars
Thinking your mind
Was my own in a dream
What would you wonder
And how would it seem?

The king started laughing
And talking in rhyme

And I traveled

Down there the dreams get
Smashed on the rocks

Wait to begin again
Lifted above by a love
That does not end

You picked up some
Pieces of light
As you broke through
The speed of sound
I was rockin' around
In my own
Two-dimensional way
Now when I hear
That jet engine blow
Then I know you are
Leaving town
Baby, I'd follow you
To the edge of it all, anyway
Up where the kingdom comes
Down where the streets
Take the breath
Of another young gun
Love is a whispered prayer
Shot like a spark
Though the heart
Of dark despair

[Chorus]

I don't regret
Any nineteen-year-old
Indiscretions
I can still fit both my feet
In my mouth, anyway
But these days I'm just not as
Willing to nurse
The obsession
If the doc says
I've got to come out
Then I'm happy to pay

[Chorus]",Alright Tonight

It wants to get out
It wants to let go
Do you feel the way I feel with your little sex appeal baby, baby
Now we move left to right side to side and grind
We can do it all night
There really ain't nothing to it but to do it boy
So let me show you how to move your body baby
I know we can work it out feel the sense of chemistry
We can do it anyway, anyway you like

Can you feel it, cause it's so strong
So you better get, get your groove on
'Cause it's funky, don't wait too long
Or you won't get, get that groove on

Just feel the rhythm flow
Feel it run through your veins
It's a rush baby (and no one can take it away)
I'm so attracted to you (so come here close to me)
Boy you know how I like it
I like it physical
I like it sexual, baby, baby
There ain't no holding back now
So let me show you how I'm gonna give it to you
Baby we can dance all night

That's what I want
That's what I need
That's what I want
Ho-down

She sprays her lies around her like the clouds release the rain
And endless stream of promises that vaporize again
Remember last Tuesday when you said it was the end
You caught her in your Nissan getting funky with your best friend
She will never change till her flesh is under dirt
But then at least she's hangin' with neighbors she deserves
Forgive me if I seem to sound a little on the loose
But I cannot pour sugar just to sweeten up the truth

I would like to wish her to a long forgotten dream
Happened early morning when I was just two or three
Everyone around who didn't quite fit in the mix
Turned and waved goodbye and disappeared without a hitch
Except my friend Billy who live just across the way
The world belonged to us forever on from that day
Until we ran into that sneaky girl from down the street
Who tried to smile so pretty stealing Billy right from me

[Chorus]

The world spun around her everywhere that she would go
But even my friend Billy knew that she was just a - oh no
She had such a way to twist and turn a simple truth
Told my friend Billy I had been a little loose
Then Billy took her by the arm and left me standing all along
I just had to wait there watching them do-se-do
Till Billy pushed her in the deepest darkest hole around
It was goodbye sneaky girl - ho down

I would like to wish her for her a place to somewhere far
A place in outer space to some exotic little star
A million miles away would probably suit the planet fine
Someplace where it's clear she is gone and you are mine
Or maybe some romantic little island in the sea
As far away as it is possible to be
She can have the flowers and the wind
And I can have my baby back with me once again

[Chorus]

I would like to wish for her another little story
My daddy said to me when I was just a little girly
He told me 'bout a pretty graceful lovely lady bird
Who never could find a nest good enough for her
From every tree she landed in she saw one that was better
So off she went before she ever could regain her breath
Wasn't it a pity when she finally hit the ground
It was goodbye lovely birdy, ho down
Goodbye lovely birdy, ho down",Ho-Down
Paula Abdul,"Now you tell me since you've been away
There was something you've been dying to say
Yes, I thought you had eyes for me

That you say you're in love with me
Now that's hard for me to believe

Cause I never knew it baby, never knew it baby
I never knew it baby, never knew it baby
That you loved me so
Now I think about you every night

Said you wanted for us to have fun
What's the matter, cat got your tongue
It's not easy to read your mind
So you bet not take too long
Kind of silly just holding the phone
Ain't it silly that I'm all alone
When you should be here holding me
Or making good love to me baby, oh so sweet

Are the things that I would give if I were her

Color Polariods show my heart attack

Why when I'm sleeping? 
Why am I the only one who knows you're there?

My dear, my dear Gertrude, 
My dear, lonely soul, 
My dear, my dear Gertrude,

Tell me all about your pains. 
Try to contact all your lost loved ones, 
Try to speak to them through me.

Why when I'm sleeping? 
Why am I the only one 
who knows you're there?

Paula Cole,"Here I am, a black-eyed bird, remaining silent. 
I simply watch, your little life from high above. 
Wanting to call you, wanting to sing, 
Inside your ears and lips and eyes and soul, 
I dig my grave, behind the gates of Babylon. 

There's a Garden of Eden 
In your distant heart, 
Garden of Eden 
In your earthly arms. 

Here I stand, a serpent queen of the garden. 
I'm beckoning, but you ignore my siren song. 
Oh I long, to touch you, to step inside your sacred gate. 
I'll dig my grave in the middle of golden bible snake. 

There's a Garden of Eden 
In your distant heart, 
Garden of Eden 
In your earthly arms.

The queen is dead,
She'll never step foot in Eden.

She's the only one of her kind in this neighborhood.

The cops just turn their heads to protect their friends.

Tied upon the railroad tracks.

I watched you whisper in her ear

And you can use me if you want to 
I know you need me just like an old soft shoe

She's a skater and a ballet dancer 
I saw her on your motorcycle 
In the seat I thought was meant for me

And I am the one who will give when she's gone

Hoping you will love me back

Our planet is a tiny atom in god's kingdom 
It's our only home 
A new millennium 
Can we all just get along?

God is watching us play our games 
God is waiting for us to overcome

Paula Cole,"It all started nine years ago
You sat to my left back in school
The future showed itself to me
The god in you, the god in me, stood together like two trees

I was so shy to inquire
If you would like tea sometime
Then in my Mercury
Hand on hand, hand on knee, mercy mercy mercy me

And I believe in love 
To be the center of all things
And I believe in love to be the way
And I believe in love
To be the center of all things
And I believe in love to be the way
To find our inner light

I saw a vision where we
Were opening presents Christmas Day 
But we were not all alone 
The wedding was shotgun 
We had a daughter and a son 

So how cruel to realize 
You had a woman all the time 
But my love burns bright as the sun 
The clouds may come, the clouds may go 
And I'll still be here at your door 

And I believe in love...

Thank you for waiting through my lovers 
Knowing we could come home to each other 
Yes, I have waited through these winters
My true one was right here

And I believe in love...",I Believe in Love
Paula Cole,"Humility on Bleecker Street
Exposed my faults until I'm left defeated
It's been three years into this relationship 
This is longer than I ever could commit 

But I feel I'm near 
But I feel my fear 

I'm standing at the edge of another precipice in life 
Gotta face my steppenwolf 
Gotta drag you through the mud
When I get there I will see myself
I will look for strength within 
I will be a better woman 
Hang in there baby, I'm the grain of sand
Becoming the pearl 

There are no roll models in rock 'n' roll 
No women who could have it all 
The long career,the man, the happy family
And here I stand and god I do demand it 

And I feel I'm near 
But I feel my fear 

I'm standing at the edge of another precipice in life 
Gotta face my steppenwolf 
Gotta drag you through the mud
When I get there I will see myself
I will look for strength within 
I will be a better woman 
Hang in there baby, I'm the grain of sand

It's dark in here-Don't know who I am 
Memories come-I'm wading through the moon
Evil side-Wants to drag me down 
Will power-God,please give me some 
(I'm hanging onto hope now) 

I'm standing at the edge of another precipice in life 
Baggage from my family 
Going back to therapy 
I will kneel, be humble,tow the weight
I will look for strength within 
I will be a better woman

She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?

I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over

Wearing shrapnel in his skin

You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
So breathe a little more deeply my love
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I want to be here now

Paula Cole,"Out on the lawn Labor Day
Popsicle melts down your face
Cicadas beat their wings
Barbecued chicken and meat

When will it snow?
When will it snow?

Sweat holds the pennies in place
I stick fifteen on your face
The soles of our feet have been baked
I wish I were back in May

When will it snow?
When will it snow?

And God only knows
How free I can feel tonight
I've longed with the moon
Under the water I go

I touch the ocean floor
The sand in my fingertips
The sound in my head

Nobody knows what I know
Nobody knows what I'm feeling
Nobody knows what I feel
Nobody knows

When will it snow?

Concerts are free Sunday night
Come hear the songs by seaside
Lawn chairs and popcorn and ice

Paula Cole,"Your eyes they conjure up those Cliffs of Moher
Faraway and not listening anymore
Dreaming of life on another shore
Not here, not now, with me, the bore

So I stop talking and fade to bleak
Feeling insignificant, atrophied and weak
Even though it's not who I know myself to be
The Queen, the confidence
Doesn't speak

[Chorus:]
But I was 14 with my passion
And 15 with my best
16 with my ego
And zero with the rest
My heart is a P.O.W. tangled in my chest
I don't know how to communicate in a cardiac arrest

Your eyes they drown me in your sadness
Your words they bring hurricanes
Braving Shakespearean tempest
The mighty tiger
Doesn't blink

[Chorus]

I think I found the one
Silent suffering inside
The one who got away
I was too dangerous to hide

[Chorus]

So I stop talking, baby, 'cause you always want me to shut up
Take the center stage meanwhile I become your trusted, silent prop
So take good care, this mighty woman's ready to explode
Fire here below the surface of my volcano",14
Paula Cole,"I'm black on blacker velvet
Milk skin and veins
Like some El Greco painting
So full of pain
So full of longing for light of day

I thought I knew who I was in the world
But here I am twice blind at being born
Crawling to my buried voice, within

And I've forgotten who I used to be
And I've forgotten the woman in red
Living her dream
And I've forgotten the courage I used to be

Happiness is overrated
It never lasts
Skating the surface of oceanic depths
Oh may the fruit of my life be meaning
So please forgive me all my seriousness
My so-called spirituality
I'm just a mess
I'm tears and anxiety
But I'm unafraid to see

And I've forgotten who I used to be
The leader in her glory shining, divining
And I've forgotten, the courage I used to be
The middle passage is so damned humbling, persona crumbling

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

Like some El Greco painting
No sun or sky
No lantern, no candle needed to light
The holy radiance behind the eyes
And I've forgotten who I used to be
And I've forgotten the woman in red
Living her dream
And I've forgotten the courage I used to be

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

And I try, and I try, and I try",El Greco
Paula Cole,"Where's my white knight
My prince to save the day?
I've always paved my own way
I'm all alone
Bringing home the bread
Raising the kid, fixing the bed

[Chorus:]
I wanna be a star, Like Marilyn Monroe
A Cinderella fantasy, a naive Clara Bow
A princess and the pea, I try to play the part
Surrounded by society, hypnotizing me
It's hard to be soft

I'm all alone
Keeping the home alive
Making the meals
She's 9 to 5
I'm the only one
At the mommy and me
Looking for some company

[Chorus]

Out there on my own
Successful in the world
It works to be so strong
But when I come home
My pendulum's outta control
I'm passive or I let my fire blow
In a man's world it's hard to be soft

I don't want to be a star
Like Marilyn Monroe
A Cinderella fantasy
A naive Clara Bow
A princess and the pea
I try to play the part
Surrounded by society
Hypnotizing me to be
Home-baked apple pie
A centerfold in heels
A Betty Crocker Pamela
Complacent to believe
In my Mr. Right

A ready, steady, rock-hard Eddy

I wanna kiss you
I wanna stop the conversation
I wanna kiss you

Oh, lie beside me now
Funny papers, morning sunlight streams
Oh fantasize me now
I'll kiss your neck and make your toast and tea
Oh won't you marry me?
I see a little church atop a hill
But in the meantime I wanna lose my shame

I wanna kiss you
I wanna kiss you
I wanna stop the conversation

I wanna lean my body into yours

Nestled in an English garden scene

And I will paint my paintings by the sea
But now I'll be Lolita if you please

I wanna kiss you
I wanna stop the conversation

I wanna wrestle you down to the ground

Paula Cole,"(Holding on, holding on, holding on...)
Here in this vacancy
Where we existed
I carry on in life like some puppet acting her part

The very core of me
An empty garden
The tree of life once flowered her arms to open sky

An angel guided you home, now I'm alone, now I'm alone
The living on's the hardest part
And the days are endless hours

This house is silent now
The bed's much bigger
The television's constant to keep me company

The Maker guided you home
Now I'm alone, now I'm alone
The living on's the hardest part
And the days are endless hours

But then at night when my soul is in flight
And together we meet in the galaxy
Love know no lease
We're here in the meadow of grace and peace
We meet again in our dreams

So if you hear me now
'Cause I know you're out there
Wait for my homecoming when I cross the other side

A little bird flew you home
Now I'm alone, now I'm alone
The living on's the hardest part
And the days are endless hours

But then at night when my soul is in flight
And together we meet in the galaxy
Love knows no lease

We meet again in our dreams

Some days we meet again in our dreams",In Our Dreams
Paula Cole,"Spin the globe, stop and start
Come to a place that's torn apart
Here's a secret, it's my heart
Oh well
It's only...

Broken shutters, whistling wind
Vultures circling overhead
Tumbleweeds fly
Dust in my eyes
Guess it's not my feelings crying

Peeling paint on empty homes
Where people lived in this town long ago
Packed their bags, nailed down the door
To Lonelytown

Oh I once had a love of my life
The sun of my soul
But I took him for granted
Ignored all the signs
And now it's just memories and passing ghosts

Spiderwebs and weeds waist high
Abandoned schoolyards and rusted wire
Looking for love
Looking for life
In Lonelytown

If you're lucky with a love of your own
Remember this in a nutshell I've told
Hold them close and don't let go
And cherish forevermore
Or you will live in Lonelytown",Lonelytown
Paula Cole,"Crimson cardinal sees his life
Into the glass he flies
The perfect partner he does spy
A moment's glance of eyes
Reflections of a future love
Feel the pull of fate
The perfect love turned out to be
Himself in haste and vain
Passion's flash of red
Bloodied on the pane

[Chorus:]
In your eyes I find
You are my lovelight
You are my lovelight
You are my lovelight
Blinded by surprise
You are my lovelight
You are my lovelight
You are my lovelight

All the qualities I loved
Now bite me black and blue
All the joys you loved in me
Come biting back at you

Becoming what we feared
Till death do us our shadows part
Make room through all these tears
Till something new appears
Reborn in this nadir

But you gotta slow down
You don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
You gotta go now, back up off me

Oh, I got them going crazy, you see, uh oh
Head over heels for me, uh oh
Weak in the knees for me, boy, uh oh
Cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy

One day, wheezy
Baby, tonight's the night
And them girls are on me like white on rice
And I get them to the crib late, two on one
I'm already high, now it's you I want
Take a jet into the sunset, you won't come
Or sit in my Phantom and chew on gum
Baby, I can take you to and from
Ice up your little wrists till you're blue and numb, um
You're dealin' with a buster, mama
Young Wayne, Tony Montana
If I were you, I'd tell my homies ""I'll holla""
And if your man ain't me, why bother?
I go by the name Carter, I got more plaques than tartar
I'm just checkin' out the charts on the charter
Number one spot: Wayne and Paula

Uh oh, got them going crazy, you see, uh oh
Head over heels for me, oh, uh oh
Weak in the knees for me, boy, uh oh
Cause you so damn easy

Uh oh, got them going crazy, you see, uh oh
Head over heels for me, oh, uh oh
Weak in the knees for me, boy, uh oh
Cause you so damn easy (no, no, no, no, no)

Don't be so damn easy
Don't be so damn easy",Easy

And that's the way you could've made all the things you told me

I remember when you told me you'd never lie to me 
I can't believe I trusted you 
I sacrificed my time and my heart 
I gave you my all and what you do 

[Chorus]
You stepped on me, you walked on me 
Boy you left your 
Footprints on my 
Heart broken crying over the way you left your 
Footprints on my 
Heart aching you ran all over me and left your 
Footprints on my heart 
My heart 

I know the way you were before me 
And I was crazy to think you'd change 
I put up with your attitude 
Your selfish ways and your childish games (whoa) 
A good heart always ends up broken 
But overtime, it'll make me strong 
I'ma put the pieces back together 
Might take some time, but I just go on 

[Chorus]

Love me or leave me 
I don't mind 
My heart can't take this pain 
We had something so beautiful 
But now it's not the same 
So I gotta let this go 
Gotta take back the truth 
This situation makes no good for me 
I can't believe I let it happen like this

Who needs love, for I've been without it 
When I met you, I didn't wanna let you in 
But you did something to me when you rubbed my hand 
Told me you would never do me wrong 
That what we have together will be so strong 
So tell me what is this, I'm falling, keep falling, yeah

I was so mistreated 
I thought you could be the one 
You were all I needed

Wanna give you my love, yes all of my love

I put my trust in you 
I gave my best to you

Without holdin' me, without holdin' me tight
I want someone who sees me all the time in their dreams

Now I just wanna be

Over wanted
Over missed when I'm away

Over dreamed of
Over cared about
Over everything
I'd give anything to be overloved

I want someone who can't wait to kiss me again

Want someone who loves love songs
And dedicates them to me
And two loving arms never out of reach

Been fine all alone
Did fine being free

You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
Yeah, I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me

I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind I can't help but question

Does she rub your feet
When you've had a long day
And scratch your scalp
When you take out your braids?
Does she know you like to play PS2
Till six in the morning like I do

I can't explain this feeling (yeah)
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on (uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

Our life from day to day
Hopin' maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
But I know I should be content
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question

Does he kiss me on the forehead
Before we play?
Show up on my doorstep
With a bouquet
Does he call me in the middle of the day
Just to say, baby, I love you
Like you used to?

I can't explain this feeling (I can't explain, yeah)
I think about it everyday (everyday)
And even though we've moved on (moved on, uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory) (Walk away)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me, my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose the love that was meant to be?
Sometimes I kiss her, and wish that it was you that I'm kissin'
Sometimes I miss him, and wish that it was you that I'm missin'
Sometimes I hug her, and wish that it was you that I'm huggin'
And I realized how much I'm buggin'
I miss you

So how do I express this feeling?
'Cause nobody compares to you
And you know that she'll never love you like I do

(Yeah) I can't explain this feeling (uh huh)
I think about it everyday (everyday, yeah)
And even though we've moved on (yeah)

I feel like we've been through this story a thousand times
I feel like we've been going around and around in circles
Ooh why, we gotta put this behind us, yeah, yeah

Baby, listen to me
Please don't walk out that door
'Cause if you ever need me
I'd be lost, I'd be going crazy

'Cause I don't want nobody else
I just wanna be with you
You're the only one who completes me baby
You're the one who makes me whole

Why is it that every time I looked in your eyes
I see something wrong, insecurity
When all along I was trying make it right
Keep us going strong, and loving you faithfully

Girl you're messing with a player
And a player will probably play ya
But a player thinks he's sticking with you
Not a streets-create, so much distrust
That I'd probably be ready to break it to you

Now I ain't trippin'
We can kick it in the morning we can make it in the evening
Stroll through the park with the Cali smoke grievin'
Believe it, I wouldn't even leave you for nothin'
That's why I'm man enough to say my feelings I ain't finding

Let's go on the road to the end of the sunshine
I'ma forget about your past, hoping you forgot mine
I'd be focus on my grind, you'd be trying to hold me down
I told you I'd be your boy come on, baby girl, let's ride

Tell me, what makes her so much better than me (so much better than me)?
What makes her just everything that I can never be?
What makes her your every dream and fantasy?
Because I can't remember when it was me

And now you don't feel the same
I remember you would shiver every time I said your name
You said nothing felt as good as when you gaze into my eyes
Now you don't care I'm alive
How did we let the fire die?

That made you laugh

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

De onde é que salta essa voz tão risonha?
Da chuva que teima, mas o céu rejeita
Do mato, do medo, da perda tristonha
Mas, que o sol resgata, arde e deleita

Há uma estrada de pedra que passa na fazenda
É teu destino, é tua senda, onde nascem tuas canções
As tempestades do tempo que marcam tua história
Fogo que queima na memória e acende os corações

Sim, dos teus pés na terra nascem flores
A tua voz macia aplaca as dores
E espalha cores vivas pelo ar
Ah, ah, ah
Sim, dos teus olhos saem cachoeiras
Sete lagoas, mel e brincadeiras
Espumas ondas, águas do teu mar

E a saudade me seguir pra sempre aonde eu for

Prove o sabor que tem o meu amor

Eu vim pra te dizer

Se pensar em voltar a me procurar
Pra gente tentar se entender
Pense bem no que quer
Porque nosso amor
Depende muito mais de você

Seja o que for
Eu te avisei
Você já sabe o que eu sempre quis
Não depende de sorte
Depende da gente
A vida é pra tentar ser feliz

Veja a sua volta
Veja o que ficou
Detalhes de uma vida
Páginas de amor
Não foi tão importante pra você
Botou tudo a perder

Há chances que o tempo doa pra quem quer
Viver intensamente o amor com uma mulher
Não tem haver com o pouco que me deu
Você nunca tentou

Me conheceu sabendo não seria fácil
Viver é uma arte amar é complicado
Mas pense que é a chance de você
Parar de se esconder

Olha pra janela
O tempo passa mesmo
Perdeu tantos momentos sem provar meus beijos
E lágrimas rolaram por você
Eu vim pra te dizer

Se pensar em voltar a me procurar
Pra gente tentar se entender
Pense bem no que quer

Paula Fernandes,"Não sei o que faço perdi o juízo
Cansei desse jogo esse amor eu preciso
Amor é verdade você me faz falta
Agora aqui fora sem teto, sem casa
Com peito ferido queimando em brasa
Amor que saudade 'to sentindo falta

Agora eu vou dizer amor
A história ainda não acabou

Quando eu te vejo amor eu fico assim
Longe do teu beijo a vida é tão ruim
Quando eu te beijo amor é piração
Morro de desejo e sinto o céu no chão

Que gosta e quer voltar pra mim

Quando eu te vejo amor eu fico assim
Longe do teu beijo a vida é tão ruim
Quando eu te beijo amor é piração
Morro de desejo e sinto o céu no chão

Parece loucura mas quando eu te beijo
Eu perco o compasso e fico sem jeito
Disfarço não nego o assunto que evito
Mas essa paixão 'tá acabando comigo
Eu fico sonhando com esse momento
Há tempos que sinto um fogo aqui dentro
Essa piração eu 'to ficando louca

A man selling ice cream
Singing Italian songs
Everybody is another
Can you dig it (yes, I can)

For Saturday

Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July

People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar
And singing for us all
Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it (yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today

Slow motion riders fly the colors of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children all is not lost, all is not lost, oh no, no

Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July
Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Until I'm almost mad

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

De no
Ocultar o mentir

Y asi
Cerraste tu el telón
De una
Historia de amor

Total
De tocar algo prohibido y de momento
Cambiaste mi vida
Por un buen recuerdo

Nada
No recordare besos ni tu cuerpo ya
Nada
Sera vuelto vacio y no quedara

Nada
Ni siquiera tu llanto ni mi estupido
Sueño
Que tenia contigo

Nada
Nada
Nada de ti
Nada de ti

Adiós
Nada te llevaras
En ti
En ti se quedara

Lo sé
Pues sólo fue un error
Que sé
Que buscaras perdón

Y yo
Limpiaré mis sentimientos en tu olvido
Pedira mi amor
Por alquien que sea mejor

Nada
No recordare besos ni tu cuerpo ya
Nada
Sera vuelto vacio y no quedara

Nada
Ni siquiera tu llanto ni mi estupido
Sueño
Que tenia contigo

Nada, nada de ti
Nada de ti
Na, na, na, nada de ti
Nada de ti

Nada
No recordare besos ni tu cuerpo ya
Nada
Sera vuelto vacio y no quedara

Nada
Ni siquiera tu llanto ni mi estupido
Sueño
Que tenia contigo

Nada
Nada de ti

Paulina Rubio,"Gotas de lluvia por mi piel
Sin rumbo en mi mirar
Llena de dudas solo tu
Calmara este ruido que azota mi sien

El viento fresco me hace bien
Caen las hojas ya es otoño
Llego el invierno entre los dos
Cubriéndose de hielo lo que pudo arder

No es que no pueda ser
Mas debes aprender
Como se trata a una mujer

Si te marchas con otra
Algo marca tu piel
Vuelves a mi lado y no eres tú

Si te marchas con otra
Se hombre y decídete
Confiésalo y olvídame

Solo el recuerdo del ayer
Lleno de besos y ternura
Borran de mis ojos la luz
Cubiertos por el velo de sal y de hiel

Y es que ni pudo ser
Aun debes aprender
Como se trata a una mujer

Si te marchas con otra
Algo marca tu piel
Vuelves a mi lado y no eres tú

Si te marchas con otra
Se hombre y decídete
Confiésalo y olvídame

",Si Te Marchas con Otra
Paulina Rubio,"Te daria mi vida despues de amar
Te daria mi vida por la mitad
Te daria mi vida, te daria todo mi ser

Te daria mi vida sin vacilar
Te abirira mi puerta de par en par
Te daria mi vida si supiera que es de verdad

Se que es dificil dar el corazon
PCues hare falta un gran valor, yo no soy
No soy mujer de una historia
Por favor, no que no, no me confundas con otra

Te daria mi vida, mi guerra why paz
Te daria mi vida, amor-amar
Te daria mi vida, te daria sin condicion

Te daria mi vida quisiera o no
Te daria mi vida por ese amor
Que soñamos despiertos
Quizas tengas que madurar

No hay que hacer planes con el corazon
Hay que ser complices los dos
Ho uh oh, oh uh oh, por favor
No me compliques la historia

Oh uh oh, soy quien soy, como soy
Ya nada puedo cambiar
No es imposible dar el corazon

Si tu me quieres como yo
Oh uh oh, oh uh oh
Ahora o nunca ya es hora si no no

Te daria, te daria
Te daria, te daria

Me llevo el recuerdo de tu piel dorada
Buscando el olvido en el camino, uh oh
Viene a mi el deseo de recordar ah
Quítame esta absurda soledad
Imagino que tu estas conmigo
Me hablas
Entre tanto why tanto caminar
Recuerdo tu cara
Me falta la luz de tu mirada, no
Why me sobran ganas de volver

Refrão:
A ti, volver, regresar
Tiraré hacia atrás
Sabes bien, porque, quiero estar
Yo te quiero amar (2x)

Paulina Rubio,"Hay fuego cruzado, cada vez que salgo de mi casa
Brillan las miradas, mas que las medallas por donde paso
No hago nada por llamar la atencion, soy de lo mas normal
No acabo de comprender, lo que les doy sin querer.

Que es lo que tengo, para que se mueran por mis huesos
En el espejo soy igual que todas, no veo nada especial
Porque se derriten asi, en cuanto empiezo a bailar
No trato nunca de provocar, pero es igual, se que pierdo el tiempo.

CORO...
Dime si soy sexy, dime si soy sexy
Cuenta me ya la verdad
Dime si soy sexy, soy o no soy sexy
Por favor, dimelo ya.

Cuentame ya la verdad
Dime si soy sexy, soy o no soy sexy
Por favor, dimelo ya.

Entro en el mercado why hay terremoto devastador, que pasa, que?
Porque me persiguen asi, a donde quiera que voy
Con ojos de corderos hambrientos, hasta que tengo que salir corriendo.

CORO...
CORO...",Dime
Paulina Rubio,"Tu lo prometiste, dijiste escribiré
Ha pasado mucho tiempo, no resistiré
Mis amigas me preguntan, no se que decir
Esta fiesta me atormenta, solo pienso en ti

Me siento atrapada, alma engañada
Pero enamorada, enamorda de ti

Enamorada, enamorada, enamorada de ti
Desilusionada, me siento engañada
Pero enamorada

Todas esas noches, hablábamos de amor
Jugabas con caricias suaves
Flechando mi corazon

Te escribo esta cara, loca esperanza
Tu dime se el amor es cierto, me alejarede ti

Amor fatal, pasión fugaz, besar tu piel
Te hecho de menos, no puedo mas
De amor por ti",Enamorada
Paulina Rubio,"Me quieres, why me mientes
Me deseas, why no llegas
Me amas, why te callas
Te busco, me huyes

Un tres de abril, una tarde más
Cuando el sol se despedía
Llegaba su final

Una historia más, una realidad
De piel why aventura
Deseo criminal

El destino marca fuertes cambios para él
Por que tropezó con algo que nunca vió

Atracción, dos sombras juego de amor
Pasión que lo contaminó
Sin darse nombres se amaban por horas
La advertencia fue clara

Una historia más, dormía la ciudad
Un cariño irresponsable, difícil de escapar
",Una Historia Mas
Paulina Rubio,"Quiero que me envuelva el poema
Que me hable la luna, acariciar el alma
Que me enfríe un poco el viento
Olvidarme del cuerpo
Solo pensar muy dentro
Dejar la pasión escondida
Y enamorarme otro día
Miedo, me da mucho miedo
Al solo pensar caer en el desprecio
Miedo, me da mucho miedo
Acercarme al fuego y luego un hasta luego

Quiero caminar en la arena, correr en praderas
Perderme entre la lluvia
No sentir el cielo de cerca, amar sin cadenas
Y coquetear sin pena

La pasión que quede escondida
Y enamorarme otro día",Miedo
Paulina Rubio,"Hoy desperté mire al cielo 
De mi corazon 
Abrí mi cortina de miedo

Que queman mas que el sol 
Andando de puntillas 
Por tus sueños lejanos 
Poner tu mundo en órbita solo por mi amor 

Soy tu fiel talismán 
Que refleja tu verdad 
Mas allá de esta tierra 
Soy la miel y la sal vivo con intensidad 
No hay de otra manera 

Únete al juego y la magia

Eso de planear futuro, siempre acompañándonos

Donde la buena y el malo al final siempre quedan bien

Que vienes solo a la guerra, en contra de un gran batallón
Pero me juego por ti del todo y de una sola vez,
Tanta emoción me impresiona y estoy segura que esta vez

Lo haré por ti, porque lo siento,
Porque tu me elevas, como la hoja al viento,
Y cuando me besas, siento que disparas
En medio de mi alma

Lo haré por ti, porque te creo
Porque es tu mirada, ver el mismo cielo,
Y cuando te beso, siento que disparas

Y desde ahora podré, barrer en este corazón
Todos aquellos sucesos, que me pusieron de bajón
Y si amar es aprender, tu amor es una gran lección
Y aquí­ me lanzo de nuevo en una sola dirección

Paulina Rubio,"Tienes una falsa idea del amor
Nunca fue un contrato ni una imposición
Y aunque te quiero cada vez más
De un modo que no puedes ni sospechar

Yo no soy esa mujer, que no sale de casa
Y que pone a tus pies lo mejor de su alma
No me convertiré, en el eco de tu voz
En un rincón,
Yo no soy esa mujer

Cambia tu manera de pensar en mi
O verás como no me encontraras aquí
Aunque se rompa mi corazón
Te obligaré a que entiendas esta lección

Yo no soy esa mujer, que no sale de casa
Y que pone a tus pies lo mejor de su alma
No me convertiré, en el eco de tu voz
En un rincón

Yo no soy esa mujer, esa niña perdida
La que firma un papel  y te entrega su vida
Nunca me verás llorar, aunque sienta deseos
Más de una vez, yo no soy esa mujer

Aunque se rompa mi corazón
Te obligaré a que entiendas este lección

Yo no soy esa mujer, que no sale de casa
Y que pone a tus pies lo mejor de su alma
No me convertiré, en lo que tu quieres no
En lo que prefieres, no;
Esa niña consentida, mimada o perdida

Yo no soy esa mujer, esa chica que baila,
Baila al son de tu vida  y tu alma
Nunca me verás llorar, no, no, no
Nunca me verás caer, no, no, no
Nunca me verás perdida, llorando, consentida, no

Yo no soy esa mujer, que no sale de casa
Y que pone a tus pies lo mejor de su alma
No me convertiré, en el eco de tu voz
En un rincón

Yo no soy esa mujer, esa niña perdida
La que firma un papel  y te entrega su vida
Nunca me verás llorar, aunque sienta deseos

Paulina Rubio,"Esta melancolía me esta dejando fría 
Si queremos andar el camino hay que ser valientes 
Vivir el día a día no es una sinfonía 
Se hace duro tener que pensarte sin llegar a verte 
Y es que tu representas mi fantasía 
Pero hoy no es el tiempo para soñar

Nieva, Nieva en mi primavera 
Un mundo irreal 
Nieva, Nieva y como el tiempo vuela 
Mi mente a donde estas 
Nieva, Nieva sobre mi alma nieva 
Soy hielo si no estas 
Y aunque duela esta larga espera 
Habrá un bello final

Soñar será tontería, pero sigue acercándonos 
Y esta prueba que es como un examen nos hace mas fuertes 
Y es que hoy que valoro escuchar tu risa 
Y extrañar ese aliento sobre mi piel

Ya no nieva en mi primavera 
Ya todo es realidad 
Ya no nieva ni noches en vela 
Llegaste hasta el final 
Ya no nieva en mi primavera 
Ya todo es realidad 
Ya no nieva ni noches en vela 
Llegaste hasta el final",Nieva Nieva

Si tu te vas
Que tristeza me daras
Si te vas

Paulina Rubio,"[Chorus]
It's very clear to me, just like it's in 3d
When total empathy sounds like it's ringing on my stereo
I'm bouncing off the wall, the way you turn me on
I think I like this song, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

Deep in the scene, like the music getting fascinating
Touching the screen, like the view from my imagination
Ninety degrees, got me circulating
I've been waiting, Impatiently
Got me changing stations on occasion

What's your frequency?
Can you connect with me?
If it's alright your satellite can be my energy

Don't want to be too bizarre but you're the key to my heart
You're my electric guitar, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

[Chorus]

Survive the people's faces, they're dancing from temptation
Her icky style is wasted, you don't need no invitation
Hey there cutey boys
Making all the noise
It's getting hard up in here
You don't have a choice

What's your frequency?
Can you connect with me?
If it's alright your satellite can be my energy

Don't want to be too bizarre but you're the key to my heart
You're my electric guitar, sounds like it's ringing on my stereo

Dentro de ti

El amor que te faltaba
La sonrisa en tu mirada
El mejor de tus secretos
El motivo de tus sueos...

momentos tristes y alegres
Así es la vida, olvida lo malo escucha lo que digo
levántate prende la radio

Te ha fallado en un momento

Invade todo tu pensamiento 
Si tu sientes que a tu lado 
Hay una vibra negativa

Vida es buena

Si tus amigos se han marchado 
Te han dejado en el olvido 
Recuerda que el camino es largo 
Y si te rindes no hay sentido 
Si ya has dejado en el pasado

Solo escucha lo que digo 
Este amor es tuyo y mio

Sudorcito, ven aquí 
Acércate un poquito

Prende la vela, deja que venga 
Lo que queda, y has que esto de la vida fluya

Como olvidar esos besos why tu sabor 
Sin ti no hay ningún lugar 
Sin ti todo me da igual 

Ayúdame a no olvidar jamás 
A sentir la brisa del mar 
Como aquellos tiempos 

Si tú te vas, la vida no será ningún lugar de sueños 
Como el que yo quiero 
Para mí, para ti 
Para ti, para mí 

Como sales why te vas sin decir adiós 
Delirio pensando que estás en mi habitación 
Sin ti, no hay brisa del mar 
Sin ti, todo me da igual 

Ayúdame a no olvidar jamás 
Why sentir la brisa del mar 
Como aquellos tiempos 

Si tú te vas, la vida no será

Why lo que veo es lo que quiero

Quiero olvidar que me dejaste así
Algunas noches fácil voy a ser

Me gustaría que sufras así

Alguien me espera abajo

No quiero ver
Quiero ver, quiero ver
No quiero verte hoy

Hoy desperté why de nada me acordé
No sé muy bien ni a dónde ni por qué
Ni lo que hice lo hice para qué
Algo te duele adentro

No quiero ver
Quiero ver, quiero ver
No quiero verte hoy

Hoy
No quiero ver
Quiero ver, quiero ver
No quiero verte hoy

¿A dónde vas?
¿Con quién estás?
No me importa más
Desde hare tanto tiempo

Hoy desperté why de nada me acordé
No sé muy bien a dónde ni por qué
Ni lo que hice lo hice para qué
Algo te duele adentro

Sigo siendo la de siempre
Pero a veces tengo suerte
El que busca la revancha
Solo sabe lo que siente

No quiero verte hoy, no
No quiero ver
Quiero ver, quiero verte
No quiero verte hoy

Paulina Rubio,"Vuelvo a caer como en un sueño 
Desde mi cama vero amanecer 
Dulce y fatal como el deseo 
Con tu brillo me confundo otra vez 
Y con el día ya no es tan incierto 
Puedo ver tus ojos en mi espejo 

Me duele cuando vuelvo a despertar 
No tengo paz 
Miénteme una vez más 
Dibujas mi mejor sueño 
Quiero soñar 
Miénteme una vez más 

Quise creer cada promesa 
Fue como arena entre mis manos al pasar 
Mi casa no es más que un escenario 
Lleno de espejos donde no tendré lugar 
Y con el día ya no es tan incierto 
Puedo ver tus ojos en mi espejo 

Me duele cuando vuelvo a despertar 
No tengo paz 
Miénteme una vez más 
Dibujas mi mejor sueño 
Quiero soñar 
Miénteme una vez más 

Una sombra vacía eres para mí 
Laberinto sin fin donde me perdí 
Ya no se quitarte de mi corazón 
Ya no puedo decir que no 

Los días se van 
Y no volverán 
Creí poder volar 
Sólo pude llegar 
Al mismo lugar 

Me duele cuando vuelvo a despertar 
No tengo paz 
Miénteme una vez más 
Dibujas mi mejor sueño 
Quiero soñar

No hay mañana, tienes sólo el presente

Ríe como nunca nadie ha sonreído
En este vida
Une no dividas, que cualquier problema
Tiene una salida

Vamos todos juntos a decir lo que pensamos
Vamos juntos!

Llora si lo sientes
Si es así como tu corazón entiende
Cambia why perdona
El amor es lo mejor de una persona

Siembra una idea, ten valor
Cree en ti, haz lo que quieras
Escucha why aprende con acciones
Cambia el ritmo de tu mente

Vamos todos juntos a decir lo que pensamos
Vamos juntos!

No te pongas tan sentimental
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Que de mi te olvidarás

Tan vacío estás
Llenándote, con tu reflejo
Que ya no te siento
Desde adentro

Cuanto más podrías ver
Quitándote las gafas
Pero te tropiezas
Todo el tiempo

Duela lo que duela, cueste lo que cueste
Tengo que arrancarte de mi piel esta vez
Miro tu retrato, en negro why en blanco
Why aunque te deseo ya no te quiero ver

Ah, ah, ah, ah
No te pongas tan sentimental
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ay, qué lástima me das

Te devuelvo así, todo el amor
Que no me diste
Brindo por que seas
Un recuerdo

Si engañarnos o cerrar los ojos

Nos hicimos tanto mal
Que por dentro algo se quebró
Me pregunto que será
De los mejores sueños que soñamos

Es difícil continuar
Si los días de felicidad
Ya no son más que una historia

Ay ay ay ay
No pretendo volver a empezar
Sólo quiero sentir tu calor
Una vez más

Ay ay ay ay
Que mañana no llegue jamás
Que esta última noche de amor
No tenga final

La distancia llegará
Why volverá tan dulce tu recuerdo

No debemos olvidar
Que los dos sufrimos por amor
Fue tan fácil prometer
Porque tú estarías para siempre junto a mí

Pero el tiempo nos venció
Nos dejó en medio del dolor
Otra vez, en el desierto

Cambia de estrategia por favor,
Que no me llevo bien coon el dolor,

Y vivir en guerra me hace mal.

I wanna lose it, lose it, lose it
I'm gonna do it, do it, do it

Build me up, make me rise like the tide
Put it on me, I'm down for the ride
I wanna lose it, lose it, lose it
I'm gonna do it, do it, do it

We can dance till our lips collide
You bring my body back back to life
In the heat of the night, heat of the night
La la la la la la la la!

Give me shivers I can’t shake away
If I'm leaving can u make me stay
Just keep it moving, moving, moving
And I'll  be cruising, cruising, cruising

Tare it up till I'm loosing my brain
Shut it down, baby, drive me insane
Just keep it moving, moving, moving
And I'll  be cruising, cruising, cruising

We can dance till our lips collide
You bring my body back back to life
In the heat of the night, heat of the night
La la la la la la la la! 

We’re out in the lasers
Tonight, we’re dancing on the stars
You know how to make me
Feel like I am the only one

We can dance till our lips collide
You bring my body back back to life

Paulina Rubio,"Cerraste la puerta
El día que te ibas
Pensé que me iba a morir
Lloré varias veces
Deseando tenerte
Y no fue así

Pasaron los días
Y yo adolorida
Quería correr hacia ti
Lo sobrepasado
Y el llanto olvidado
Ahora me río de ti

Pero como fue
Ahora me he enterado del engaño aquel
Pero ahora se
Ahora me he enterado lo perro que fue

Hoy me toca a mi
Me voy a divertir
La vida es así
Sufrir y vivir
Cierro la puerta ya no vengas aquí
Pasaste ya, te voy a olvidar

Paulina Rubio,"Yo te quiero, tú lo dudo
Sos el tonto más seguro
De que no me voy a ir
Voy a pintar una manta
Donde te diga que no hay nada
Que me pueda hacer sufrir

Con mis labios congelados
Por tus besos tan helados
Está nevando dolor
Hay invierno en esta historia
Siendo honestos no es la gloria
Y es por eso que me voy

Y me voy, me voy, me voy
Amándote, queriéndote
Amándote queriéndote me voy, me voy de ti
Y me voy, me voy, me voy
Sabiendo que nunca nadie te amó como yo a ti
Sabiendo que nunca nadie te amó como yo a ti

Me despido de tu vida
Pero nunca arrepentida
Porque yo di lo mejor
Aunque sé que por tu parte
Hay mentiras tan cobardes
Y es por eso que me voy

Y me voy, me voy, me voy
Amándote, queriéndote
Amándote queriéndote me voy, me voy de ti

Everytime I, see you face
It's clear to me that, you're all I need
But still, I walk away (walk away, mmh)
I wish I knew how, to make this change
But is it impossible, am I struggling in vain
All these clouds, surrounding me so I can not see

But still there's nothing I won't do to have you next to me
But all I do is letting you down (Letting you down)
So how in the world can I make you listen
To me, and my heart

I wanna try to make it right

Pauline,"Some say that I'm just too much
I guess I caught your attention
One thing that you don't know
That I'm a mad ping pong player
Never get up when I should
Wearing some jeans a hood
I nearly get my hair done
I'm always good to go
Just need to scratch my old Afro

I won't turn my life around
'Cause I like it upside down

Oh, no, no, no
I never said I was an angel
Oh, no, no, no
I never be a little angel
How can I get to you darling
I wanna fell it so real

Oh no, no, no
I never said I was an angel

Some say that I'm on the run
I say it's time for some action (action)
(Yes it is)
I'll have my high and my lows
I guess it's just how my life goes
I always shower too long
And make my coffee to strong
My momma says I'm a lonely one
Can't make this story too long
Take my hand or be gone
(Better be gone, be gone gone)

I won't turn my life around
'Cause I like it upside down

Pauline,"Si demain tout s’arrêtait
Si je laissais derrière moi
Ton ombre et tous les étés
Où nous partions toi et moi

Si demain tout finissait
Si je partais pour de bon
Ne me laisse rien de mauvais
Ne me parle pas sur ce ton
Mais…


Sors-nous de là (na na na na na na)
On tombera (na na na na na na)
On se dira
Qu’on en a fait du chemin
Qu’au fond tout ça
On le sait finira bien

Si demain je revenais
Si je pouvais comprendre
Ce qui nous est arrivé
Le chemin qu’il faudrait prendre

Si demain je retrouvais
La force d’y croire encore
Laissons nos cœurs se serrer
Et ne pleurons pas sur nos sorts

On s’abîme, on se retient plus fort
On se laisse, on se revient encore

Pauline,"Il paraît que les nouvelles ne sont pas si bonnes
Que le moral descend

Quels sont les actes et les mots qui peuvent t'aider à faire face ?

Pour faire le premier pas,

Pauline,"Je n'veux pas tout donner en un seul tout d'œil
Me dévoiler à la terre entière
Au moindre regard inquisiteur

Je préfère me sauver, éviter les écueils
En préservant mon univers
Mon petit monde intérieur

Il faut pas croire tout ce qu'on voit de moi
Je n'suis pas si fidèle
Y'a des humeurs qui affleurent à deux pas
Comme une vie parallèle

Mon côté fragile
Mon côté cristal et lunaire
Les secrets que je veux garder
Mon côté fragile
Mes ombres et mes mystères
Les choses que je veux protéger
Mon côté fragile

Je n'tiens pas à livrer toute mon âme en pâture
À tous les donneurs de leçon
Les partisans du moindre effort

Les faux amis, femmes et hommes de mauvaise nature
Qui ne se posent aucune question
Et me prennent pour leur réconfort

Il y'a des larmes que je n'veux pas verser
Devant n'importe qui
Il y'a des doutes que j'n'veux pas laisser
Aux oreilles non-averties

Mon côté fragile
Mon côté cristal et lunaire
Les secrets que je veux garder
Mon côté fragile
Mes ombres et mes mystères
Les choses que je veux protéger
Mon côté fragile

Cette face cachée de moi que je garde en sommeil
Qui ne s'offrira qu'à ceux et celles
Lisant sur le bout de mes rêves

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue

Why should we spend money

Paulinho Boca de Cantor,"Às vezes você me pergunta
Por que é que eu sou tão calado
Não falo de amor quase nada
Nem fico sorrindo ao seu lado
Você pensa em min toda hora
Me come, me cospe, me deixa
Talvez você não entenda
Mas hoje eu vou lhe mostrar

Que eu sou a a luz das estrelas
Eu sou a cor do luar
Eu sou as coisas da vida
Eu sou o medo de amar

Eu sou o medo do fraco
A força da imaginação
O blefe do jogador
Eu sou, eu fui, eu vou

Eu sou o seu sacrifício
A placa de contra-mão
O sangue no olhar do vampiro
E as juras de maldição

Eu sou a vela que acende
Eu sou a luz que se apaga
Eu sou a beira do abismo
Eu sou o tudo e o nada

Por que você me pergunta?
Perguntas não vão lhe mostrar
Que eu sou feito da terra
Do fogo, da água e do ar

Você me tem todo o dia
Mas não sabe se é bom ou ruim
Mas saiba que eu estou em você
Mas você não está em mim

Das telhas eu sou o telhado
A pesca do pescador
A letra ""A"" tem meu nome
Dos sonhos eu sou o amor
Eu sou a dona de casa
Nos ""peg-pagues"" do mundo
Eu sou a mão do carrasco
Sou raso, largo, profundo

Eu sou a mosca da sopa
E o dente do tubarão
Eu sou os olhos do cego
E a cegueira da visão
É, mas eu sou o amargo da língua
