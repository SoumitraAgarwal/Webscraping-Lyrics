George Jones,"If you think it's lonesome where you are tonight. 
You oughta be here with me. 
If loneliness is calling where you are tonight. 
Then you oughta be here with me.

[Chorus]
Because with you I'm whole. 
Without you I'm cold. 
So if you think about me where you are tonight then 
You oughta be here with me.

If teardrops are fallin' where you are tonight. 
You oughta be here with me. 
If loneliness calls you where you are tonight. 
Then you oughta be here with me.

[Chorus]

Recitation,
You know if nobody loves you darlin' 
And it's lonely where you are tonight. 
Don't you know you oughta be here with me? 
Here's thinking of you where ever you are tonight
But you oughta be here with me.

[Chorus]",You Oughta Be Here With Me
George Jones,"Lyin' here thinkin' and I happen to think
Blamin' myself for the things that I said
Hoping that you soon forget and forgive
My life without you ain't no way to live.

Come home to me, come home to me
It just won't be right till you do
Come home to me, come home to me
I can't take one more night all alone
Come on home.

Baby, you left a hurtin' only your love can heal
And I understand that's how I made you feel
Well, my life without you would just fall apart
Right from the body come my lonely heart.

Come home to me, come home to me
It just won't be right till you do
Come home to me, come home to me
I can't take one more night all alone
Baby, come on home.

Is my shade of blue
As I'm holding your pillow
Longin' for you, baby.

George Jones,"Well, you and me baby know what love's all about
It sure wasn't easy oh, but we figured it out
No matter what happens we'll see it through
Baby, don't you see there ain't no me without you

We're like Heckle and Jeckle, Jeckle and Hyde
Frankie and Jonny oh, Bonnie and Clyde
Just like Laurel and Hardy, Bartles and James
One without the other baby, just ain't the same

We've held it together and together we'll stand
You and me against the world hand in hand
A team of wild horses couldn't pull us apart
Forever joined together heart to heart

Just like Heckle and Jeckle, Jeckle and Hyde
Frankie and Jonny oh, Bonnie and Clyde
Just like Laurel and Hardy, Bartles and James

George Jones,"Well I don't know why you left me but I do know that your gone 
Over night you turned my life into a sad ol' song And one way or another, 
I gotta get over you Well there's only one thing left for me to do Lord, 
I don't wanna die of a broken heart That would be too sad Or drive my car off a cliff 

Well, that would just hurt too bad And if I tied a rope around my neck, 
I couldn't get my breath Well I think I'll just honky-tonk myself to death 
Well, I may get a little bit crazy but I don't wanna go insane Young women and ole whisky, 
Well it just may kill the pain I'm gonna find the highest barstool and climb up to the top. 

I think I'll just drink and two-step until I drop Lord, 
I don't wanna die of a broken heart That would be too sad Or drive my car off a cliff 
Well, that would just hurt too bad And if I tied a rope around my neck, 
I couldn't get my breath Well I think I'll just honky-tonk myself to death

George Jones,"A friend of mine told me that you were down here last night
I almost called him a liar but I seen he was right, 
Yeah, he was right.

I'm over my anger but that's about all
It's hard to recover from that kind of fall
A fool never knows when to give up
For years I remember those long nights of love

But, I don't go back, anymore
My heart's locked it's windows and bolted it's door
It's like trying to hold back the sea from the shore
No I, don't go back anymore

You're still just as pretty as you were back then
If I didn't know you, I'd fall again
So don't smile and tell me that you still care
Don't stir up my feelings, it just isn't fair

I don't go back, anymore
My heart's locked it's windows and bolted it's door
It's like trying to hold back the sea from the shore
No I, don't go back, anymore

No, I don't go back, anymore

A friend of mine told me you might be down here tonight...",I Don't Go Back Anymore
George Jones,"I gave her that diamond she dreamed of,
And I bought her a home with a view;
I took her to the ends of the rainbow,
But all I left her was blue.

Seems I never had time to love her,
Now it seems time just stands still;
I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.

[Chorus]
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely,
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill;
I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.

[Chorus]
 
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely,
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill;

But I was only a fool on the hill.

But I was only a fool on the hill...",King of the Mountain
George Jones,"I started drinking and actin' crazy
Way back in sixty five
Mama would pray and say, he's my baby
Lord, please keep him alive

Sister came home with two little children
Her man had left her alone
Mama knew too well the hurt she was feelin'
'Cause daddy had been gone so long

We all did our part to add to her pain
We all broke her heart but she never complained

She loved a lot in her time
She watched love grow and die on the vine
She stood in the shadows
So others could shine
She loved a lot in her time

Mama's prayers were answered a long time ago
I ain't touched a drink in ten years
Sister remarried to a good ol' boy
They don't live far from here

Mama's work is done
Now, she's gone on home
The words in our hearts
Are engraved on her stone

She loved a lot in her time
She watched love grow and die on the vine
She stood in the shadows
So others could shine
She loved a lot in her time

She stood in the shadows
So others could shine
She loved a lot in her time

Mama, you loved a lot in your time",She Loved a Lot in Her Time
George Jones,"There's three bedrooms, hardwood flooring and the kitchen's new
It's got everything a family needs with a backyard view
Ask anyone where it is, everybody knows
Who used to live here, where the tall grass grows.

The couple who lived there before they kept it up
But since they left that big old yard looks a little rough
And God I miss that little boy who always kept it mowed
We say still lives where the tall grass grows.

So come by and get the key go make yourself at home.
Take all the time you  need, wish I could come along
But I'd sooner build a fire then walk across it slow
And to thank those burning memories where the tall grass grows.

Yes, I'd sooner build a fire then walk across it slow
Than face those burning memories where the tall grass grows
Can't go back and face those memories where the tall grass grows",Where the Tall Grass Grows
George Jones,"I hear people talkin' bad, 
About the way we have to live here in this country,
Harpin' on the wars we fight, 
And gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be.
And I don't mind 'em switchin' sides, 
And standin' up for things they believe in.
When they're runnin' down my country, man, 
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me. 

[Chorus]
Yeah, walkin' on the fightin' side of me.
Runnin' down the way of life,
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep.
If you don't love it, leave it,
Let this song I'm singin' be a warnin'.
If you're runnin' down my country, man,
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me.

I read about some squirrelly guy,
Who claims, he just don't believe in fightin'.
And I wonder just how long,
The rest of us can count on bein' free.
They love our milk an' honey,
But they preach about some other way of livin'.
When they're runnin' down my country, hoss,
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me.

[Chorus: x2]",Fighting Side of Me
George Jones,"Hey, I've got a guitar, I've got a fiddle
I'll sing the low part, I'll sing the middle
Rosin up the bow and let's pick a little
Got a fiddle and guitar band.

I like the glad songs, I like the blues
Well, we'll play them and another note too

George Jones,"By the time I noticed her she was smilin' at me
From where I stood the mutual attraction was easy to see
Ten beers and twenty passes later the bar tender said it was time to go
I was outta money, she stood and said honey I'm a-going home on my own.

Oh, I've been there, listen buddy, I've been there
I been there when I thought I was livin' a dream and woke up in a real night mare
Yessum, I've been there, let me tell you I've been there
Anywhere a woman can leave you, man, I've been there.

My baby said honey you need a break
Why don't you take a little fishin' trip
I loaded my my old truck and as I drove away
She waved and kinda blew me a little kiss
A couple days later when I got home
Was nothing left but a note on the door
It said I had to leave you
I need a man who'll stay home a little more.

Let me tell you, I've been there, hey buddy, I've been there
I've been there when I thought I was livin' a dream and woke up in a real night mare
Oh, I've been there, I'm here to tell you, I've been there
'Bout anywhere a woman can leave you, man, I've been there.

'Bout anywhere a woman can leave you, son, I've been there

Oh, I've been there.
I've been there too, son, let me tell ya, I know what it's all about.",I've Been There
George Jones,"Hey, we broke up in Nashville on a cold and rainy night
My tears mixed with the cold rain drops as she walked out of sight
So I put Nashville in my rear view mirror and headed south
'Cause I thought the girls in San Antone would knock her memory out

But it hurts as much in Texas as it did in Tennessee
Lone star lonely, down and blue is what they're callin' me
I thought these Texas dance halls nights would kill my misery
But it hurts as much in Texas as it did in Tennessee

My heart still lives in Nashville with the girl I long to see
I'm tryin' to forget the way that she broke up with me
I thought that I could two step her sweet memory from my mind
But she still waltzes through my dreams and wakes me up at night

But it hurts as much in Texas as it did in Tennessee
Lone star lonely, down and blue is what they're callin' me
I thought these Texas dance halls nights would kill my misery?
But it hurts as much in Texas as it did in Tennessee
Yeah, it hurts as much in Texas as it did in Tennessee

",It Hurts as Much in Texas (As It Did in Tennessee)
George Jones,"I remember my grandfather's counsel
As he laid the leather to my hide
He said there's just one rule to life that always will apply
You can't do wrong and get by.

Now, lessons tend to fade as we grow older
And I found myself in jail at twenty-five
Had to sit there by my lawyer, the old judge looked me in the eye
Said, you can't do wrong and get by.

You can't do wrong and get by for very long
Do wrong and all your troubles multiply

You may not face them here but you'll face the man on high

You can't do wrong and get by.

Now once I had a wife and lovin' children
But I gave into the pleasures of the night
Used my grand dads very words to say her last goodbye
You can't do wrong and get by.

You can't do wrong and get by for very long
Do wrong and all your troubles multiply
Oh, you may not face them here but you'll sure face the man on high
You can't do wrong and get by.

No, no, you can't do wrong and get by
You can't do wrong and get by.

George Jones,"I know momma loved me
I reckoned that dad thought I was a pretty good kid
I've been blamed
But I'm not ashed of a couple of things I did

I learned the golden rule before I started to school
Like every little young'n should do
But what am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm not worth nothing to you?

What am I worth here on earth
Darling, If I can't have you?
I just can't find no peace of mind
With anything that I do

I don't know why you made me cry
Honey, won't you give me a clue 
What am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm not worth nothing to you?

I might get sent to be president
I'm sure I could do it for you
They would feature my face all over the place 
For all the good things I do

I might get my name in the hall of fame
Or even in the book of ""Who's-Who""
But what am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm mot worth nothin' to you?

George Jones,"Written by George Jones and Darrell Edwards 
In the papers I saw you this morning
You were lovely, dressed in your wedding gown
And it said you would marry a stranger to me

That had drifted into our old home town
Accident'ly, you met him one ev'ning
And you say it was love at first sight
Accident'ly on purpose you're marryin'

Accident'ly on purpose, for spite
For you say that you saw me out painting the town
That I was just a fool with the heart of a clown
Accident'ly, you were mistaken that night

And never did I think I'd let a sweet love get me down

Oh, this aching, breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
And I'm afraid to let you know I love you like I do
For if you knew how much I care, I know what you would do
You'd drop me like the others and go find somebody new

Last night I saw you, darling, in the arms of someone new
And I know that you don't love him, you just want to make me blue
I guess you think that hurting me will make me love you more

George Jones,"Up above me are the skies like the twinkle in your eyes
These things are the color of the blues
In the mail your letter came, the ink and paper looked the same
Blue must be the color of the blues

Bluebird sitting in the tree seems to sympathize with me
For he's not singing like he used to do
The pretty waters in the sea feel as cold as you left me
Yes, blue must be the color of the blues

There's a rainbow overhead with more blue than gold and red
Blue must be the color angels choose
A blue dress you proudly wore when you left to return no more
Blue must be the color of the blues

George Jones,"THE LAST TOWN I PAINTED
(Writer Buddy Word)
Â« Â© '63 Glad Music Â»

I came home the other night I've been out on a town
I searched talk through the house she was not around
I finally found her note it red this is goodbye to you
And that's the last town I painted and I painted it blue
Now that I have lost her I don't want to live
I done all the takin' I didn't want to give
Time has come it's plain to see the devil must pay his dues
And that's the last town I painted and I painted it blue
I still go to the tavern that I went to before
I search for the fun I had it's not there anymore
If I could have her back again I know I would be true
Cause the last town I painted I painted it blue
Now blue is not my favorite color cause it makes me sad
Why I asked for all these blues when I'm usin' too much red
I've got a lotta troubles no one to tell it to
Cause the last town I painted I painted it blue



",The Last Town I Painted
George Jones,"I've got a feeling you'll soon be leavin'
But I won't beg you not to go
Because I've always been
A fool to cry for you.

I know this time it's really over
For there's no happiness in store
And I will never be the fool I was before
No one can ever call me Mr. Fool no more.

My tears were scattered with all was shattered
Dreams that faded in the past
Vows were spoken and vows were broken
But the last one was the last.

So I'll keep smilin' although you're leavin'
For time will heal a heart that's sore
And I will never be the fool I was before
No one can ever call me Mr. Fool no more.

George Jones,"What goes wrong with the mind of a man in a bar
Who sits and keep drinking with his thoughts strayed so far
It's the same old sad story that has often been told
One drink then another till he's out of control

As he sits at a table with his hands on the glass
For him there's no future there's only the past
He reaches for the bottle but his hands don't take hold
His eyes just can't focus he's out of control

Does he search for contentment that he might hope to find
From a honky tonk woman or the bottles of wine
He shakes and he trembles even though he's not old
Like a leaf in a whirlwind he's out of control

Yes I'm just like that fellow who sits there all alone
With no one to love me no family at home
I'm a picture of others with a future so cold
A life ain't worth livin' when it's out of control",Out of Control
George Jones,"Well I was standin' in the tavern a-feelin' blue
My foot on the rail, just a-thinkin' 'bout you
But I won't be blue all day
Because relief - is just a swallow away

Well I've been blue before and I will again
I'll drown all my worries or I'll teach 'em how to swim
And I won't be the one to pay
Because relief - is just a swallow away

Yes, you thought when you left I wouldn't have any fun
I'll admit I worried but I won't be long
We're apart because you wouldn't swallow your foolish pride
So you hurt me deep inside

But you're not the first to hurt me and you won't be the last
Can't tell the future, but I've learned from the past
As long as there'd a cabaret
I know relief - is just a swallow away

Well, I looked down the bar and what did I see
Your sad-lookin' face a-lookin' back at me
Wishin' you could turn time a few hours back
Get off of that one-way track

Well you want me to come over, but I'll tell you true
You're as close to me as I am to you
And that may still be too far away
Because relief - is just a swallow away
I said relief - just a swallow away



",Relief Is Just a Swallow Away
George Jones,"Written by James O'Gwynn

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me through this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright
Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me through my darkest gloom
Help me bring her mem'ry to this lonely room

(Chorus)
Talk to me and let me cry the whole night through
You have lost, yes, but I've lost as much as you
So talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me through this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Talk about the love I miss
Talk to me about the lips I used to kiss
Tell me how she used to smile
Just before she said goodbye
Talk to me, oh lonesome heart, while I cry

(Repeat chorus)

George Jones,"Your halo is the neon
Your heart a jukebox song
Your heaven is a honky tonk
You love to live so wrong

I know you're not much angel
As a saint you've gained no fame
My angel's kind of tarnished
But I love just the same

[Chorus]
Tarnished angel
From a backstreet bar

I want you just as you are

Our world's are strange and different
But love they say is true
I'll try to live in your world
If you won't live in mine

George Jones,"Tell me why baby, why baby
Why baby, why you make me cry baby, cry baby
Cry baby, cry
I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die
So tell me, why baby, why baby, why baby why

Well, I got a crow I wanna pick with you
Just like last time when the feathers flew
You're runnin' wild a-kickin' up your heels
A-leavin' me home with a hand full of bills

I can't live without you and you know it's true
But there's no livin' with you so what'll I do
I'm goin' honky-tonkin', get as tight as I can
Maybe by then you'll 'preciate a good man

Why baby, why you make me cry baby, cry baby
Cry baby, cry
I can't live without you 'til the day that I die

Well, now I don't know, but I've heard say
That ever' little dog's a-gonna have his day
You'd better pay attention, don't you dare forget
'Cause I'm just a little bitty puppy yet

I caught you honky-tonkin' with my best friend
The thing to do was leave you, but I shoulda left then
Now, I'm too old to leave you, but I still get sore
When you come home a-feelin' for the knob on the door

Tell me why baby, why baby
Why baby, why you make me cry baby, cry baby

George Jones,"I've been living a new way
Of life that I love so
But I can see the clouds are gathering
And the storm will wreck our home

For last night he held you tightly
And you didn't even shove
This is true for I've been watching (watching you)
From the window up above

You must have thought that I was sleeping
And I wish that I had been
But it's guess to get to know you
And the way your heart can sin

I thought we belonged together
And our hearts fit like a glove
But I was wrong for I've been watching (watching you)
From the window up above

From my eyes the teardrops started
As I listened on and on
I heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong

But I hope he makes you happy
And you will never lose his love
I lost mine while I was watching (watching you)
From the window up above

How I wish I could be dreaming
And wake up to an honest love that's true
But I'm wrong for I've been watching (watching you)
From the window up above",Window up Above
George Jones,"The jukebox is playing a honky tonk song
One more I keep saying and then I'll go home
What good would it do me, I know what I'll find
An empty bottle, a broken heart, and you're still on my mind

The people are laughing and having their fun
While I sit here crying over what you have done
My pockets are empty, my last drink of wine
An empty bottle, a broken heart, and your still on my mind

Alone and forsaken, so blue I could die
I just sit here drinking till the bottle runs dry
To try and forget you I turn to the wine
An empty bottle, a broken heart, and your still on my mind",You're Still on My Mind
George Jones,"I know this house is the finest one around and we are both respected in our town
But our friends don't know the truth when they drop by
That our house is such a lovely place to cry
I keep my yard cut as close as it can be there's no litter laying round for one to see 
And I know someday I'll tell this place goodbye
But till then it's sure a lovely place to cry
You don't need lonely things around you when you have no love left in you
And when you're already dead before you die
But someday someone will buy this place and be happy if they'll try
But for us it's been a lovely place to cry yes for us it's been a lovely place to cry",A Lovely Place to Cry

We shall meet on that beautiful shore, mmm together

George Jones,"Tonight the bottle let me down
I've always had a bottle that I could turn to and lately I've been turning every day
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm a hurtin' in an old familiar way

Tonight the bottle let me down and let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found tonight the bottle let me down
Each night I leave the barroom when it's over not feeling any pain at closing time

But tonight your memory found me much too sober

Lord let me keep her at least for a while
I promise I'll love her 'till I've walked my last mile
When your trumpets are sounding and you've played my song
Don't send me no angels 'cause I've got my own

I know I ought to save it, but it's burnin' a hole
Right through my pocket and into my skin
Come Monday morning I'll be broke again

It's finally Friday
I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday
I'm out of control
Forget the workin' blues
And let the good times roll

I got a little sugar baby down the road
She's sittin' on a radio and rockin' on roll
We'll dance up a storm, and later, all night
We'll be workin' on doin' all the wrong things right

It's finally Friday
I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday
I'm out of control
Forget the workin' blues
And let the good times roll

Monday, I'll be hurtin' with my head in a vice
Tuesday, I'll be wonderin' if I'll ever survive
Wednesday and Thursday, I'll be slowly tunin' in
Friday, I'll be revin' up my motor again

George Jones,"Wandered in around midnight 
Like I've done so many times
She was sittin' at the table 
There were no tears in her eyes

It seemed so much unlike her 
To be so much at ease
She took a sip of coffee 
And softly said to me

""There's the mantle where 
We keep our wedding picture
There's the bedroom where 
We make both love and war

And there's the ring that keeps 
On slipping off your finger
There's no reason we should go on 
Anymore and there's the door""

So I'm back here on this bar stool, 
My whole world gone to hel
Behind the bottles there's a mirror 
Where a fool can see himself

If I was the man I should be 
And not the one I am
I would go back there this minute 
And beg for one more chance

There's the jukebox 
Where I wasted all those quarters
Oh, there's a lady trying to 
Get me out on the floor

And there's a chance the one I love 
Would still forgive me
It's a step that I just never took before 
There's the door

There's the door...",There's the Door
George Jones,"I once stood in the darkness I couldn't see a light
Backed up against the wall I built around my life
I'd run out of reasons to ever love again
But somehow you found a door and you came waltzing in

[Chorus]
Walls can fall, storms can end
Skies can clear, hearts can mend
All it took was your sweet love to rise above it all
You can build 'em strong and tall, but walls can fall

Here we stand together with stones enough to build
A bridge into forever beyond the highest hill
The past will fade behind us if we let the future shine
Not a thing can come between us if we always keep in mind that

[Chorus]

You can build 'em strong and tall but walls can fall",Walls Can Fall
George Jones,"I no longer know what's real anymore
In the back of my mind I have opened the door
That leads to the past & the love we once shared
I keep asking myself what am I doing there

[Chorus]
What am I doing there holding you tight
Taking down your hair lying close by your side
Making believe that you still care
My new life is here what am I doing there

I don't get much rest with the secrets I keep
And I'm afraid that some night oh I'll talk in my sleep
How could I explain to the one lying here
She's loving me now what am I doing there

Some men look for gold
I'm just trying to find myself
Before I get too old
Different people have their ways
Of measuring success
Maybe it's not the right way
But wrong's what I do best
Well I walk the straight and narrow
Straight to where I don't belong
One time I even tried to love one woman
But that didn't last too long
If my ship is docking in the east
You can bet I'd be heading west
Riding the wrong direction
'Cause wrong's what I do best
When I'm down and out
And can't get up [ rest of line ?]
I feel right at home
When I got the blues
And it's all bad news
That's when I'm in my comfort zone
If they held a loser's playoff
There'd be no contest
'Cause I've had lots of practice
And wrong's what I do best
If my ship is docking in the east
You can bet I'd be heading west

George Jones,"I woke up downtown in jail again this mornin'
They say I went half crazy with the booze
Then they hit me one more time for no reason
But they can't hurt me, not half as much as you

You must have walked across my mind again
I don't recall what I've done or where I've been
I was holding my own, then everything went wrong
You must have walked across my mind again

That old jukebox won't be playing my favorite song no more
The bottle that I through knocked out it's lights
They say I damaged everything I put my hands upon
And one man might not make it through the night

The I watched her hang her dresses up and close the closet door
And I watched her put her satin things away
Somehow now I know she won't be leaving anymore
I do believe forever's here to stay

It's good to hear her foot steps just walking down the hall
Lord, I wondered would I hear those sounds again

We've got a lot of broken dreams to mend

I start thinkin' I might be over you
There's a knock on my hearts door, it's your memory back for more
Yes I've still got some hurtin left to do

Bloom in the springtime
Reflections of scarlet and gold

There ain't no diamond

There ain't no star that shines
Like the love in your eyes

I've had some good friends
Turn out to be strangers
Funny how quickly they turn

And I've had some lovers
That helped me discover
How easy it is to get burned

In this world of glitter
And cosmetic people
There's one thing that's real in my mind

It's the love in your eyes

There ain't no diamond

And loose my direction
Sometimes I go over the line

But it's such a comfort
And it's such a blessing
To know that you're there all the time

And I feel I'm driftin'
On a sea of confusion
There's a beacon that always shines
It's the love in eyes
It's the love in eyes

There ain't no diamond

They speak with their bodies and they talk with their eyes
They don't make no promises so they don't tell no lies

They cling to each other and lie there silently

When I awke this a morning the rain was a pouring down
I was gonna wed the little river girl just over the bridge across town
Now I'm a runnin' up and down the river and my nerves are drivin' me wild
Because the bridge washed out I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
Rain oh rain stop a fallin' dark clouds hurry from the sky
The preacher and my bride is a waitin' and the weddin' bells are starting to chime
I can't kiss and hold her and it's driving me out of my mind
The bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side

Now I got one foot in the water the other foot solid on the ground
When I try to swim that ragin' ol' river I know if I try I'd drown
There's not a boat around me they walked on out with the tide

Rain oh rain stop a fallin'...

Like a whisper on my cheek                           

And I cursed the sun for risin'

That I placed beneath her head
And the soft sheets still feel warm, Lord
Where she lay upon my bed

We like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo;
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy,
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do.

And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
A place where even squares can have a ball;
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
White lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all.

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear,
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen;
A football's still the roughest thing on campus,
And the kids here still respect the college dean.

Down the mountain to possum hollar
Accidently I'd find her waitin' there.

She'd tell her mama she was pickin' blossoms
By the moonlight so sweet and fair
And I'd tell daddy I'm a-huntin' possum
And take off, friend and slicken down my hair.

As time goes by the tales grow taller
About possum in possum hollar.

Then one evening in possum hollar
Sally's daddy stopped all my fun
And we got married in possum hollar

I'm dreaming tonight of the mountains that's where I long to roam
The roosters crow at the break of day in my Dixie home sweet home
Old people here they just don't care I never saw the beat
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me
I'm going back to my old home in the mountains far away
Where the wild red roses smell so sweet and the rippling waters play
Old people here they just don't care...
This city life is not for me I'm going where the neighbors speak
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me
Old people here they just don't care...
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me

And I hate to admit it but that last footprint's mine
She was crying when I met her, she cries harder today
So don't blame her life turned her that way

About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
Cause all I have to offer you is me

There'll be no mansion waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers
And there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see
All I have to offer you is me

Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can
But be sure that's what you want while you're still free

About the things that make me happy
I wanta sing
About my brother and my mother and my sister and my pappy

I wanta sing
About the things that make me happy
But most of all
I wanta sing about you

I picked up my first guitar when I was just eleven
Listened to them grand old opry shows
Well, I cut my teeth on gospel songs and good old country fair
My favorites then were Acuff and Bill Monroe

What a beautiful thought I am thinkin'
Concerning that great speckled bird
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
They were the sweetest songs I ever heard

I wanta sing about
The thing that make me happy
I wanta sing about
My brother and my mother and my sister and my pappy

I wanta sing about
The thing that make me happy
But most of all
I wanta sing about you

I travel all over the world singing good old country music
It makes me feel so good to hear them cheer
Some like for me to sing the hits I do on the Grand Ole Opry
And after all that's why were really here

Well, my favorite songs that are sung today
Are like Rivelle and Williams
Boy, oh boy, they really were the best
And when they sang their songs
People laughed and cried by millions
And here's the ones today they all request

Always late with your kisses
But your cheating heart will tell on you
I love you, I'll prove it a thousand ways
And that's why I got the lovesick blues

I wanta sing about
The thing that make me happy
I wanta sing about
My brother and my mother and my sister and my pappy

But most of all
I wanta sing about you

Or if it be one hundred years

And in your mind you never doubted that I would

Copyright 1971

The wind blows Sunday papers by my feet
As I walk down this cold and lonely street
My hands searched through my pockets for a dime
While the memory of you eats away my mind

Looking back I see that I was wrong
But the road I'm on don't lead me back to home
And I can't turn back 'cause everything is gone
Yes it's gone
And right won't touch a hand that's filled with wrong

I was filled with so much jealousy
And doubted all the love you had for me
But now I see the kind of fool I've been
I'll never see the one I love again

Looking back I see that I was wrong
But the road I'm on don't lead me back to home
And I can't turn back 'cause everything is gone
Yes it's gone
And right won't touch a hand that's filled with wrong

Perhaps the sun will go down between my house and town.

Home became a prison

Oh, I'd give the world if I could change the things
That made her climb that wall

George Jones,"Don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine

Well I recall the first time that I flirted with you dear
When I jokingly said come and be my bride
Now that time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth
That I have you dear forever by my side

Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me I've been hurt in love before
Only God can know and time alone will tell
But in the mean time I'll keep loving you with all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will

Just like last time when the feathers flew
You're runnin' wild kickin' up your heels

Lord, I can't live without you and you know it's true
But there's no livin' with you so what'll I do
I'm goin' honky tonkin', get as tight as I can
And maybe by then you'll 'preciate a good man

You'd better pay attention, don't you dare forget
Cause I'm just a little bitty puppy yet
Well, I caught you honky tonkin' with my best friend
The thing to do was leave you, but I should'a left then
Now I'm too old to leave you, but I still get sore
When you come home a-feelin' for the knob on the door
Tell me why baby, why baby, why baby why
You make me cry baby, cry baby, cry baby

George Jones,"Well you can find me servin' drinks inside a honky tonk
And I'll even play the jukebox on your dime
And sometimes I will dance with you to your favorite song
Yeah but she'll be mine after closin' time
She will smile at all the men and shake her pretty hips
And you can yell and say she look so fine
But I'm not looking for a man I'm looking for their tips
And then she'll be mine after closin' time
When they turn the lights out that's when I'll turn him on
Oh she can serve me love much better than wine
So when they close the doors I guess who takes me home
And she'll be mine after closin' time

Tomorrow night I'll still be there inside the honky tonk
And I'll still play the jukebox on your dime

When they turn the lights out...
And she'll be mine after closin' time",After Closing Time

George Jones,"Imagine a world where no music was playing
Then think of a church with nobody praying
If you ever looked up at a sky with no blue
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing
If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two
Then you've seen a picture of me without you",A Picture of Me Without You
George Jones,"Has it been a year since the last time I've seen her my God I could swear it was ten
And the ocean of liquor I drank to forget her is gonna kill me but I'll drink till then

And I got a long way to go still doin' time
Still doin' time in a honky tonk prison still doin' time where a man ain't forgiven

Don't think I can work but I'll try
The car's in the shop, so I thumbed all the way
Oh, these days I barely get by

I walked home from work and it rained all the way
My wife left and didn't say why
She laid all her bills on the desk in the hall
Oh, these days I barely get by

Put my only two dollars on my favorite horse
He lost by a nose and I cried
Oh, my boss says, ""Come winter, we'll all be laid off""
Oh, these days I barely get by

I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool that's blind and just can't see oh lonesome me

Well I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
A flirtin' with the boys with all of her charms
Yeah but I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Oh, if I could take a fist a twist it into liquid form
And mix it with the way I melt there in your arms
Sprinkle and a twinkle or two from your eyes
And a dab of this feeling inside

George Jones,"I'm so glad to have you back within these arms of mine
I can finally close my eyes and get some rest
Never once did I think of finding someone new
'Cause there's nothing better once you've had the best

You're the very thing they sing about in love songs
And one mistake don't mean you've failed the test
And as you lay beside me softly sleeping, this I know
There's nothing better once you've had the best

Within your arms I've had the best and I think the world should know
I don't care what you've said or done I'll always love you so
You've got more love in your little finger than all the rest
And there's nothing better once you've had the best

I should have known

So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand

But the words we're hiding from him now
Tears the heart right out of me.

Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away

Or his fifth birthday
And he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play

And turn my head when I speak

George Jones,"Well, I've had a splittin' headache from my eyebrows to my backbone
Arthritis, appendicitis, Bright's disease and gall stones
Bleedin' ulcers, ingrown toe nails, swollen adenoids
The Asian flu a time or two and inflamed vocal chords
I've had a toothache so severe my jawbone split in two
But nothing's ever hurt me half as bad as losing you

Well, I've had the lit end of a cigar pressed against my belly
Whupped upon with a crowbar till my eyeball turned to jelly
Accidentally nailed my index finger to the wall
Cut off half my toes and soaked my foot in alcohol
Well I've had my pelvis ruptured by an angry kangaroo
But nothing's ever hurt me half as bad as losing you

Well, it's not because you measure fifty, twenty, forty-four
It's surely not because you own a chain of liquor stores
It's not because your daddy is the richest man in town
It's just that I've grown used to you and having you around

I've had my parents tell me son we don't love you at all
I've seen my sister's name written on a washroom wall
My best friend set my barn on fire and burned my horse to death
I went out with a girl who told me, ""George you've got bad breath""
Last week I drew a crowd when I went to the city zoo
But nothing's ever hurt me half as bad as losing you

Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world, the Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rock, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love

Right now I'm like a wounded bird hungry for the sky
But if I try my wings and try long enough I'm bound to learn to fly
So I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right
My door to love has opened up more times than in
I'm either fool or wise enough to open it again

Cause I'll never know what's beyond that mountain till I reach the other side

George Jones,"Oh Lord, you know that I'm not one to bother you with little things
And you and I have never been too close
But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched you with doin' things
And tried to understand you more than most

No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought you knew in my own way I worshiped you
While even your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way you go about the things you do

I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die, you could have saved

But I believe that in your eyes this little child was something special 
And you wanted it to be with you, no doubt
So with out-stretched arms you beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way you worked it out

Once I saw a young man growin' till he neared the age of knowing
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marveled at your way of bein' kind

They tried everything in vain and I was there when they explained it 
To the family, how he slipped into a trance
Guess you looked into the future, watched him turn his back upon you
Lovin' him so much you couldn't take the chance

It took a lot of love to die, for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why you've never given up on me
You understood when some denied you and even when they crucified you

That look that's in your eyes pulls me apart
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart.

Your kiss is like a drink, oh, when I'm thirsty
Oh, and I'm thirsty for you with all my heart
But don't love me then act as though we've never kissed
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart.

Don't give me something, oh, that you might take away
To have you then lose you it wouldn't be smart on my part
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart.

No, don't give me something, Lord, that you might take away
To have you then lose you it wouldn't be smart on my part

And the trumpet of the Lord shall sound

He came back home crazy and asking, ""What for?""
They had him committed oh, medals and all
To a mental hospital with rubber walls

They cut off the funding oh, they cut off the lights
He hit the street runnin' that cold winter night
Now the streets are the only place he can call home
He seems, oh so lonely, but he's never alone

He lies there holding his Wild Irish Rose
This crazy old fool in the smelly old clothes
He could have had something much better, God knows
Than a half-empty bottle of Wild Irish Rose

A baby named Scarlet with laughing blue eyes
Has been in his wallet, ah way back since '65
So much was forgotten, oh so far back in time
Way down in the bottom of a river of wine

You know, they found him at Clark street, West 25th
They can't even find a heartbeat Lord, his fingers are stiff
Just like they're all frozen, he's holding her tight
But the habit, oh, it's broken, this is Roses' last night

But his soul's in a place where a real hero goes
Now he's got something better much better, God knows

In your eyes there's a love light
That shines for him
But how long will it stay there
Will that love light grow dim

You can just see the happiness
You can't see the tears
It's true, 'cause you're living
In your tender years

So if I can't be your first love
I'll wait and be your last
I'll be somewhere in your future
To help you forget the past

And you'll know that I love you
With a love that's sincere
For I'll wait 'til you're through living
In your tender years

I'll tell you about her for you ought to know

And make sure she dresses just right
You comb her hair every mornin'
And put her to bed every night

I stammer and I walk right into doors
And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak

But I know all about you,
I've come to talk to you tonight,
About the things I've seen you do.

I've come to set the record straight,
I've come to shine the light on you,
Let me introduce myself,
I am the cold hard truth.

There is a woman we both know,
I think you know the one I mean,
She gave her heart and soul to you,
You gave her only broken dreams.

You say you're not the one to blame,
For all the heartaches she's been through,
I say you're nothin' but a liar,
And I'm the cold hard truth.

All your life that's how it's been,
Looking out for number one,
Taking more than you leave,
Moving on when your done.

With her you could have had it all,
A family and lots of laughs,
If you had any sense at all,
You'd go and beg her to come back.

You think that you're a real man,
But you're nothing but a fool,
The way you run away from love,
The way you try to play it cool.

I gonna say this just one time,
Time is running out on you,
You best remember me my friend,
I am the cold hard truth.

You best remember me my friend,
I am the cold hard truth","Cold, Cold Heart"

And in my sleep the teardrops filled my eyes

And when I touched your arm early in the darkness
I knew that I had cried myself awake.

If you should ever take your love from me
To lose you would be more than I could take

He staggers all around
I heard his scream and saw the car
That knocked him to the ground.

A silver haired old lady rushed to him
And raised his head
He must have thought she was his mama
Cause these words he said

Mama (mama) my wife has gone and left me
Mama (mama) she left with my best friend
Oh, mama (mama) I was coming home to tell you
So mama take me home and help me live and love again.

I wanted so to help him but I was to ashamed
He rolled his head from side to side and struggled for life

Where I learned about salvation from the book of revelations
In an arbor by the side of the road

Where a sinner could lay down his heavy load
It was in those old brush arbors troubled souls found peaceful harbors

Many times I have departed from the way of life I started
In an arbor by the side of the road
But each time the devil's caught me I remembered what they taught me

George Jones,"It was a long time ago, no shoes on my feet
I walked ten miles of train track to hear Hank Williams sing
His body was worn but his spirit was free
And he sang every song looking right straight at me

I'm just a tramp on the street
Hank, you must understand
You've got my soul at your feet
Oh, and my heart in your hand.

Now, I don't have to think and I don't have to cheat
Oh, I don't have to win and I don't want to lose
If I make any hay I'd just float away
I don;'t count on tomorrow I just live for today.

Sir, I'm a tramp on your street
And you must understand
You've got my soul at your feet
And my heart in your hand.

Hank, you opened your heart
And you let me inside
And made a stray dog like me 
Feel welcome tonight.

George Jones,"My fingers tremble as I slowly touch the phone
I dial your number not knowing if your own
It rings you answer with sweet hello
My heart beats loudly as the teardrops start to flow.

I bite my lip until the blood runs free
And keep the words I love you hidden deep deep inside of me
I hang up wrong number I hear you tell your friend
But I just had to hear you talkin' once again.

And divisible was the word for you and me
But just one word in a just one moment will change happiness into misery
You hang up again and I know what you will say
Wrong number, that's the second time today.

And the voice I hear falling on my ear the son of God discloses
And he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own

Sometimes my path grows drear without a ray of cheer
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the day
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies

She couldn't read the music, just the words
But when she'd stand to sing on Sunday mornin'
She had the sweetest voice I think I've, I've ever heard.

She loved to sing the songs about our Savior
""There is a Fountain"", was her favorite one
And I've seen tears roll down the cheeks of sinners
By the time my mama's song was done.

When mama sang the angels stopped to listen
You could see the love light shinin' in her face
When mama sang the angels stopped to listen
Now in heaven's choir she has a special place.

You know my daddy wanted me to sing a song
The day that mama left us
And you know that little church
Was filled with all of mama's friends
And you know it seems we could all hear mama singin'

There is a friend who walks with me

You help me do the best I can
For I need Thy light to guide me day and night

For I need Thee every hour
Through this pilgrim land
Protect me by Thy power

O Lord, look down on me
When I kneel in prayer
I hope to meet You there

Let me travel in the light divine
That I may see the blessed way
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing 'Redemption's Song' some day

I will be a soldier brave and true
And ever firmly take a stand
As I onward go and daily meet the foe

Jesus, hold my hand
'Cause I need Thee every hour

'Bout what's right or what's wrong.
It's too hot to fish, and too hot for golf,
And too cold at home.

George Jones,"Well, I've a-come here to tell you folks, I'm ragged but I'm right
I'm a tramp and a rounder, I stay out late at night
A porterhouse steak three times a day for my board
That's more than any loafer in this mid-town can afford.

Well, a big electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy to play 'round daddy's feet
I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler and I lead every life
Cause I tell you folks, I'm ragged but I'm right.

Now, when I got married, I knew I'd settle down
And built a little love nest right here in my hometown
So now I've got a family, one that I'm proud of
I know that I'll be happy, 'cause they're the ones I love.

George Jones,"I know that someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody else
You'll expect me to be true and to keep on loving you
Though I'm feeling blue
You'd think I can't forget you.

Until someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm strong for somebody new
And though you don't want me now
I'll get along somehow
And then I won't, won't want you.

George Jones,"He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by 
She still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then 
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single I love you

I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

[Chorus]
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

(Spoken)
You know she came to see him one last time
Oh and we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good

George Jones,"HEARTS IN MY DREAM
Writers George Jones, Roger Miller

I dreamed that all the hearts I've broken came to visit me
And in my sleep they came to pay me for their misery
They were all so torn and shattered, Oh such tales of woe
It was I who caused them all and my conscience hurts me so
Hearts in my dream
Each one of them true
Each one loved me so
Each one I broke in two
My younger days were wild and reckless
Just love 'em and let 'em be
Those days are gone although it took a dream to make me see
Hearts in my dream

And no luck, it's true
But I always get lucky with you

But I always get lucky with you
I keep two strikes against me

And the way she's always loves me, she's got that down perfect too
I keep asking myself, what is it the lady can't do?

She brightens any room she walks inside
And the way she comes in smiling you'd never think she ever cries
She still looks as young and pretty as she did the day we met
If there is one thing bad about her, I ain't found it yet

George Jones,"WHAT'S IN OUR HEARTS
(George Jones â?? Country Johnny Mathis)
Â« Â© '63 Glad Music Â»
WITH MELBA MONTGOMERY

Everybody tells me you're a cheater
Yes and everybody says you cheated too
Should we believe them and let them tear our love apart
Or should we believe what's in our hearts
I believe in my heart the one I love is true
And I'd never take a chance on losing you
Side by side hand in hand we'll never be apart
Just as long as we believe what's in our hearts
Only your two lips could make me happy
And I'm sure you know I feel the same way too
Together we will share a tender love no one can part
Just as long as we believe what's in our hearts
I believe in my heart the one I love is true...



",What's in Our Hearts
George Jones,"Where did the sunshine go, why is it raining so
Where is the love I used to know, where did the sunshine go.
Where did the sunshine go, why do the cold winds blow
Where is the one I needed so, where did the sunshine go?

I discovered the sunshine in a woman's loving smile
Like a fool I thought the sun had come to stay
Then she fell for another and the sun went out of style
And the springtime vanished when I went away.

Where did the sunshine go, why is it raining so
Where is the love I used to know, where did the sunshine go.
Where did the sunshine go, why do the cold winds blow
Where is the one I needed so, where did the sunshine go?

Now there's mothing but heartaches in the whole wide lonely earth
Anyway my blue world looks that way to me
Gone is all of the sunshine and the smile that gave it birth
Leaving nothing but a cold cold misery.

Where did the sunshine go, why is it raining so
Where is the love I used to know, where did the sunshine go.
Where did the sunshine go, why do the cold winds blow
Where is the one I needed so, where did the sunshine go?...

I gave up my home to see you satisfied;
I just called to let you know where I'll be living,
It's not much but I feel welcome here, inside.

I've got swinging doors, a jukebox and a bar stool,
My new home has a flashing neon sign;
Stop by and see me anytime you want to,
'Cause, I'm always here, at home, 'til closing time.

I've got everything it takes to drive me crazy,
And I've got everything it takes to lose my mind;
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches,
Thanks to you I'm always here, 'til closing time.

In a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
An old upright piano plays that old familiar tune

Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, ""With this ring, I thee wed.""

[Chorus]

Ooo-ooo

In a small two room apartment 
As they fought their final round
He says, ""You won't admit it,
But I know you're leavin' town.""

She says, ""One thing's for certain,
I don't love you any more.""
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door

[Chorus]

In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
There on display,
Golden ring.",Golden Ring [Version]

Near you

It's like heaven to be
Near you

Times when we're apart
And I can't face my heart

Say you'll never stay
More than just two lips away

If my hours could be spent
Near you

I'd be more than content
Near you

Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days

George Jones,"I just love that good old gospel singing
'I'll Fly Away' is my favorite song
I just love that good old time religion
This old world has gone without it much too long

Oh, how I love to sing and tell
When they ring those golden bells
And I just can't stand in one place
When they sing 'Amazing Grace'

I just love that good old country preaching
This old world has gone without it much too long

Yes, I love them good old fashioned gathering
Where all of God's children came to pray
And oh, how I really miss those old brush arbors
How I wish we had more of these days today

Oh, how I love to sing and tell",Old Fashioned Singing [Version]

A thousand miles from the nearest sea
The very moment I saw your smile
It would be like heaven to me

There's not any mountain to rugged to climb
No desert too barren to cross
Darlin', if you would just show a sign
Of love, I could bear with all loss

Take me to Siberia
And the coldest weather of the winter time

How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?

So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Can't have no lovin' like a huggin'
And a kissin' in a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further
Closer than a country mile

So why don't you spark me like you used to do
And say sweet nothings like we used to do?
I'm the same old trouble you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Well, why don't you be just like you used to be?
How come you find so many faults with me?
Somebody's changed, so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Can't have no lovin' like a huggin'
And a kissin' in a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further
Closer than a country mile

So why don't you say the things you used to say?
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

George Lake Big Band,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
George Lam,"Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I've found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue

George Lam,"Before I leave let me tell you why I'm going
And try to speak in such a way that you won't be afraid of listening
Too many words been spoke without no understanding
And I'd hate to add another wound to the times we had good loving.

But oh when I think of the tall pine trees growing
The silver mists of snow all around me blowing.
I'll miss the gentle times and the fireplace a'warming
Perhaps I'll turn my head away to hide the tears a'falling.

Some say I have dishonored you through foolishness and folly
The question not in where that lies but if you're standing by me.
I do not need to hear the words to know your truthful answer
Your eyes that once were home to me now tell me I'm a stranger.

But oh when I think of the tall pine trees growing
The silver mists of snow all around me blowing.
I'll miss the gentle times and the fireplace a'warming
Perhaps I'll turn my head away to hide the tears a'falling.

I'm bound to be a wanderer, I'll never take another
I'll catch a merchant ship tonight and sail to foreign waters
I'll judge no man for what he's done and no man will I bother
And I hope to find some peace again and cleanse my soul of anger

But oh when I think of the tall pine trees growing
The silver mists of snow all around me blowing.
I'll miss the gentle times and the fireplace a'warming
Perhaps I'll turn my head away to hide the tears a'falling.",Wo Yao Zou Tian Ai

How could you be so cruel 
You treat me like a fool 
After all I did for you 
You cut me like a blade

Now I don't know what to do 
I thought that when you gave me love 
My life would start to change 
Instead I saw that I was wrong

You just put my love aside 
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie 

You never wanted to start

You never played the game to smart 
Cause you know your bad

Have got me this other day 
Just tell me what, I need to hear you say 
I want to play those games I used to play 
Baby can't you see, just what you do to me 
It's hard enough to find a love that's true 
How heaven knows girl I wanted to be with you 
Other times I've left it up to you 
Just open up your heart, and girl just turn the key

That your here, its just you and me 
Just like it always was 
But then I'm left to see that it was only a memory

Wishing that you weren't on my mind 
Remembering how each and every time 
We used to say I love you, remember 
I wish you remembered the morning so bright 
And I knew in my heart 
Nothing could ever make our love fall apart 
And now the thought of losing you 
Because of words spoken so untrue 
If I could turn back the hands of time 
I would make no mistake to redeem our love

A minute to look into my eyes

Because of words spoken so untrue 
If I could turn back the hands of time

So sweet, cool and so fair

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.

Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

From Florida to the North Pole.
The fact is, their name would be mud,

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner,

If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell
George Masso,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

We're gonna drain the cup dry

You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place

George Masso,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

Is the candle worth the flame?

So before it's too late, 
Change your ways and repent,

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Love came, planning to stay

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

""Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
Did momma give me hell?
Did I get a thrill?
Am I full of quiver?
Was he rough?
Did I care?
Am I glad I fell?
Every time I think of him do I shiver?
Was he hot?
And was I?
And would he stand for maybe?
He would not?
Did I lie?
Does he still think I'm a baby?
If I was, am I still?
Do I care?
Don't be silly
Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
And did momma give me hell?

Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
Did momma give me hell?
With his hands loose as no refusin'
Did he fight?
Was I blue?

And I don't know yet the system he was usin'

Well I said, stop, please, behave!
Well what's the use of breathin'?
He said, give
So I gave

With a gun that he polished for a rainy day
A smile and a quote from a vigilante movie
Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away
He said it made him crazy
Twenty five years living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep
She needs her mother but her mother is dead
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget
Just another hooker
It happens everyday
She loved her little baby
But she couldn't bare to see her living
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

I believe in the gods of America
I believe in the land of the free
But no one told me
(No one told me)
That the gods believe in nothing
So with empty hands I pray
And from day to hopeless day
They still don't see me
(See me)

Everybody talks about the new generation
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation
Like to help you buddy, but I haven't got the time
Somebody shouted save me
And everybody started living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

There's a big white lady
On a big white doorstep
She asked her daddy and her daddy said 'yes'
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get
Has to give a little
They say it's for the best
Somebody shouted
Maybe
But they kept on living from hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

So she ran to the arms of America
And she kissed the powers that be
And someone told me
(Someone told me)
That the gods believe in nothing
So with empty hands I pray
And I tell myself
One day
They just might see me",Hand to Mouth

George Michael,"I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me
Say you love me
But if you don't just let me go

'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

And teacher
There are things
That I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher
There are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh so I don't want to learn
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try

I'm so cold

Maybe just one  more try",One More Try
George Michael,"Jimmy Got Nothing made himself a name
With a gun that he polished for a rainy day
A smile and a quote from a vigilante movie
Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away

He said it made him crazy
Twenty-five years living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep
She needs her mother but her mother is dead
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget
Just another hooker, it happens everyday

She loved her little baby
But she couldn't bear to see her living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

I believe in the gods of America
I believe in the land of the free
But no one told me
That the gods believe in nothing

So with empty hands I pray
And from day to hopeless day
They still don't see me

Everybody talks about the new generation
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation
Like to help you buddy but I haven't got the time

Somebody shouted, ""Save me""
But everybody started living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

There's a big white lady on a big white doorstep
She asked her daddy and her daddy said, ""Yes""
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get
Has to give a little, they say it's for the best

Somebody shouted, ""Maybe""
But they kept on living from hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

So she ran to the arms of America
And she kissed the powers that be
And someone told me
That the Gods believe in nothing

So with empty hands I pray
And I tell myself one day
They just might see me
They just might see me",Hand to Mouth [Remastered]

Look to the sky's above
I am in the hands of fate
Push till it gets to shove

You hang around with people who are sure to make you cry
I can make you happy if only for a while

I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires

Keep on picking it up
So you can watch it come down

Sleep with me tonight","A Last Request (I Want Your Sex, Pt. 3)"
George Michael,"It's late, time for bed
So we sit, and I wait
For that gin and tonic
To go to your head

I know it's a devious plan
But it's the only way that I know
To get those big bad car keys
Out of your hand

You know that I remain a gentle man
But even so there's only so much a gentleman can stand
Sleep with me
Oh, sleep with me tonight

My cards are on your table
My dreams are in your bed
If I was able, I'd be there instead
Oh oh, sleep with me tonight
",A Last Request
George Michael,"I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now 
I've got to live",Freedom [Album Version]
George Michael,"That's all I wanted
Something special, something sacred
In your eyes
For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
Maybe this time is forever
Say it can be, whoh

That's all you wanted
Something special, someone sacred
In your life
Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side

Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
But something tells me together
We'd be happy, oh oh

(Baby)
I will be your father figure
(Oh baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine
(I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher
(Be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind
(It would make me)
I will be your father figure
(Very happy)
I have had enough of crime
(Please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time

That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's
Blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover
Understands me
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be
Strong, baby

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time

If you are the desert
I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger
Hunger for me
Whatever you ask for
That's what I'll be

So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling
Don't think of me

Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes, baby,
And love can't lie, no
(Greet me with the eyes of a child)
My love is always tellin' me so
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on, hold on
I won't let you go, my baby

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind, baby
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
(So I am gonna love you)
'Til the end of time
I will be your father
I will be your preacher
I will be your daddy, whoa
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time",Father Figure [MTV Unplugged]

To make those pretty eyes look so blue

He must have known
That he could
That you'd never leave him
Now you can't see my love is good
And that I'm not him

Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more
Someone who will protect you
Love and respect you

Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
And I can't make you love me
If you don't

I'll close my eyes and then I won't see
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then, to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

And I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
And here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I'll feel the power

George Michael,"Take my life
Time has been twisting the knife
I don't recognize
People I care for

Take my dreams
Childish and weak at the seams
Please don't analyze
Please just be there for me

The things that I know
Nobody told me
The seeds that are sown
They still control me

There's a liar in my head
There's a thief upon my bed
And the strangest thing
Is I cannot get my eyes open

Take my hand
Lead me to some peaceful land
That I cannot find
Inside my head

Wake me, with love
It's all I need
But in all this time
Still no one said

If I had not asked
Would you have told me
If you call this love
Why don't you hold me?

There's a liar in my head
There's a thief upon my bed
And the strangest thing
Is I cannot get my eyes open

Give me something I can hold
Give me something to believe in
I am frightened for my soul, please, please

George Michael,"She takes the back road and the lane
Past the school that has not changed
In all this time 
She thinks of when the boy was young
All the battles she had won
Just to give him life

That man
She loved that man
For all his life
But now we meet to take him flowers
And only god knows why

For what's the use in pressing palms 
When children fade in mother's arms
It's a cruel world, we've so much to lose
And what we have to learn, we rarely choose

So if it's god who took her son
He cannot be the one living in her mind

Take care my love, she said
Don't think that god is dead
Take care my love, she said

You have been loved

If I was weak, forgive me
But I was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
The kind that makes devils cry

So these days
My life has changed
And I'll be fine (and I'll be fine)
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime

So what's the use in pressing palms 
If you won't keep such love from harm
It's a cruel world, you've so much to prove
And heaven help the ones who wait for you

No, I've no daughters, I've no sons
Guess I'm the only one
Living in my life

He's a soldier waiting for war
Time will come
He'll hold a gun
His father's son

And as he grows
He hears the band
Takes the step from boy to man
And at the shore she waves her son goodbye
Like the man she did before

Mother's pride
Just a boy
His country's eyes
He's a soldier waving at the shore
And in her heart the time has come

They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well, maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say, ""What's mine is mine and not yours""
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for

I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 
Without despair we will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end 
And with the strength we have won't be erased 
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you 
Will echo in your mind 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
God surely answered my prayer
God surely answered by prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
God always will answer your prayers
Believe in one who will answer my prayer
Thank you God

That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died

Never heard nothing but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth

And when he died
All he left us was alone""

That papa never worked aday in his life
Some bad talk going around sayin'
Papa had three outside children
And another wife

Preachin'
Talkin' about saving souls and all the time
Leachin'
And dealing in dirt
Stealin' in the name of the Lord

But mama she just said

Say I heard my papa was a jack of all trades
Is that what papa sent to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow or steal just
To pay his bills
Hey, mama, folks say papa was never much in thinkin'
Spent most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'

I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know ?
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were young
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been - just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame ?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
Better sit back and go - with the flow
'Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find - no change
Those were the days of our lives yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you
I still love you",These Are the Days of Our Lives [Live]

Won't you help me

But like all good men who swim too well
It takes all that I have just to cry for help
Then that voice in my head tells me no

I'm going down 
Won't you help me
Save me from myself
I hear the sound of the memory
Maybe, who can tell ?

Let me live my life beside the river
Take me to places where a child can grow
And then maybe the boy inside will forsake me
Maybe the child in me will just let me go

But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show

They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

Why tell me you don't understand when you do

I tell myself I feel no pain

When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

Or no one tried 
You smiled at me

You saved my soul 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

And what have I learned 
From all these tears 
I've waited for you all those years 
And just when it began 
He took you away 

But I still say 
When you find love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed

I'll make it for two

Has become a part of me

I think of all the days and nights I spent crying
And I move on

I've been in and out of favor with love
Because I gotta tell you
I've been things I never wanted to be
And then some angel called me up
He told me I was sleeping
Said ""don't waste time 'cause even angels say goodbye""

Waiting for that change of season
Oh the winter's been so long
Searching for that rhyme or reason
You've just got to

And oh, there goes another season
Getting hard to find a decent sonng to play
But oh, I guess I got my reasons
Everybody thinks I'm doing a.o.k
They ought to know by now

I'm gonna be luck in love someday",Move On

I will not live in fear

Well, show me you can take you've got some giving to do.
And now you tell me that you're having my baby,
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
One step further and my back will break,

Than how can it be good enough for two?
I can't work any harder than I do

Why do I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew.

I don't even think that I love you,
Won't you tell me,
Tell me, tell me, tell me

How could you settle for a boy like me,
When all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign,
And the things we buy,
Ain't gonna keep us together,
It's just a matter of time.

My situation,
Never changes.
Walking in that manner through that door,

But the wages,
I give you all you say you want is love

And the things we buy,

Watch it count down to the end of the day

Star people
Never forget your secrets safe with me
Just look at all the wonderful people
Trying to forget just who and what they have been

Oh, it's a dream
With a nightmare stuck in the middle
Are you serious? I'm just curious
Without all this attention
You'd die
I'd die
We'd die (Wouldn't we baby)

And if I live to be a hundred and one
I will never understand what you are

And they don't really seem to mind

DJ (Get yourself some Oprah cash)
Is that what makes a star?

Did you get off on a bad foot, baby
Do you have a little tale to tell
Did you get off on a bad foot, bad, bad foot?
Is that why you're a star?

Do you really think you've got it so hard?
Do you think it might do you some good to look around you
And decide how you might feel
If the pain you felt was real
Tell me

Now nothing comes for nothing, baby
That fame and fortune's heaven sent
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling

You can pay",Star People '97
George Michael,"So every day I see you in some other face
They crack a smile, talk a while
Try to take your place
My memory serves me far too well

I just sit here on this mountain thinking to myself
You're a fool boy
Why don't you go down
Find somebody
Find somebody else
My memory serves me far too well

It's not as though we just broke up
It's not as though it was yesterday, yeah
But something I just can't explain
Something in me needs this pain
I know I'll never see your face again

C'mon now
I've got to be strong now

Now everybody's talking about this new decade
Like you say the magic numbers
Then just say goodbye to the stupid mistakes you made
Oh my memory serves me far too well

Don't you know that
The years will come and go
Some of us will change our lives
Some of us still have nothing to show
Nothing, baby (nothing, baby)
But memories (but memories)

And if these wounds
They are self-inflicted
I don't really know
How my poor heart could have protected me
But if I have to carry this pain
If you will not share the blame
I deserve to see your face again

C'mon now
You don't have to be so strong now
Come back, come back, come back, come back
Come back, come back, come back, come back

Oh, come back to me darling
I will make it worth your while
Come back to your baby
I miss your kiss
I miss your smile
Seems to me the peace I search to find
Ain't going to be mine until you say you will
Don't you keep me waiting for that day
I know, I know, I know you hear these words that I say

I know, I know, I know 
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want, oh",Waiting for That Day
George Michael,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As
George Michael,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend

George Michael,"I'd say love was a magical thing
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there
Had I been there
I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare
No, I don't dare

'Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared
I'm so scared

Take me back in time, maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care?

Oh, I don't understand it for you it's a breeze
Little by little, you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care?

No, I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love

And if all that there is
Is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear",A Different Corner

George Michael,"The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
I've seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way

Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road

George Michael,"I was mixed up when you came to me
Too broke to fix said 'daddy you gone, I'm missing my baby'
Still missing my baby

I was stitched up by the hands of fate
Said how you gonna make it on your own if luck is a lady?
Maybe luck is a lady

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away

Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun 
I never thought that my savior would come
I think it's amazing
I think it's amazing

I think you're amazing

You tried to save me from myself
Said 'darling, kiss as many as you want!
My love's still available
And I now you're insatiable'

We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom
And your mom, was always acting crazy

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I though that loving you was out of the 

Question
Then I say my reflection
Saying please don't let this go

Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun 
I never thought that my savior would come
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

Celebrate the love of the one you're with

Celebrate, this life with you baby
I think you should celebrate yeah
Don't put your love in chains baby
No no, walk in the midday sun
I thought I was dreaming
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

And the devil inside
Tells you to give up",Amazing
George Michael,"Bless the day you came into my life, I still remember
Horny cowboy with your stars and stripes
Bringing the light into my day
With that Texan smile

Too afraid to love, to hope that you would stay
So broken that I never saw you chase the past away

My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night
Takes away that fear that I carried forever
You stopped to wipe away my tears
And you stayed forever and more

(I don't think that I)

Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December
All alone I watched the eagles fly
Even the light seemed to have changed
In the Californian sky

Through all of those battles then you came
Stepped out of the fading light
Said, ""Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again,
Because I'm here to save your life""

My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night
Takes away that fear that I carried forever
You stopped to wipe away my tears
But you stayed forever amore

And more, didn't you baby

Because I don't think that I could love and lose again
I don't think I have the strength
I don't think I have the strength

I don't think that I",American Angel

George Michael,"My mother had a brother
They say that I was born on the day that he died
Someone to cling to, she said
When all the noises and the shame came calling

My mother had a brother
I thought I knew them all, I thought I knew
But she lied
I said, ""Show me his face again, tell me again why he died""

She said he couldn't wait for the things that I've seen
She said he wasn't strong enough, he never dared to dream a life like mine

My mother had a brother
Over-sensitive and kind
Seems it all became too much for him.
It seems he took his own life
Mum, I can't imagine the joy and pain in equal measure
Tears in the dirt, and all over your newborn treasure

I guess he had to wait until my momma had me
I guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free
In endless sky

But mama will you tell him from your boy
The times they changed
I guess the world was getting warmer
And we got stronger
Mother will you tell him about my joy
I live each day for him
The sun came out, yeah, and I'm just breathing it in

My mother had a brother
Same desire, different time
Seems the empty spaces tortured him
Until he took his own life

I don't know why I waited so long for love
I just don't know what I was thinking of
All that wasted time

But mama will you tell him from your boy
The times they changed
I guess the world was getting warmer
While we got stronger
Mother will you tell him about my joy
I live each day with him
Your son came out, yeah,
And I'm still breathing it in

And I swear now that freedom is here
I'm gonna taste it all for you boy
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn
I'm making so much love

So those of us who have nothing to fear
We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned
I'm making so much love

It's like a conversation, where no-one stops to breathe
Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table?
Such destruction, and pure white castles in the sand
No time for introduction
With all that money changing hands

And the satellite says, ""Take a look at all we have""
But the old man says,
""You want my family, for your liberty, I can't do that.""

Look into the eyes of any patient man
Whether they be amber, green or blue,
There's a piece of God staring back at you
But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves
They see our broken women
On imaginary shelves

Don't you want it?

Can't you see the things that you lack?""

From the stars to my home, down through the stone,
I could have been so alone,
Without my precious box
Have I a family? I guess not
I've never seen a lot of beauty
In my life.

Well in your house there are servants, and the lights all dim
Such a beautiful home, your agent's on the phone, they never
Leave you alone
The party never stops!
You say that's fantasy, I say ""So what, I need a little
Beauty""

So let me in,
You know you've kind of got under my skin
You know we never see a lot of the action round here
My dear
You may want to strip again

And you look so fine in your Gucci suit
And you're making more money than your daddy
Could have imagined
But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time

So take that picture, stop acting so dumb
Don't you know that the moment will come
I will find someone like you
But with something extra, I'm sorry baby
I don't know why
I don't know why that is

The systematic breakdown of my community
You know I hate my job, I try to save but God
There's just never enough
Switch on, the pressure, stops

And she's a little beauty

Give me your life, give me your life, I want it
Because lately, it's so freezing out here
(This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass)
In so many ways, but you make it good
Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could
(This side of the glass)

So take that picture, stop acting so dumb
Don't you know that the moment will come
I will find someone like you
But with something extra, I'm so sorry baby
I don't know why
I don't know why that is

Precious keeps me company
Keeps me from being alone

Because no-one comes in the morning
No-one comes in the evening time
I'd sit and wait for the phone to ring
I could be waiting my whole damn life

So sick of the same old faces
In this street, where nobody talks to me
And the funny side of the situation is
I don't care, I'll always be there

When you come down from the sky
And make yourself at home
In my house

Because these days it's the money the money
The money, honey, or your life
I said don't you know you can't have both

Stop acting so dumb
The moment will come
I will find someone like you
Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby
I don't know why (something)
Said I don't know why that is

You may want to strip again
You may want to let me in
You may want to sacrifice
More than you think is fair or right

You may want to think again
You may want to watch your friends
You may want to change your mind
You may wish you could turn back time.",Precious Box
George Michael,"My daddy got here on the gravy train
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game
They went walking and she took his name
Round here

There was dancing in the afternoons those days
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same

Frightened little girl, she makes a break
Into the arms of, something better
Round here

I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark
Waiting patiently to make my mark
Round here

And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool
I remember it all, like yesterday

Don't you

Every time I try to leave this place
Something inside says, ""You can do better""

So come with me, let me show you where I've lived
I want to put my hands in this earth again
Music fell like rain to the streets
The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space
Is the place of my birth

When all that I wanted, was to be someone.

Two little Hitlers in an old church hall
Some cheesy covers and those neighbors that banged on the walls
Andy says it's time to show them all
Round here

Please sir, we two have other plans
Please sir you would not understand,
What's going on
Is magical, can't you see
That some of us do more than dream

Every time I try to leave this place
Something inside says, ""Keep on keeping, on and on....""
Around here

In this town,
Yes I guess I got to be someone

In your eyes, I guess 
You heard me cry 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

I'm blessed 
I know 
Heaven sent 
And Heaven stole 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

And what have I learned 
From all this pain 
I thought I'd never feel the same 
About anyone 
Or anything again 

But now I know 
When you find your love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 

Sadness 
In my eyes 
No one guessed 
Or no one tried 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

Loveless and cold 
With your last breath 
You saved my soul 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

And what have I learned 
From all these tears 
I've waited for you all those years 
And just when it began 
He took you away 

But I still say 
When you find love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 

So the words you could not say 
I'll sing them for you 
And the love we would have made 
I'll make it for two 

For every single memory 
Has become a part of me 
You will always be 
My love 

Well, I've been loved 
So I know just what love is 
And the lover that I kissed 
Is always by my side

Broken lovelorn on your rocks.

I'm so tired of you America

Ain't gonna be alone

Say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
Oh wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me
Don't you know
You're life itself!

Like the leaf
Clings to the tree
Oh my darling cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind

George Michael,"She takes the back road and the lane
Past the school that has not changed
In all this time 
She thinks of when the boy was young
All the battles she had won
Just to give him life

That man
She loved that man
For all his life
But now we meet to take him flowers
And only god knows why

For what's the use in pressing palms 
When children fade in mother's arms
It's a cruel world, we've so much to lose
And what we have to learn, we rarely choose

So if it's god who took her son
He cannot be the one living in her mind

Take care my love, she said
Don't think that god is dead
Take care my love, she said

You have been loved

If I was weak, forgive me
But I was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
The kind that makes devils cry

So these days
My life has changed
And I'll be fine (and I'll be fine)
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime

So what's the use in pressing palms 
If you won't keep such love from harm
It's a cruel world, you've so much to prove
And heaven help the ones who wait for you

No, I've no daughters, I've no sons
Guess I'm the only one
Living in my life

Take care my love, he said
Don't think that God is dead
Take care my love, he said

You have been loved",You Have Been Loved [*]
George Michael,"You've changed
That sparkle in your eyes has gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart, you've changed

You've changed
Your kisses are now so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand you've changed

You've forgotten the word I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you ever cared

You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, you've changed

You've forgotten the word I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you ever cared

You're not the angle I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, you've changed

George Michael,"Kindness 
In your eyes, I guess 
You heard me cry 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

I'm blessed 
I know 
Heaven sent 
And Heaven stole 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

And what have I learned 
From all this pain 
I thought I'd never feel the same 
About anyone 
Or anything again 

But now I know 
When you find your love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 

Sadness 
In my eyes 
No one guessed 
Or no one tried 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

Loveless and cold 
With your last breath 
You saved my soul 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

And what have I learned 
From all these tears 
I've waited for you all those years 
And just when it began 
He took you away 

But I still say 
When you find love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 

So the words you could not say 
I'll sing them for you 
And the love we would have made 
I'll make it for two 

For every single memory 
Has become a part of me 
You will always be 
My love 

Well, I've been loved 
So I know just what love is 
And the lover that I kissed 
Is always by my side 

Oh, the lover I still miss 
Was Jesus to a child",Jesus to a Child [Instrumental]
George Mileson,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss

One, two, three, four

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really wanna go
And we'll walk in the sun
But till then tramps like us
Baby we were born to run

Oh honey, tramps like us
Baby we were born to run

There to greet a working man when his day is done

I'm gonna take them down to the Cadillac ranch

Rides just like a little bit of heaven here on earth
Well buddy when I die throw my body in the back
And drive me to the junkyard in my Cadillac

But that blood it never burned in her veins

And a style she's trying to maintain

You can tell her that I'm easily found
Tell her there's a spot out `neath Abraham's bridge, tell her 
There's a darkness on the edge of town

Well everybody's got a secret, son
Something that they just can't face
Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it
They carry it with them every step that they take

'Til some day they just cut it loose
Cut it loose or let it drag 'em down
Where no one asks any questions
Or looks too long in your face
In the darkness on the edge of town
In the darkness on the edge of town

Some folks are born into a good life
And other folks get it anyway anyhow
Yeah and I lost my money and I lost my wife
Them things don't seem to matter much to me now

Tonight I'll be on that hill `cause I can't stop
I'll be on that hill with everything I got
With our lives on the line where dreams are found and lost

I love to see the message of love
That the bluebird brings

When I see you with your man

I love to see your hair shining
In the long summer's light
I love to watch the stars fill the sky

The music plays you take his hand
I watch how you touch him as you start to dance

And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty
Now fill me with pain

I can't say that I'm sorry for the things that we done
At least for a little while sir, me and her we had us some fun

Now the jury brought in a guilty verdict and the judge he sentenced me to death

You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft, sweet, little girl's tongue
And Rosie, you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats
Little gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs, 'cause you know we ain't gonna come
I ain't here on business, baby, I'm only here for fun

Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bone Billy, they'll be coming up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school
Act real cool, stay out all night, it's gonna feel alright

Oh, closets are for hangers, winners use the door

And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room, I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't have any money
Oh, your papa says he knows that I don't have any money
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have any money
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And my machine, she's a dud, out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, 'cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California, down San Diego way
There's a little cafe, where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
So hold tight, baby, 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'

And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play

And they carried him off of his shoulders
But you there wasn't no one there to meet the preacher
And he looked into the heavens and said Lord did you forget me
And it seemed like the heavens broke open
And he said no son I didn't forget but you must remember you're not home yet

I told you I was like a bird a free and wild and restless thing
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly

I only know that I must go and nothing here must hold me back
I like the love you gave me and the tender way you scratched my back
I like your warm sweet kisses and the way you cook your ham and eggs
I like the way the suntan lotion softened up your lovely legs
I like the static noise I heard when you would sit and brush your hair
The way you gave yourself to me and never asked to go nowhere
But most of all I like the way you always smiled and never frowned
The way you took this chance for love and grasped me just for what I am

I told you I was like a bird

And now my darling as I leave I fight the yearning in my blood
To wake you up and love you just once more before I go for good
But somehow I am fighting back my passion for I cannot stay
And someday you'll look back and know best it ended up this way

I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo
George Nascimento,"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do,
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do,
The best that you can do is fall in love",Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)
George Nascimento,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Shoulda known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're, know you're not a fool

George Nascimento,"Tell him what you know thought you had me
But I let it go
And now I'm gonna take down the whole thing

Left out a little bit about yourself
And I found out from your best friend
I think its time that I filled him in
And now I'm gonna take down the whole thing
Everything is going down
With me


You know to much keep it to yourself
So much at stake but you don't give a damn
And now it's coming back on you
You keep on pushing baby can't you see
Always try but your never gonna get to me
I'll make sure this time

George Nascimento,"Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standing by

When ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

But I know a place where we can go
That's still untouched by man
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end

This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords

For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details

Since daddy had to lie
But I know a place where we can go
And was away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by

And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense

But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast

But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss

And let me take a long last look
Before we say good bye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me

Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence",The End of the Innocence
George Nascimento,"She packed my bags last night, preflight
Zero hour, nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high
As a kite by then

I miss the earth so much
I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Ah, no no no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse

Mars ain't the kind of place
To raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them

And all this science

George Nozuka,"Goodbye is what she said
When she said I'm sorry
And I, I'm dying on the inside
'cause I tried but I can't hide the tears
That fall from my eyes

Hold me close one more night
Hold me close one more time
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside
A butterfly

hello with a little wink 
But what she think of me 
And oh she smiled
Give me her name
But who would have thought I would be crying here
With all this pain no no


Hold me close one more night baby
Hold me close one more time (just give me one more time my baby)
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside
A butterfly

Now there's nothing I can do and
There's nothing I can say
About losing you
I wish that I could find a way, wish that I could see you again
If only I could turn back time

Hold me close one more night...
Hold me close one more time.. 
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside (dying on the inside)
A butterfly....

George Nozuka,"Can't Stop Loving You Lyrics
Artist: George Nozuka


Since you let me go
Every single day seems impossible
Just can't get you out of my mind
Everything I see brings back memories
Of you and me
Left me on my knees
Even though its been hell
I'm still begging please
And I really just wanna why

babe if you're home please pick up the phone
'cause I'm incomplete.. without you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you 
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up

I know you hate girl
And I know you're only doing this to
Hurt me, girl, and I'm dying inside
Tonight, I got no other choice, I need to hear your voice
To get goodbye,
If were meant to be just thought I should be happy
And I'm saying it straight from the phone
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
Guess it is what it is I..

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you (cant stop, can't can't stop)
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up loving you

there's are times I don't know what I'm suppose to do
'cause I don't like to be alone (don?t like to be alone)
Lookin at all the pictures that I have of you
I'm listening to sad love songs
Where will I go, what will I do
Who will I be if I can't be with you
Here I stand, half a man
And I'm givng my all in my hand

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you 
(cant loving you, can't stop loving you)
'cause I'm all torn up baby and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up loving you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you 
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up
Loving you, 
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
'cause I'm all torn up and I just can't give up 
(all torn up, can't give up)
(all torn up, can't give up)

George Nozuka,"In the middle of the night,
No one heard the boy
Who cried himself to sleep
Didn't care about himself 'cause he
Hurt too much, he was hurt too much
And the burden of the world was put
On a hurting child, hurting child
Who never smiled
The world was put on the hurting child,
Hurting child
I sing for the hurting child
I sing for the hurting child

In the middle of the fight
No one saw the girl who thought it
Was her fault, didn't know about her pain
Though it was right there
No one said they cared
And the burden of the world was put
On a hurting child, hurting child
Who never smiled
The world was put on the hurting child,
Hurting child
I sing for the hurting child

I sing for the children, dream for the children,
Cry for the children now
So I sing for the children, dream for the children,
Smile for the children now
Said the world was put
On a hurting child, hurting child
Who never smiled
The world was put on the hurting child,

I sing for the children, dream for the children,
Cry for the children now
So I sing for the children, dream for the children,
Smile for the children

George Nozuka,"I'll tell you all something man
This girl man
I used to love we was together
She left, She with this other guy
Its really blowing my mind right now
George man I gotta tell you about it

I was up in the VIP section
I've seen her with her girlfriends dancin'
With her tight blue jeans and stilettos on
I thought about our last convo on the telephone
And I said girl I'm going on a tour
I'll be gone for 4 months
So why don't we just break it on off for 4 months
She said boy if you leave you so nuts
'Cause Imma just move on
And you gonna be so crushed

Never thought I'd bump into you
With another guy under your arm
Now I know that I was a fool
Fool of my girl, fool of my girl
The whole time that you were with me
My friends said I did you wrong
And now it's easy to see
It just took too long

That was the last time
'Cause the last time
I said goodbye to you
(said goodbye to you)

You may scroll down and join the discussion
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
It was the last time

You keep on blocking my calls
So now I know how it feels
And it hurts
What goes around comes around
The pain is so real
I see you two so happy
Don't know what to do (Oh)
I'm lost without you (Nooo)

It was the last time
'Cause the last time (Ohhh)
Don't wanna say goodbye (say goodbye)
Don't wanna say goodbye to you

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time

Jeah, momma said
Boy she with a keeper
But now I understand
Why I'm sick with a fever
That's why I run around
With the models and divas
Drinkin' away the pain
With the henni and tequila
If I could take it all back I would
I'd take it back to the days
Where our love was all good
When I used to have you
On the bed, legs spread
Instead, I'm listening to the words you always said

On the real
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
How I feel
Don't you know that your the only one
Last time,
I took you for granted
When you were mine
Please forget about the last time
Let's talk

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more try
It was the last time

Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth
Last time
Don't let him take all my love
I know it was all my fault
Give me just one more truth

And drop the somethin' somethin' on me
Drop your pants if you feel right 
Because you know were going to rock through the whole night
Drop your pants if you feel right
Does it feel right

Gotta see this girl with your one two eyes
With her back up against the wall
Its the way she moves from side to side

Before the club we're hanging out until this girl walked in
Caught me by surprise when she didn't say hello
Had an attitude, why be so rude I know just what to do
Pulled the girl aside and politely gave my name
Told the girl don't act this way
I see right through your game
What he did was such a shame
Don't be living with his pain

So let it go tonight
I see the beauty within your eyes
So let it go tonight

I never thought that it would be me
How could I be such a fool, oh?
And here I am saying girl I'm sorry
For something I didn't do, this is my point of view
Baby I never meant to fall for her
Lately it's been driving me crazy
Baby, baby, you still and always will be my baby
Oh yeah

It's 4 o'clock in the morning and it didn't take too long
For the girl to change her tune and now she's singing a different song
She's all up on me, kissing on me, grinding on me

Baby I'm not that guy
I already got that someone in my life
Baby I'm not that guy

George Olsen,"Took my girl to the races
Gosh! How she loves the races
There we sat, sittin' in the stand,
She stood pat, couldn't pat her hand
Took one look at a big 'Gee Gee' and that was the end of me.

Goofy over Horses, Horses, Horses
She's a litle wild
Daffy over Horses, Horses, Horses
Silly over Horses, Horses, Horses
Once I heard her call me 'Spark Plug' Brown eyes too;

Gues she thinks I'm a Horses 'Barney Google' at the altar, altar, altar
May be she will falter, falter, falter,
Then I'll get a halter, halter, halter
Just to make her mind.

And with my bride close to my side 
Will holler ""Thanks for the buggy ride""

And I will bet her bridal veil
Will look just like a Horses tail",Horses [Take 2]

Just call my name 'cause i ain't ashamed
To crawl on home to you

Any kind'll do
The only song i know play it soft and low
While i moan the blues for you

George Shearing,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

George Shearing,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
George Shearing,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

The stars would fall from the skies
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

The birds in Maytime
Would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
No wind in winter would blow
With you beside me
A rose would bloom in the snow

I gave you my love
But I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain
If I lost you",If I Should Lose You

I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts
Seemed romantic fools
A house in Iceland
Was my heart's domain
I saw your eyes
Now castles rise in Spain

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That un-felt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

This is the end of a beautiful friendship,
It ended a moment ago.
This is the end of a beautiful friendship, 
I know,

Like sister and brother, 
Until tonight, 
When we looked at each other.

And just the beginning of love.

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me
George Shearing,"I make a date for golf,
You can bet you life it rains.
I try to give a party,
And the guy upstairs complains.
I guess I'll go through life,
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains,
Everything happens to me.

I never miss a thing,
I've had measles and the mumps.
And every time I play my ace,
My partner always trumps.
I guess I'm just a fool,
Who never looks before he jumps,
Everything happens to me.

At first my heart tho't,
You could break this jinx for me.
That love would turn the trick,
To end my despair.
But now, I just can't fool,
This head that thinks for me.
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air.

I've telegraphed and called,
I sent air mail special, too,
You answer was goodbye,
And there was even postage due.
I fell in love just once,
And then it had to be with you,
Everything happens to me.",Everything Happens to Me
George Shearing,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

After it brought my lover near

George Shearing,"Some folks were meant to live in clover
But they are such a chosen few, chosen few

Is something I've never seen

They say there's moonbeams I should view, I should view

Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.

Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,

Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter

George Shearing,"When two lovers meet in Mayfair so the legends tell
Songbirds sing and winter turns to spring
Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the spell

I know such enchantment can be
Cause it happened one evening to me
That certain night, the night we met,
There was magic abroad in the air,
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square

I may be right, I may be wrong,
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turn'd and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
The moon that lingered over London town

Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love,
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars,
It was such a romantic affair,
And as we kissed and said goodnight,

It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!
But be it sunshine or shady, here's my love to my lady,

There's a melody in your heart
With a singable, happy feeling

To face the world every day
With a ""deedle-um-dee-di-di""
Little melody that is making the world go by

I of course replied ""something here inside cannot be denied""
They said ""someday you'll find all who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

And a smile can hide all the pain

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
George Shearing,"The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart!
How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart!
There's a line between love and fascination,
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they give the very same sensation.
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss.
Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!
But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start.
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart,

Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.
Just because I'm in misery.
I'm not begging for no sympathy.
But if it's not asking too much,
Just send me someone to love.

Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love. 

Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do
Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do
Because strange things are happenin', babe, an' somethin' might happen to you

If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?
If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?
Because it's better to be without you, then to live on in misery

Hey!

Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too
Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too
You better change your ways pretty baby or somethin' might happen to you",Please Send Me Someone to Love
George Shearing,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I pine, for you, dear, only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I can't believe it; it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending? It looks like the ending
Unless I can have
Just one more chance, dear

My life a wreck you're making
My heart is yours for just the taking
I'll gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul",Body and Soul
George Shearing,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

High in the sky up above

George Shearing,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
George Shearing,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

You look around, the day has passed.
When you're in love,
Time is precious stuff;
Even a lifetime isn't enough.

Where has the time all gone to?
Haven't done half the things we want to.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time

This day was just a token,
Too many words are still unspoken.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.

Just when the fun is starting,
Comes the time for parting,
But let's be glad for what we've had
And what's to come.
There's so much more embracing
Still to be done, but time is racing.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.

Didn't get half my wishes,
Never have seen you dry the dishes.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.
Can't satisfy my craving,
Never have watched you while you're shaving.
Oh, well, we'll catch up
Some other time.

Comes the final-inning

Haven't had time to wake up,
Seeing you there without your make-up.

George Shearing,"The boat rides we would take, the moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favrite song
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

The midway and the fun, the kewpie dolls we won
The bell I rang to prove that I was strong
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike, the rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back

The leaves began to fade like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?
The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long

Need I say that my love´s mispent
Mispent with angel eyes tonight

The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.

And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.

There may be other springs as full and fare,

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

But that was long ago

Gone and got the blues in paris,
Paris blues called azure-te.
How can I be blue in paris? 
Easy, ?cause you?re far away.
Can?t lose this blues,
This azure-te.

Moments, springtime, eiffel tower,
Funny taxes, kids at play.
Paris without you is lonesome,
Yearning more and more each day.
Can?t lose this blues,
This azure-te.

If you knew how much I need you,
You?d come back to me to stay.

Really is the only way
To lose this blues,

Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.

I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.

Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,

A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

My head is just a hat place,
My breast an empty shell,
And I've a faded dream to sell.

All alone and all at sea,
Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love,
Why is my heart so frail,
Like a ship without a sail?

Out on the ocean,
Sailors can use a chart;
I'm on the ocean,
Guided by just a lonely heart!

Still alone, all at sea,
Still there's no-one to care for me.

Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

For flames live such a little while

George Shelby,"Birth to this emptiness conception in lovelessness.
Spiritless hands show no caress. There was no embrace from tearstained faces.
Environment bottomless compassion was motionless.
Weary eyes will only see the depths of captivity here in this perpetual misery.
Hate's piercing sound disfigures the soul in the stream of my tears
I lay in their mold!

Do you got any love in your heart? Unfeeling! Unfeeling! Unfeeling!
I touched my innermost self with its healing.
Threw myself down at the feet of its mercy
the stone of my heart met its defeat love emptied me filling me with serenity.
It's a light that want to embrace me,
I was not of love still it accepted me whole
and where there was nothing left there is love in the soul. Love is not weakness!

Love is truth!
Love is endless!

Love is your sacrifice!
Love is your faith!
Love is your trust!

Traded all the troubles on our minds
One thing led to another in the evening

Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime 
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason

In a rundown motel room as dark as hell

He sat her at a table and strolled out on the floor
He grabbed the first sweet thang that gave him the eye
And left the door open for the steal of the night
Three dances later she was still in her chair
He was still on the dance floor like he didn't care
So I eased on over, there was no ring in sight
And I found myself facing the steal of the night.

She was the steal of the night, 
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He long hair flowing and her jeans so tight
I held her close and it felt so right
She was the steal of the night
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He left her lonely and the pickings were right
She was the steal of the night

We danced every slow one the band could play
Was it ever this easy for ole Jesse James
Had the gold in my hands and the banker was blind
Just inches away from the steal of the night
When the band stopped playing we walked to the car
As I closed the door he ran out of the bar
Saw him shaking his fist under the parking lot light
As I strolled away with the steal of the night

She was the steal of the night, 
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He long hair flowing and her jeans so tight
I held her close and it felt so right
She was the steal of the night
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He left her lonely and the pickings were right
She was the steal of the night

She was the steal of the night, 
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He long hair flowing and her jeans so tight
I held her close and it felt so right
She was the steal of the night
Oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
He left her lonely and the pickings were right
She was the steal of the night",The Steal of the Night
George Strait,"You ain't never fell as far as when you fall in love
Except the fall you take when you've been loved and given up
When you have your heart and soul rubbed into the dirt
An eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper will take away the hurt

Give me an eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper
And I'll start feeling I forgot her
Get a little loose and lose her memory
And I won't think I'm close to dying
Because it dries up all my crying
An eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper always sets me free

It ain't easy losing love although it's turned out bad
All at once you're turning off old feelings you once had
But I found a helping hand right here in my hand
And eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper will help me take 'em out

Give me an eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper
And I'll start feeling I forgot her
Get a little loose and lose her memory
And I won't think I'm close to dying
Because it dries up all my crying
An eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper always sets me free",80 Proof Bottle of Tear Stopper
