Matchbox Twenty,"(Hello, hello, hello)

I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world,
But its feeling just like every other morning before,
Now I wonder what my life is going to mean if it's gone,
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour
And I started staring at the passengers who're waving goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?

But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend,
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
I started running but there's no where to run to
I sat down on the street and took a look at myself
Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to

I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend,
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

It's gone gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
It was cool cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you
Well its gone gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well it was cool cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you

But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

When I get home I swear I'm gonna change my ways

So why you gotta stand there looking like the answer now
It seems to me you come around
I need you now
Do you think you can cope, you've figured me out
That I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken
Though I've never spoken
I come undone
In this mad season

I feel stupid
But I think I've been catching on
I feel ugly
But I know that I still turn you on
You've grown colder now
Torn apart angry, turned around

Matchbox Twenty,"Morning falls like rain into the city life
There goes another night
Losing my breath in waves
Knowing that ever crash is bleeding the hourglass
And taking the strife, from all our lives

Everyone keeps talking
They promise you everything
But they don't mean anything

We may loose our focus
There's just too many words
We're never meant to learn
And we don't feel so alive

Say goodbye, these days are gone
And we can't keep holding on
When all we need is some relief
Through these hard times
Through these hard times

Move your hands in circles
Keeping me hypnotized
The power behind your eyes

Move around your bedroom cursing the naked sky
You should be here tonight
But you stay alone and cry

Say goodbye, these days are gone
And we can't keep holding on
When all we need is some relief
Through these hard times
(Whoa) There's something missing
(Oh whoa) You'll never feel it but you
(Oh whoa) You're gonna feel it when it's gone

Matchbox Twenty,"Come inside, the air I breathe
While the band still plays
It's the end, of the coldest week
Come down into the sea

'Cause everybody wants to get away sometimes
And everybody needs mistakes

When the sun breaks over the edge
Of an English Town
It pulls me awake, from a bad dream
I don't know why
But I know I'm not, ever going back

In the dark, we can lose our sleep
We can both be kind
'Cause I don't need, the pulling apart of sheets
Just to know, who you are

But everybody wants to get away from something
Everybody lose their way

When the sun breaks over the edge
Of an English Town
It pulls me awake, from a bad dream
I don't know why

Thought it was right, but I was wrong

But how long
Are you gonna make me wait
And how long
Are you gonna hesitate
'Cause l love the way we carry it on
But baby how long

You know the way they always say
Don't make it never, it's better late

But tell me why, my cautious angel
Must you put it in my face

Are you gonna make me wait
And how long
Are you gonna hesitate

But baby I don't ever wanna make it feel too rushed
Make it feel like love wouldn't be enough
But that's just another don't mean much
Like a high school crush, make you wanna run
Can't you see the way I need you crazy
And I want you in my arms every night, of my life

Lying there in front of me

Oh, this is the way you want it to be
Guess you don't want me

We had love
Always thought it would be enough

We put our love in the ground
Felt to die when a car on the road
100 miles, I'm still thinking about you, uuuh yeah

I know, but my heart seems never lose faith.
Caught the acts, stop the games, but still I can say
When I get back, I'ma be looking you up.
Looking you up.

So, I'm looking for the love
Would you love me again?
Yeah!

I have your face on flying with the title
Broken high space.

Waiting to be found now.

Until we're together.

Like rhythm and riddles, I explore you
Your hips turn to rivers, you see me swim in them
My waves will make you speak, in tongues like Spanish
You listen to Coldplay and Dr. Dre
Turn heads in sweatpants and throwback j’s
Seems that your perfect in every way
But the only other question
Is just how good

How good is your love, baby
How good is your love?
How good is your love, baby
How good is your love (in the meantime)

I like that you listen and grab my attention
With lips made for kissing I aim right for them
Maybe you're land and I’m out to sea
And all I want to do is catch up to your beach
Fucks with the way that you say my name
Love how you roll up the perfect J
Seems like your better than all the rest
But the only thing I‘m thinking
Is just how good

How good is your love, baby
How good is your love?
How good is your love, baby
How good is your love (in the meantime)

Meantime, I guess well get to know each other
Meantime, I guess we’ll cross the bridge together
Meantime, Meantime, Meantime, Meantime, Meantime

Good, How Good is your love)

Said some things that were wrong
Girl, I was just too scared to fall in love
I have to cause of my complications
Wore out all your patience
Girl, I don't blame you for being fed up
But then it hit me all at once, when you left
Just like a hundred thousand tons, in my chest
Wishing this pain would go away, and leave me
But it gets worse, everyday, cause baby

I can't let you go, I keep tryin' but I can't girl
It's impossible, I miss you too bad
I can't wish away the pain that I cannot do girl
And all I can say is I miss you

Tryin' to tell myself to move on, to grow up and be strong
Girl, I keep thinking bout those better days
So many things I wanna tell you
Like how much I love you
But girl, can't believe you're really gone away

Keys in the lock
Trapped in my heart

That's when it fell apart
When everything anything I do is true
Reminds me terribly that

I've tried it
It's obvious
I can't hide it
Gonna win back your heart

Tell me that you will sing about me

Tell me that you will sing about me when I’m gone

Something walked across my mind
Screaming at my conscious high
Written in a question rhyme
What’s the point? Why even try?
You’ve been cryin’ over rivers…
Been cryin’ over rivers for months

Why’s the price of chasing fame
Dollars someone else can gain
All that’s left is pocket change
And Bill’s the only name u made
I’m tryna see the lesson
Tryna learn the lessons… I can’t

But when the dark covers me
I hope the world remembers me
That I was free free to be me

Mine before the beat could start
Bet I’ll find the missing parts
Cause Momma needs a brand new carI promise that Im working
Promise that I’ll work hard for her

And if I die up on this stage
Tell my girl I love you babe
Probably should’ve quit the game
Now I’m by the river banks
I’m cryin’ you a river
Cryin’ over rivers for you

Man, ich reg' mich gerne auf!

Keine Geduld
Und ich raste gerne aus
Ich beiß ins Lenkrad, wenn ich an der Ampel steh'
Ich schrei „Ihr Penner! Wegen euch komm ich zu spät!“
Ich hab 200 Puls! (ah)
Das Pech lächelt
Ich will reinschlagen
Denn ich bin beschissen drauf an solchen scheiß Tagen
Ich will die Augen schließen
Und mal tief einatmen
Doch der vor mir, kann noch nicht mal rückwärts einparken
Und mein Nachbar lügt, er sagt ""Um Zwölf, da ist die Party um.""
Ich steh im Bett um 1 - Ohropax und Valium
Hau mit dem Besen an die Decke, im Takt der Musik
Womit hab ich das bloß verdient?
Alle Welt ist gegen mich
Immer, nicht gelegentlich.
Ich wär gern entspannt doch wegen all den Pennern geht es nicht
Babys schreien in der Bahn
Schreien am Nebentisch
Ich geh' an die Decke wenn mich jemand fragt, wie spät es ist
Ich hab' 200 Puls
Alle andern sind schuld
Man, ich reg' mich gerne auf!

Ich hab die Faxen dicke, man ich steig' dir gleich auf's Dach!
Wer mich blockiert, dem mach' ich Feuer unter'm Arsch
Wie dieser unfähigen Kassiererin im Supermarkt
Halt deine Schnauze
Wenn ich sprech'
Ich kann nicht ausstehen, wenn man mich unterbricht
Ihr habt doch alle überhaupt keinen Respekt
Jeder dritte Deutsche leidet doch an Auto-Tourette
Hier macht doch jeder, was er will und das ertrag' ich nicht
Wenn deine Kinder zu laut spielen, dann verklag' ich dich!
Von all dem Scheiß, der mich plagt
Grippier' ich irgendwann noch jämmerlich an einem Herzinfarkt
Ich hab' 200 Puls
Alle andern sind Schuld
Man, ich reg' mich gerne auf!

Und ich raste gerne aus
Ich beiß ins Lenkrad, wenn ich an der Ampel steh'
Ich schrei ""Ihr Penner! Wegen euch komm ich zu spät!""
Ich lass' mir all den scheiß nich' mehr gefallen
Nein! Ich hab' es endgültig satt!
Wer nervt, kriegt einfach gleich einpaar geknallt
Bohw! Das es richtig schön klatscht!
Soziale Kompetenz ist nicht mein Job
Ich geh' mit dem Kopf durch die Wand
Wenn ihr mich weiter nervt, lauf' ich amok
Ey!
Ra-Pa-Pam-Pam!

Alle andern sind schuld
Man, ich reg' mich gerne auf!

Wenn keiner deinen Namen mehr ruft
Kann ich sagen ""Man, ich hab es versucht.""

Hab hart gekämpft - Blut, Schweiss und Tränen
Und jetzt steh' ich hier auf der Bühne des Lebens
Tut mir leid, das ihr damals nicht auch
An mich geglaubt habt!
Wenn ich hinfall', steh' ich sofort wieder auf

Ihr braucht mir gar nichts sagen Abschiedsbriefe sind so 80er
Doch jetzt jetzt schmeiß' ich das Handtuch endgültig hin und streich die Siegel
Ich hab mal gelesen jeder verdient die Chance auf ein besseres Leben denn hier
Fall ich zusammen wie ein altes Haus die Wände kalt und grau ich schrei es raus 
Ich halt’s nich' aus ich will hier einfach raus einfach nur vergessen um zu vergessen 
Einfach fliegen wenigstens versuchen mit gebrochenen Flügeln
Sie sagten mir als Kind „Du wirst das Leben lieben“ sie haben gnadenlos gelogen 
Ich hab jahrelang gegraben am Ende des Regenbogens
Zücke mein Handy ein letztes Mal schreibe der Welt „Ich komme“
Fang von vorne an komme was wolle grüß‘ mir die Sonne

Lass alles stehn und liegen
Mach mich aus dem Staub

Und ich lösch mein altes Leben
Aus den Augen aus dem Sinn
Und ich renne bis ich ankomm
Wo ich sein kann wer ich bin
Ich hau ab

Ich hab mehr Löcher als Taschen hab die Hoffnung verlorn 
Wer hat mein Lächeln versteckt man ich beginn noch mal von Vorn
Renn so weit wie die Beine mich Tragen auf steinigen Pfaden
Wind in den Armen ich kann’s nicht mehr ertragen die Lichter der Straßenleere
Gesichter die sagen „Ich schaff’s nich mehr, ich hör auf“
Auf der Stirn geschrieben mit dicken Buchstaben „Burnout“
Ironie des Schicksals alles cool alter bis man erfriert
Wie soll man denn sein Glück finden wenn man sich selbst verliert
Ich steh am Gleis nach nirgendwo versteh nur Bahnhof
Habe die Karte für den Schatz in meinem Herzen doch bin planlos
Wo ist die Liebe hin, wenn man sie braucht Ich hab sie lang nicht mehr gesehn
Ich bin nur gekommen um zu sagen dass ich geh

wenn's am schwersten ist.
Wenn nichts mehr geht,
macht ihr den ersten Schritt.
Wenn es brennt seid ihr da, gebt uns Kraft. 
Ihr fakelt nicht lang,
auf euch ist Verlass.
Seid die helfende Hand, ein schützendes Dach.
Aus Leuten wie euch werden Helden gemacht.
Für Schwache die Stärke,
für Arme die Spende, 
Geborgenheit, Schutz wie die eigenen vier Wände.
Was wär'n wir ohne die Männer und Frauen in weiß, in grün, in rot, in blau?
Bei Tag und bei Nacht, bei Sturm und bei Wind
Verloren da draußen, taubstumm und blind.
Ihr seid die Stars, die anderen nur Statisten.
Das gute Gewissen hinter den Kulissen.
Ich kann die Last nicht tragen an manchen Tagen, will nur Danke sagen.

Ihr seid Helden, die dieses Land so braucht.
Stille Helden.
Wir bauen euch ein Denkmal auf. 

Ich erinner mich, als ich klein war, Oma und Opa schoben mein Dreirad.
Mit Oma backen, spielen unter'm Apfelbaum und mit Opa ein Haus in die Wolken bau'n. 
Ihr habt mir gezeigt wie man läuft und grade steht
Das man für seine Taten grade steht
Es war nicht immer einfach ohne beide Eltern
nicht behütet mit Brüdern und Schwestern. 
Mama schenkte mir das Leben, sie war da für mich
Auch in schwierigsten Momenten hat sie mich geliebt. 
Es war wie im Paradies auch an dunklen Tagen
Und ich werd sie dafür immer in mei'm Herzen tragen.
Wir danken euch mit jedem Atemzug.

Nur mit dir kann ich so herrlich bekloppt sein!
Bring ich mal einen schlechten Witz bringst du noch ein

Wir sind auch ohne drauf, lachen laut ohne Grund
Im Kino schmeißen sie mit Popcorn nach uns
Neben dir will ich einpennen
Neben dir wach ich auf
Denn du siehst morgens verpennt genauso schön wie ich scheiße aus

Wir fliegen aus dem Club
Weil du gerne pöbelst, wenn wir uns fetzen
Dann fliegen auch mal Möbel

Weißt du was, weißt du was ich meine?!
Du bist nicht so wie sie
Du bist perfekt unperfekt aber das ist es was mich zeckt oho

Und ich will nie wieder lachen du bist perfekt unperfekt!

Du bist ein Klasse Teil ein echtes Rasseweib
Endlich eine die mir Whiskey statt das Wasser reicht
Und du hast alle Qualitäten die mich umhauen
Manchmal Miss Universum manchmal missgelaunt
Wenn wir durch's Viertel gehn bin ich gleich ein drittel jünger
Ich schenk dir Schmuck du trägst ihn auf dem Mittelfinger!

Ey du hast du mir schlau nicht affektiert
Große Klappe unzensiert, fick die Welt tättoowiert
Feiern bis nachts um vier dann den ganzen Tag schimmeln
Wir ham den gleichen Horizont nicht nur den gleichen Himmel

But before the night is gone our love may be revealed

you were there to show me how you could hold me

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?

Mathilde Santing,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all

And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

You came along and everything's startin' to hum

You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine

We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground

A-wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
A-wait till you see that sunshine place

Mathilde Santing,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,

Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell

What's the use of trying not to fall
I have no will, you made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me

Ooh I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So what's the use, you've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me

Ooh I'm so hot and bothered

That I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near

Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me

Matisyahu,"The place lays phased like a warrior slayed
Engraved into the space with his sword still raised
Layers of charcoal sprayed through hallways
Praise relays off the walls echoing all ways

Dirt covered earth lays beneath my rib cage
Giving birth to overgrowth invading on to path ways
Burnt out trees cover streets where children once played
Sown seeds decay through sacred stepping stones in disarray
Where the alter used to be placed inter-changed for bloodstains
Sunrays illuminate the smoke filled haze
Trace of incense scents of sacrifice stayed

Chorus:
Aish tamid eternally
A fire burns continuously
Wondering where you been
Won't you come on home to me?

Flash back patches of grass growing wild in fact
Cracked walls burnt black like a kingdom sacked
Memories like artifacts attacked yet still intact
Melodies wrapped in glass and shatter with the impact

Air intermingling ringing with the singing
of songs once sung, hung, flung into the rafters
Catastrophe struck the sound stuck
Disaster plastered
The aftermath a blasted building once standing, like a starved man fasting
the skies expanding clouds passing, dust particles dancing,
in broken bars of light, streaming from a shaft, slashed into the ceiling,
Sshhhh, you could feel the ground breathing.

Chorus

Daughter of Zion is lying crying in the mist
Morning light slips in, shifting through the darkness
Like a morning wife reminisce having visions of her long gone prince
Memories drip rain drops tip towing emptiness
Intermixed with tears like fears left unfixed
Walls worn thin frozen fortress like dawn waiting for the sunrise of a day that got skipped
Like a life gone wrong wandering wilderness
Lovesick stripped abyss empty once luscious

Chorus

Paint the scene so you could see, the city's picking up speed
On a bench 14th street, taxi's streaming yellow streaks
Spears piercing through my ears, you could hear the traffic speak
Jack hammers drill smacking through the cracking concrete
Buildings filled with windowsills spilled tangled telephone wires
Signs sparking neon lights flash like wild fire
My insides rise I start to feel paralyzed
Let out a sigh-a melody blew by- like an ancient war cry
the way the sunlight hit the trees it really caught my eye,
glistening' listening' to the breeze dancing' through the leaves,
freeze, the city move's in slow motion like a dream

I'm left empty like the temple turned into a fox den
Bus fumes dripping spitting into city summer sun
Sifting through the ash dimly lit vision listening
To the hiss lifting off a nighttime ocean
Shim, shim, shimmering singing hair on my skin
Glim, glim. Glimmering, whispering where ya been

From amidst the darkness set sail with the softness
Breeze traveling across the seas arisen from with in Mt. Zion
Wind coming in picking up momentum
Cutting crisply through the thickness riding on a rhythm
A rollercoaster sizzling, twisting down the mountain
ripping rocket ship exploding like a fountain
overflowing spilling through the courtyards of Jerusalem
Uncovering debris lifting up the fallen arisen within
to reach the yiddin even in Manhattan
exposed menorah glowing in the shadows of destruction
trailblazing through affliction
brushing off the branches golden
standing strong flames
dancing like a lion roaring rising out of nothing",Aish Tamid
Matisyahu,"Austin how you all feeling.
Like this, Like this.
It?s the music that grows all the illusion and fears.
It?s the music that makes the confusion become clear.
It?s the music that I live, these 18 years.
It?s the music I give my blood, sweat, and tears.
Not to mention some lifer,
Did I mention I like her?
Then the rest of the cipher man it?s not hard to decipher.
Music gets people hyper,
Music made me a riper.
Music made me a fighter.
Yo man, pass me the lighter.
It?s the fire that igniter, shot it right in the sky.
Look me right in the eye.
Hey yo kid, you want to fly.
The why-o, the n-ya, from N.Y. to egg white.
You cannot deny so why even try.
My mother sang songs to kids in concentration.
His mother sang songs inside the cotton plantation.
Her mother sang songs while we were robbin the nation.
Now I sing songs for much more then an occupation.
I am the music.
We are the music.
I am the music.
You are the music
Austin is the music.
Texas is the music.
We are the mu-sic.


Yo I take two steps forward.
Taking one step back.
Every time I think I am on track, Life fades to black.
Now I pick the slack and attack faster then a rapper on crack.
Feel my knack and just spit.
I bet there?s more triplets 'cause rap has hit vicious.
My style is more delicious the eggnog.
You wish this kid would vanish, so?s his family,
And my spirit needs fitness, that why I flip this.
Yo so I held back the life and blown and feeling.
Alright surprising people 'cause I drowned last night.
Here I am one more time,
My rhymes are at your shine.
I?m ripping over ribbons life swimming through time.
Sit back in unwind,
Let your brain unravel.
Slip sliding away like travelin on wet gravel,
Ain?t no need to battle if need be, yah..

Matisyahu,"From the forest itself comes the hand for the ax
Split this wilderness listen up this ain't where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down; chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Time flies by like clouds passing in the sky lifetimes hear and gone like the blink of an eye
March through this desert one-step at a time, march through the desert one step at a time

Chorus: From the forest itself comes the handle for the ax,
Drop the staff Moshe rabbainu split the ocean in half,
March through the desert this ain't where it's at
Chop 'em down, Chop 'em down

Patterns engraved not so easily erased, still wandering trying to find your place
Playing the game I see pain on your face now a day's the yiddin like children sold as slaves
Strange ways running through the maze, strange ways always lost in the desert trying to
find to find your place lost in the desert trying to find your place

From the forest itself comes the hand for the ax
Split this wilderness listen up this ain't where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down; chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Joseph descended sold as a slave,
thrown into a dungeon cause he wouldn't be swayed
Interpreted pharaoh's dreams and Egypt was saved
stock piled food for seven years of rain
then sold to all the nations when the drought came
Joseph rose to power and the yiddin stayed
They started to build and success was made
Pharos getting worried let's make them pay bound in chains
First born was sent down to their graves
Moshe was saved and a prince he was raised
Hashem spoke to him hears a message to relay
Take my Nation from Mitzrayim (Egypt) I see the suffering
Hard hearts ego breaks take sparks and make way
Trail blaze through the wasteland breaking the chains
Last generation just the ruminants
March through the desert leaving footprints
Peel off the lid this is just plastic, get into it, get into it
Heavy hitter stepping solid never quitter jump into the ocean before it split got a jump into it
Rip through Egypt rip through it,
get into it, 600,000 witnessed it, no you didn't forget
In the spiritual desert things are not what they seem
snakes camouflaged just fit the scene
Put your faith in a mirage it's just a smoke screen
The king is sitting on his thrown of glory",Chop 'Em Down

I know I'm crazy mothers would never run from inside
And try to keep me down, them  a sin on Jah
An' dem know! That them folks, put 'em in a fire
They just type and can't see, open up your eyes
Every politician is a human in disguise
They say them a tease and the waves is rough,

Each and every day I pray to get to know you please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe

Strippin’ away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high, bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If you're cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the water's and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy, and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Searching up to the sky and looking beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
You keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray,
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my God, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now, time we start revealing
What's this feeling?
My love will rip a skylight in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my God, songs of love and healing

Op! diggy do-do-do, you make my heart want to serve you and I'm bound to erupt you lift me up from quick sand in a world gone corrupt no longer stuck up up and away we go Yerushalayim is our home 
(chorus:
Said lord raise me up from the ground I've been here so long I said lord raise me up from the ground) bass man!

When it started it'd be etched into my brain elevation
The shield that david blazed, into my brain waves
And I'm raisin' my soul like a sword in ancient days
When protection surrounded me like the sun's rays
Started it'd be etched into my brain elevation
The shield that david blazed, into my brain waves
And I'm Raisin' my soul like a sword in ancient days
When protection surrounded me Like the sun's rays

Matisyahu,"Ani auni vevyone. Hashem yashav li. Ezrati, umafalti, atau.
As for me, I am poor and destitute. Hashem my G-d will think about me. My help, my rescuer, you are.

My word is like a hammer like a shattering rock,
crack through your heart and take the evil apart

From the end of the earth unto you I call, time and again I fall, back to you I crawl
You have been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy
Enemy, enemy lines I find I let myself get tied up too many times
You can't have my heart I'm taking back what's mine
I know it lie just smoke in your eye and you saved my soul from the other side

When faint grows my heart to a rock that too hard for me to climb alone lead me
For you have been a refuge

With you I smash a troop and with my G-d I leap over a wall
May the king answer you on the day that you call
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled,
heavens lay draped over New York like a prayer shawl,
the holy one enthroned upon the praises of Israel

Pathways of my heart clogged like a traffic jam
From the start, I want to take the blockage apart",Refuge

Battleaxe can chop 'em down that's the call of the wild
There's no message in your bottle emptiness its just hollow
Think the way to wake up is through sex, that's just shallow
Tossing seed into the wind producin' loss and sorrow
Dracula's on MTV sucking the blood from the marrow
Hearts hardened like stone wantin to be known like Pharaoh
'Said to let me people go that's just the call of the wild
Children drowning in the rivers, swimming, babbling, I was taught
Hit the wall, first thing, drop and fall, hard to swallow
If its roots are cut off how we can feed this flower?
Might look pretty temporary, but rotten within the hour
Disconnected from its source with no footsteps to follow
Chasing death disguised as life, world's a bridge that's narrow

Won't believe what I saw

Washed up on the shore

Now it's nighttime
You had to leave

Separated from the king
Now the water's rushing and you keep trying to swim against the stream
And it seems, like your not moving the many water's gushing you gasp for air
Almost drowning ears ringing, once upon a time we were singing
One day the trees will stand and clap hands
Stream of thought getting caught in the klipa, this place is just a shell, external
Egos swell, that one'll burn ya, we fell a long way down, that eternal frown'll get you
You look vexed it's the dregs, the yetzer hara's lurking
Trying to make you forget we got a job to do

Re-united, re-united, she's been taken for so long
Re-united, re-united and then she'll be filled with joy
Re-united, re-united like the days of her youth

Descended to the pit
What's this feeling can't get rid of it
Soul sick
Can't seem to shake it
When one retires at night weeping, joy will come in the morning
You made my mountain stand strong

Oh, yo, then we'll see clearly

Left hers father house 
To walk streets that never rest 
Maybe they'll hear me in metropolis 
So I'm sending an SOS 
Fighting with her ta 
She wants out of this mess 
And those big city lights 
Might brighten up the darkness 
You know that I'm tired and you know that I'm stressed 
You can't stop me and you can't stop this 
You could call the police try to make an arrest 
Today is the day that I repossess 
Leaving on the first bus that I can get 
Now its rings around eyes sopping wet from rain droplets 
Window shopping for some solace 
No address and penniless 
That's the price you pay for running away from the stress 
Feeling the pain like dance by the DJ 
Reminds me of a time when things were ok 
Frightened by her own shadow 
Now she wants to go home 
Many names for one G-d 
Trotting on, through the facade 
You were all my children 
Got a dig for that feeling 
Love will break through concealment 
Strip away the serpent's skin 
We came to win 
Dispatch the troops 
Send the captain 
My gem is held captive in the dungeon 
Don't come back till you end the mission 
If it takes a long time 
Don't lose the vision 
If you're stuck 
Check the blueprint 
Look within

Got to find the rhythm 
Won't you please return child 
Where you been 
She says I can't come home because he won't let me in 
And besides we don't need no more friction 
Uses to look so nice, how'd you get so thin? 
With a heart like ice, it's a heart of sin 
Skin white like a ghost with a pale complexion 
Pray to g-d for the dead we need resurrection 
Don't you know wherever you go thick and thin 
You are still my children 
Since you've been gone my soul's been hearting 
Wondering through this world

It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

Matisyahu,"The world is moving to the song I hear,
Who's that singing, wind is rushing in my ear,
Mind gushing memories almost lost everything,
Felony and fellows running in my dream,
We were in the van where the hits were driving,
Saw myself In the highlands at age 13
And I'm asking questions to the present day me,
Moving backwards down the hill see we were posting.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

I don't need to glorify,
Ate the apple of the tree and tried to lie,
In the garden I'll remember
That's when I started to sing
I said death brings life into uncertain things,
Cut some slack for me
Sun setting autumn breeze
Sound is moving like a chorus
Keep hearing that melody,
Check the radio but there's nothing playing,
Check the radio again but there's nothing playing.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

Rewind!

Swing low, sweet chariot of flames
Change my name, yo!
It was always the same,
Till if only what you find when you climb,
Check the radio but of all that shines there's no time,
My life is making your mind work in overtime,
But along the line you'll have to pay for the crime.
Slow it down, you turbo too soon,
Vroom vroom then you want to blast off unto the moon,
But you might get trapped in a temple of doom,
You might get trapped in a temple of doom.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

Matisyahu,"On the way into this world, our soul was born in two
Searching for you, I been searching for you
Where ya been, where ya running to
Where ya got to go, what ya got to do
Don't care where were goin, just wanna be with you
Put your head on my shoulder, tell me what you been thru
When I lose my focus, you remind me of the truth
Lift us up to the heavens, for a birds eye view

One woman for me
Other half of my soul, you are my queen
One woman for me
Other half of my soul, roots of my tree

We could forget about galus for a while, our troubles for a while
Sometimes I look at you and just smile, sit in the park and just laugh all day
Sometimes I just lose it with the things that you say, waiting by the subway
But we missed the train, well take the next one if you can pull me away
Keep me cool down to earth, and no anxiety
Stay Matis with the humble heart always

One woman for me
Other half of my soul, you are my queen
One woman for me
Other half of my soul, roots of my tree

We don't need no umbrella, when we're walking in the rain
Sunlight or clouds, its all the same
Don't need no umbrella, when we're walking in the rain

So smart and sharp, a soul lovely
And beauty shine bright, yes you're there for me
Keep the ways of our fathers, how way it use to be
Moving forward, don't mean erase our history
Look to your ways, and see a girl who wants to do the right thing
Dedicated to your life, bigger than you or me
Build a temple in our hearts, for his majesty
Stay simple, serve god, and keep our deeds clean

One woman for me
Other half of my soul, you are my queen
One woman for me
Other half of my soul, roots of my tree",Unique Is My Dove

Is worth far more than silver and gold
What I'm fighting for

With the brothers coming home at last
Fighting together for light

Lay down to a higher command
Don't be tricked by the acts of man

Matisyahu,"Slap me Daft, we sat down in the back of the class
To seize knowledge we don't need, I forgot my late pass
But I'm early to a arival beatbox, you got raps?
Meet me on the football field, don't sleep on field, the quarterback
No one clapped when we locked in, it was removal of our class
But my flag got captured and I fell between the cracks
My tool for inspiration turned into a handicap
No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fill the gaps
Those whipper snappers, they got trapped old chap
They lost the way, they never had the right map
Needed a sneak attack to slap the demons off my back
So I packed for the schddle dreamed big I wouldn't settle
Put the pedal to the metal and returned to fundamentals
I'll never forget running through the hall with all y'all rebels
Roaming through the high land, young bucks invincible
Echoes in my brain, if kids report to the principle
Substance dulls the mind
Traife wine clouds the heart
You can't sew a stitch with one hand
While you're taking it apart
Bright lights might look nice
But they sure won't make you sharp
You can't sew a stitch with one hand
While you're taking it apart

Yeah, misty morning and my mum's a mess
To make matters worse dog my pops is stressed
Life is a test, make the grade or catch an F
Now death is all that's left to ponder
I wander off hoping to catch my breath

Yeah, misty morning and my mum's a mess
To make matters worse dog my pops is stressed
Life is a test, make the grade or catch an F
Now death is all that's left to ponder
I wander off hoping to catch my breath
And hold it, mold my memories from untold scripts
And roll up in a tornado twist, now I'm certain
There's a pertinent reason I'm on this earth
Seasons change in white plains, but we remain alert
When new school years appear, fools fear for a failure
And crawl away in tears
I play Popeye the Sailor and stay with spinach
We walk the halls with a grimace
Yeah they gossip in groups
I try to mind my business and tell the truth
For instance, I listen, see it all with basketball court vision
Ignoring ignorance in fields of fiction
We lean back in the calmest position
And embrace the honesty found within our tension

What's good?

Substance dulls the mind
Traife wine clouds the heart
You can't sew a stitch with one hand
While you're taking it apart
Bright lights make you blind
But they sure don't leave you sharp
You can't sew a stitch with one hand
While you're taking it apart

Trapped in the elevator of your mind
Is it real, what will you find behind the door
Your imaginations put you in a bind
Around you there's a cloud of gloom
Swallow the key, lock yourself in a room
Can't see outside of your Universe

No more war, there won't be anymore hunger
No jealousy, not even competition

Let go, release, you hold the keys
Time we evaporate into the breeze
We are nothing, we are something
Let go, release, you hold the keys
It's time we evaporate into the breeze
We are nothing, we'll be something
Welcome to the desert of my soul
You can stay if you like

Matisyahu,"From the forest itself comes the hand for the ax
Split this wilderness listen up this ain't where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down; chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Time flies by like clouds passing in the sky lifetimes hear and gone like the blink of an eye
March through this desert one-step at a time, march through the desert one step at a time

From the forest itself comes the handle for the ax,
Drop the staff Moshe rabbainu split the ocean in half,
March through the desert this ain't where it's at
Chop 'em down, Chop 'em down

Patterns engraved not so easily erased, still wandering trying to find your place
Playing the game I see pain on your face now a day's the yiddin like children sold as slaves
Strange ways running through the maze, strange ways always lost in the desert trying to
Find to find your place lost in the desert trying to find your place

From the forest itself comes the handle for the ax,
Drop the staff Moshe rabbainu split the ocean in half,
March through the desert this ain't where it's at
Chop 'em down, Chop 'em down

Joseph descended sold as a slave,
Thrown into a dungeon cause he wouldn't be swayed
Interpreted pharaoh's dreams and Egypt was saved
Stock piled food for seven years of rain
Then sold to all the nations when the drought came
Joseph rose to power and the yiddin stayed
They started to build and success was made
Pharos getting worried let's make them pay bound in chains
First born was sent down to their graves
Moshe was saved and a prince he was raised
Hashem spoke to him hears a message to relay
Take my Nation from Mitzrayim (Egypt) I see the suffering
Hard hearts ego breaks take sparks and make way
Trail blaze through the wasteland breaking the chains
Last generation just the ruminants
March through the desert leaving footprints
Peel off the lid this is just plastic, get into it, get into it
Heavy hitter stepping solid never quitter jump into the ocean before it split got a jump into it
Rip through Egypt rip through it,
Get into it, 600,000 witnessed it, no you didn't forget
In the spiritual desert things are not what they seem
Snakes camouflaged just fit the scene
Put your faith in a mirage it's just a smoke screen
The king is sitting on his thrown of glory




",Chop 'Em Down Dub
Matisyahu,"[verse 1]
Fire descends from on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on Mount Zion
Rub me the wrong way, taking the highway
Rubbing sticks together but your fire's man-made
Capitalize on hot air, soar like an airplane
Yearn to rise in the sky quick high like cocaine
False pride is suicide but you've got nothing to gain
Babylon's buildings raise like flames
Drowning in their champagne
Explosion pulled the pin in the hand grenade
Soul stain blowing up
In your own domain
Fire crackers ohh and aah
But they never maintain

[bridge]
Fires burning
Flames are dancing
Don't burn the house down Lord
Heavenly fire only resides on an alter made from the ground

[chorus]
Fire descends on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on to Mount Zion
[repeat 2x]

[verse 2]
One pair of eyes
But see two different things
One person cries but the other one sings
You walk around like everybody owes ya something
Take what you got, thank G-d for all that life brings
The poor man has it all but not content with anything
While the rich man's hands are empty but he's sitting like a kind

[bridge]

[verse 3]
Backpack's geting heavey, moving at a steady pace
Carrying bricks on your shoulders and lead around your waist
Making way, run in haste
There is no time to taste what you ate
WE should be grateful got a plateful
Fire burns like ice morcels falling fire like rain

[chorus]

Matisyahu,"You're all that I have and you're all that I need
Each and every day I pray to get to know you please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till midnight
Said, thank you to my God, now I finally got it right
And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my god all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now so it's time we start revealing

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my God all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now

Strip away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high then you're bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If you're cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the water's and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Looking up to the sky and searchin' beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
Yes, you keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray,
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling

And I seen it circling around from the mountain

Sleeping out in the rain
From falling down the drain

Raging waves with no name
Raining pain distorted face

Hazy rice sunny days puff fly a kite afraid to face the night

Things seem to sway
Nothing stays the same
Even in this madness we will survive

Afraid to pick through the bushes and see
Closed off bogged down reality
Bind barbed wire with no key

I'm a searching, I'm a searching search light
When the time is right and the night is ripe

Would you leave it all behind?

To find you waiting even in a desperation
Feel something that's embracing

Ah

There is a place in the bottom of the soul
It's no bread of restitution
Hearts splash fly like dough
Where there is no pollution

You would know words to hold
Folks question your solutions
Bedrock of a river that flowed
No times, present or future

We are men of nature
We are made from the earth
At the end of my eighty, I'll return to the dirt
Just sand, just rock, dry land, fast and silent
Only bein' only breathin'
We're just children of believers

Type, fire and water be strong with compassion
In the morning we're born everlasting
Like the grass by the sea
And in with the wind which knocks ya down time and again
We remain and sing
Stand until the dawn of day carries us away
As we sway through the phases of each generation
We leave our trace and then leave this station

Fierce fronts, fantasy phased
No blame, untamed or spoken
Shiggy walks through this space
On dry land that's cracked and broken

We came to taste the rain
We're just, widows and orphans
Not afraid to feel the pain
Or to leave behind our notions

Bathe in showers, taste the tension
Hear the howl, climb the mountain
Kiss the cold and heal the frozen
Read the dreams in this here dungeon

We are men of nature
We are made from the earth
At the end of my eighty, I'll return to the dirt
Just sand, just rock, dry land, fast and silent
Only bein' only breathin'
We're just children of believers

There is fire in these leaves and therefore naturally
I'm not afraid to face these seasons
'Cuz, times change and there's no one to blame
Even when the day is leavin'
Will you rise like a lion in the morning sun
Or will ya, just lay there bleedin'
When the time has come, return to the kingdom
Close my eyes and be screamin ""freedom""

Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom

We are men of nature
We are made from freedom the earth

'Cause the world is a place
That will eat you alive in one day

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it´ll all turn around

All my life I´ve been waiting for
I´ve been praying for
For the people to say
That we don´t wanna fight no more
They´ll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day (one day), One day (one day)
One day (one day), One day (one day)
One day (one day), One day (one day)

It´s not about
Win or lose
We all lose
When they feed on the souls of the innocent
Blood drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the waters stay raging
In this maze you can lose your way (your way)
It might drive you crazy
But don't let it faze you no way (no way)

Stop with the violence
Down with the hate
One day we´ll all be free

to shine a warmth into eternity, this is an eternal decree,
We'll dance like flames for there's no gravity,
for now I'm just a candle trying to stay lit in this windy night.

Got to crush my fantasies of how this life is supposed to be

Bring my broken heart to an invisible king with a hope
one day you might answer me, so I pray don't you abandon me.

Your silence kills me;
I wouldn't have it any other way.

You might speak, would it be words and what would you say?

With hopes to find some peace of mind
Now I'm looking for your voice through the chitter-chatter
That doesn't matter that's torn and tattered these angels on a ladder
This laughter
Strip away the extra plaster
I'm crashing fast
It's the morning after
Through the hum and the buzz
The thickness and the fuzz
I jump over puddles to stomp through the sludge

Look for me through the wind and rain
Sunshine remember my name
I'll be coming yes I'm running oh I'm on my way
Just stay and I'll be there by the break of day

Look for me through the wind and rain
Thunder remember my name
I'll be coming yes I'm running oh I'm on my way
Just stay and I'll be there by the break of day

I had to evacuate the premises
You're your own nemesis
The premises you're born and blood and leave the world penniless
I had to remember that there's darkness before the exodus
Split the sea
We'll flee to the next
Come and vent with us
I had to send and blend out
Spent it all on sentences fend off the members of relentless pessimists
I had to miss the world
Looking for the core
Cure my heart so I can live more

Look for me through the wind and rain
Sunshine remember my name
I'll be coming yes I'm running oh I'm on my way
Just stay and I'll be there by the break of day

Look for me through the wind and rain
Thunder remember my name
I'll be coming yes I'm running oh I'm on my way
Just stay and I'll be there by the break of day

Remember my name

City lights shine and I'm on my way
This time tomorrow I'll be on my way
At the break of day I look for you at sunrise
When the tide comes in I lose my disguise

Look for me through the wind and rain
Sunshine remember my name
I'll be coming yes I'm running oh I'm on my way
Just stay and I'll be there by the break of day

Matisyahu,"I told her you must go you can't stay here
She said, ""I know since the death blow
My soul's been old like sand, I'm so tired
It's like my spirit expired""

Remember when I was just a child, yeah
Now I feel like a star at daybreak
'Bout to expire and get lost in the sun
Me and you we got to leave and just run and run

Don't wait for me while I'm down
'Cause I might not get up
All I have is right now
Gonna give you what I got

You are the o-only good thing that I have ever done
We will walk until my blood runs out
Until my heart is burnt you are not alone

(You are the only good thing that I have ever done)
Run, yeah, run, yeah, running away, come we stun you here to stay
Up and down so look both ways trying to live most everyday
If you don't well that's okay, bound to the one and will not sway

Found again his majesty record power radio play (we will walk until my blood runs out)
Climb and climb to outer space, give and take, it's time to taste
Make the best, don't leave no waste (until my heart is burnt you are not alone)
World moves fast, don't lose your place
Wanna build tall, gotta have a strong base
And play like kids and meditate

He sits on top of a mountain
Pumping blood through the veins of creation
Land and sky, he aches for her
But can't find his way, can't live no more

And I ache for her but can't find my way
I can't live no more, she is not alone
Just before the light goes away comes a child
That collects all the reasons to be

The laughs, the smiles, moments of clarity
Exchanging them for another day
Exchanging them for another day
And so my heart continues to say

You are the only good thing that I have ever done
We will walk until my blood runs out
Until my heart is burnt you are not alone

(You are the only good thing that I have ever done)
Here we go, it's you and me, gotta let go, gotta believe
Rip through negativity, find some place where we can be
Oh, I agree inevitably we can't stay here, it's time to leave

We will walk until my blood runs out (slip and slide the day has come)
Until my heart is burnt you are not alone (undone, bottoms up don't be a crumb, undumb)

(You are the only good thing that I have ever done)
She said, ""We got to go, we can't stay here""
I said,"" I know but got no place to go
The nights are cold and we need a place to be""

(We will walk until my blood runs out, (until my heart is burnt you are not alone))
Remember when I was just a child
Now I feel like a star at daybreak 'bout to expire
And get lost in the sun
Me and you we gotta leave and just run and run

(You are the only good thing that I have ever done)
Run and run, run and run away
We can't stay, we can't stay

We will walk until my blood runs out (run, run)

Who's that singing, wind is rushing in my ear,
Mind gushing memories almost lost everything,
Felony and fellows running in my dream,
We were in the van where the hits were driving,
Saw myself In the highlands at age 13
And I'm asking questions to the present day me,
Moving backwards down the hill see we were posting.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

I don't need to glorify,
Ate the apple of the tree and tried to lie,
In the garden I'll remember
That's when I started to sing
I said death brings life into uncertain things,
Cut some slack for me
Sun setting autumn breeze
Sound is moving like a chorus
Keep hearing that melody,
Check the radio but there's nothing playing,
Check the radio again but there's nothing playing.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

Rewind!

Swing low, sweet chariot of flames
Change my name, yo!
It was always the same,
Till if only what you find when you climb,
Check the radio but of all that shines there's no time,
My life is making your mind work in overtime,
But along the line you'll have to pay for the crime.
Slow it down, you turbo too soon,
Vroom vroom then you want to blast off unto the moon,
But you might get trapped in a temple of doom,
You might get trapped in a temple of doom.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.

Matisyahu,"Sit back, in these days 
Remember my ways 
Oh, will I ever get out of my cage? 
Yes, I am a slave 

Searching for some freedom 
Searching for some freedom 

So intend to sing them 
Songs to spark memory 
What is a man with no history? 
Who am I?
Where am I? 
What is this place? 
We're just spinning in space 

I will be light 
I will be light 
I will be light 
I will be light, oh mama, light some

Time will continue without you 
So in the end 
It's not about you 
But what did you do? 
Who do you love besides you?
Beside you, many died in the name of vanity 
Many die, in their mind's eye, for justice 
We die for you 
And still do, so I say to you 
This is nothing new 

I will be light, oh mama
I will be light
I will be light, hey mama
I will be light 

One tiny moment in time 
For life to shine, to shine 
Burn away the darkness, you got

One tiny moment in time 
For life to shine, to shine
Burn away the darkness, you got one tiny moment in time
For life to shine, to shine
So burn away the darkness, you got one tiny moment in time
For life to shine, to shine
So burn away the darkness, said one tiny moment in time

I will be light 
I will be light, now, oh mama 
I will be light, light some",I Will Be Light [Live Acoustic] [Live][Version]
Matisyahu,"You're all that I have and you're all that I need
Each and every day I pray to get to know you please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till midnight
Said, thank you to my God, now I finally got it right
And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my god all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now so it's time we start revealing

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my God all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now

Strip away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high then you're bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If you're cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the water's and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Looking up to the sky and searchin' beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
Yes, you keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray,
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my God all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now so it's time we start revealing

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my God all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now

And see, I lift up my eyes where my help come from
And I seen it circling around from the mountain
Thunder!
You feel it in your chest
You keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest
You're not vexed

When I look to the sky where my help come from
And I've seen it circling around from the mountain
Thunder!
You feel it in your chest",King Without a Crown
Matisyahu,"When the house was burned
We returned to the desert and mourned
Son's slaughtered, daughter's raped
Like they closed the drapes
Gone away are the sun's rays
And the days when our children play
Now they been crushed like grapes
There ain't no escape
This is your place, this is your kingdom
This is your face, broken reflection

We're burning in a burnt down house
We burned this house a long time ago

Silent victim from bite of regret
Sick with a symptom of a name we forget
Forgotten skeleton, no dignity left
Unforgiven, we are forgotten
So
Fill with the venom of an ancient fire that burned our kingdom
The day the high priest sang the anthem
This is your place, this is your kingdom
This is your face, broken reflection
Who have we become, what will we become?
One day the moon will shine like the sun
And our hearts will feel the love and be numb
Take out your drum and your harps to strum
This is your place, this is your kingdom
This is your face, broken reflection

We're burning in a burnt down house
We burned this house a long time ago",Temple
Matisyahu,"You're the son of his majesty
Remember how it used to be
In the light of day it's easy to see
Now it's nighttime, yeah
You had to leave

Separated from the king
Now the water's gushing and you keep trying to swim against the stream
It seems like you're not moving, the many waters gushing you gasp for air
Almost drowning ears ringing, once upon a time we were singing
One day those trees will stand and clap hands
Stream of thought getting caught in the klipa, this place is just a shell, external

Taken from the world above, and brought down this world below
Warrior, fighting for your soul

Re-unite them, re-unite them, return the princess to her king
Said re-unite them, re-united, she's been taken for so long
Re-unite them, re-unite and then she'll be filled with joy
Said, ah, re-unite them, re-united like the days of her youth

Descended to this pit
What's that feeling, I can't get rid of it
I'm so sick, I can't seem to shake it
When one retires at night weeping, joy will come in the morning
You made my mountain stand strong

Warrior, fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above, and brought down this world below
Warrior, fighting for your soul
Taken from the world above, and brought down to this world below

Ancient memory, remember how it used to be
Close your eyes and breathe in
The scent of freedom
Ringing across the sea
Land of milk and honey
One day, we'll wake up from this dream and we'll stop sleeping
Oh, yo, yo, yo, yo and then we'll see clearly, no, no, no

I don't know who you are, even when we face each other
When I wake up I know you're here this is everything you've done
I've got nothing to fear cause the battle's already been won.

Sublime love cuts like a razor

Just want someone to walk the line
Next to me cause all alone
You're a king without his throne
Don't ya know it's time to come home
Found his people you're alone
I'm done tryin' this, I'm done tryin' that
It comes down to this, it came down to that

We can make it all alright

Lookin' up into your clouds searchin' for a face
They say I may be just a crazy fool
But my DNA, runs thick like blood
An I'll be stuck in the mud, trudging through the quicksand
A man with a plan so stand and deliver

With my eyes on the prize and my hands reaching up to the sky
They wanna know why with my life on the line
Like my mothers and fathers one thousand times
And it's bound to repeat or you're gon' go back to the earth
This a noun for the sound
One day, I'll leave it all behind
I am yours, you are mine
There's no reason, there's no rhyme
There's no logic in these lines
It's above this space in time
It's above all of their minds
When the time comes I'll close mine
Open up your eyes

Run this race
There's no end in sight
Together we can handle this
We can make it all alright

This far I've done lost my mind
Only to find the other side

Is where the world opens wide
To descend these city streets late at night
I've been searching for my bite
They say I inspired, but I'm still looking for my fire
These lies have got me tired
I'm free falling, I'm done stalling
I'm done crawling up this mountain top
I won't stop till I manifest my craft
The top is close
I'm sky scraping
They stay chasing
I'm like racing in the Sun, I'm running from depths
They're done, I'm going gray
I'm still young having mystic visions
Of the one, I hear the hum, the melody comes
Rushing in like some wind

Cleaning off the dirt beneath my feet
I got the speed on repeat
While I'm riding subway trains on a fact
Over tracks to go crack, my heart's black
But intact I've come to take the music back
I'm moving forward this time you can't ignore it
Put the pedal to the floor
Let's take you off
Through the time that has come
The time has come I launch orbit
I'm tight rope
Walking over fire with flames, yeah hot coals
I'm like water for you trolls
I pay no tolls
Speak to ghosts
Time to go high
The cross that you walk by
Got my eye into
I'll magic fly off on the broom
Which is true,
I'm at the crossroads, but I'll give my soul
It's already old

Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high

I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high

The chariot, the flames, it's my home
I'm in a class of my own

But the digging you must do yourself (the digging you must do yourself)

Let go of what y'all know
Return to the land of the rainbow
Where the sun hang low and the wind doth blow
And the tide it move so slow
Creeps and more through the window
Return to the land where the wild mare roam
And the buffalo go, yeah the buffalo go

Where the wild mare roam and
Cross the countryside search far and wide
Dig into the wheats upon the other side
Streams and the rivers and the oceans and the streets
Gonna swim with the fishes till I'm deep

I've been searchin' far and wide
I've been searchin' for you

Lift your eyes upon the other side
Sunrise and I fight to sleep through the night
Leap upon the skies on the clouds so high
When I fly by the heights feeling oh so right
Finally find the land and I'm kickin' up sand

When I stand and deliver the plan
Would you please back down
Or get slammed to the ground
When my slams strike thunder
While your village is under

Now you wonder why you going under
Got yo' self on the run from the number one
That you can't run from
You spin and faint
You feel hunger (hunger)

I've been searchin' for you
I've been searchin' far and wide
I've been searchin' for you
All my life (my life)
All my life (my life)

In the Earth, there are so many wonderful treasures. And if you know where
To dig, you will find gold, diamonds (diamonds, diamonds)

I've been searchin' for you

I've been searchin' for you
All my life (my life)

And if you know where to dig, 
You will find gold, diamonds, jewellery, all kinds of treasures.

Keeping it on till the day is done
Morning till the night time blaze is on

Sometimes I get so crazed

'Cause you're my light through the haze

Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again

Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mind
Be my golden sunshine
It's raining in your mind
So push them clouds aside
Forever by my side
You're my golden sunshine

When the sun set I let myself down
Found the ground beneath my feet gone
No more words were there to speak
On that day my song was born
Never meant to leave you all alone
Said I'd be your shelter from the storm
Now your clothes have all been torn
Kingdom sacked attacked and dethroned

It's time for a champion
Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again

Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand

You're on your own
Time to grow and be a man
Want to fly high like peter pan
No more never never land
So lose your backpack filled with sand
Come along and take my hand
We'll walk together for forever

Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mind

Doves cry when I blaze through the night

Same city, same drone
Scenery change but my zone stayed unknown
You were with me, now I'm not in control
Fold crash and crumble and I decompose
And run back to the grass
Back to the last moment intact
In a flash it'll be over
And we'll be back

Suns down streets are cold
I sold the last possession
And I'm all alone

Where the wild wind sings
Where the whirlwind burns
Where the madness rings
In the crisp night sky
Where the air might sting and bring the reasons why
Ancient child, I swim the Nile
With my rude boy style the wild child
I get lost for a while when I'm under attack
I took my freedom back and took the path unmapped

Matisyahu,"""Of David.Annotate Do not compete with the wicked; do not envy those who commit injustice. For like grass they will soon wither, like green vegetation. Trust in the Lord and do good, then you will abide in the land and be nourished by faith. Delight in the Lord, and He will guard your desires and needs, and take care of you. You reveal your righteousness like a light, and your judgments are on high. Depend on the Lord and hope for Him; compete not with the prosperous, with the man who invents evil schemes. Let go of anger, abandon rage; do not compete with one who intends only to harm. For the evildoers will be cut down; but those who hope in the Lord, they will inherit the earth.""

I just wanna talk to You now
This is for the One
You kept me alive
And so I thank You

Moses is on his way down town
Yoshua maintaining the fountain
Right about now I should be over Chicago, lights out the window
Levee breaks, flow like diamonds
All these babies crying, ideas flying around
It’s time to come down from the mountain
Welcome home, just stick to the plan
But how can I be like the stars and sand?
It's only man who commands
He put this one in our hands
Two tabs of stone, I'm alone while these fans keep circling
Over the land like helicopter blades, I crave some breeze
Will you wait, wait for me, please?
Forty days and forty nights, but I can't stand much more
So you think you understand what’s pure and impure?
Now it's pouring my soul on the floor
You think ya know so much, that I'm so out of touch
I tossed in the crutch to the אֵשׁ תָּמִיד
I walk with a limp, with a wound that bleeds
While all these animals feed with their envy and greed
Smoke marijuana seed
Wanna chop this tree
Cut me down, pressure to concede
And give in to what they believe is me
But I'ma fight, I'm a light, I'm the glory of the King
I'm the song that you sing, the melody that you bring
Sharp teeth and venom that stings not gonna bring me to my knees
I'm a fish in this here sea, evil eye won't get at me
I just want to finish this thing
Not gonna bring me to my knees
I'm going down, down to go up
From the pits to מצרים, from the dungeon to the kingdom
To my stage offering, can't give up and won't give in
I am the blood of Jacob and I'll keep struggling
Like Joseph, my brothers wanna sell me out
I had the dream, time to leave the doubt
Multicolored coat with blood on my sleeves
Best believe it ain't from no beasts
Got no car, I walked around this reservoir
This is David’s heart, rainbow-colored cry
From the end to the start, this is David’s heart
A rainbow-colored cry from the end to the start
Phantoms and ghosts, raise your glass and make a toast

Sweeping up the broken crowns

Passé 4 heures do matin, why'a plus rien à faire
J'ai qu'une chose à proposer, on s'finit au cimetière
Viens groover dans les allées, le respect ça gère
Chanter une petite chanson, pour le Grave Digger
Ca va pas les emmerder, à 6 pieds sous terre
Juste un poeu d'animation, ça fait marrer Werner
Un jour on interdira, mon anniversaire
Ca m'étonnerait pas qu'ce soit pour la prochaine guerre
Je compte sur vos p'tits enfants, pour venir me distraire
Dites-leur d'aller faire un tour, au fond de mon cimetière.

Et on est allés en boîte mais why avait qu'des lesbiennes

On a noyé en même temps toutes les Parisiennes

Matmatah,"How far I remember the day
I lost my wife
I thought that losing her was the end of my life
But I held on and thought there was something better
Than sinking like a stone, so I became a gravedigger

Staying home, living alone, dropping tears on my own
I do have never known where these voices come from
As sweet as the morn, they were just saying :
""Son, Hey, there's work to be done among coffins and bones""

Then all over the years, buried pounds of corpses
Saw gallons of tears and drank thousands of beers
I buried some lawyers
I buried some junkies
I buried some preachers
I buried some bitches
I buried my mother
I buried my sister
I buried some miners
I buried gravediggers

Old enough to give in, I am digging your vault
And in the state I'm in, you may think it's not yours
Digging deeper and deeper as you're getting ever colder
Anyhow you can rave, I won't fall in the grave

For the rest of my years I'll bury pounds of corpses
see gallons of tears and drink thousand of beers
I'll bury you lawyers
I'll bury you junkies
I'll bury you preachers
I'll bury you bitches
I'll bury your Queen
I'll bury your mother
I'll bury your king
Oh, I'll bury you brother

Yes I'll bury you dreamers
And bury your teachers
And bury you friend

Outside the windows of my heart
So cold and shivering
There in your world that is so dark

I wish that I could set you free
From all your insecurities
But you threw away the key
When you locked the door

I tried to love you
I tried to keep you from harm
But I might as well be holding
The wind in my arms
Oh, I can't give you shelter
When you are the storm

There is a wind tonight
That blows and chills me to the bone
Here by the fireside
Even the heat can't keep me warm

I'm haunted by your troubled soul
That rages so out of control
But I had to let you go
I had to let you go

I tried to love you
I tried to keep you from harm
But I might as well be holding
The wind in my arms

If you'll ever change
Then I hear the lightning
And thunder and the rain

I walked the streets of this little town
Late last night when it all shut down
Feeling stuck between lost and found and nowhere

Using my memory for a map
I went looking for trains on the torn up tracks
With a weary conductor, he just turned his back but he's still there

Waiting for the resurrection
Fire from the ashes and the tears
The resurrection
You know dreams die hard, dreams die hard around here

Well, it's hard to believe I'm back again
Looking up old lovers and long lost friends
Just to reminisce like the veterans and survivors

I heard Reverend Bill with the kind old face
Say he got alittle stale and he's been replace
Still we all bowed our heads when he said grace at the diner 

Waiting for the resurrection
Fire from the ashes and the tears
The resurrection
You know dreams die hard, dreams die hard around here

Well, the engine dies and the main line fails
But surely the heart and the soul prevails
Like the wildflowers grow between the rails in the summer 

Oh, the resurrection

You know dreams die hard

It was a long, hard road
It was all up hill
We nearly lost our way
We nearly lost our will
So we clung to the rocks
Where the cold winds blow
Till love gave us strength to finally let go

We, we climbed that mountain
And we got so high
Then on the wings of an angel
We took to the sky
Out here on the edge
Love dares us to try
Baby some people fall, but some people fly

Many they fall
For passion's kiss
And many they say
Is this all there is
Well, it never was easy
To rise above
To look into the eyes of love

We, we climbed that mountain
And we got so high
Then on the wings of an angel
We took to the sky
Out here on the edge
Love dares us to try
Baby some people fall, but some people fly

And baby love has no fear
Leap and a net will appear

Sunday morning, a quarter past ten
The congregation says amen
The friends and neighbors come rolling in
Amazing grace and original sin
The preacher said one of us had strayed
We sort of shuffled in that nervous way
And then we all breathed a sigh of relief
When Jimmy Miller fell to his knees

When everbody sings I Saw the Light
'Cause we all try to do what's right
From Sunday morning to Saturday night

Betty Miller found a younger man
Went to Memphis with a brand new plan
And poor ol' Jimmy didn't have a clue
He was too busy chasing you know who
The preacher prayed and Jimmy just cried
And we all tried to act surprised
That Betty left in his brand new car
We saw it all last night at the bar

But there's a little ancient poodle
Waiting there for her at home
And she'll tell you all about him like he was her only child
And rubs her swollen ankles

Sweet Abilena looked out at the Midwestern sky
Sweet seventeen with a far away look in her eyes.
She said, ""I feel like a bird in a cage, but come September I'm flying away.""
I said ""I'll miss you,"" then I made her promise to write

Since we were tall as the corn in the spring
We shared every secret, shared every dream
So anxious to grow in the new summer rain
And bloom like a rose on the calico plains

How could she hear as we laughed on that long summer night
The tiny heart of the baby she carried inside
I stood beside her when September came
Watched her get married, then caught the bouquet
And like those hand-me-down dresses she gave me
I made her dreams mine

From a seat by the window on wings made of steel
I stared at the patchwork over the fields
Where young tears that once flowed like warm summer rain
Were turning to snow on the calico plains

And float down grand street in daylight 
And float down grand street in daylight 
And float down grand street in daylight 
And float down grand street in daylight 
And float down grand street in daylight 
And float down grand street in daylight

And with just half of a sunburn 
New yellow lines that I earned 
Step back and here comes the night time 
Step back and here comes the night time 

And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine 
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames 
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone 
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home

And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine

Matt & Kim,"Show me the sidestreets in your life
Train yards like boneyards sharpened knives
Sidewalks are unassuming fields
Concrete and cracks won't cut you deals
Lost teeth like white jewels of some kind
Petty theft for penny crimes
And we yell
Ahh like a good old fashion nightmare


Riding trains to the end of lines
Still we've got nothin but time
The skyline looks brighter tonight
Lets go smash out every light
Your left foot in front of right
And we yell
Ahh like a good old fashion nightmare",Good Ol' Fashion Nightmare
Matt & Kim,"I wanna sleep through the weekend
I wanna try
I wanna walk on my own floor
Before I die

And now, now the band tunes up
And now remember your lines
And all morning I woke up
And all day long no time

I wanna bring back the bison
I wanna try
I wanna close up the cabinets
Before I die

And now, now the band tunes up
And now remember your lines
And all morning I woke up
And all day long no time

Matt & Kim,"Pull out all the stops
We are coming home tonight
A pair of old boxing gloves
In a new fight
Where every single scar
Well it means something to me
As if life wrote down my history

bottles and road signs
Sound like tires on bent wheels
Our hands and feet and ordinary thrills
When we unlocked all the doors
Just so we could finally breathe
Just so we could sew down these torn up sleeves

here we stand with a wolf like shadow
Here we stand in the end
Hey New York here's our wolf like shadow
Hey New York our old friend

this roof could be my bed
Blankets feel like the night sky
Blankets feel better the heavier they get
Red lights can mean go
I'll take us home
I'll take us home
Cut down the blinds from my windows
I stood back on the couch
Remembered this is my life
With my hands over my head
Friends by my side

here is where we'll go
I'll take us home

Tape holds things that cannot stick
And keep leftovers in the fridge
While lessons learned go down the drain
I can't believe in everything
All the bad names gone
And the good ones were all wrong

And so I stayed up all night
Slept in all day
This is my sound
Thinking about tomorrow won't change how
I feel today

Da da da-da-da-da, da da da
Da da da-da-da-da
(repeat)

Never let your mark erase
'cause broken legs can be replaced
Two steps to the finish line
Three sips till I finish mine
A straw will always suck it out
Close your eyes and use your mouth
And tell me about your song

And so I stayed up night
Slept in all day

Thinking about tomorrow won't change how

Came down on me
I'm begging you now

Someday spare change
Won't feel the same
Stand up real tall
And wait to be called

Thoughts so strong
I feel them when you're gone
Oh, thoughts so strong
I feel them when you're gone

And these old walks in the park
And meetings after dark
A sore sight for sore eyes
And wild and free, you've got no place to be

Oh, comes down to hope
Came down on me

",Spare Change
Matt & Kim,"Please direct my call
Like strings and cans through halls
I made some out of lead
And I tried them out from bed
Couldn't make it through the walls

Turn this boat around
We're starting to go down
But it begins to rain
You forgot how dark it stains
Thought it was a drought

La la la, leave it all behind
La la la, see the fight
La la la, make the best of it
La la la, and goodnight

Left turn look both ways
Take breaks on cloudy days
With miles and miles of roads
How'd you know which ones have holes?
I'm glad we didn't stay

La la la, leave it all behind
La la la, see the fight
La la la, until the end
La la la, and goodnight

Watch out for late phone calls, we face them concrete walls
Go to far, live too long, time's too short, right and wrong
Block after block, block after block
Rolled down gates look the same, different trips, different trains

Hey friends, break in the back door
And turn it up while the lights are out
Eyes closed and shouting right now

Block after block, block after block
If one way, now unwise, what was left now is right

And cut it down while the lights are out

And I'm not sure that I hear mountains grow from just one note

Matt & Kim,"Sun's going down let's get together
On the bridge we'll meet up tonight

Black pants, red sweatshirt and brown bags
Above the East River's northern lights

You see what I see
I thought it make believe
Watched the sunrise
On my street

Old cement makes for
A solid place to lay
Bed of light grey
My bed of light grey

While I know it's letters
That can spell
I hear now it's words that can say

I decided to start writing less
And I'm talking more everyday

A five seat bright red van
Curbside view
Turn off of Grand

We'll be gone when we're dead

We'll steal and throw through their window
My water comes straight from the tap
And those bottles are all just for show

I see that we're made of
More then blood and bones
See we're made of
Sticks and stones

Need locks for your keys
Don't forget to breathe now
Forget to breathe now

Hope you sneaked in all of my friends just so we could leave together.
The books I won't read,
The air that I will breathe,
The colors I'd have seen,
I'll leave these pages in the trees.

Today, leave good for great
Leave sleep for late
Leave good for great
Leave sleep for late
Leave good for great
Leave sleep for late
Leave good

So many books that I didn't read,
But there's so much air I chose to breathe.
How about the colors that I've seen?
So I'll leave these pages in the trees.

I don't sit alone, I pick up my phone.
One day we'll say all that we had.
The beaten path is beaten fast.
I'm practicing hooks and jabs.

I traced a few lines, misread all the signs, slipped many times.
My blood's still red and I'm just fine.
Today, leave good for great
Leave sleep for late

Moving from place to place, another town, a different face

I prefer my own company.

Every evening when all my day's work is through

I call my baby and ask her what schould we do?
I mention movies but she don't think with me beg.
And then she asks me why don't I come to her flat
And have some supper and let the evening pass by
By digging records beside a groovy hi-fi.
I say yeh-yeh, that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh.

My baby loves me
She gets me feelin' so fine

The way she loves me she makes me know that she's mine.
And when she kisses I feel the fire get hot

She never misses
She gives it all that she's got.
And when she asks me if ev'rything is okay

I got my answer
The only thing I can say,
I say yeh-yeh; that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh.

We'll play a melody
And turn the lights down low so none can see.
We gotta do that
We gotta do that

We gotta do that
We gotta do that.
And there'll be no one else alive
In all the world than you and me.

Pretty baby
I never knew such a thrill

It's hard to tell you because I'm trembling still.
But
Pretty baby
I want you all for my own

Before I count to three, step to it baby.

She goes out every night till the morning is light
And she sleeps all day,
So come on, get up, I won't say it again,
I'll drag you out.

I don't care any more, you can sleep on the floor,
'Cause I'm locking you out,
So come on, get up, I won't say it again,
I'll drag you out.

Matt Bianco,"Who said that dreams that you plan
Will always slip through your hands to the man
Who always gets in your way, day after day
Who said that love was a thing
For someone else to believe in your heart
You're always running away
Why can't you stay

Hear me when I say
That things are getting better
Never be afraid
In a day what a day
When I'm spending it with you
And every time you say
That life is so much more
Then I'm blown away
Golden days

Hey what you say is it time
To free yourself
From yourself in your mind
Like a Phoenix you'll rise
With hope in your eyes
Hey what you say is it time
To face the truth
Have some peace in your life
This I hope and I pray
That you'll find a way",Golden Days

Cause it was just too soon to say goodbye forever
Oh, it feels to soon for us to say goodbye
But if there’s one thing I could see
That helps to ease the suffering 
It was the hope inside your eyes when hope was gone

Is there a place on the other side
Where you can rest your head tonight
I need to know it’ll be alright
And on the wings of angels you will fly

Well, I know your life was never easy
And you wrestled with your demons till the end
But it’s your laughter and your songs that I’ll be missing
It’s what you will always be remembered for
Now in the wake of seeing endings and beginnings
Oh it’s hard to think about eternity
So now I’m asking for a sign
To make some sense here in my mind
When all I really want is to believe

Is there a place on the other side
Where you can rest your head tonight
I need to know it’ll be alright
And on the wings of angels you will fly

And in the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
We shall meet on that beautiful shore",The Other Side

I don’t want to lose this
I don’t want to lose this feeling

Please say that we’ll never settle for anything less
Than what we’re feeling
Please say that we’ll never settle for anything less

Has captured the places we try to hide

It’s easier to say goodbye

And taking it in, the silence is everything

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Matt Darey,"Your shining light will be my guide.
Leads me to a place where I donÂ´t need to hide,
The Heavens open up the door.
With dreams so innocent and pure.

You are beautiful within the rays of light.
You are beautiful without the jewels of life.
Let your spirit capture me, my love is blind,
You are beautiful within, You are beautiful without.
You are beautiful within.

You are beautiful tonight,
In amongst the rays of light,
Your silhouette it shines,
YouÂ´re an angel you are free,
Let your spirit baptize me,
And elevate my mind.",Beautiful [Video][Multimedia Track]
Matt Dennis,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

I have a lovely disposition
That's very strange in me
And life's as sweet as it can be

From every care my mind is free
So I repeat, with your permission
There's been a change in me!
 
Have you heard I married an angel
I'm sure that the change'll be awf'lly good for me
Have you heard an angel I married
To heaven she's carried this fellow with a kiss
She is sweet and gentle, so it isn't strange
When I'm sentimental, she loves me like an angel
Now you've heard, I married an angel
This beautiful change'll be awf'lly good for me

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,

I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.

I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due

And then it had to be with you

Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.

But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,

A mistress so impossible, so cruel yet wonderful 
Wise men have lost their wits over you 

You make me believe you're back for good each time 
Then you go and when you leave 
You take my pride but I need you still 
A man can need love but love never will 
You're cold as ice, cold as ice 

And even when you're close to me, you're still a whisper of a dream

Life's too short to waste sweet time, love is gone now you must start
Deep blue eyes smile at you across the room 
You say that his brown, and he is not the guy that you once knew 

Don't go looking for, that heart you loved before 
You can't replace him with the same kind of face 
Don't dream that sweet old dream. Its not the final scene 
Be open to somebody else, someone new. 

Change brings fear as clouds will always bring the rain, 
But when it finally clears their sun will shine to make it bright again 
Let love in, you might feel it deeper still, 
But if you hide away, I swear you never will

Life goes on a never-ending tale 
Of love reborn, from the cradle warm

Life goes on like a spinning wheel 
Life goes on never standing still 
The gods decide how blessed am I 
The days to come for every mother's son 

And these footprints in the sand maybe nothing grand 
But if we leave a mark in somebody's heart, what more can I say 
Than I was a king for a day 
Once the web is spun, for every mother's son 

Life goes on like a tapestry 
Life goes on each thread a part of me 
That master plan of who I am

It took five hours to say goodbye 
Five weeks to wonder why
And five months of just rain 

I had a path 
That led me home 
It gathered no moss 
But now I'm alone 

There was five minutes without air 
Five hours without meaning 
Five weeks without insight 
And Five months 'till I sing

No warning signs 
To pause for justice 
No peace for a while

Each memory a rush of joy and pain 
If only I could hold you once again!

Should'a held her in my arms said baby no, please wait

Matt Dusk,"I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always been beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

For there's nowhere else on earth that I'd rather be
Let the time go by, I don't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Matt Dusk,"Where were you when my first love came callin'
My heart kept on fallin' like a stone?
Where were you when, I left home for college
Traded that first love for knowledge?

I've lived in the dark, I've refused to forgive
But somehow I knew there was more I could give

Long before you came to me I laid beneath the evergreens
Dreamed this day would come if only I had known
Far beyond the eye could see my soul knew what was best for me
I only had to wait and for that I have faith in love

Who held your hand on your first day to school?
Who read to you that night?
Who broke your heart for the first time?
Did you cry out loud just to know why?

Have you lived in the dark or refused to forgive?

Dreamed this day would come if only I had known
Far beyond the eye could see my soul knew what was best for me

Matt Dusk,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs, never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
But the world will always welcome lovers

But it doesn't know if it's coming or going
There is fashion, there is fad
Some is good, some is bad

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

Matt Hammitt,"I have a hope
I have a treasure
I have found a place
Where I have no need for my earthly possessions

And my worries just fade away
And when sickness and death are at my door
Trying to steal from me
They cannot take what I've already laid down
At Jesus' feet

You are my treasure
Your love lasts forever

And I have a peace that I don't understand
When I know where I stand with You
And I already have everything that I need
And You're all that I have to lose

Trying to steal from me
They cannot take what I've already laid down

Matt Harris,"Long ago and far away, I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast but now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine, Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Matt Haviland,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Matt Herskowitz,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem

And shimmer right in front of my eyes

And dim reflections but
You shine, you shine so much brighter, oh

So honey let me sing you a song
And listen to my words
As they come out wrong, but don't
Run away, run away, this time

And honey let me look in your eyes
You can open them one at a time, but don't
Look away, look away, this time

So please don't leave me
Don't meet me outside
Leave me outside, oh no

Oh, and honey I'll try, honey I'll try to hold you
Like the starry skies, we lie beneath tonight
'Cause you shine, you shine so much brighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh

So honey let me sing you a song
And listen to my words
As they come out wrong, but don't
Run away, run away, this time

And honey let me look in your eyes
You can open them one at a time, but don't
Look away, look away, this time

Oh, I'm walking on a wire, 'cause you're all I want now
So don't feed me to the fire, and I won't let you down
And please don't hide, these things we say tonight
Can help us get our feet back on the ground

So honey let me sing you a song
And listen to my words
As they come out wrong, but don't
Run away, run away, this time

And honey let me look in your eyes
You can open them one at a time, but don't
Look away, no, look away
No, look away, don't look away, oh

And honey let me sing you a song
And listen to my words
As they, come out wrong, but don't
Run away, run away this time

Matt Hires,"Pretty girls come from the ugliest places
You come from the worst of them all
Heart-breakers like you are hard to erase
You lift me up just so I fall
I followed you all the way down to the coast
And we kissed under traveling skies
I wish I had seen what was coming for me
But you wear such a lovely disguise

Hey you've got a restless heart
Beating out out out on your sleeve
And I won't let this fire start
You say love is all that you need
Well you're not gonna get it from me
Oh-oh, oh-oh, no you're not gonna get it from me

You say that you wanted a lover
Someone to cover your head when it rains
But even a hopeless romantic like me
Yeah I know that it's all just a game
Everyone's looking for love
Looking for something to hold on to
Oh I've been looking for 25 years
And I know I won't find it in you

Hey you've got a restless heart
Beating out out out on your sleeve
And I won't let this fire start
You say love is all that you need
Well you're not gonna get it from me
Oh-oh, oh-oh, no you're not gonna get it from me

I won't let you break my heart
I won't let you break
I won't let you break my heart

Matt Hires,"I want to let you take me where it started 
Through the days into the night 
Where everybody moved slowly 
We had all the night alone 
Never caught you in the daytime 
You showed me things that i never knew before 
Then you went away and came back 
I've been patient for so long cause 

All this time that I've been waiting 
for this moment to come alive 
And all my life I've known for sure 
that you'd be coming back for more 
Forever, never gonna let it go forever 

Picked up an old daydream 
Let it take me where I want to be 
Where verybody moved slowly 
And the world was silently asleep 
Now show me where you soend the daytime 
Show mw all that I never knoe before 
Ill let you go away and come back

Has left you here with
Nothing but a name

Matt Hires,"Twelve o'clock.
The lights are glowing on the sidewalk of the cars.
A river moving down the street.
The subways rumble underneath my feet.

So why oh why am I the only one
To see the gold inside
The only one to hear the music in the mystery, 
The music when she looks at me.

I hear the rhythm of the midnight rain.
My heart is beating like a bullet train
To the melody in my blood.
Ohh Voices ringing in the city streets
Sirens turning into symphonies.
If I'm dreaming don't wake me up.
This is the sound of falling, 
The sound of falling in love.

A record plays, 
My thoughts are turning into
Crashing tidal waves
That carry all the buildings out to sea.
It doesn't matter much to me.

I'm so caught inside a beautiful commotion.
When chords collide, 
And everything is fine and
There's music in the mystery.
There's music when she looks at me.

I hear the rhythm of the midnight rain.
My heart is beating like a bullet train
To the melody in my blood.
Ohh Voices ringing in the city streets
Sirens turning into symphonies.
If I'm dreaming don't wake me up.
This is the sound of falling, 
The sound of falling in love.

Ooooh ooooh ooooh.

Twelve o'clock.
The lights are glowing on the sidewalk of the cars.
A river moving down the street.
And nothing looks the same to me.

I hear the rhythm of the midnight rain
My heart is beating like a bullet train
To the melody in my blood, 
To the melody in my blood.
Voices ringing in the city streets
Sirens turning into symphonies.
If I'm dreaming don't wake me up.
This is the sound of falling, 
The sound of falling in love.
This is the sound of falling, 
This is the sound of falling, 
The sound of falling in love.",The Sound of Falling in Love
Matt Houston,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",12/0013

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

And stares at me
These two teeth are
Gone as you can see
I don't know just who
To blame for this catastrophe
But my one wish on Christmas Eve
Is as plain as it can be

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could with you
""Merry Christmas.""
It seems so long since I could say
""Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!""

Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be
If I could only whistle (thh)

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you
""Merry Christmas!""

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June

Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves

It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child

In the towers, in the money
In the strong and in the weak

In the orphans and the widows
In the churches and the bars
You are everywhere
God, You are everywhere

Some turn to a drug
Some turn to another's arms

Count the lines on my face and wonder how they got there

Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

How does it feel

To say goodbye

To all the times we had before

Guess it don't matter

It don't matter anymore


If you're ever in Eastern Passage

You'd better not come knockin' on my door

'cause it don't matter

It don't matter anymore


Time, lord give me some time

To rid my head of these things I can't ignore

Like your fists poundin' on my door


All I want some piece of mind to help me get through

Oh, it don't matter,

It don't matter anymore


",It Don't Matter
Matt Mays,"

It came comin' from far away

Riding along plains,

Down through the rivers and streams

To visit me in a dream


I left my life behind

Buried it in the sand

Maybe I'll get back someday and dig it up again


Lost souls stay gone for good

To keep a satisfied mind


I saw it comin' from far away

It was fallin' down with the rain

Movin' from the rivers and streams

Shot it right into the vein


I left my life behind

I buried it in the sand

Maybe I'll get back someday and dig it up again

Maybe I'll get back someday and dig it up again

And dig it up again


Lost souls stay lost for good

Matt Mays,"Oh darlin' I feel your pain 
And the summer rain in your eyes 
I'm desperately trying to get the blue 

Back into your sky 
And darlin' I've been dreamin' of you 
Have you been praying for me' 
As I cast my mind & soul 
To the sea 
I've got a plan 
That will get us through 
I've got a plan 
I spend my days counting counterfeit 
That will slip on through 
For me it's all about you 
I've got a plan 
That will get us through 
I've got a plan 
Oh darlin' I feel your pain 
And the summer rain in your eyes 
I'm desperately trying to get the blue 
Back into your sky 
I've got a plan 
That will get us through 
I've got a plan 
Oh darlin' I feel your pain",The Plan
Matt Mays,"You believe in what nobody else does
In your mind there's no time and a constant buzz
So disregard the master plan
It's a disaster man you better ride it out

I can see it all in your eyes
Your future fades, your minutes are few
When the angels make contact with you


You believe in what nobody else does
And things ain't the way they was
A fool like you is a freak to me
It's unique to me, what you seek to see

I can see it all in your eyes
Your future fades, your minutes are few
When the angels make contact with you


I've seen the future isn't pretty
Killer instinct, love a surprise
Make a stop, build a fire
Hold you breathe, cover your eyes
The tides are turning crimson
Nightfall growing like a cancer
Feeding on your broken body
Isolations not the answer
Listen what the wind says softly
Sound of traffic, smells like paper
Kisses on your worried eyelids
Sleepless nights turn into vapor
Like a dream and as the crow flies
Must reject the pain your trapped in
Give me all your hard earned beauty
Now I'll tell you what will happen

Your day will fade and your thoughts will jade
And you'll wake up in the middle of a dream
Coming up on hard luck, with a moment of silence
And no time to kill, no reason to care
Beware

I can see it all in your eyes
Your future for a dime, anytime
I can see is all in your eyes
Your future for a dime, anytime
I can see it all in your eyes
Your future for a dime, anytime
Your future fades, your minutes are few
When the angels make contact

Matt McAndrew,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us

Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky

I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes

I can't take my eyes off of you

Matt McAndrew,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey, hey, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey, hey, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey, hey, hey

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain old Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the milky way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone
Conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the milky way

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day

Matt McAndrew,"My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped 'er sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She is the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
The fresh poison each week

I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
For good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
For good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

To drain the whole sea get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
Got a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
For good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
For good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence
Than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog
At the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
For good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church

I'll tell you my sins

So I'm not supposed to love you no more
I guess I'm not supposed to care
I held you so close, now I'm holding a ghost
How can love just disappear?
And where does it go when it's over?
I know that it's somewhere out here

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die trying to justify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

Oh, wasted love
Oh, wasted love

It's late, I'm drunk and I'm running on empty tonight
Baby, I'm chasing my shadow around
Like smoke cigarettes I inhale these regrets
I can't change what I've become
There's pain and there's glory, but this is my story
I'm asking everyone

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die trying to testify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

Knocking down doors and I'm pounding the pavement
Lie at your mercy, will somebody save me, save me?

When you get on the whiskey 
When you get on the whiskey

Had me blowing in a tube charged with DUI 
Cuffed, booked and thrown in a cell 
Try to sober up, just telling myself

In a room full of drunks surrounded by steel

And I swear by God if I ever see the sun
Over any length of time, I can hold it in my mind
Then I will never again go down underground

And he swears there will never be another on
In the dark recess of the mine, where you age before your time
And the coal dust lies heavy on your lungs

At the age of sixty-four, if he lives that long, he'll greet you at the door
And he'll gently lead you by the arm
In the dark recess of the mine, he can take you back in time
Tell you of the hardships that were there

Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do you win again

He'll give his heart but all in vain

And I know there were times that you carried a lot of the load
We had to fight sometimes to stay alive
And there were those amongst us like to see us take a dive
But you held your head up high
You wouldn't lie!
You had the strength to carry me when I was down
You gave me the guts little girl to get off the ground
And the road might have taken us apart sometimes
And I might have even damaged your heart sometimes
But this love I have is true
I give it to you

I hope the world don't grind on you
I hope that nothing unwinds you
I hope that trouble never finds you
I hope that no one undermines you 

Treat you mean or be unkind to you
You know I'll always be behind you
I hope trouble never finds you without me
There was a time when I thought I really might loose you
And it chilled my heart and soul baby through and through

This love I have is true I give it to you

Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through

But while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Before the fiddlers have fled,
Before they ask us to pay the bill,
And while we still have that chance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Soon, we'll be without the moon,

And love and romance,

On a mule, in a jet
With your hair in a net
In a towel wringing wet
I don't care, this is where you should be
From the hills, from the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the highway to dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world, only just come back to me
Blast your hide, hear me call
Must I fight City Hall
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me
What on Earth must I do
Scream and yell till I'm blue
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon
Or to wreck and to ruin
Mademoiselle, where in Hell can you be?
Leave a sign on your door
Out to lunch ever more
In a Royce or a van, wrapped in mink or Saran
Anyway that you can, come back to me
Hear my voice through the din
Feel the waves on your skin
Like a call from within, come back to me
Leave behind all your own
Tell your flowers you will phone
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me
Let your tub overflow
If a date waits below
Let him wait for Godot
Come by rail,
Come by mail, COD
Par avion, par bateau
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux
Come by steam, come by gas
Call for free on a pass
On the drags and the glass, come back to me
Leave your bills all unpaid
Let your bed go unmade
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me
Come by sail, come by freight
In a box or a tray, keep your head on the plate
I don't care this is where you should be
Come in pain or in joy
As a girl, as a boy
In a bag or a trunk (Shut up!)
On a horse or a drunk
In the flora or faun, come back to me
Come back to me, come back

""Will you stop bothering me?""",Come Back to Me
Matt Monro,"Gray skies are gonna clear up,
Put on a happy face;
Brush off the clouds and cheer up,
Put on a happy face.

Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy,
It's not your style;
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Ya' decide to smile!

Pick out a pleasant outlook,
Stick out that noble chin;
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look,
Slap on a happy grin!

And spread sunshine all over the place,
Just put on a happy face!
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine

I knew a girl so gloomy
She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing

So spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
So, put on a happy face",Put on a Happy Face
Matt Monro,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Matt Monro,"Till the end of time,
Long as stars are in the blue,
Long as there's a spring, a bird to sing,
I'll go on loving you.

Till the end of time,
Long as roses bloom in May,
My love for you will grow deeper,
With every passing day.

Till the wells run dry,
And each mountain disappears,
I'll be there for you, to care for you,
Through laughter and through tears.

So, take my heart in sweet surrender,
And tenderly say that I'm,
The one you love and live for,
Till the end of time.",Till the End of Time
Matt Monro,"As long as I'm singing, 
There's a bell up in my brain that's ringing,
Makin' a crazy 'ding dong'.
And if this band don't desert me,
Then there's nothin' in the world can hurt me,
Long as I'm singing my song.

Give me trumpets legato, 
Put some saxes with 'em,
Strings pizzicato and some rhythm.
As long as I'm singing,
Then the world's all right and everything's swingin'
Long as I'm singing my song.

Making music is more to me than a pleasure,
'cause me and music, 
We go together like notes in a measure.

Long as I'm singing my song.",As Long as I'm Singing

With crazy words that roll along

I'm happy, happy

Of broken hearts who love in vain

But, oh, you haunted me so
Still, my tongue tied young bride
Would not let my love for you show

You won't really fall in love, 
For you can't take the chance

In your arms

Of course, I have
Or maybe except when I hear your name

Buckles my knees 
I'm simply drown in the sight, and the sounds, 
And the scent and the feel

I'll take the flowering hat 

And the towering hill

Matt Monro,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Matt Monro,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess,

Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be the one you run to see

You've kept my love so young, so new

Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart

Is when I give my heart to you

Every day was Sunday
Every month was May

When Joanna loved me

And the rain begins to fall
Pitter patter, pitter patter

No sweet lover man comes to call
Oh when sunny gets blue
Oh when sunny gets blue

Like the winds that sway the trees.
Winds that set the leaves a-sway
Like the violins that play
Strange and haunting melodies
Oh when sunny gets blue
Sunny gets blue
When sunny gets blue

People used to love to see her laugh
And see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair
She's lost her smile
Changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

And pretty dreams rise up
Where the other dreams fell through

Matt Monro,"Around the world I've searched for you;
I traveled on when hope was gone
To keep a rendezvous.
I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow,
You'd look at me and I would see
The smile you're smil-ing now.

It might have been in County Down,
Or in New York, or gay Paree,
Or even London town.
No more will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you.",Around the World
Matt Monro,"She said my son I beg of you
I have a wish that must come true
The last thing you can do
For mama

Please promise me that you will stay
And take my place while I'm away
And give the children love each day
I had to cry what could I say?

How hard I tried to find the words
I prayed she would not see me cry
So much to say that should be heard
But only time to say goodbye to mama

They say in time that you will forget
Yet still today my eyes are wet
I tell myself to smile for Mama

Now soon there'll be another spring
And I will start remembering
The way she loved to hear us sing
Her favourite song 'Ave Maria'

Ave Maria

The children all have grown up now
I kept my promise to mama
I cannot guide them anymore
I've done my best all for mama

Matt Monro,"To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest To follow that star
No matter how hopeless No matter how far
To fight for the right Without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm

And the world will be better for this

Still strove with his last ounce of courage

Then they must hold each other tight, oh, so very tight
And take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll stay together, so much in love

And in the silence of a mist, of a morning mist
When lips are waiting to be kissed, longing to be kissed
Where is the reason to resist and deny a kiss
That holds a promise of happiness?

Though yesterday still surrounds you with a warm and 
precious memory
Maybe for tomorrow we can build a new dream for you and me

This glow we feel is something rare, something really rare
So come and say you want to share, want to really share
The beauty waiting for us there, calling for us there
That only loving can give the heart

When life is passing in the night, in the rushing night
A man, a woman in the night, in the lonely night
Must take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll be together, so much in love
Together, so much in love

To the music of romance, of a new romance

For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for rainbow coloured weather

But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall

Before they ask us to pay the bill,

The pleasure's mine and I will pay the bill

Hide all the need inside

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.

And not the words of one who kneels.

And did it my way!",My Way

That she whistles night and noon.

Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" every day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand

That leads us to who knows where

Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another

From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there

Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here? Let me know the way.

Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried.
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried,
And still they lead me back, to the long winding road.
You left me standing here, a long, long time ago.

We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love

Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love

Matt Monro,"Poor boy! Poor boy!
Down-hearted and depressed and in a spin
Poor boy! Poor boy!
Oh, youth can really do a fellow in!

How lovely to sit here in the shade
With none of the woes of man and maid
I'm glad I'm not young anymore

The rivals that don't exist at all
The feeling you're only two feet tall
I'm glad that I'm not young anymore

No more confusion
No morning-after surprise
No self-delusion
That when you're telling those lies
She isn't wise

And even if love comes through the door
The chance that goes on forevermore
Forevermore is shorter than before
Oh, I'm so glad that I'm not young anymore

The tiny remark that tortures you
The fear that your friends won't like her too
I'm glad I'm not young anymore
The longing to end the stale affair
Until you find out she doesn't care
I'm glad that I'm not young anymore

No more frustration
No star-crossed lover am I
No aggravation
Just one reluctant reply
""Lady, goodbye!""

Methuselah is my patron saint
I've never been so comfortable before
Oh, I'm so glad that I'm not young anymore",I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore

Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain

How you were frightened by the clown,
Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew,
Someone who was big and strong and looking out for

And for all the times we've cried I always felt that

With crazy words that roll along
And if my song can start you laughing

Of broken hearts who love in vain
And if my song can start you crying

And start you tapping your feet

Of cotton fields and mammy's arms

Like a friendly home the second time you call

There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet

But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I had to say

Take me back, I love you
I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along

Without you",I'm a Fool to Want You
Matt Monro,"Midnight. Not a sound from the pavement.
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone.
In the lamplight the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan.
Memory. All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days;

I was beatiful then.
I remember the time I knew what happiness was.
Let the memory live again.
Every street lamp seems to beat

A fatalistic warning.
Someone mutters and a street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning.
Daylight. I must wait for the sunrise,

I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin.

Burnt out ends of smoky days,
The stale, cold smell of morning.
The street lamp dies, another night is over,
Another day is dawning.

Touch me. It's so easy to leave me
All alone with a memory
Of my days in the sun.
If you touch me I'll understand what happiness is.
Look, a new day has begun.",Memory

You'll never guess who
Lovable, hugable Emily Brown
Miss Brown to you
What if the rain comes pattering down
My heaven is blue
Can it be sending me Emily Brown
Miss Brown to you
I know her eyes will thrill ya
But go slow, oh, oh

Matt Monro,"No me dejes no, tienes que olvidar
Vuelve por favor, no te acuerdes más
De lo que pasó, lo que hice yo y me hiciste tú
Eso que más da, olvida tambien la desilusión
Que llegó tal vez y por otro amor
No me dejes no, no me dejes no, no me dejes no...

Yo te cubriré toda de coral, con plata y rubí, perlas de la mar
Yo te llevaré conmigo a un país donde todo es luz, besos y canción
Si conmigo estás la reina serás, yo seré tu rey si estás junto a mí
No me dejes no, no me dejes no, no me dejes no..

No me dejes no, te convenceré con el corazón
Tal vez sin razón te recordaré
Cuando te ibas a ir, y te vi temblar por primera vez 
Y te explicaré que la muerte está siempre trás de mi
Cuando tú te vas
No me dejes no, no me dejes no, no me dejes no..

No sé si quizás te pueda extrañar, que me porte así y no pueda más
Mucho años ya vivo junto a ti
Y este inmenso amor cada dia es más
Y te oí decir que te quieres ir
Y sentí un puñal dentro de mi ser
No me dejes no, no me dejes no, no me dejes no..

No me dejes no, no quiero llorar 
No puedo ni hablar, yo me esconderé
Y te miraré bailar y reir y felíz seré si tú eres felíz
Solo quiero ser como un perro fiel
Sombra de tu amor, eco de tu voz
No me dejes no, no me dejes no, no me dejes no..",No Me Dejes (If You Go Away)

It’s a feeling so unreal somehow I can’t believe it’s true
The pounding I feel in my heart
The hoping that we’ll never part
I can’t believe this is really happening to me

I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them you’re still here
I close my eyes and count again
I can’t believe that you’re still here

It isn’t the way that you look
And it isn’t the way that you talk
It isn’t the things that you say or do
Makes me want you so

It has nothing to do with the wine
Or the music that’s flooding my mind
And never before have I been so sure
You’re the someone I’d dreamed I would find

But the way you make me feel the moment I am close to you
Makes the day seem so unreal somehow I can’t believe it’s true
Tomorrow will you still be here
Tomorrow will come but I fear
That what is happening to me is only a dream

And when I open them you’re still here

Matt Monro,"In my heyday
Young men wrote to me
Everybody seemed to have time to devote to me
Everyone I saw all swore they knew me
Once upon a song
Main attraction, couldn't buy a seat
The celebrity, celebrities were dying to meet
I've had every accolade bestowed on me
And so you see

If I never sing another song
It wouldn't bother me
I had my share of fame
You know my name

If I never sing another song
Or take another bow
I would get by, but I'm not sure how

Always posing, but you love it all
Though you have to learn to act like you're above it all
Everything I did the world applauded
Once upon a star

Framed citations, hung on every wall
Got a scrapbook full of quotes, I can recall them all
There were times I felt the world belonged to me
And so you see

If I never sing another song
It wouldn't bother me
I had my share of fame
You know my name

If I never sing another song
Or take another bow
I would get by, but I'm not sure how
But I'm not sure how
But I'm not sure how",If I Never Sing Another Song

More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life will be in your keeping
Waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping

Longer than always
Is a long long time
But far beyond for ever
You'll be mine

I know I've never lived before
And my heart is very sure
No one else

We stood still as the days moved along

Suddenly we can see we were wrong

All of a sudden this world's yours and mine
All of a sudden water tastes like wine
Now every moment there are songs to sing
All of a sudden everything

Let's not talk of all the times we've been lonely
But let us speak of the times we will know
From today I will live for you only
Wish I'd said all these things long ago

there's a big romantic deal I've got to wangle
For I've fallen for a certain luscious lass
And it's not a passing fancy or a fancy pass

I love the look of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you, the pure of you **
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you

For I love all of you",All of You
Matt Monro,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues
Matt Monro,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you

Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips

The ocean's roar
A thousand drums

As I gaze from my window
At the Moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you

Do you love me as I love you

Things never change they fade away. The Church of Love ... it's law and disorder. We're meant to give more than we take. Calling Gods on high, it's in your name millions die, Silenced those who scream, no golden cold image can redeem, The tongue tells lies, minds deceive. I turn around and see a finger pointing at me.

Where in the world can I turn and look to? Things never change they fad away. The Church of Love ... it's law and disorder Where cheating hearts can kneel and pray.

When the day was young, and the night was long

Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning 'til
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello?
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go! I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space

Look into my eyes, my lover you will see 
All the lovely things you are to me 

Our wistful little star was far too high 
A teardrop kissed your lips and so did I 
Now when I remember spring 
And all the joy that love can bring 
I will be remembering the shadow of your smile 

And now that I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Matt Monro,"Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through (the whole day through)
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)

I'm say Georgia, Georgia
A song of you (a song of you)
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

I said Georgia, oh Georgia
No peace I find (peace I find)

Matt Monro,"When I think of Tom
I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white
And the soft mist of England
was sleeping on a hill

I remember this
And I always will
There are new lovers now
on the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom and me

Hello Young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my memories happy tonight
I've had a love of my own
I've had a love of my own like yours
I've had a love of my own",Hello Young Lovers [From The King and I]
Matt Monro,"Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With Angel songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That any where I go, I'm never lonely
With her along who could be lonely
I reach for her hand, its always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her until the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

Matt Monro,"It seems we stood and talked like this before.
We looked at each other in the same way then,
But I can't remember where or when.

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore.
The smile you were smiling you were smiling then,
But I can't remember where or when.

is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
and my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

They seem so happy and gay
Though they sing and they swing as they sway

'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my heart's calling to

Trying to smile once in a while
But I find it so hard to do
For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you

While the throng's in the spell of a song
My thoughts keep drifting to you
While each pair seems to share their affair
They're making me blue

Though someone else may be nearer your heart.

Once in a while won't you dream of the moments I shared with you,
Moments before we two drifted apart.

Then let me dream alone
For in my dream my every wish comes true
I dream that you are near
That you had gone never gone
And hand in hand I walk with you

Must your loveliness just fade away
Say you will be mine until the end of time
Then no more will I need to pretend
Our love will be a dream that will never end

					Words and Music by Margo Guryan


You make me shine,
     shine, shine, shine
Looking at me
With stars in your eyes
Trying to say
What I've always wanted to know
You want me to know that you're mine, mine

My, it feels good to believe
In someone
It's been a long time
A lonely time
It's been a hard time
An empty time
Since anyone made me feel

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Dancing to music
And singing each line
As I shine, shine, shine, shine
    shine, shine, shine, shine

Praying for electricity to keep her warm for a little while
Nobody made her wise to the things a girl might find
In a belly of a hungry man who don't care nothing about his bloodline
She got lost in his bloodline
Heavy cost of a bloodline
She goes on she cries at night and keeps alive his bloodline
So much riding on a bloodline
Why is he hiding from the bloodline?
It ain't right she cries at night and keeps alive his bloodline

She heard heaven is invite only preserved for Christian soldiers
Not on wet girls living in the city asking for change from strangers
But father said Jesus loves her even though she never married
God loves her more than the Christians did she's part of his holy bloodline
She got saved in her bloodline
The price he paid for the bloodline
Chased alive she cries at night and keeps alive his bloodline
She believes in his bloodline
Lives and breathes by the bloodline
With all her might she cries at night and keeps alive his bloodline

Ohhhhhhhhhh oooooooooooo
I know I should have never left her a shoulder of a burnt eye
She probably won't forgive me god might not even
I made a cross and laid it on her back
But I never broke her spirit and she owes that to her bloodline
She stood strong for the bloodline I did wrong by the bloodline
But she went on she cried at night and kept alive her bloodline

For all her life she cried at night and kept alive her bloodline

There's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Now I got used to tenderness, we'd hold each other tight
And I got used to happiness, we'd make love day and night
And I'll get used to mornings, eating breakfast all alone
Sitting in the evenings, when there's no one else at home

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

I accept the notion that there's things you can't control
The changing of the seasons or the fact we're growing old

Matt Nathanson,"How ironic it all seems because I remember you telling me
About other lovers running out of words to say to each other
And how beautiful you thought it was and I agreed that
Would never happen to you and me
So here we sit in silence, searching our heads for common ground
We've rehashed the past and beaten it down
Left us with nothing, no present, no future
I still read your letter and all that evil makes me sick
But this is regimented pain and it gives me the illusion
That I have lived
I was the one that pushed you off the pedestal I put you on
And with my arms still outstretched I watched you fall
And break apart like glass on the highway
I realized my mistake a bit too late
Because I'd never risk picking up the pieces,
Jesus look at them all
I'd never risk picking up all those goddamn pieces
Because I lose control at the sight of my own blood
I still read your letter, and all that bullshit makes me sick
But this is regimented pain and it gives me the illusion
That I have lived

So that they'd have something to 
Wrap their mouths around

Show me how pretty the world is
'Cause I envy the way that you move
Show me how pretty the world is
'Cause I want something just a little bit louder

God, you're always burning up so bright
When there's someone there by your side

Well just take me home

And I'll lie until i believe

Cause all I want to be is the minute that you hold me in
When you pretend that I'm all that you waited for
Time slips to nothing and I'm better than I've ever been

With your breathing, filling up my lungs
I can almost believe that I'm almost enough
Spent all of my life emptied of anthems

And all of it was lost on me
Bought and sold like property
Sugar on my tongue

I kept falling over
I kept looking backward
I went broke believing
That the simple should be hard

All we are we are
All we are we are
And every day is a start of something beautiful

I wasted, wasted love for you
Traded out for something new
Well, it's hard to change the way you lose
If you think you never won

All we are we are
All we are we are
And every day is a start of something beautiful

And in the end the words won't matter
Cause in the end nothing stays the same
And in the end dreams just scatter and fall like rain

And every day is a start of something beautiful

Stay in your bed
All day 'til the street lights came on

So what happened to bulletproof weeks in your arms?
What happened to feeling cheap radio songs?
What happened to thinking the world was flat? 
What happened to that?

Up on 59th street 
Right before the rain
Lovers catching taxis going downtown

I'm talking to what's left of you
Watching what I say
Counting all the freckles on your perfect face

You open your window
And I stay on your bed
Just hoping that right words will come

And forget the lies we use to live

With nothing but the clouds against our skin

And all the living they don’t do

Yeah, it’s easy to get colder and it’s easy to forget
So meet me when the lights dim
We can wake up every morning, we can set ourselves on fire
We can do it all again

They lack the confidence
Yeah, we’re only hearts and bones and blood
Oh, but we are giants, giants

We climb and they descend 
With nothing but the clouds against our skin
Oh, we are giants, giants

I’m done trying to fit in
And be half forgiven
For things that I never did

We’re more than what scares us
We’re final and fearless
We’ll dance where the ice gets thin, gets thin

The world don’t speak for us 
They lack the confidence

I gotta get that feeling
Summertime, summertime, summertime

It's too hot to sleep
Laughing in the heat
We lay together
And watch the sky turn on

Sirens come in waves
Up the fire escape
Every shadow disappearing
Into dawn

Oh let's keep this going
I wanna go all in
We'll never be lonely in the dark

Nobody loves you
The way that I do
The way you shine through
Gold in the summertime

Summertime, summertime, summertime
I gotta get that feeling

We could dodge the rain
In some museum cafe
Or run together til the
Storm clouds all get gone

Wander through the streets
F train to the beach
Be in love with being young
Dazzling and lost

Oh let's keep this going
I wanna go all in
We'll never be lonely in the dark

Prince on the radio

So mighty and so strong

With mercy for all men

As Jesus went down in the cold of the grave
Defeated the darkness when He overcame
The keys of the Kingdom were placed into hands
Of children and priests and of fishers of men
Through all generations His voice will be heard
Creation resounds the victorious words!

Winter changes nothing
The frost east can bring the highways down
I went to a movie I want to believe in

The actors were all looking at me
Stupidly, I sat struck dumb
Will this feel alright with the lights on?
Would it all be right with the lights on?

Lily, there's a picture of your mother
I'm sickened when I see it
It must be something to be her kind
I saw a movie I think, I believe in

The actors all fell back and they were laughing
The frame stopped and I started thinking
Will this feel alright with the lights on?
Would it all be right with the lights on?

There is no sign to be discreet
To clutter up the clearings
This is casting out and waiting
Hanging lines to stay up late with

The cold that holds the corner
Cannot be more boring
Startled now that there's all these lights on

In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me 

What a curious life 
We have found here tonight 
There is music that sounds from the street 
There are lights in the clouds

Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me 
Soft and sweet 
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees 

Now how I remember you 
How I would push my fingers through 
Your mouth to make those muscles move 
That made your voice so smooth and sweet 
And now we keep where we don't know 
All secrets sleep in winter clothes 
With one you loved so long ago 
Now he don't even know his name

When the snow falls thick and silent
I can only hear you breathing

I will follow a set of deep tracks
Other people all stay hidden
As the cars rest under snow drifts

Appears framed by cables
So clearly your breath's white
As you struggle to tell

that the people we have become
Still lay awake hoping to hear airwaves
Say snow day

as the day goes gray to grayer
We don't think of all the struggle
In our footsteps, it's behind us

so clearly your eyes framed in the light decaying
So quiet your words stood out when you were saying

Matt Ray,"Add a little sugar, honeysuckle
And a great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss
With a dozen roses
Such will astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
It is true, the makings of you
The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told them so
You're second to none
The love of all mankind
Should reflect some sign of these words
I've tried to recite
They're close but not quite
Almost impossible to do
Reciting the makings of you",The Makings of You

To so faithful a Friend, to so loving a King?
Savior, what can be said, what can be sung

Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part
Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart

This thankful heart
This thankful heart

You deserve my every breath, for You've paid the great cost
Giving up your life to death, even death on the cross
You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
Open up the gates of heaven and have beckoned me in

To so faithful a Friend, to so loving a King?

What can I, what can I, what can I sing as an offering, Lord?
I want to please Your heart
What can I give, what can I bring, what can I sing as an offering, Lord?

What can I give, what can I bring, what can I sing as an offering, Lord?
What can I bring to the King of kings?
Oh, what can I give, what can I bring, what can I sing as an offering, Lord?

At the foot of the cross,
Where mercy paid for me.
Where the wrath I deserve,
It is gone, it has passed.

And the bread we will break,
Remembering Your love.

But You took on our shame
And nailed it to a cross.

The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo

The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby says good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

why you keep peeping in my window?
Do you know something I don't know?

walking down the railroad tracks?
You can tell me if the girls
ever coming back.

Is she hid out with another
or is she trying to get back home?
Is she wrapped up in some other's arms?
Or is the girl somewhere all alone?
Can you see if she is missing me,
or is she having a real good time?
Has she forgotten all about,
or is the girl still mine all mine?

You can see the whole damn land

Oh yellow moon,
have you seen that creole woman
You can tell me,
Now ain't you a friend of mine.

All because a foolish man had lied
She gave up all she had, to show how much she cared
But the man told so many lies, now another man is over there

Sweet woman across the river, she was mine

Word got around, that he had jilted her
And men came running, came running from near and far
How could I be such a fool, I'll never never never know
That the man, he's got to know, he's a lucky so and so

She said ""i don't even want to talk to you
Cause I don't love you any more""

We’re quiet as cathedral mice on lithium

You came and went and you left me crazy
Off in a far away land
Now I gotta level with you baby I am lost and alone

Never once shed all my tears ‘til my sense of direction went away

Now I gotta level with you baby, I am lost and alone

Just as my insanity came like blood through your telephone
And now every other Sunday, they will line up out the door
to wish you well in hell forevermore

Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road

So to escape it I went back to bed 
But then the rain started leaking through the ceiling 
And pretty soon it was pouring on my head 

Sometimes it follows you home 
Like an old stray dog 
It won't leave you alone

But it's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
No it's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
So don't sleep it all away 

So I jumped into my car and hit the freeway 
I found a sunny spot so I could work on my tan 
But just as soon as I stepped one foot in the ocean 
From out of nowhere it came pouring down again 

Cause sometimes it rains 
All over your parade 
It's like you're reaching for the sun, 
And you're landing in the shade 

[Chorus]

Well the moral of the story is 
Sometimes life takes so much more than it gives 
But the One who makes the air I breathe 
Is the One who'll fix the ceiling when it starts to leak 
It may look like the end but it's only the beginning

When I carry more chains the world when they see me? 
I don't wanna be the fool who stays

Something that you can't avoid
Gotta to get a chance to
Trying to get an answer
Somewhere in between the noise

Every time you're screaming

And it feels like home

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

Lights out...underneath disguises
We'd give anything to feel it
We are the ones...begging for more...haunted and living
And we're breathing...and we're dreaming
You smile...serving to remind me...
That when lights go out...you going to find me
You'll be the one...holding me close...reaching into me
And we're breathing...and we're dreaming
We are the ones...begging for more...can you feel it?
And we're breathing...and we're dreaming



",Breathing
Matthew,"Lying on the floor I wonder...were you just too afraid to show?
I guess we'll never know
To this distant ever-after...you didn't want to go
Were we blinded by a reason?
Watching days refuse to shine...to darkness from divine
Such a pity for this lover...you left behind
I never wanted anybody else
I never needed you, I needed help
After the feeling's gone...so long, because it's over
Not a healthy situation...push me over, hold me down
To see if I would drown
Was I waiting for an answer I didn't want to know?
I never wanted anybody else
I never needed you, I needed help
After the feeling's gone...so long, because it's over
And like the lyrics to a song I sang to you before
You know it fades away
I never wanted anybody else
I never needed you, I needed help
After the feeling's gone...so long, because it's over

I want to feel your skin
I want to know what's there within and breathe it away

We could be so nice
And to the fire, the leaves entice...don't blow them away
You've got to tell me
You wanted this to be
Sleeping eyes are open wide
You say...you're the one to blame
And we've been here too many times...but I want you still, the same
I want to know you...the simple, salacious
Your undefiled and devious, insatiable ways
So look into these
So look into these eyes and never wonder if they'd lie
Or lead you away to fearful places
Sleeping eyes are open wide
You say you're the one that's changed
Bring your mind down to the ground from your cloudy, starry place
I want to touch you
Sleeping eyes are open wide
Looking straight into your pain...and we've been here too many times
But I want you still the same
I want to touch you



",Open Wide
Matthew,"Monsters on the shore are getting nearer
Smoke and scream and fire
I don't remember when infection came into the healer
Voices in my head say it's now or never
Overboard...let me fall from the death and slumber
Just pretend you're sailing, safely...throw me overboard
Zombie heads on cold, plastic shoulders
Faces only hide the brooding fear
Overboard...let me fall...to the waters...catch me
Come into me...floating, still...and safer, overboard
We're all so far away
We lie beneath the stars
No one ever told you...you're free
Overboard...let me fall...from the death and slumber...
Just pretend you're sailing safely...

Because I don't want to bring you up and let you down
I know there's always something wrong with me
This paranoia freezes
Circles...rolling over...run away from your embrace
Your hands gently kill me...i would never be the same
You were always one to take away the madness,
And I would be the one to bring it back around
You saw the water crashing over me...
We stream around into these circles...
Rolling over...run away from your embrace
Your eyes see right through me...i would never be the same
Circles...rolling over...i can feel them...run away
Your eyes crucify me...and I would never be the same



",Streams
Matthew,"The morning comes and mornings fade away into the eve of what's to be
And breathing in the life
That's breathed from out the maker of the day
We see...the marred intentions all around us fall...
To pools of wings that never fly
So as we promise to redeem the lazing losses of the day...
We only pray that this time we'll see it turn around...we'll see it turn around
This time...dreams we'll realize
And who was I to walk away from you
And who were you to wonder why
For I could place a million faces on the shoulders of my pain...
And I do
But time continues on the broken road...
And treasures wait for those who find
Among the thistles grow the promises unending souls desire...
And thoughts that maybe this time...
We'll see it turn around...we'll see it turn around
This time...dreams we'll realize
Dark memories surrounding...will offer only fruits of darkness
Into this daze we're thrown...but not to drown
This time we'll see it turn around...we'll see it turn around
This time dreams we'll realize



",This Time
Matthew,"A heavy heart with heavy eyes...i can feel you by my side
Now, the one thing I desire has run away...to no surprise
We could have reached a thousand skies, and I'm still reaching for you
Remember when it all began?
I touched your face...you touched me...and we believed in innocence
Something you could bring to me
Now that something in the past is coming back again...you'll see
Where did you go?...what did it mean?
I try to remember you...it's hard to believe
The beauty if fading...and silence has ceased
Where did you go?...bring it back to me
I saw the symptoms on your face...how I know you felt inside
Was it a dream for me to think I could please you for a while?
It won't let me get away...and I don't want to leave if this is true
Where did you go?...what did it mean?
I try to remember you...it's hard to believe
The beauty if fading...and silence has ceased
Where did you go?...bring it back to me
I didn't mean to understand the feelings that you posed
I didn't mean to be a friend when you were all alone
I only wanted to be free...and maybe to believe you could love me
Where did you go?...what did it mean?
I try to remember you...it's hard to believe
The beauty if fading...and silence has ceased
Where did you go?...bring it back to me
I want to know, I want to see...i want to know because I believe
I feel the fire...i feel the shine...i want to feel your soul in mine
I want to feel...i want to touch...the part of you I need so much
I want to know...i want to see...i want to know because I believe

I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.","Oh, What a Beautiful Morning"
Matthew Baldwin,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Matthew Barber,"Four in the morning
I woke with a start
I woke with a pounding deep deep down in my heart
And it's all over now, 
But I had such an awful dream

I don't know what it tells me
I don't know what it means
I don't know where it comes from
I don't know where it leads
And it's all over now
But I had such an awful dream

Maybe it was something   somebody said
Maybe it was nothing, the wrong side of the bed
But all I know is that it scares me
Even though it's not real
And I had an awful dream

And it's strange what you see
In the middle of the night
When your eyes aren't even open
And there isn't any light
And it's all over now
But I had such an awful dream

Now I know what you're thinking
You wanna know what went down
You wanna know if you were in it
Don't let me go, you weren't around
Oh and it's all over now
But I had such an aw-aw-awful dream

Have you ever had the feeling
Something you can't shake
It doesn't matter if you're sleeping

Or if you're awake
And nothing's as it should be
At least that's how it seems
We all have our awful dreams
Awful dreams

Awful dreams
Awful dreams.",Awful Dream
Matthew Broderick,"Your honor when I was in Rio
And had everything I'd ever dreamed of
I suddenly realized that this man, this man

No one every made me feel like someone
'Til him
Life was really nothing but a glum one
'Til him
My existence bordered on the tragic
Always timid, never took a chance
Then I felt his magic and my heart began to dance

I was always frightened, fraught with worry
'Til him
I was going nowhere in a hurry
'Til him
He filled up my empty life, filled it to the brim
There could never ever be another one like him

Leo, I, I never realized you're a good singer
Thank you, Max I sang it for you
I sang it because I'm your friend

You are? Gee, I've had a lot of relationships
But you couldn't call any of them friend
But come to think of it

No one ever ever really knew me
'Til him
Everyone was always out to screw me
'Til him
Never met a man I ever trusted
Always dealt with shysters in the past
Now I'm well adjusted 'cause I've got a friend at last

Don't help me

Always playing singles, never doubles
'Til him
Never had a pal to share my troubles
'Til him
He filled up my empty life, filled it to the brim
There could never ever be another one like him

Gentlemen it breaks by heart
To break up such a beautiful friendship, so I won't
Five years in the state penentary at Sin Sink

",'Til Him
Matthew Broderick,"You will join me in singing
Und dancing the Fuhrer's favorite tune
'Der Guten Tag Hop Clop', all right, key of E?
Is there any other?  Vunderbar, eins, zwei, drei

Guten Tag hop hop, Guten Tag clop clop
Ach du lieber und oh boy
Guten Tag clap clap, Guten Tag slap slap
Ach du lieber, vat a joy

Oh, ve essen und fressen
Und tanze und trinken
Tanzen und trinken
Until ve get stinkin

Everybody, Guten Tag hop hop, Guten Tag clop clop
Guten Tag, meine liebe Schatz
So we hop our hops und we clop our clops
Und we drink our Schnapps 'til we plotz

Vunderbar, gentlemen, I like your dancing
Thank you, you may produce my play
Excellent, but only if you will take the Siegfried Oath
I solemnly swear, I solemnly swear

To obey the sacred Siegfried Oath
To obey the sacred Siegfried Oath
Und, und, und, never, never, never, never, never, never
Dishonor ze spirit und ze memory of Adolf Elizabeth Hitler

Dishonor the spirit, Elizabeth?
Ja, that vas his middle name
Not many people know it, but the Fuhrer was descended
From a long line of English queens

Really? Adolf Elizabeth Hitler
Gut, so now I sign your contract
Ah, you won't regret this, so, thank you, Herr Liebkind
Broadvay, wait til they hear about this in Argentina
Ach, mein lieblings

Ve're winkin und blinkin
Und clinken und drinken
Our Schnapps 'til we plotz
Heil, you know who

Matthew Broderick,"Unhappy, unhappy, very unhappy
Unhappy, unhappy
Very, very, very, very, very, very, very unhappy
Unhappy, unhappy
Very, very, very, very, very, very, very unhappy

I spend my life accounting
With figures and such, unhappy
To what is my life amounting?
It figures, not much, unhappy

I have a secret desire
Hiding deep in my soul
It sets my heart afire
To see me in this role

I wanna be a producer
With a hit show on Broadway
I wanna be a producer
Lunch at Sardi's every day

I wanna be a producer
Sport a top hat and a cane
I wanna be a producer
And drive those chorus girls insane

I wanna be a producer
And sleep until half-past two
I wanna be a producer
And say, ""You, you, you, not you""

I wanna be a producer
Wear a tux on opening nights
I wanna be a producer
And see my name, Leo Bloom, in lights

He wants to be a producer
Of a great big Broadway smash
He wants to be a producer
Every pocket stuffed with cash


He wants to be a producer
Pinch our cheeks 'til we cry ouch, eek, ooh, oh, ahh, yes
He wants to be a producer
With a great big casting couch

I wanna be, he wants to be
I wanna be, he wants to be
I wanna be the greatest, grandest
And most fabulous producer in the world

He wanna dine with the duchess and the duke
I just got to be a producer
Drink champagne until I puke
Drink champagne till he pukes

I wanna be a producer
Show the world just what I've got
I'm gonna put on shows that will enthrall 'em
Read my name in Winchell's column


I wanna be a producer
'Cause it's everything I'm not

Unhappy, unhappy
I wanna be a producer
Very, very unhappy, unhappy
(Wait a minute, yeah minute, hold everything, hold everything)

Mr. Bialystock was right
There is a lot more to me than there is to me
Stop the world, I wanna get on

I'm gonna be a producer
He's gonna be a producer
Look out Broadway 'cause here I come

",I Wanna Be a Producer
Matthew Broderick,"The urge to merge can rob us of our senses
The need to breed can make a man a drone
We must be on alert with our defenses
For every skirt will test testosterone

So, knowing this I severed all connection
With any creature sporting silk or lace
I was firmly headed in the right direction
When suddenly I stumbled on that face

That face, that face, that dangerous face
I mustn't be unwise
Those lips, that nose, those eyes
Could lead to my demise

That face, that face, that marvelous face
I never should begin
Those cheeks, that neck, that chin
Will surely do me in

I must be smart and hide my heart
If she's within a mile
If I don't duck, I'm out of luck
She'd kill me with her smile

That face, that face, that fabulous face
It's clear I must beware
I'm certain if I fall in love, I'm lost without a trace
But it's worth it for that face

That face, that face, that lovable face
It melts my Swedish heart
I'm certain if I fall in love, I'm lost without a trace
But it's worth it for that face

",That Face
Matthew Broderick,"Don't you see, Bloom, darling Bloom?
Glorious Bloom, it's so simple
Step one, we find the worst play ever written
Step two, we hire the worst director in town
Step three, I raise two million dollars

Two? Yes, one for me, one for you
There's a lot of little old ladies out there
Step four, we hire the worst actors in New York
And open on Broadway and before you can say, “Step five”
We close on Broadway, take our two million and go to Rio

Rio? Nah, that'd never work, oh, ye of little faith
What did Lewis say to Clark when everything looked bleak?
What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing
As they struggled toward Everest's peak?

What did Washington say to his troops
As they crossed the Delaware?
I'm sure you're well aware, what'd they say?

We can do it, we can do it
We can do it, me and you
We can do it, we can do it
We can make our dreams come true

Everything you've ever wanted
Is just waiting to be had
Beautiful girls, wearing nothing but pearls
Caressing you, undressing you and driving you mad

We can do it, we can do it
This is not the time to shirk
We can do it, you won't rue it
Say goodbye to petty clerk

Hi, Producer, yes, Producer
I mean you, sir, go beserk
We can do it, we can do it
And I know it's gonna work

Whatta ye say, Bloom? What do I say?
Finally a chance to be a Broadway producer
What do I say?

Finally a chance to make my dreams come true, sir
What do I say, what do I say?
Here's what I say to you, sir

I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do it, that's not me
I'm a loser, I'm a coward
I'm a chicken, don't you see?

When it comes to wooing women
There's a few things that I lack
Beautiful girls, wearing nothing but pearls
Cashing me, embracing me, I'd have an attack

Why, you miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar
Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?
Don't you want to spread your wings
And flap your way to glory?

We can do it, we can do it
We can grab that holy grail
We can do it, we can do it
Drink Champagne, not ginger ale
Come on, Leo, can't you see oh

Mr. Bialystock, please stop the song
You've got me wrong, I'll say, ""So long""
I'm not as strong a person as you think
Mr. Bialystock, just take a look
I'm not a crook, I'm just a shnook
The bottom line is that I stink, I can't do it

You see Rio, I see jail
We can do it, I can't do it, we can do it
I cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot do it
'Cause I know it's gonna fail, we can do it
I know it cannot fail
(It's gonna fail)

",We Can Do It
Matthew Broderick,"{Look at these reviews
A satiric masterpiece
No way out
A surprise smash!
No way out
It was shocking, outrageous, insulting
And I loved every minute of it!
No way out}

How could this happen?
The show was lousy and long, we did everything wrong
Where did we go right?
Christmas came early to Broadway this year
And guess who they stuffed in our stocking? Adolf Hitler!
It was so crass and so crude even Goebbels would've booed
Where did we go right?

Last night a star was born on Broadway the lovely Miss Ulla
Inga Hansen Bensen Yonsen Tallen-Hallen Svaden-Svanson
We predict that her name will soon be up in lights
If they can find enough bulbs

We searched Broadway on and off
For singers with a cough
We had tryouts and auditions by the score
And to trip the light fantastic
We picked dancers who were spastic
If anyone jetted, we jetted them out the door

They shouted hooray for that sausage on display
Where did we go right?
Our leading man was so gay he nearly flew away
Where did we go right?
A show so easy to despise
Now it's up for the Pulitzer prize
Oh, where, oh, where, tell us
Where did we go right?

The best new music of the decade!
Max Bialystock is a theatrical genius!
Now they like me

Oh, we knew we couldn't lose
Half the audience were Jews
It's the end of our careers
It'll run for twenty years
Tell us where did we go right?
