Dean Shostak,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Dean Shostak,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Dean Torrence,"You got a thing about you
I just can't live without you
I really want you Elenore near me
Your looks intoxicate me
Even though your folks hate me
There's no one like you Elenore really

Elenore gee I think you're swell
And you really do me well
You're my pride and joy et cetera
Elenore can I take the time
To ask you to speak your mind
Tell me that you love me better

I really think you're groovy
Let's go out to a movie
What do ya say now, Elenore can we?
They'll turn the lights way down low
Maybe we won't watch the show
I think I love you, Elenore, love me

Elenore, gee I think you're swell
And you really do me well
You're my pride and joy, et cetera
Elenore, can I take the time
To ask you to speak your mind?
Tell me that you love me better

One more time!

Elenore, gee I think you're swell, ah-hah
Elenore, gee I think you're swell, ah-hah-hah",Elenore [#]

Dean Wareham,"I can wait another day until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string and everything a-flutter
But another lonely night might take forever
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me love
'Cause I know what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill of being near you
And if takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights (Never be another)
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away

Yes, I know (I know) what I feel (I feel) to be right
No more lonely nights (Never be another)
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away

No more lonely nights, no, no",No More Lonely Nights [Ballad]
Dean Wareham,"It's my direction
It's my proposal
It's so hard
It's leading me astray

My obsession
It's my creation
You'll understand
It's not important now

All I need is
Co-ordination
I can't imagine
My destination
My intention
Ask my opinion
But no excuse
My feelings still remain

My feelings still remain

Deana Carter,"I remember that new pair of blue jeans
And man, your boots sure did shine
You had on my favorite cologne
I knew what was on your mind

You picked me up in that Mustang
You were right on time
Had the radio on, it was playing our song
We were leaving the world behind

I wanna remember that loving feeling
When we were young and our hopes were high
A heart was something you could believe in
Love was more than just a word
Before we ever heard goodbye

That summer night down at the levee
You gave me your ring on a chain
There would never be another for me
Tell me why does everything always have to change

I wanna remember that loving feeling
When we were young and our hopes were high
A heart was something you could believe in
Love was more than just a word
Before we ever heard goodbye
",Before We Ever Heard Goodbye
Deana Carter,"Could there be a different ending
To the same old story
?Cause you're not the first to say
You're gonna be there for me
I need to know what's in your heart
Can you finish what you start
Tell me how can I be sure I wont' be sorry

If heartaches and tears and shadows of doubt
Are part of the deal, you can count me out
But if you're talking about a game I can win
You can count me in

When you tell me you're the one
I've always needed
You don't know how much I'm wanting
To believe it
But I've heard it all before
Now I'm needing something more
A promise is no good if you can't keep it

If heartaches and tears and shadows of doubt
Are part of the deal, you can count me out
But if you're talking about a game I can win
You can count me in
",Count Me In
Deana Carter,"Flowers and wine is what I thought I would find
When I came home from working tonight
Well now here I stand, over this frying pan
And you want a cold one again

I bought these new heels, did my nails
Had my hair done just right
I thought this new dress was a sure bet
For romance tonight
Well it's perfectly clear, between the TV and beer
I won't get so much as a kiss
As I head for the door I turn around to be sure
Did I shave my legs for this?

Now when we first met you promised you'd get
A house on a hill with a pool
Well this trailer stays wet and were swimmin' in debt
And you want me to go back to school

I bought these new heels, did my nails
Had my hair done just right
I thought this new dress was a sure bet
For romance tonight
Well it's perfectly clear, between the TV and beer
I won't get so much as a kiss
As I head for the door I turn around to be sure
Did I shave my legs for this?

Deana Carter,"We've always been the best of friends
No secrets and no demands
But suddenly from somewhere out of the blue
I see a different light around you
One thing I haven't told you, I just want to hold you
And never let you go, but I need to know

How do I get there from here
How do I make you see
How do I tell you what my heart's been tellin' me
Lost in your lovin' arms that's where I want to be
You know I love you
How do I get there

You probably think I've lost my mind
Takin' this chance and crossin' that line
I promise to be truer than true
Dreamin' every night with these arms around you
I can't wait any longer it's only getting stronger
So help me find a way

How do I get there from here
How do I make you see
How do I tell you what my heart's been tellin' me
Lost in your lovin' arms that's where I want to be
You know I love you
How do I get there

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
But I'll climb any mountain that you want me to climb
The perfect combination is your heart and mine
Baby, give me a sign

How do I get there from here
How do I make you see
How do I tell you what my heart's been tellin' me
Lost in your lovin' arms that's where I want to be
You know I love you
How do I get there

How do I get there from here
How do I make you see

Deana Carter,"I hear what you're telling me but that don't make it so.
Two timing, talking sweet from the time your feet hit the floor
My heart is telling me it's time to let you go.
Oh baby, let go..

I've loved enough to know.
A heartache when I see one coming.
Been down this road before.
I've loved enough to know.

Every night out with the boys, you think I'm so naive.
I know exactly where you're going every time you leave.
I see every little something up your sleeve.
Oh baby, I can see.

I've loved enough to know.
A heartache when I see one coming.
Been down this road before.

Deana Carter,"Hold your racing horses just one minute
A funny feeling coming over me
I'm hearing violins and Tony Bennett
Boy if this is love then I'm in it

It was a triple digit summer
I thought I'd let you share my ice cream cone
We took a walk going nowhere
But I was already already gone

The train of love is rolling and I'm on it
Destination end of the line
Every star I see I wish upon it
Boy if this is love well then I want it

It was a triple digit summer
I thought I'd let you share my ice cream cone
We took a walk going nowhere
But I was already already gone

It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be now was it
Simple as the dimple in your smile
I just can't resist kissin' and huggin'
Boy if this is love then I sure love it
Boy if this is love
Boy if this is love
Boy if this is love then I sure love it",If This Is Love
Deana Carter,"Why did you have to forsake me
Couldn't you tell me goodbye
I've been waking up lately with tears in my eyes

Love ain't worth making, when it makes you the fool
A chance ain't worth taking
My heart is breaking
When she's holding you

You don't know how happy you made me
Couldn't you give it one more try
I know her arms are waiting to hold you tonight

Love ain't worth making, when it makes you the fool
A chance ain't worth taking
My heart is breaking
When she's holding you

So go on and pack up what's left
Of all that we shared
You're leaving me lonely tonight

Deana Carter,"He was working through college on my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still  remember when thirty was old
And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
Strawberry wine
Strawberry wine",Strawberry Wine
Deana Carter,"If you get out in the drivin' rain
Stand in the eye of the hurricane
And never think twiceIf you turn your back on selfishness
Cause your thougts are for someone else
Cause they've changed your life
That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough
That's how you know it's love
When you heart insists that you give it all
When you no longer fear the fall
And you just let go
When the past is finally dead and gone
Fate leads you somewhere to the one
That has your soul
That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough
That's how you know it's love
No part of you questions
No part of you doubts
You're only sure this is what love's about
And nothing and no one can stand in your way
Or keep you from saying
What your heart is dying to say
That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough
That's how you know it's love
",That's How You Know It's Love
Deana Carter,"Everyday seems I turn another page
And it feels like the heartache fades a little more away
Look in the mirror and I like what I see
Hey you didn't take that much baby out of me
Something proud and something strong
Fills the absence of a memory that's dead and gone

I do believe I'm crossing over
I feel that weight come off my shoulder
I close my eyes
And drift close to the other side
Lord I swear I'm crossing over
I found the strength to let you go and
The the thought of you is getting colder
And further from my mind
And I think I crossed that line
To the other side

Lately I find when I'm walking through town
I don't have to turn away
I don't have to look down
If I should see you with somebody new
Well I might get sentimental
But I'll lake it through
Something real and something right
Puts the shadow of doubt
In a different light

I do believe I'm crossing over
I feel that weight come off my shoulder
I close my eyes
And I drift close to the other side

Deana Carter,"The summer air was heavy and sweet
You and I on a crowded street
There was music everywhere, I can see us there
In a happy little foreign town
Where the stars hung upside down
A half a world away, far far away
I remember you were laughung
We were so in love, we were so in love

And the band played songs we'd never heard
But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang oh la la la la la la la oh
And we danced anyway

They say you can't go back, baby I don't believe that
Come along with me, come on and dance with me
Maybe if I hold you close
Baby we could just let go
Of these things that tie us down, we'll come back around
Do you remember we were laughing
We were so in love, we were so in love

Deana Carter,"I write you letters, but I don't send ?em
I just can't figure out how to end them
I try to reach you, you're right beside me
There's something missing and we can't deny that

We live together separately
We don't want to fall apart
But every time we kiss there's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

We live together separately

Deana Carter,"She was born at a rest stop on the Kansas state line
In the back of a Dodge in the summer time
Her momma named her Indiana like their license plate
And with the hum of the tires on the interstate
She was cryin'

They left her at a Denny's up in Colorado
In a blanket with her name written on a note
That said, ""Forgive us Lord for not takin' her
But this child has a better chance of makin' it
In someone else's arms""

And it's a crazy thing
Fate has perfect wings
All the way down the line
Angels working overtime

She was raised in a place called Cheyenne Wells
But she never fit in and everyone could tell
That she didn't belong in some prairie town
And when she turned eighteen she bought a ticket out
On a Greyhound

They stopped a few minutes out of Santa Fe
She got out for a smoke and they drove away
She hitched a ride with a boy right out of school
He said ""I'm headed out west"" and she said ""Me too
If that's all right""

And it's a crazy thing
Fate has perfect wings
All the way down the line
Angels working overtime

It took a couple hundred miles 'til they fell in love
They knew forever was the only thing good enough
And in a moment of passion in a motel room
They held on tight and their aim was true
Now they're countin' down the days
And dreamin' all night in an apartment in L.A.

Deana Carter,"I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at day light
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone, but you got something I need

Kinda like the kudzu, she grew up fast and pretty

Satin shoes tied to her feet
People 'round here said she was a sight

Every night when the sun went down
She'd curtsey and take a bow
To the man in the moon and the dim street lights

We held in high regard
The rose in the mission yard
Singing, ""Buffalo Gals won't you come out tonight""

And her name was Ruby Brown
And she came through shanty town
Like a queen without a crown
And her name was Ruby Brown

Long about ten years ago
She disappeared, why no one knows
But some say she was running for her life

'Cause a mean looking man in a limousine
Came down from New Orleans
He said he came here looking for his wife

And her name was Ruby Brown
And she came through shanty town
Like a queen without a crown
And her name was Ruby Brown

Some say he beat her bad
'Til she just went plain mad
But I say she went where he could never go

And her name was Ruby Brown
And she came through shanty town
Like a queen without a crown
And her name was Ruby Brown

Waiting for your world to turn around is less likely to be found
As I watch it moving past
Than any other hope that I might hold that someday you
Might know what it's like to slowly drown
Waiting for your world to turn around
Waiting for the the thought to cross your mind that 2 hearts might
Be inclined to commit an act that's bold
Or even just be looking for a chance to take advantage of
One glance and live inside it one more time
Waiting for the thought to cross your mind
How long will it be
'Til these blind eyes can finally see
I don't know, time goes so slow
While your love, like a river, flows right by me
Waiting for your world to turn around is less likely to be found

Might know what it's like to slowly drown

We used to sit and drink pink champagne on a tin roof 
Ridin' it out in a Thunderbird 
Singin' out loud, every single word of ""Jack & Diane""
Tryin' to pretend there was no rules 
Kissin' on boys and sneakin' in bars 
Tryin' to get a glimpse of who we are 
We weren't wild, but we weren't far 
She said, ""Thelma and Louise, you got nothin' on me""
And you call, tell ole James Dean to get in line 
Thanks to Elvis and Kurt Cobain, the world will never be the same 
You've got to make history one day at a time 
She graduated in 1987 
We were gonna make a break for it together 
Headed out to Hollywood 
Where the stars are bright and the weather's good 
But she changed her mind 
Went back to the 7-11 
She went and married the football star 
Had few kids and works real hard 
It ain't wild but it ain't far 
She said, ""Thelma and Louise you got nothin' on me""
And you call, tell ole James Dean to get in line 
Thanks to Elvis and Kurt Cobain, the world will never be the same 
You've got to make history one day at a time 

Hey, Thelma and Louise, you got nothin' on me 
And you call, tell ole James Dean to get in line 
Thanks to Jesus and John Wayne the world will never be the same

Big smile on my face, wine glasses all over the place
Your shirt on my floor, I've never done that before
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't it feel so good
Flying high without a net above the neighborhood
I love to cross the line
I get a running start and I go five steps at a time
Oh wouldn't be scary
Just being ordinary?

At my church I pray. I had a long talk with the angels today
And they say, ""Listen to me...you gotta be a Shepard, don't be a sheep""
Stop sign go away cause I ain't stopping for no one today
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Deana Carter,"She parks her car on Woodland Street
She's got a job at the meat-n-three
She's kind of pretty in a peculiar kind of way
And I try hard to like her
Yeah, I try hard to like her

Because she's good for you
She's so good for you
You say she's good for you
That makes her bad, that makes her very bad
For me.

I saw her at the grocery store
Her stuff was obviously yours
It may sound silly but it made me want to cry
I try hard to hide it

You say she's good for you

Well if she's good for you
That makes her bad, that makes her very bad

Deana Carter,"I ain't picked up my guitar in 15 days
Some music man didn't give a damn what I had to say
But he's still in tears and playin' games that I don't play
I'm not gonna let that son of a bitch take my love away
Can't take my love away

so roll me over over and over
While I turn your head
Hold me under under under
While I'm takin my last breath
It just gets colder colder colder 
While you try to save yourself
God's gonna blow your clouds away
And give me a sunny day

it's on the telephone the tv and on the radio
Any day now the final whistle is bound to blow
But this ain't the way we have to say we had to go
There's still a chance at hand in hand from shore to shore
But can't take our love away
(can't take our love away)

so roll us over over and over 
While you turn your head
It just gets colder colder colder 
While you try to save yourself
God's gonna blow your clouds away
And make me a sunny day

Deana Carter,"Flowers and wine is what I thought I would find
When I came home from working tonight
Well now here I stand, over this frying pan
And you want a cold one again

I bought these new heels, did my nails
Had my hair done just right
I thought this new dress was a sure bet
For romance tonight
Well it's perfectly clear, between the TV and beer
I won't get so much as a kiss
As I head for the door I turn around to be sure
Did I shave my legs for this

Now when we first met you promised we'd get
A house on a hill with a pool
Well this trailer stays wet and we're swimmin' in debt
And now you want me to go back to school

I bought these new heels, did my nails

Deana Carter,"I am just a poor boy, though my story is seldom told.
I have squandered my resistance,
For a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises.
All lies and jest.
Still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.

When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy,
In the company of strangers,
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared.
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters,
Where the ragged people go.
Lookin' for the places, only they would know.

Lie-da-lie ...

Asking only workman's wages I come lookin' for a job,
But I get no offers,
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue.
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome,
I took some comfort there.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

Li da li ...

And I?m laying out my winter clothes, and wishing I was gone, goin' home
Where the new york city winters aren't bleedin' me, leadin' me goin' home.

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade,
And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down,
Or cut him 'til he cried out in his anger and his shame,
""I am leaving, I am leaving.""
But the fighter still remains, still remains.",The Boxer
Deana Carter,"I was all right for awhile
I could smile for awhile
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say, ""Hello""

Oh, you wished me well
You, you couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you

When you said, ""So long""
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying
Crying, crying

It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Than I did before

But, darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me
And I'll always be crying over you

And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying

Yeah, crying, crying
Over you",Crying
Deana Carter,"A long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times or the bad things he's done
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world hand in hand
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man

Now he likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends
And when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again

Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I rang his number by mistake today

Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the mem'ry of him lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy girl I used to be
He thinks I still care

And if he's happy thinking I still need him
Then let that silly notion bring him cheer
But how could he ever be so foolish?
Or where would he get such an idea?

Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
'Til the sunlight has touched your face

She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
Your love for her grew
With each rising sun

And then one winter day
His hand led hers away

She left you here drowning in your tears, here

Deanna Durbin,"'Tis the last rose of summer left blooming alone
All her lovely companions are faded and gone
No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, to pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead

So soon may I follow when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown

Many the songs I sung
When I was playing with my brother,
Happy was I

There let me live and die

Deanna Durbin,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.
I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
Darling, I love you!

Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk
Mr. Grinch!
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote
""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch!
You're the king of sinful sots!
Your heart's a dead tomato
Splotched with moldy, purple spots
Mr. Grinch!
Your soul is an apalling dump-heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful 
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled-up in tangled-up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch!
With a nauseous super naus!
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss
Mr. Grinch!
You're a three-decker sauerkraut 
And toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce!","You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"
Deanna Ranson,"[Chorus]
Who would ever thought a guy
Would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that I
Would  fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we
Would finally come to be
I guess they just don't know
How much you mean to me
Who would ever thought that they
Would have some words to say
We'll go on anyway
It's alright, it's okay
Take what ever comes our way
Together we will stay
I got three words to say
Never say never

I can't believe they'd stop our happiness
By trying to pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out of all of this crazy madness
Now when they talk I think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

Now baby they can't believe that
You and me are together
That's why they should have never
Never say never
There were times when we thought that
You an me could never be together
That's why we should have never
Never say never

[Chorus]

Now there's a lot of talkin' goin' round
About the way me and you gettin' down
What are they jealous are they hatin' me
I guess they all have their own Ph.D's
I wish that they would just stop sweatin' me
Stop trying to get the best of me
No matter what they say baby
We gotta move on because we're gonna be happy

We didn't let the thoughts that we had
We didn't let the words that they said
Keep us from the love we now have
Never say never
Simply for me to see when
Never would've been never allowed
Now that we are together
Never say never

[Chorus]

Never say, never say, never [Repeat: x8] 

[Chorus: x3]",Never Say Never
Deanna Reuben,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Deanna Reuben,"How do you keep
The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever

Yet be the best of friends

Deanna Reuben,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Deanna Witkowski,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.
But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all.
I know you've forsaken me,
Till the shadows fall.
But then once again
I can dream,
I've the right
To be close to you
All through the night.",All Through the Night
Deanna Witkowski,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night
DeAnne Arnold,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song

Dear Jack ,"Fuori ancora piove
La mia mente adesso naviga
Verso nuove realtà
Mi chiedo, ora dove sei?
Se tra le mie mani un giorno tu sarai
Anima gemella

Non so neanche se tu esisti
M'immagino il sapore
Tra le labbra che tu lasci
Non bastano parole
E ancora il tuo sorriso
Luminoso come il sole
Che abbraccia coi suoi raggi
Una semplice canzone

Dimmi chi sei
Forse non lo saprò mai
Se sei una tipa coi suoi spazi (guardi il viso t'imbarazzi)
Bevi latte a colazione (entri dentro le persone)

Ora penso al tuo aspetto
I capelli rossi sulle spalle scendono
Mentre fissi il nulla
Immagino d'inverno le mani fredde (sulla schiena)
Poi l'estate tu che mangi e ridi (con la bocca piena)
Non è facile pensarti
Come un sogno e niente più

Natale coi parenti (a sgranocchiare il panettone)
Poi tornare a casa finalmente (a coccolarci ore e ore)
E dopo fatto l'amor
Un film è di garanzia
Dimmi anima gemella
Se un giorno sarai mia

Dimmi chi sei
Forse non lo saprò mai
Se sei una tipa coi suoi spazi (guardi il viso t'imbarazzi)
Bevi latte a colazione (entri dentro le persone)
Nei miei sogni ci sei tu
O anima gemella
Quanto male mi farei (ad inseguire una stella)
E se davvero tu fossi la donna ideale
Ti prego
Mostrati
Diventa

Corse e passi piccoli
È da un anno che
Che non respiro amore e poi stringimi
Che domani poi è un altro film
Che anche se non vuoi convinciti
Dimentica tutto quello che verrà

Resta un segno ne hai da scrivere
Ti nascondi dentro un mare immenso
Mare immenso consapevole
Che anche se non vuoi

Stai qui senza fretta spiegami
Cosa inventi senza noi
Senti ancora musica
Musica e poi stringimi
Che domani poi è un altro film
Che anche se non vuoi domani qui
Dimentica tutto il meglio che sarà

Più cancelli e più ti resta il segno
Resta un segno ne hai da scrivere
Ti nascondi dentro un mare immenso
Mare immenso consapevole

Lasceremo alle spalle le parole scontate
Persi nelle ore di mille giornate
Lascerò la mia pelle agli sbalzi d'umore

Come un fuoco sei tu bruci lento quaggiù

Scappa e non fermarti senti I cuore in gola
Ha rapito anche a me
Ci sta uccidendo
E sai che il sole muore all'orizzonte
Buca il mare come fai con me
Irresistibile

Gocce di rugiada su di me come lacrime

Scegli la verità, amore, scegli scegli scegli scegli
Se credi ancora nelle favole
Ti prego scappa sulle nuvole

Ci sta uccidendo
E sai che il sole muore all'orizzonte

Languida la notte

Una nube passeggera,

Soffi la ferita quando è ancora viva

Ricomincio da me
Qui non servono solo parole d’amore
Lo faccio anche per te
All’alba di ogni partenza c’è sempre un finale
Un finale cos’è?
È Solo un dettaglio in un cielo stellato di te.

Improvviso un viaggio con la mente
Nel paradiso delle idee
Alcune son rimaste
Altre si consumano
A fuoco lento in prescrizione

Ricomincio da me
Qui non servono solo parole d’amore
Lo faccio per te
All’alba di ogni partenza c’è sempre un finale
Un finale cos’è?
È Solo un dettaglio in un cielo stellato di te.

Io che ero parole di vetro ora sono canzone per te
Io che restavo in disparte a guardare la vita scivolare con me
Non capivo il perché, ricomincio da me

Dice che mi conosce

Trovato nulla che mi fa sentire bene come fai

Nelle mani voglia di mischiarla con la mia
Per essere una cosa sola e farne melodia
E poi cantarla e farla diventare eterna
Vorrei liberare

Farti sentire quanto è dolce il suono

Dear Jack ,"Pensa
A questa stanza
A una conquista
A te che dormi mentre sei
Qui nascosta
Tra cielo e terra
Diventi aria
E cresci

Fino alle idee
E non ti accorgi
Fermi i secondi guardandomi

Niente è per sempre
Il mondo esplode tranne noi
Che abbiamo fretta
Di perderci cercando
Il senso dentro questo viaggio

Cerco
Un sorriso
Dentro a un pianto
Ai piedi di un tramonto
Sei
Quella scoperta
Che non passa
Che muove cielo e terra

Fino alle idee
E non ti accorgi
Cade una stella guardandoti

Niente è per sempre
Il mondo esplode accanto a noi
Che abbiamo fretta
Di perderci cercando
Il senso dentro questo viaggio

E ricordo ancora tutto il buono che sei
Non c’è pace, né guerra né gioia più attesa
Non mollare la presa

Il mondo esplode accanto a noi
Indifferenti
Al traffico del centro
Al tempo che consuma il resto

Niente è per sempre
Il mondo esplode tranne noi
Che abbiamo fretta
Di perderci cercando
Il senso dentro questo viaggio",Il  mondo esplode

Se mai ti lasciassi
Guardandoti negli occhi

Eviterei l’elenco degli errori

Come quadri alla parete
I miei ricordi impressi
Difenderei il mio cuore e il tuo
Dagli insulti
Che presi dalla rabbia
Potremmo dedicarci

Non smetterò di farlo

Ma è diverso anche il silenzio

Il nostro tempo, mentre adesso
Lo sta uccidendo

E adesso imposti

E non inventerei un ruolo

Dear Nora,"


Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had the chance to

I've stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my way
And I wonder if I'll see another highway

I had a lover
I don't think I'll risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing so long

Then I'll stop my dreaming
I don't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on corner stores
And count the time in quarter tones to ten
Please don't confront me with my failures
'Cause I have not forgotten them

That I am not changin'

And I almost let you patronize me one last time

And acceptance is the key to peace, do not try to defy her

You did not do me wrong, in fact you did me right
To let me go although I felt so broken
For you did not see the heart of me perhaps you were too lazy
And though I tried I could not gain the heart of you either

So now it's done and I am glad that I will find another man
Though you will always be the first I tasted
And I will harness all this pain and let it bear me far away

Loving isn't always an open doorway
It's giving up your heart at moments of faith

Death Angel,"I just can't believe what I'm seeing
It makes me sick inside
Condemned by the world around me
I'm not gonna run and hide
I'm gonna come alive
Ain't gonna take no jive
Open up your sewn shut eyes
Your disappearing eyes

When I'm walking down the street
People turn and stare at me
As if I couldn't feel their eyes
They're living in a world of fear and lies

Best loosen up and take it in stride
The world don't need egotistical pride

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes
And see the light
Just do it

Must you choose to shut your mind
I look deep but nothing do I find
You're so tough hey put it on a shelf
You've got to come out of yourself

Knock knock knock but no one's home
Excuse me please but I'm sick of society
'Cause you are you and I am me
And if we don't agree
Just let it be

Open up your eyes
And see the light
Just do it",Open Up
Death Angel,"The crack of dawn fills the empty sky
We turn our heads towards the east
Between the hills
Walk the paths of love
Towards the caverns of the beast

A distant cry breaks the solitude
Of weary men who journey on
To see the sight horrifies us all
The magic wind blows and it's gone

[Chorus]
Searching for answers
Another clue on the list
Searching for answers
To questions that cease to exist

Decipher the runes of earth
We travel forth to the lake of death
The guardian says that we must pay
The price is high for he demands a life
So it's he we must slay

Beyond the gates
Forests of the darkness
Without the key you'll not get in
We weave the spell
Of time and dimension
Which plants us on
The shores of sin

[Chorus: x2]",Shores of Sin
Death Angel,"I will never understand the way you are
Your mind's an evil tod striving for more
Can't you see I can penetrate your lies

I created you but yet you still defy
It doesn't matter how hard I try
A lesson in respect is what you need

You thrive off the weak minded ones
These pour helpless souls that you deceive
Still come back to the security
Under my sleeve

[Chorus]
Don't beat around the bush
I know it's a task
I only have one question
Which I must ask

When I was sad and down
You suddenly came around
Like a guiding light
No need for me to fight
I told you everything
Brought me up again

Oh how that all changed
Only you to blame
Manipulative days are through
So bye bye to you

You've opposed me since the birth
Wanting your own little world
Brainwashing them to believe

You're the ruler evil supreme
Mother earth is not your toy
Your evil world I will destroy
You were deprived of your youth
You were deprived of joy
Lonely depressed little boy

[Chorus]",Why You Do This
Death Angel,"Blurs of beauty have passed me by
Scenes have flashed inside my mind
Remembered places in memory alive
Forever moving onward

An endless space within you are
Black hopeless hole, feelings are sparse
Seems your goal is gone, devotion wanders far
Take a look back on your past

Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel

An aimless search through latent realms
The warmth is lost, cold beings dead
Affection fatal, love bonded to a bed
Release your inner self

Time is sacred until it ends
Never to stop, so cleanse your head
Relax in peace; I'll be happily content
Waiting to fulfill your fate

Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear that you still feel

Provoke the end, don't wait

Do it now, rearrange
Discontinue
And make the change",Discontinued
Death Angel,"Well, I can't get it off my mind
Said, I just can't seem to leave it behind
And it haunts me till this very day
And I don't think it's ever gonna go away
'Cause the people, yes, the common people
They be knowing this shit is real
Having a good time
Ain't committing no crime
Innocent victims
Pushed to the red line

We'll put you people into a line
Interrogate your mind, rape you one at a time
Don't say a word, shut up, and obey
Your opinion doesn't matter to us anyway
'Cause the more that you resist
Is the quicker you make the list
Making your own choice

Pushing us too far

Yearn for the feel
The warmth that's inside
A childish grin
I joyfully scream
To deafened ears
It's time to begin

All seems different to me
What I've seen before
Can't help but notice
Hidden feelings I had stored

You stare at me
As if I am strange

There's no hope; I'm going down
Won't be long until I kiss the ground

I'm falling out
There's no lasting

Rock a bye baby
In your deep thoughts
When the night wind blows
It's time to rock
A life with no breaks
The child will fall
Down will come baby
No one cares at all

I'm not sure just what to do
Not up to me, not up to you
Always been a different breed

Foretell what lies in store
Running from the grave believers
Try to evade the chase

For him

You're looking at him
He's looking through you

Who's fooling who?
There's got to be something that he knew

So there he sits, and some may wonder
About the sly grin on his face
Yet little do they know

In the solitude of his kingdom

On our way to nowhere
Oblivious to our destiny
Slowly drifting on and on and on

Wander far away too far
Trapped in a timeless void
Changing with the shifting wind
Never can see an end
It's a real vague story
Impossible to perceive
A seemingly endless time

Passing through eternity
Still devoid of meaning
Useless to inquire upon

It's so cold in this lonely room

And I'm alone, just talking to myself
Trying to find the answer but to no avail

That he believes in the truth

Of a twisted mind
All virtues had faded away
Apprehension made her cold
But warm she was inside
The child within her died
And left her with a heart of stone

Surface anger was a thin disguise
Yet at night she cries
Behold the pain in her eyes
Degradation was a grind
Her true self left behind
Compassion you will find
Hidden by a veil of deception

And so the story goes
That's the way she chose to live her life
And anybody knows
The way it feels when you hurt inside
She's running from herself
The game of life in which she played

Looking back upon the early years
There was room for tears
But she chose to push them away
Condemnation was a vice
She chose to roll the dice
And so she paid the price
Misery was her only friend

Inner feelings were a neutral zone
Though she tried to condone
In a world she faced so alone
Her salvation came too late
And on that day she died
No one even cried
Forgot about the veil of deception

Nothing to fear, there's no end and there is no final chapter

Pay no attention to the devil's evil eye
Meant to distract us, lead us astray
To throw us off our course until we've lost the way

When the time has come to say goodbye
To all the ones we love
We shall not fear our fate or destiny

Foretell the future of thy kingdom that will come
Still we ride onward on wings of black
Long as we live there'll be no end to our attack

Constant quarreling, the childish fits, and our clothes in a pile on the ottoman.

Were only foolish attempts to show you did not mean
Anything but the blatant proof was your lips touching mine in the photobooth.

And as the summer's ending,
The cool air will put your hard heart away.
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document.
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on.

Cup your mouth to compress the sound,
Skinny dipping with the kids from a nearby town.
And everything that I said was true,
As the flashes blinded us in the photobooth.
Well, I lost track, and then those words were said.
You took the wheel and you steered us into my bed.
Soon we woke and I walked you home,
And it was pretty clear that it was hardly love.

The cool air will rush your hard heart away.

Waking up to the sound of 5 A.M. to take my turn at the wheel. 
Climbed up Shasta, oh how the engine ached 
As the sun tortured California, 
And old alleys turned deep at the heart of me. 
Murals of heroes defacing the blank concrete.

Lodged out as the engine wheezed.

And they all said that you were the king 
Of a gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would sing

'Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place where they're
Far more suited than here

I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain

That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too

Death Cab for Cutie,"Time for the final bow
Rows of deserted houses all
Our stable mates highway bound

Give us our measly sum
Getting the air inside my lungs
Is heavenly starting out
With nothing but
Crippling doubt

We'll rest easy

I'll endure countless repeats

An awful curse
With age it just
Gets much worse

I won't mind",Stable Song
Death Cab for Cutie,"Squeaky swings and tall grass
The longest shadows ever cast
The waters warm and children swim
We frolicked about in our summer skin

I don't recall a single care
Just greenery and humid air
Then Labor Day came and went
And we shed what was left of our summer skin

On the night you left I came over
And we peeled the freckles from our shoulders
Our brand new coats so flushed and pink
And I knew your heart I couldn't win
Cause the seasons change was a conduit
And we'd left our love in our summer skin",Summer Skin
Death Cab for Cutie,"And it came to me then
That every plan
Is a tiny prayer to father time

As I stared at my shoes
In the ICU
That reeked of piss and 409

And I rationed my breaths
As I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today

As each descending peak
On the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me

Amongst the vending machines
And year old magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye

It sung like a violent wind
That our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds

And I knew that you were truth
I would rather loose
Than to have never lain beside at all

And I looked around
At all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself

Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous paces bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes round
And everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said

That love is watching someone die

So who's gonna watch you die",What Sarah Said

On the back of a motorbike with your arms outstretched trying to take flight, leaving everything behind

Death Cab for Cutie,"It was one hundred degrees as we sat beneath a willow tree
Whose tears didn't care they just hung in the air
And refused to fall, to fall

I knew I'd made a horrible call
And now the state line felt like the Berlin wall
And there was no doubt about which side I was on

'Cause I built you a home in my heart 
With rotten wood that decayed from the start
'Cause you can't find nothing at all

No, you can't find nothing at all

I braved treacherous streets
And kids strung out on homemade speed
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep at all

An outdated map crumpled in my pocket
But I didn't care where I was going

The boundaries of language I quietly cursed

Death Cab for Cutie,"Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind and I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me,
Son, fear is the heart of love,so I never went back

You and me we've seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down

Death Cab for Cutie,"If I could open my arms and span the length of the isle of Manhattan
I'd bring it to where you are, making a lake of the East River and Hudson
If I could open my mouth wide enough for a marching band to march out
They would make your name sing and bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings

I wish we could open our eyes to see in all directions at the same time
Oh what a beautiful view, if you were never aware of what was around you
And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in

Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound

'Cause each broken heart will eventually mend
Just as the blood runs red down the needle and thread
Someday you will be loved

Death Cab for Cutie,"I remember when the days were long
and the nights when the living room was on the lawn. 
Constant quarreling the childish fits
and our clothes in a pile on the ottoman. 
All the slander and double speak were only foolish attempts
to show you did not mean,
anything but the blatant proof was your lips touching mine in the photobooth. 

And as the summers ending the cold air rush your hard heart away. 
You were so condescending, 
and this is all that's left 
scraping paper to document. 
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on. 

Cup your mouth to compress the sound, 
skinny dipping with the kids from a nearby town. 
And everything that I said was true
as the flashes blinded us in the photobooth. 
Well I lost track when those words were said, 
you took the wheel and you steered us into my bed, 
and soon we woke and I walked you home
and it was pretty clear that is was hardly love. 

And as the summers ending, 
the cold air will rush your hard heart away. 
You were so condescending, 
and this is all that's left scraping paper to document. 
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on. 

And as the summers ending,

You were so condescending, 
as the alcohol drained the days. 
And as the summers ending,

Cath, it seems that you live in someone else's dream
In a hand-me-down wedding dress
Where the things that could have been are oppressed
You said your vows, and you closed the door
On so many men who would have loved you more

At the place where your soul had died

Barefoot in the shallow creek,
I grabbed some stones from underneath
And waited for you to speak to me

And the silence; it became so very clear
That you had long ago disappeared
I cursed myself for being surprised
That this didn't play like it did in my mind

All the way from San Francisco
As I chased the end of your road
Cause I've still got miles to go

And I want to know my fate

Like a stranger on a foreign shore
With an eroding beach disappearing from underneath

And when my mirror speaks it never minces words
Because these eyes don't shine half as bright
As they used to do and they haven't for quite a while

Because I'm a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines
And there's a tangled thread inside my head
With nothing on either end

I always fall in love with an open door
With a horizon on an endless sea
As I look around the ones who were standing right in front of me

And then my mirror speaks with irreverence
Like a soldier I can't command
It sees a child in the body of a full-grown man

And he's a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines

And there's a tangled thread inside his head
With nothing on either end
There's nothing on either end

A new position for a different view
And nothing changes but the slightest hues
And I am standing face to face

With a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines
And there's a tangled thread inside his head
With nothing on either end

I'm a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines
And there's a tangled thread inside my head
With nothing on either end

There's nothing on the ends
No there's nothing on the ends",My Mirror Speaks [Version]

Though you know so few words
You're on infinite repeat
And you're brain can't keep up with your beak

So you're free to leave or stay
And sometimes this makes you confused
But there's no hint that I'm trying to give you

Death Cab for Cutie,"Portable television, shrouded in snow
In a raggedy van on the side of the road
The night it had frozen through my little bones
So you took me in your arms, you squeezed out the cold

And oh

Upstate New York, autumn, brightly colored leaves
Oh, the hills were on fire, they burn for you and me
And where we were going it was built like a lie
But as sacred as the Bible, so we didn't question why

And oh

I saw it in the soil just recently
Where the rows of teeth they grow in fields of infinite greed
And here laid the father, and here stood the son
Where the road meets the horizon for everyone
For everyone

From this burden of reflection we've carried today
Oh, the generator's running but there's nothing on the air
And the static is a comfort, so we huddle around and stare

And the constellations move
And the brightest point is falling

Was pointed only at you

And I've got nowhere to go except further below

And it gets darker everyday
But I see no other way than just committing

Then I won't find another place

And all before the pocket dial

She said she knew a place where we could hide

I said, I see, I didn't know the kid is mine
I'll never leave you, it isn't right

Oh now the white is red

Across the state there's no one that we know
Or maybe rent a place where we can stay
Where what we have will go along the way

Then Frankie turned to me, she looked me in the eye
She said that I looked tired, she told me she could drive
I pulled up to the station, walked through neon lights
Then she put her foot down, down, down, down

Why did you leave me alone that night

You left me standing out on the yellow line

Death on Wednesday,"Here it comes, it's coming on a wave
So let it come take over you

So I'm ready for you, holding out for the one that brings me, I'm older now
So I am ready, for you, for your love

We take our time to smoke some cigarettes

When she left I wondered why

The light of my return
After too much time in darkness
I've had enough of being underground

By now it?s all over
Forgotten from memory
And from the heart of the living

My sepulchre has become decrepit
Decaying as my mortal remains
They are corroded by time
By vice and worms

So many years now have passed
From the last time 
That someone cried
Or even prayed for me

Oooh Zombie, what do you want from us?
Oooh Zombie, why have you come back to life?

Men don't care about their dead
don't know that they've come back
Come back to kill them

don't believe that it?s all over
At the moment of burial
There is something more important
That pushes us to come back

The living cry the dead but the dead kill the living
That is the greatest day for me
The day of resurrection

I don't know who I was
I don't remember my ancient name
but now I feel a new reason
I have no fear to kill

Oooh Zombie, what do you want from us?
Oooh Zombie, is this real life?",Zombie

Will I ever follow through with what I had planned?

How does it feel when nobody wants it
Tell me does it float around like a little lost cloud

What does love do when it's not being used?
Feeling like it don't belong
Is it lying awake in the middle of the night?
Think 'bout what went wrong

When I hunger for affection the cupboard is bare
I don't know why I keep hangin' on

And the strike of the night will trash the skyline
And darken the marks I've put in your skin

With you
I want to rule it all
Rule you

All the tears of the victims run on cold cheeks' meat
Cause here's a future that'll feed on sheep

I'll play God and you'll play you
Let's play a game tonight

Deathstars,"Here she comes down, as her wings get nailed to the ground 
A polaroid of shame 
The last angel's pathetic fame 

The face of deceit with nails in her feet 
She's a preacher deprived from her voice 
A punctured lung is creating noise 

The cry that she made was the cry of a dying child 
The revocation of empathy 
The sound from a million dreams and scars 
Termination Bliss 

Blessed under a lie, Her last little weak ""why?"" 
The bloody end of a dream 
Slit the throat and taste the cream 

She wears her crown on a head that's bowed deep down

A tortured saint fed to the flies",Termination Bliss

Feel him seduce when you pray
There 's oralsex in his psalms

All the seeds that you have planted
Upon Trinity Fields
And those crops that thrive inside of you
Grow like thorns through your praying hands

Hear him scream as you pray
The cold father and sin
Feel his soft and sick tongue
Lick your christian skin

A rose that withers and dies
So leave the fields and join the insects
Join the lord of flies",Trinity Fields

The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

The more I want you

More lost without you and so it goes

That you were here with me
And we were in each others arms
It was oh so heavenly
You held me close to you
And whispered in my ear
""Let's build a life together
Share love beyond compare""

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share (then the music stopped)
In a flash I was all alone (it was just a dream)
Haunting me once again

A dream, of simple fantasy
That I, wished was reality
That you'd, come knocking at my door
And we'd, relive this dream once more

The day you left
You said you would return
Just when you wouldn't promise
Said you needed time alone
You said you loved me and
Someday our love could be
I couldn't understand it
I thought we were both happy

We had so much to share (then the music stopped)

Debashish Bhattacharya,"The night was black, rain fallin' down;
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""
I saved my baby from an Endless Sleep.",Endless Sleep
Debbie Cameron,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.

Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare

For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Debbie Gibson,"I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost I can't let go

I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

And if I can't find my way
If salvation seems worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven

Long enough to look my way
Thought he was out of my league

Listened so attentively

Reverse psychology
Doesn't work on me
It works my nerves
But I think logically
So don't rehearse what you're gonna say
I like it better the spontaneous way
You got an insecurity? 
I won't nurse it
I don't buy psyche - so why reverse it?

Games are good for attention (Mmm-yeah!)
But in the end they let you down
Hold me back or let me go
But no more middle ground

Boy, you've got to play your cards right
Get on back to the basics of love
We don't need no mindless mind games
A little give and take - push and shove -
A little honesty is what I'm in need of!

[Chorus]

Don't you know I've seen it all
Though I seem naive to you
(So now) Hit me with anything at all -
Just hit me with the truth - yeah!

You keep thinking one of these days you'll
Push my back against the wall (against the wall)
It's too late for tricks of the trade now
I can escape anything at all - oh!
A little push and shove - give and take 
But I won't fall!

Why wait till something better comes along?
Why not stay steady and strong? (steady and strong)

On the radio
Seems they're playin' too fast
Or they're playin' too slow
Nothin' seems right
Since you walked out of my life
Love's a lost feeling
That cuts just like a knife in my heart
Darlin' emptiness surrounds me now
And chains are all around me tonight
And I'm bound to your love
But when push comes to shove
It seems just like an endless fight
So tell me

Do you have it in your heart?
To give another try before we say goodbye to love
So that we can try again baby
Do you have it in your heart?
Am I losin' my mind?
Maybe I was too blind to see
That our love could ever end
But baby if you have it in your heart
You will never part from me

Just the other night
At the movie show
I saw you from a distance
But you didn't know
Though time has passed,
I can still read your face
I could tell that girl,
She made you feel so out of place
Boy I know
Though we said goodbye forever I know
We could never let our dreams die

I don't like what I found
Boy won't you look me in the eye

Debbie Gibson,"VERSE1:
Got a groove in my head and a feeling of chains
Releasing me from this bed of nails
Got a smile up my sleeve and wind under my feet
With the air I can set sail
You can only push me just so far
I've been a fool for too long
I know the words to this song
You might tear us apart
But I'll still have my heart

CHORUS:
You might like to think you're strong
You can't break me, you can only free me
Think I'm stuck like glue? You're wrong
You can't break me, you can only free this heart

VERSE2:
There's a whole world of life with a promise of love
That's waiting outside of these four walls
And you can't walk away though you feel your heart break
Suddenly freedom calls
I've been searching for something I've yet to see
I've been thirsting for what you can't be
Now I need to be free

You can only push me just so far
I've been a fool for too long

You are the treasure that I've searched for desperately
The tide it races in, its pullin' me out to the sea

Don't say a word just hold me close

I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You)
Debbie Gravitte,"Where the boys are
Someone waits for me,
A smiling face, a warm embrace,
Two arms to hold me tenderly.
Where the boys are
My true love will be,
He's walking down some street in town
And I know he's looking there for me.
 
In the crowd of a million people
I'll find my valentine,
Then I'll climb to the highest steeple
And tell the world he's mine.
 
'Til he holds me
I wait impatiently.
Where the boys are,
Where the boys are,
Where the boys are,
Someone waits for me.
 
'Til he holds me
I wait impatiently.
Where the boys are,
Where the boys are,
Where the boys are,
Someone waits for me.

Debbie Gravitte,"Ladies and gentlemen
The Keeper of the keys, the Countess of the clink
The Mistress of murderers row
Matron Mama Morton

Ask any of the chickies in my pen
They'll tell you I'm the biggest mutha hen
I love them all and all of them love me
Because the system works, the system called reciprocity

Got a little motto
Always sees me through
When you're good to Mama
Mama's good to you

There's a lot of favors
I'm prepared to do
You do one for Mama
She'll do one for you

They say that life is tit for tat
And that's the way I live
So, I deserve a lot of tat
For what I've got to give

Don't you know that this hand
Washes that one too?
When you're good to Mama
Mama's good to you

If you want my gravy
Pepper my raggoo
Spice it up for Mama
She'll get hot for you

When they pass that basket
Folks conribute too
You put in for Mama
She'll put out for you

The folks a top the ladder
Are the ones the world adores
So boost me up my ladder kid
And I'll boost you up your's

Let's all stroke together
Like the Princeton crew
When you're strokin' Mama
Mama's strokin' you

So what's the one conclusion?
I can bring this number to
When you're good to Mama
Mama's good to you

Debbie Harry,"Surrender my love to you?
Oh no, I won't surrender
Surrender my love to you?
Oh no, I won't

Before I surrender my love to you
I'd rather lie down in the street
And get hit by a big Mack truck

Surrender my love to you?
I'd rather sleep in a lion's den
Maybe then I'll have better luck

I get so mad
Thinking of the chance you had
You had my love
But you didn't want it then

So now
Before I give you my love
I'll need a better excuse
To take that abuse again

Surrender my love to you?
Oh no, I won't surrender
Surrender my love to you?
Oh no, I won't

Before I surrender my love to you
I'd rather jump into the sea
And be eaten by a big fat shark

Surrender my love to you?
Like a hunter you never miss your mark
I think this time you are gonna find
You want my love, you'll have to take it

So now, come on
And shoot your best shot
Come on, give me all you got

Oh no, I won't surrender

Dirty dozens gonna push their pistols, gonna pull their pride
Oh so friendly flirties change their partners choose up sides

Buckle up your seat belt baby
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
Buckle up your sweet self sugar
You drive me crazy ya fly me high

Re re repercussions, echo and the reverbs sigh
Careless caution, it's not the case but what's inside
What can pass for safety measures?
You can tell 'em not to wreck your treasures
No this time, not ever, not next time
Make secure some sons and lovers
It's all made clear with see-thru covers
We're too close, too close for comfort now

Buckle up that seat belt baby, it's gonna be a bumpity bump

Will you make me belong?

Oh no
You're not
Not free to fall

Can this be happening

Then you're swimming
Then you're sinking in the sea of love
Still you sparkle and you sizzle
'Cause a live wire always does

Got no time for poses set my explosives
I'm gunning for you I got power packed motives

Debbie Harry,"Listen while I tell of a secret life
Clandestine lives entwined like vines
You may already know where when and how
If I tell you then, it's no secret now

Two sides to every story
Heads and tails of the very same coin
Two sides to every story

Different words with identical rhyme
They appear to be most commonplace
They're breathing like the winners of a marathon race
It's blase, causality
They are balanced like a trinity

Two sides to every story
Opposites from the ends of the earth
Two sides to every story
Who's to say what either is worth

We come together
Our story's told as one
We come together
After all is said and done

Listen while I tell of a secret life
Lives entwined like vines, man and wife
They said it's all express solidarity
When one's a crowd three's company

Two sides to every story
Heads and tails of the very same coin
Two sides to every story
Sill the same parallel lines",Secret Life

Debbie Harry,"I've touched some objects of faith
More precious than pieces of eight
Seen sacred places and ritual ways But for communion let's go to my place
I learned to pray on my knees

Been taken in hand if you please
Had my own revelations ideas about fate
But for communion let's go to my place
So as the body so as the blood

Sacred as the soul is to love
Don't be mistaken if you don't understand
Divinely simple
Part of the plan

Take
Eat
This is my body
I give it to you

Take
Drink
This is my blood
Do it in remembrance of me so you won't forget me

Now I've been a witness of grace
I stare sacred days in the face
The long long parade of ritual ways
But for communion let's go to my place

Sacred stories are told
They're passed on like pieces of gold
So make your conclusions consider your fate 
But for communion let's go to my place

So as the body so as the blood
Sacred as the soul is to love
Don't be mistaken if you don't understand
Divinely simple

Debbie Harry,"Night comes a calling calling on you
Slips in behind ya long overdue
You'll be dancing down the moon
Sunlight's blinding shuts my eyes

Sunset sliding my time to rise and be dancing down the moon
You whisper to me
Don't fear the dark
Come closer darling you'll feel the spark

I'll hold you tighter tight as I can
Moving together hard as we can
Sunlight don't burn me
Sunlight be cool

Moonlight's kind to me
I'm in night school and I'm dancing down the moon
Should I watch the night be dreamless
Stay away from light be seen less

Am I sleeping
Stay awake all night
Night comes a crawling curling round you
Slips in behind ya long overdue

You'll be dancing down the moon
I love the moonlight
I love the night
Oh baby hold me tight now

I want you near me when it's five o'clock in the morning
It's hangin' overhead
We should be home sleeping or in bed doing it
(Wish) I had a chart I'd know what's up ahead

But we're still out here holding tight holding tight instead
Yeah yeah we're dancing dancing down the moon",Dancing Down the Moon
Debbie Harry,"Maybe it's just a twist of light tonight
But the city's so bright this whole town's in focus
He'd always call me Baby Strange
He's hold my head and pray for rain

Oh Johnny let me be your dog star girl
Let me curl inside
The fire's just right
The fire's just right in focus

But then he said
Like anything goes baby
But I don't know
I just don't know

Do you?
And how'd I ever get to this dead man's town where the rain
Where the rain falls down where the rain falls down forever?

Debbie Harry,"Give it up baby
Don't be so mean
Give it up baby
Why don't you come clean?

What harm can come from a stolen kiss
How could ya leave me at a time like this
Convicted by forbidden bliss
You hit the road like a fugitive

Give it up baby
Give it to me
I said give it up baby
Come clean

Were we just getting too intimate?
Like falling into a bottomless pit?
Committed crimes are pa-passionate
And just when it gets so primitive

You hit the road like a fugitive
Work me now
Work me now
Show me how

Work me now
Running scared's no way to live
Hesitant and tentative
Something else has got to give

It can be so primitive
All in one night we'll scheme our way to the heavens
You're captive in my grip
You're watching time crawl by

Attending to my needs
Emotion boiling over I count the explosions
Then you hit the road like a fugitive!
Work me now!

Oh baby show me how!
Work me now!
Work me now!
Staring for a moment as I sneak attack

You run away
I watch your back
You got to make your getaway
You better get it good

You're just a primitive fugitive
I said work me now!
I said surrender surrender give it to me
Mmm baby give it up don't be so mean

Ah baby baby can't ya why don't you come clean
Come on and show me how!
Baby work me now!",The Fugitive
Debbie Harry,"I can tell you've got it 
Bottled up inside
I can tell 'cause 
It shows in your eyes

Your secrets inside

That's my lip service lip service

A lot of this before
I can tell you've had your fill

You you keep yours
And I'll keep mine 
And when we tell stories 
We'll wait for bedtime

But the raven still beguiling 
All my fancy inter-smiling
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat 
In front of bird and bust and door

Then upon  the velvet sinking 
I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy thinking 
What this ominous bird of yore

Said the Raven Nevermore
Your lips are sealed
But your eyes reveal the reason 
You tell me the reason you squeal 

For my lip service lip service
That's my lip service lip service",Lip Service
Debbie Harry,"Where does it start?
Where does it end?
Where's the division in ocean and sand?
Days are quiet nights are long

Everything is August everything is calm
We're lying here in the heat 
In suspended animation with a slow-mo beat
Taken together taken apart 

I feel your excitement
Take it to heart
Changes of season changes of reason
Changes in a mood ring 

Come straight from the heart
Where does it stand
Where does it bend
Where does my love light begin and yours end

Days are quiet nights are long
Everything is August 
Everything is calm
We're lying here in the groove 

In the heat equation

Debbie Harry,"All I get is rain
Thunder clouds up above my head
Storm warning's been posted
Heavy weather predicted today

There's a storm on outside
I've been thinking about the day
It was in late September
I thought that you 

Would have changed my life
But it's only rainy rainy December
I get caught in the...
I get caught in the rain

Rain rain go away, 
Come again some other day
Baby, baby, unchain my heart!
Unchain my soul

Let the sunshine back into my life
Bring it on let it go
Make the wind blow the clouds away hey
All I want is inspiration

Let the voices within me speak
But for now it's only rainy rainy December
I've had enough of this rain 
Crying for my pain

Let in some light again
Make the day night again
It's raining in my heart
The sky is always dark

The calm before the storm
There was no time to warn
Got to keep brewing on
The water's coming into my heart 

Before there was time to warn you
I can't give up my reason
I love the change in season",Rain
Debbie Harry,"Hey I don't feel so good lately
I wake up with the thought of you penetrating my head
Instead I wanna fill my bed
With thoughts of us joined at the heart like we were at
the start
You left me talking to myself underneath the weather
No good-bye kiss or long love letter
Don't orchestrate my life just be-bop

Must I take pills for stability?
With you I can hardly speak
Must I confess to the stress that I feel?
You take me right to the edge
You take me right to the edge
I need some more of your time
I'm not trying to be funny!

If you think I'm a joke you got another thing coming
When your orders came by phone today I'm not alone
I heard you but what did you say?
So now you're talking to yourself
Do ya like it?
Well do you like it any better?
Don't orchestrate my life just be-bop

If you are so sophisticated why am I still denigrated
When I should be venerated?
I'm sick and tired of repudiation where upon your
orchestration
Leads to endless complication and causes me great
consternation
Must I take pills for stability?
With you I can hardly speak

Must I confess to the stress that I feel?
You take me right to the edge
You take me right to the edge
La la la You love to dance but you maintain you're not
romantic
Bla bla bla
You love to talk but I'm still out here stranded
La la la

You love to sing but don't you know a different key?
Ha ha ha
If I'm your last laugh are you sure the joke's on me?
You don't have to hubby love me
Don't try to chubby shove me
You don't have to tell me I'm your ultimate honey

Don't ya know the leash laws

assorted pit frogs
Put him down if ya don't know where he's been
Pick him up if he's looking too thin

Don't inhale or derail or curtail my train of thoughts
overwrought can't be bought

Don't orchestrate my life just be-bop",Stability

We'll be in our street clothes and pretend we've never
met
And I will tell you My name is Angel
When you call me Angel I'll freeze like a statuette
And they will point and say I look very real
Yes they will
I guess we all take turns on the water wheel
Baby last night you made me think now strike me pink
Maybe you'll bring me a lucky streak
Well strike me pink
So what if our love is tragic part of a missing link?
Baby your touch is magic
You strike me pink
I know that I'm in for a rude awakening
Only you can make me come from behind the door
Is it me or the earth that's shaking
Only you can make me still come back for more
And they will point and say I look very real yes they
will
I guess we all take turns on the water wheel
And they will point and say I look very real yes they

Looking out at the rain

They cover my window pane

And how it should have been
Oh if we only could start over again

I know you'll never forgive me dear, 
For running out on you
I was wrong to take the chance 
With somebody new

I know you'll never forgive me, dear

The things we used to do
I'm lonely and blue

Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind

You crossed your heart
Where there's a tattoo of Jesus 
And Cupid shooting his dart

All covered and colorful
Stories and stars
You bet I go crazy
An odyssey blazing 
With daggers and fire

Uh oh oh whoa

You're incurable for me
And yet you mock me easily
But not for the naked eye
To see 
(No no you're incurable for me
And yet you mock me easily
But not for the naked eye 
To see

I can't stop staring
At my image-painted man
There's a mass of confusion
'Till you put your clothes on
And when times are rough
Shoots up your arm
Then forward is backward
And love is a bad word
But sex is alright

Uh oh oh whoa

Debbie Harry,"What is love, what is love?
Yesterday I knew what it was
What is love, what is love
Well I've been haunted by the invisible ties that bind
And its impossible to get you out of my mind
So I'll be talking and texting till what seems like the end of time
And you know I'll be thinking of you and asking myself
What is love, what is love
Yesterday I knew what it ws 
What is love
Today I'm not so sure
What is love, what is love
Maybe tomorrow I'll know what it was
What is love
Why try? Why even bother to redefine?
All these feelings that have been floating the water line
I'm still happy to know what it was like and I'll be thinking of you and asking myself everytime..
If you go wild I'll take my chances
I'll build a shrine to what romance is
I'll wreck my brain for some kind of answers cause even though I'm in vain 
What is love what is love?
Yesterday I knew what is was
What is love 
Today I'm so sure
What is love what is love
Maybe tomorrow I'll know
What is was
What is love what is love
What is love what is love
Yesterday I knew
Wat is was what is love
Today I'm not so sure
What is love
What is love

Debbie Henning,"4+20 years ago
I come into this life
The son of a woman
And a man who lived in strife
He was tired of being poor
And he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more

A different kind of poverty now upsets my soul
Night after sleepless night
I walk the floor and I want to know
Why am I so alone?
Where is my woman can I bring her home?
Have I driven her away?
Is she gone?

Morning comes to sunrise
And I'm driven to my bed
I see that it is empty
And there's devils in my head
I embrace the many colored beast
I grow weary of the torment
Can there be no peace?
And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease.",4 + 20

I have dreamed what a joy you'll be
I have dreamed ev'ry word you'll whisper
When you're close, close to me

I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go

So keep repeating it's the berries
The strongest oak must fall
The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?

So live and laugh at it all

Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
At eight each morning I have got a date
To take my plunge 'round the Empire State

There's a guy in the show, the girls love to kiss
Get thousands a week just for crooning like this

En los dragones y los cuernos 
Y hay un silencio de animales 
Mientras se anuncian los infiernos

La sangre ajena es nuestra viña 
Cuando profanen y den muerte

Y un enano de alcahuete 
Sádicos abominables

Para gestión de grilletes 
Y corazones de sables

Ronda el olor a carne rota 
De calabozo de edad media

De besar y abrazar a gentes

Could it be finally I'm turnin' for home?

Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I'd come running back for more

Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

Someday you'll find someone you really care for
And if her love should prove to be untrue,
You'll know how much this heart of my is breakin'
You'll cry for her the way I cried for you

Debby Boone,"I told this heart of mine our love would never be,
But then I hear your voice and something stirs inside of me,

Debby Boone,"O come all ye faithful, ye lovers come sing 
A cry from the mountains, a call to come worship your coming King 
Come praise Him with music, and honor Him with dance 
Behold He comes quickly and He carries His reward in His hands 

Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah 
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah 
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah 
Hallelujah 

And build Him a highway on the music of praise 
For the Light of the True Morning 
Pierced through the darkness His golden rays 
Sound loud all you trumpets, a call to all men 
To come to His Temple and with solemn reverence to worship Him 

Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah 
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah 

And go to the city and sing out the song 
For the walls of the Temple will be shaken 
And the music will transcend the concrete and the chrome 
And the minds of the children will waken 

Sing 'Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth and good will to men!' 
Sing 'Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth and good will to men!' 
Sing 'Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth and good will to men!'

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Was more than I should ever let my heart decide

Behind some other lovers when we said goodbye

Darling and I try forgetting youAnd fall for someone new 
But I was only fooling myself 
'Cause right now 

Right now I'm still in love with you 
And I don't know what to do 
I know it drives me crazy and makes my mind so hazy 
I know it's over but I'm still in love with you

I, I think about your love 
Your lips so close to mine remind me of what I miss 
Oh one one love in time 
Forever we were searching for the love we missed 
So I look far and wide for somebody new 
Just to prove that it was over 
Darling and try forgetting you 
And fall for someone new

You're there holding me tight

But you came and made me fall in love again
I never thought I'd feel this way inside
I never thought I'd give love a try
But you came and made me fall in love again

When you smile
I feel so warm inside
Fireworks are in your eyes
I know this is real
A love that's finally real
Someone who loves me for me

When we hold hands
I got the world in the palm of my hand
I think you got the Midas touch
Ooh baby, touch me again
Ooh baby, touch me again

Tell me where's the love and tenderness
Where or where did it go
Don't you think that I won't leave you
I'll pack my love and go

Chorus

(verse 2)
If you think that just because I love you
I will stay and you can treat me any way
That you want to, 'cause last night
When you were fighting me I was thinking
How much better things used to be

Tell me where's the love and tenderness
Where or where did it go
Don't you think that I won't leave you
I'll pack my love and go

Brigde

Baby lately you've been treating me so mean and cold
We argue more than we've been making love baby
I don't wanna be taken for granted anymore
Last night had better be the last or I'm out that door

I don't know why all my friends try to hurt me
Telling me lies I know can't be true

All I can see is me loving you
How can they say that you don't really love me
Who really knows what love is anyway
If I'm a fool then I'll stay in a fool's paradise

No one but me really knows how to love you
Nobody sees what I read between the lines
Nobody is here all alone in the darkness
And you hold me close and tell me that you're mine
Some of them call me a fool for believing
All those wonderful things that you say
As long as I can I will stay in a fool's paradise

Everybody tells me to open my eyes
Wake up and tell you goodbye
I'm so afraid if I did that I would find
I would wake up a fool of a different kind
So let them call me a fool for believing

You only get around to me when someone else has said goodbye
Somehow you only want the ones who noly going to make you cry
It seems no matter what you do you never get their loving affection
It should be obvious to you you're looking in the wrong direction

What's the matter with me
What do I have to do to make you see
Just how good it could be
If it's really love that you need
What's the matter with me

When you're lying in my arms waiting for your heart to feel
How can you be so close to me and not know the way I feel
You say it makes you feel so good to know you can cry on my shoulder
I must really be a fool to let it happen over and over

It never felt so real, I can't believe
The way my heart melts with every beat

Blame it on the heat
It happens when we meet
Blame it on the sweet southern nights
Blame it on the heat

Baby, when we touch
Uncontrollable fire, comes over us
Why we create such a burning desire
Is mysterious, we go out of our minds
As the temperature climbs by degrees

Blame it on the heat
It happens when we meet
Blame it on the sweet southern nights
Blame it on the heat, blame it on the heat

We go out of our minds

Deborah Allen,"I've made my rounds on the right side of town.
Met my fair share of millionaires.
But all those uptown boys just seem to let me down:
Diamonds and pearls don't meant they care.

I swear sometimes the boys on the wrong side of town,
Know how to do it just right.
They'll keep you up till Sunday mornin' on a Saturday night.
They'll slow you down, to rev you up.
Drive you crazy when it comes to love.
Sometimes the boys on the wrong side of town,
Know how to do it just right.

They can make your heart feel as wild as a rebel.
Then tame you down with just one look.
You'd drive all the way across town for that kind of trouble.
'Cause you never had it so good.

I swear sometimes the boys on the wrong side of town,
Know how to do it just right.
They'll keep you up till Sunday mornin' on a Saturday night.
They'll slow you down, to rev you up.
Drive you crazy when it comes to love.
Sometimes the boys on the wrong side of town,
Know how to do it just right.

If I had to choose between rich and refined,
Or a man who could love me out of my mkind.
I'll take the passionate kind, every time.
Oh yeah.

Deborah Allen,"Break these chains around my heart
Cut me loose and set me free
I can't stand to live my life
Bound to your memory

The phone rings, it's three in the mornin'
Who else could it be
You're gone but you try to keep it goin'
That's the last thing I need
Forever is over - now it's up to me

I gotta say goodbye and let it end
My heart is tellin' me if I'm gonna be free
I gotta break these chains

Take your pillow from my bed

Why in the world did you hurt me?
And just when I thought
I'd found someone to trust
You took away your love and

Hurt me
I still can't believe you hurt me
And just when I thought it was safe to come in
You let me want you and need you and then

You left me, like a child in the rain
Now, I'm mending myself in the pain
Oh, you hurt me

Yes, you left me
Like a child in the rain
Now, I'm lost in an ocean of pain

Oh, you hurt me

Made up my mind
Till you start comin' back around

Then throw me away once you get your thrill

So I can make it until the morning's light

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me

Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware

And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

And the laughter of children at play

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

I'm just trying to keep afloat
I'm not looking for buried treasure
I don't want to change the world

I'm not looking for an answer
We moved in a dream we moved in together
And it was a crazy scene 'til the thing went sour

Trying to figure out another way to get back on the ground
I didn't mean to cause a problem didn't mean to lose my way
But now I'm standing on this ledge having a pretty bad day
I'm getting so dizzy when I look down at the street
I don't like my chances of landing on my feet
There's a fire truck siren I hear it far below
All I need is scalpers selling tickets to the show

And of course I'm embarrassed
Of course I'm unprepared
I've probably got no clothes on
And my mother's probably there

Who knows how it happened it's a mystery to me
All of a sudden I'm delivering 'to be or not to be'
I got the cops on a bullhorn trying to keep me calm
While a guy with a straitjacket causally looks on
I was never really worried until I heard the sound
Of an AK47 firing off a couple of rounds
Now I'm basically a shy girl who doesn't like a scene
But oh my God they've called in the marines

Welcome to my nightmare
Welcome to my nightmare
Oh yeah

And then on A&R man suddenly appears
Wants me to be a dance queen to further my career
""Baby you'll be famous you know I could moke you rich""
Then he vanished in a puff of smoke and left me feeling sick

Was I thought that I could fly

How come the next day life's so strange

To be devoured by your eyes

I must rally the full force

And then singing that same old song
(And you don't really know about love)

But I never let it get into me
'Cause I didn't take you serious baby
Now to be without your love
Only makes me realize
What I could've had in you honey

Now that you're gone (oooooooh ooooh ooooh)
I want you more
I said it slapped me in my face
And then my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance
I don't know why

I'm going crazy alone in a daze
And my heart ain't the same
And I don't even think unless I think about you
That's the only time I get sentimental
That's the reason why baby
I can't let go of you
Yeah, that's the only time I get sentimental

I miss you day and night, seems like you're still here
I'd rather be together honey
Now that I'm lost for words
I can't believe I'm on my own
I should've been looking at love

Now that you're gone
I want you (oooh ooh oooh)

Deborah Cox,"I'm going down
When I hear the sound
The sound of my tears
Always alike at the party
Always the clown of the class
All my friends see me happy, baby
But happy is only a fact
Nobody knows
When I'm alone inside my room
I sing under the two

I'm going down
When I hear the sound
The sound of my tears
When you're not around
It's all I can do
When I listen to
The sound of my tears

Baby when I'm missin' you
Don't buy the sound of the sea, baby
Don't buy the noise of the falls
Just when I'm lonely with my thoughts of you
The silence is always too loud
And it's no mine
You know we truly hang the sound
It's only just like a sign

For the first time since you've been gone, babe 
No friends to understand, to lend a helping hand 
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known 

How you walk away so easily 
Still remains a mystery to me 
Don't you remember that you promised me 
Yes, you promised me, that you'd never leave, boy 

But you went away, baby, and It's such a shame 
How could you turn you back on me, oh

If you really don't want me, if you don't want me 
If you really don't need me, if you don't need me 
If you really don't love me, then who do you love? 

I gave you babe everything, a man could ever need, 
I was there whenever you would call, baby, 
But somehow your feelings changed, and you don't act the same 
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all 

How you walk away so easily 
Still remains a mystery to me 
Don't you remember that you promised me

Now the love is gone, babe 
Tell me what went wrong 
How could you leave me hanging on, oh baby

I once was blind, but baby, now I'm seeing 
That I'm not the one, who can fill your every need

Deborah Cox,"There were words between us
Words that hurt inside
Still that's just no reason 
To say the words goodbye

We can't let go of something beautiful
We can't just let it die

Try to find one reason

Let the love back inside
Can't you and I just
Get back to those feelings

To those nights when the touch was sweet
Can we find our way back 
Before we lose everything

Couldn't time take the tears away
Couldn't you, you an me try again, again

Deborah Cox,"It was a cold day in December 
I remember it so well 
You captured my whole being 
And you left me in a spell 

You warmed my heart with passion 
Desiring all of you 
You left me cold in the summer 
I wish that I only knew but- 
 
I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

All the nights you left me crying 
Keeping company with my fears 
That some day you'd leave me lonely 
And that's exactly what you did 
I swore that I was your baby 
The darkest night for you I'd bear 
Now that I need you here with me 
I call your name and you're not there 

You left me standing 
So empty-handed 
Out in the cold 
How was I to know 
That my love didn't matter 
And my world was shattered 
'Cause you left me here 
Drowning in tears, oh why? 

I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

After we made plans to spend our lives together 
I thought what we had was meant to be forever 
Oh why did our love have to go away? 
I don't know how, I don't know when 
But I know, I'll never love this way again 

I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run

Was in front of your face

I drove down past the park 
Spotted a couple 
Who wasn't in trouble 
And they were doin' no harm 
She leans down and kisses him on his lips 
To give her love back he rubs her hips 
Oh, I could feel it 
I felt their passion 
Running through my warming veins 

So bad I wished that that was me 
Make love like they do on TV 
I see, all I seem to see 
Is you and me

Oh, I could feel it 
I felt their passion 
Running through my warming veins
 
How I wished that could be 
Baby you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 
If I had one wish it would be 
Baby, you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 

Now I'm not sayin' something's wrong with this relationship 
But I know one thing, boy 
It could be better 
We have bedroom secrets 
Sealed with a kiss 
But nothing else compares to this 
I'm talkin' about that real love 
That true love 
Can you feel me? 

Someday it will be you and me

With one exception 
I'mma grant your wish 
You see I'm diggin' your package 
That's why I sealed it with a kiss 

Homie's ain't understanding it 
They think I'm saving you girl 
Never take me for granted 
'Cause I'm craving you girl 

See my mental state is streetlight 
I'm like a fantasy

Deborah Cox,"I can't believe that a year has passed 
It seems like yesterday in September 

We started off as the best of friends 
No intention of falling in love again 
He held me there in my time of need 
My heart was set free 
What a sweet memory 

[Chorus:]
The day I fell in love 
It was so beautiful 
His hands, his tender touch 
I remember the day in September 
When we fell in love 

It was an unexpected night 
The sun was somewhere, but out of sight 
So familiar, yet unexplored and new 
We surrendered to our love in bloom 

[Chorus]

I couldn't believe it was love 
The passion we felt between us 
The warmth of your touch 
'Twas a night to remember 
On the day we fell in love in September

Deborah Cox,"I saw you the other day
And I almost lost my mind
I remember the things we did
I can't believe it's a waste of time
And sometimes I want to cry
And sometimes I want to die
Please help me understand
Why can't my heart just lie

Things just ain't the same
He could never be you
You should know the pain I feel
Understand what I'm going through

I'm still in love with you
And I know that you feel it too
But I feel that I can't go on
I just want you to come back home
I'm so ashamed of me
My heart is not complete
I know you walked away
My heart wants you to stay

Things just ain't the same
He could never be you
You should know the pain I feel
Understand what I'm going through

The water's in my eyes
Can't hide what I feel inside

I just cannot help myself

Deborah Cox,"To just act like we never were
To come around and not show hurt
How dare we greet by shaking hands
Just months ago  I was your man (was your man)

Can't get over you  girl (oh oh oh)

We can't be friends

(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend, yeah)
Cause I'm still in love with you

I went by mother's, saw your car there
To her you still family, and it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
I've tried and I can't do it
Cause I'm still torn

I tried to think of you as just another love
(in my past) in my past that didn't last
But it's not that simple, baby we

We can't be friends
(oh no no no no no) we
We can't be friends
(if we) if we can't be lovers
(we we we)
We can't be friends

Or catch me in a daze
You may see me hang my head

Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets

Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Still you never did keep me warm 
Conversation was a waste of time 
Never even asked what was on my mind (oh) 
It's funny how I can't recall your touch 
Spending time alone with you is never enough 
This emptiness I feel is too much 
You may not understand there's been a change of plans 

[Chorus]
Mr. Lonely, you gotta go 
You need to pack your bags and be out the door 
Even though you were there for me 
You never cared for me 
Before I couldn't see but now I know 
Mr. Lonely, I'm in love 
I've found a real man and you need to know 
And this time you won't be coming back 
Cause his love will last 
Mr. Lonely, who's lonely now? 

Two o'clock on a Sunday afternoon 
Same place, same park, but where were you 
I waited, but you never came 
That's when he sat down, but it wasn't the same 
Every word I said, he listened to 
Everything he had, I was missin' in you 
He's the man I never had before 
I won't be needin' you no more

The silence was killin' me 
It almost got the best of me 
Now that I've got room to breathe 
I'm makin' some changes, changes 
I'm stronger now; I'm wiser now 
A real man wants to hold me now 
It's clear to see I'll never be Mrs. Lonely

Wait until tomorrow babe 
If you think you're lonely now 
Wait until tomorrow babe

I'm not into you

Too good to be true
What you say what you do
So I gotta be careful
Don't want to fall too soon
And if I come across sometimes being rude
It's nothing against you
It just seems, too good to be true

I'd love for us to keep doing things together
But I don't want to rush the feeling (don't want to rush the feeling)
We can take our time (our time)

It's my season, now I stand alone
Just thought that I would let you know
Some things you just can't control

Should I wear my hair in a ponytail?
Should I dress myself up in Chanel?
Do I measure me by what you think?
Absolutely not, absolutely not
If I go to work in a mini-skirt
Am I givin' you the right to flirt?
I won't compromise my point of view
Absolutely not, absolutely not

But some things have got to change
Not gon' be a victim of

More than fancy clothes
More than you'll ever know

Made me stronger everyday

If he's giving you more (than a little bit) 
And if he's giving his all (can you handle it) 
You keep holding it down 
Yeah if he's givin' it up 
Hold it down for the one you love 

See I remember those days when they took more than they gave 
And the tears rolled down my face, for someone to give me that good love 
But then he came and turned my lonely nights to brighter days 
And I never will be the same 
'Cause I be lovin' my man, ladies can you feel me 
And if your man is givin' you more 

[Chorus:]

Is it his style- he's got the jeans and Timbs and the iced out pinky ring 
Is it his ride- got the Benz on chrome but it don't mean a thing to me 
Does he spend time - takin' first class flights but I'd rather be at home 
So he can touch me, slowly, 'cause when we're all alone, he gives me more

Deborah Cox,"Heard a million stories about love
 Some were good some were bad
 I found that if you hold on too tight
 You might lose everything you have
 Didn't think my heart could easily break
 When you fall in love that's a chance you take
 Now I know from these lessons that I learned from loving you
 
[Chorus:]
 I know that everybody makes mistakes
 I hope you still believe it's not too late
 'Cause I don't care about what people think or say
 I'd rather take a chance with you
 I'd rather be in love than be alone
 But I never knew that love could hurt so much
 I found it in my heart to forgive
 But it's hard to forget
 'Cause everyday the vision creeps in
 Of you and somebody else
 All my girls told me to let you go
 But I they're wrong
 I still love you so
 I'll hold on
 'Til I gain back the trust I had in you

And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you

And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet

Can we do a better job of pretending that you really care

You seem to have an important part
The lead role of my heart
You played it well along time ago
Until I started falling in love
And then you changed your character
And avoided all of your lines
Now the man I love is gone now
Can you play his part at this time

Love is like a see saw it takes two in order for it to work
I'm working hard, I'm playing my part but the scene still won't work

And who can play your part for life

Cause you know one call from him
And you'll be home before morn

You want him to be a better man
And you want him to treat you better than you treat yourself,
Girl you can help by showing him how he can

So try to find some ways to make me feel good
Up and down in and out that's what love is all about 
On our knees both of us feeling good and so helpless
Up and down in and out love keeps moving us around 
To the beat like a drum
I don't know if I can catch a rhythm (repeat 1x)


Well girl you real lady like and I'm real hood 
But at the end of the night we both feel good 
And I don't want to control you I just want to hold you
And I know I flip sometimes but I'm supposed to
When I don't mean to come off rude and all that 
'Cause I know you and your sexy mood and all that
Nobody get wetter than you do believe me girl 
I know you better than you do, believe me 
Its always in the back of you head
How we go from the jacuzzi to the balcony back to the bed
So perhaps we discuss it a little 
Can't change my attitude though maybe just adjust it a little
Then I'm gonna keep being thug 
The only time I disarm myself ma when we make sweet love
I'm gonna protect home base can't catch the rhythm 
Then we gonna make our own pace
You know I'm in a sexy mood so why you gotta act the fool tonight? 
You need to change your attitude 
'Cause I ain't arguing with your right (repeat 1x)

Deborah Cox,"How did you get in
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no
Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life
On a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turned around 
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken 
Oh it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say love wins again
So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're staying here

How did you get in
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no
Nobody's supposed to be here, (nobody's supposed to be here)
But you came along and changed my mind

This time I swear I'm through
But if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again when will I ever learn
Knowing these tears I've cried
This lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things
So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here

Deborah Cox,"[Chorus]
Can you pretend to be the man I should have been with?
Can we fake the life you know I should have had?
Can we do a better job of pretending that you really care?
Or I´ll have to give the part to someone else?

You seem to have an important part
The lead role of my heart
You played it well along time ago
Until I started falling in love

And then you changed your character
And avoided all of your lines
Now the man I love is gone now
Can you play his part at this time

[Chorus]

Love is like a see saw
It takes two in order for it to work
I´m working hard, I´m playing my part 
But the scene still won´t work
And rehearsals are long 
Because your timing is all wrong
So I´ll find someone who loves me
Who can play your part this time

[Chorus]

I deserve a lot better than this
And I´m tired of acting like it´s okay 
for me to give you my love
And receive nothing back in return

Different day but same damn bags

And I hope this don't take long

And you'll be home before morn
Here's a friendly hug
Followed by tough love
Are you ready?

The way he knows he can
It's all up to you my sista to show him that he can't
Have you had enough

Time for a change
Starting with you

No, don't say a word
Listen to Deborah for once
'Cause I went through the same thing
So I'll tell you what needs to be done

Mavis said it best
Girl respect yourself
It starts with you
You want him to be a better man

And you want him to treat you better than you treat yourself,
Girl you can help by showing him how he can
You can start by building your self esteem
Start believing you can do anything

And you'll find your man will fall in line
And if he don't than leave him behind

Deborah Cox,"When you're in love
Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart
How do I trade 
The best I had for less
Without giving up
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends

How do I know
When to let go
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

There's no winning bets
The battle's just begun

Deborah Cox,"[Chorus:]
Can you pretend to be the man I should have been with
Can we fake the life you know I should have had
Can we do a better job of pretending that you really care
Or I'll have to give the part to someone else

You seem to have an important part
The lead role of my heart
You played it well along time ago
Until I started falling in love
And then you changed your character
And avoided all of your lines
Now the man I love is gone now
Can you play his part at this time

[Chorus]

Love is like a see saw it takes two in order for it to work
I'm working hard, I'm playing my part but the scene still won't work
And rehearsals are long because your timing is all wrong
So I'll find someone who loves me
And who can play your part for life

I deserve a lot better than this
And I'm tired of acting like it's okay for me to give you my love
And receive nothing back in return

I sit around and wonder
About your new love affair

But you're lingering in my mind

To forget you now and then.
'Cause the sun rose and set on you baby
Time and again
Should you ever doubt
What I think about
Don't it always come right back to you

[Chorus]
I meant every word
Every single kiss
Everything you heard
Still lives inside me
Whoa
Though others have gone
And more still will come
And time marches on
You'll always be the one

Can't you see through me
Something's missing
Since you dropped from the palm of my hand
With faith I hold tight to the promise
Oh just as tight as one girl can
It's not that I'm denying
I know what we are not
Oh but

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You're the best thing I'll never have
Our love it dies in slow motion
You're every star I'll never catch
Over our desert ocean oh
I meant every word
Every single kiss
Everything you heard
Still lives inside me (oh)
Though others have gone
And more still will come
And time marches on
Oh yeah - yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't it always come right back to you

[Chorus]

You'll always, you'll always be the one
You'll always, always, always be the one
You'll always be the one",The One
Deborah Gibson,"Maybe I thought I wanted to be here
Maybe I thought I wanted your lovin' tonight
The music too slow, the lights too low
But something just wasn't right
I started to fear your glowing eyes, your tender touch
Your words they were too much for me
But when I tried to push you away
You said you didn't think I'd want it that way

[Chorus] 
When I say no, that's what I mean
Not maybe so or what's in between
If I said yes, that's what it would be
Is that what you heard? No!
So step away from me

True there are some girls who know what they're doing
People think they get what they deserve
But look who's calling the kettle black
baby you've got some nerve
I do not know why the reasons lie so unclear
But boy you've got to understand
If any girl rejects you
Don't you doubt it's part of the plan

[Chorus] 

Ego trips won't save you when your woman is deceived
Act upon what matters baby, not how you're perceived
She will love you more and maybe the rest will follow
But not if you push it baby!",What Part of No
Deborah Gibson,"I'm writing letters and your candle is burning
Things could be better, can't handle this yearning.
Can't stop my head from spinning,
wishing you were here.

Look at your photo but it still can't hold me,
I just recall the things you never ever told me
Like you're the one and I am
wishing you were here.

Wish you were here
to see the moon in the sky
Oh here, to see the light in your eyes
Looking at the stars and
Wishing you were here.

The clock is ticking but the time moves slowly
The weeks go quickly so you just won't know me
I'm writing love songs and I'm wishing

Wish you were here,
to see the moon in the skies
Oh here, to see the light in your eyes
Looking at the stars and
Wishing you were here
To put a smile on my face
Oh here, to get caught in my
warm embrace
Looking at the stars and
wishing you were here

To calm the restless nights
To kiss my fears away.
Here, to make this wrong seem right
To start our lives today.

Wish you were here,

Oh here, to see the light in your eyes

Deborah Harry,"Country cousins stepping out on city sides want to warm you and wish you a lovely time
Dirty dozens gonna push their pistols, gonna pull their pride
Oh so friendly flirties change their partners choose up sides

Buckle up your seat belt baby
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
Buckle up your sweet self sugar
You drive me crazy ya fly me high

Re re repercussions, echo and the reverbs sigh
Careless caution, it's not the case but what's inside
What can pass for safety measures?
You can tell 'em not to wreck your treasures
No this time, not ever, not next time
Make secure some sons and lovers
It's all made clear with see-thru covers
We're too close, too close for comfort now

Buckle up that seat belt baby, it's gonna be a bumpity bump
Buckle up your sweet self sugar, you drive me crazy and I jumpity jump

Yeah you got to do it
Yeah there's nothing to it
It's the law
Pull over, coming up on some bad road

Deborah Harry,"I've touched some objects of faith
More precious than pieces of eight
Seen sacred places and ritual ways But for communion let's go to my place
I learned to pray on my knees

Been taken in hand if you please
Had my own revelations ideas about fate
But for communion let's go to my place
So as the body so as the blood

Sacred as the soul is to love
Don't be mistaken if you don't understand
Divinely simple
Part of the plan

Take
Eat
This is my body
I give it to you

Take
Drink
This is my blood
Do it in remembrance of me so you won't forget me

Now I've been a witness of grace
I stare sacred days in the face
The long long parade of ritual ways
But for communion let's go to my place

Sacred stories are told
They're passed on like pieces of gold
So make your conclusions consider your fate 
But for communion let's go to my place

So as the body so as the blood
Sacred as the soul is to love

Deborah Harry,"Night comes a calling calling on you
Slips in behind ya long overdue
You'll be dancing down the moon

Sunset sliding my time to rise and be dancing down the moon
You whisper to me
Don't fear the dark
Come closer darling you'll feel the spark

I'll hold you tighter tight as I can
Moving together hard as we can
Sunlight don't burn me
Sunlight be cool

Moonlight's kind to me
I'm in night school and I'm dancing down the moon

Stay away from light be seen less

Am I sleeping
Stay awake all night
Night comes a crawling curling round you
Slips in behind ya long overdue

You'll be dancing down the moon
I love the moonlight
I love the night
Oh baby hold me tight now

I want you near me when it's five o'clock in the morning

Deborah Harry,"Maybe it's just a twist of light tonight
But the city's so bright this whole town's in focus

He's hold my head and pray for rain

Oh Johnny let me be your dog star girl
Let me curl inside
The fire's just right
The fire's just right in focus

But then he said
Like anything goes baby
But I don't know
I just don't know

Do you?
And how'd I ever get to this dead man's town where the rain
Where the rain falls down where the rain falls down forever?

So much for you so much for me but I don't see no I don't see

You're not
Not free to fall

Can this be happening
'Cause it sounds like lines to me
First you're sailing
Then you're swimming
Then you're sinking in the sea of love
Still you sparkle and you sizzle
'Cause a live wire always does

Oh no
You're not free to fall
Free to fall

Within the atmosphere so rare
So rare
So rare
I can see my liquid love light fading

Don't be so mean
Give it up baby
Why don't you come clean?
What harm can come from a stolen kiss
How could ya leave me at a time like this
Convicted by forbidden bliss
You hit the road like a fugitive
Give it up baby
Give it to me
I said give it up baby
Come clean
Were we just getting too intimate?
Like falling into a bottomless pit?
Committed crimes are pa-passionate
And just when it gets so primitive
You hit the road like a fugitive
Work me now
Work me now
Show me how
Work me now
Running scared's no way to live
Hesitant and tentative
Something else has got to give
It can be so primitive
All in one night we'll scheme our way to the heavens
You're captive in my grip
You're watching time crawl by
Attending to my needs
Emotion boiling over I count the explosions
Then you hit the road like a fugitive!
Work me now!
Oh baby show me how!
Work me now!
Work me now!
Staring for a moment as I sneak attack
You run away
I watch your back
You got to make your getaway
You better get it good
You're just a primitive fugitive

Got you on my mind and it's mind over manners

I got the latest point of view
I'm looking to pursue

Taken together taken apart

Where does it stand
Where does it bend
Where does my love light begin and yours end

They are balanced like a trinity

Two sides to every story

Our story's told as one
We come together

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Deborah Iurato,"Mi ritrovo a volare
Fino a toccare il cielo
Tutto sembra possibile
Tutto sembra più vero
Trovo anche il coraggio di specchiarmi nei tuoi occhi
Perdo ogni timidezza
E non c’è ombra che mi tocchi

Solo pochi minuti
A che sfiorano l’eterno
Finalmente respiro
Finalmente mi sorprendo
E vivo
Anche se fuori è inverno
Io mi sento bellissima
Mi sento più sicura
Non ho paura
E sorrido
Anche se fuori è inverno
Anche se fuori è inverno
È vero che l’amore porta in altre dimensioni
Dove ogni sogno è unico
Parlano solo le emozioni
E non ci sono ostacoli
Nemmeno passi incerti
Siamo fiumi d’acqua noi
Che bagnano i deserti

Solo pochi minuti
Ma che sfiorano l’eterno
Finalmente respiro
Finalmente mi sorprendo
E vivo
Anche se fuori è inverno
Io mi sento bellissima
Mi sento più sicura
Non ho paura
E sorrido
Anche se fuori è inverno
Anche se fuori è inverno
E la mia voce volerà
Fino a toccare il cielo

Mi sento già bellissima

Mi sento più sicura
Non ho paura

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow

Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

The quick toboggan when you reach the heights

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her

In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Let's start some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay?

Need ya, need ya, baby love, my baby love

Baby love, my baby love, why must we separate my love?
All of my whole life through
I never love no one but you
Why you do me like you do, I guess it's me
Ooh, need to hold you once again my love, feel your warm embrace my love
Don't throw our love away, please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be, loneliness has got the best of me my love

My baby love, I need ya oh how I need ya
Why you do me like you do
After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you
Baby, baby ooh
'Til it hurt me, 'til it hurt me
Ooh baby love
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away",Baby Love
Deborah Weisz,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Deborah Wyndham,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Deborah Wyndham,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
