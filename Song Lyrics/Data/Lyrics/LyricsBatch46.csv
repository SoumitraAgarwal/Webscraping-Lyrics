David Foster,"Another summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home

Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters
That I wrote to you,
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you?
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another aeroplane, another sunny place
I'm lucky, I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home

Let me go home

I'm just too far
From where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living
Someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day
Has come and gone away
In either Paris or Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
Let me go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
Let me go home

I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I've gotta go home

Let me go home

It'll all be alright,
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home",Home
David Foster,"Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

David Foster,"Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name 
But I knew just who they meant.
 
Whoa I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too
If by chance you heard it for yourself 
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you 
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa oh oh oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh

Now, now
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I want to hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah
And it made me feel proud when I heard you say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself 
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio 
Whoa oh oh
On the radio
 
If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Well tune right in you made find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud , they said it really loud

On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh 
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh

David Foster,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Pie Jesu/O Mid Bambino Caro
David Foster,"I found that love provides the key
Unlocks the heart and souls of you and me
Love will learn to sing your song
Love is written in the stone

Every man, I meet is walking time
Free to wander, past his conscious mind
Love will come and take you home
Love is written in the stone

Do you believe, my friend, in what you claim
People of the world, all doubt the same
Bringing questions of their own
Truth is written in the stone

In the stone, you'll find the meaning
You're not standing tall
In the stone the light is shining
Ever touching all

Life experience a passing day
Time will witness, what the ole folks say
Getting stronger every day
Strength is written in the stone

Deep inside your hearts for you to keep
Lies a spark of light that never sleeps
The greatest love you've ever known
Yeah is written in the stone

In the stone, you'll find the meaning
You're not standing tall
In the stone the light is shining
Ever touching all

Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Ever forever my darling
True love is written in the stone

Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Ever forever my darling
True love is written in the stone

Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Ever forever my darling
True love is written in the stone

Never

David Foster,"This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness",Say You Remember It
David Foster,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met",Smile/We've Got Tonight
David Foster,"I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side

I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my heart

'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes
I'll never break your heart

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear like a shadow that's by your side
I'll be there

For better or worse, till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear

I'll give you every thing I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls

And when just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as the time turns the page, my love won't age at all

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I swear (and I swear) like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there

For better or worse, till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear

I swear (I swear) by the moon and stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there

For better or worse, till death do us part
I'll love you with every (single) beat of my heart
I swear, I swear, oh, I, swear",This Will Be
David Foster,"I look in your eyes and I can see
We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone
You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun

When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire
To the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I know you're afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
And I can help if you'll only let me try
You touch me and something in me knew
What I could have with you
Well I'm not ready to kiss that dream goodbye

When it's this sweet, there's no saying no
I need you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire
To the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

Through the test of time

Through the fire
To the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

Through the fire, to the limit

David Foster,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

David Fridlund,"There's a yellow arrow painted on the ground 
I give up and I decide to follow 
There's a thick white blanket covering the town
And right now it's more then I can swallow

There's a ship sailing gently on the waves
There's a tear drop rollin'
There's a small hand pressed against a glass
And there's and engine pullin' 

And you'll be far away
And you'll be deep inside
And you know that time is all we have 

There's a big black nothing in your heart
There's me in a white van
And there's a million holes dug in the pavement
There's a good chance to avoid them

So if you decide to leave
Or if you decide to stop breathing 
Don't leave me hanging
‘Cause time is all we have

And what about the love in your hands 
And the cold in your palm
And the sweat on your forehead 
I can never ever be calm 
I can never sit still
Because I'm like an alarm-clock
See me 
Hear me
Do this 
Do that 
Take my words, eat them and swallow
Don't measure my steps and actions 
Just hold me close and I will follow

And there's a big knife pressed against my throat 
There's a word carved into my back 
And there's a sea of questions everywhere you go
And there's really no way out

And if you decide to leave 
Then you'll leave without me 
And you know that time is all we have",White Van
David Friedman,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day

David Friedman,"Father, I'm going through some heavy things
It seems like this world ain't getting any better
The more we try to get closer to You
The farther we run from Your throne

I've spent so many nights wonderin' when will it end
When will the day come when happiness begins
I'm running the race but it seems too hard to win
I'm sick of mourning my stomach is throwing up in the morning

I'm calling for help and watching it melt away
My heart's been put on display and put away
In many ways, many times I told myself it was ok
And anger was the price that was paid
While these faded dreams just screamed to bring them home

The burden was too heavy I kept running from the throne
I can't take it any longer
I can taste my spirit hunger
God please help me get home

Lord though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I'm not scared cause You're holding my breath
I only fear that I don't have enough time left
To tell the world that there's no time left, Lord please
Lord though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I'm not scared cause You're holding my breath
I only fear that I don't have enough time left
To tell the world that there's no time left

I've come to terms that I'm burning both sides of the rope
And I'm hoping that self-control would kick in before I'm choking off
The sin that be destroying every fiber I got
I need the Lord in every way I'll never make it I'm not
Going back to the way I was before Christ in my life
I couldn't do it I would lose it there's no point to the fight
And I'm writing this song, for the people who don't belong
I pray away the pain you feel from all the things that went wrong
Inside a life that's filled with anger and disappointment
'Cause daddy treated you weaker than all of the other kids
It's annoying and I feel for all of you who wanna give up
You feel stuck I feel the same way Lord help us stay up
You couldn't pay me to abandon the idea of true hope
That I could make it through this life into a place where there's no crying
I'm dying to find You with open arms when I go
Knowing You love me and You waiting to give rest to my soul

There's go to be more
Than this life I know
But still I'm here fighting to never give up
I find strength in Your love
And You will see me through",Forgiving

Maybe haven't got shoes

David Friesen,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

David Friesen,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

How white the ever constant moon

To which I hatched a plan
I drink myself to death
Just because I can

I have to stand up and walk away
I can't lie to myself this way

So hard to feel the pain
But you're wrapped so tight
In your one block world
Too scared to make the change

While you're playing with your gun
Is your finger shaking on the trigger
Are you really having fun

I have to stand up and walk away
I can't lie to myself this way

You're breathing
Maybe you can make a change

Sitting up there on your throne

Waiting for the last drop seems like a long, long time
Maybe I should go back home, I'll sit and wait right by the phone
Praying over the porcelain throne on my dirty sticky floor

Ask me what I want easy that's just more
How long will I wait for you, twice as long as I did before
Standing in the freezing snow, maybe you left I just don't know
I'll soon be lying on my own on some dirty sticky floor

I hope no one can see me, the tin man says I'm doing fine
That lion ain't gonna get me, see that gun right there it's mine
I've painted a face where I burnt the floor
Now the face has become my devils' door
Laying in the back room, on my dirty sticky floor

David Garrick,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;

David Garrick,"I never liked the rain before
It always made me stay inside
There's one thing that I know for sure
I've got a reason to like it
Since you took me for a rainbow ride

It's raining, it's pouring
But I don't care no more

i've got a lonely message for you
the marionette's in the ballroom laughing
Baptiste the clown
up in the gods now they're laughing
Garance has a heart like a vase
the man has fingers like flowers blooming

Humming this tune that I just heard
a melody I barely know
a song for the children of paradise
Baptiste the clown
asks himself who am I

ah - don't sing only half the song
ah - can't you hear us sing along
yawning words waiting
for the moon to come closer

How can he kill without mercy
just to dress up like a king
under the makeup his face is flooding

try to remember the days
when we would talk till the light

with salt and sand

in time maybe we'll discover 
we could've been closer to the core

try to remember we're dead

Before I let you down, before you let me go
We'd listen to the left side of the radio

Your coffee eyes
Your half and half
White lies
Back around '92
I lost god
I found you
I found you

I found you dancing with the blissed-out brothers
And the dreadlocked white girls
Spinning like a discoball world
With the extra virgins and the gold-teeth stoners
Spinning like a discoball world

The flowers that we stole from san jacinto
They're in the vodka vases by the window
I can't forget the day that you forgot me
When your kisses got so vicious
And I fell for

I'll breathe through you.
Under life you'll find me waiting for this:
Pain to end
With your kiss.
Stay another hour
Flower, flower.
Bloom under the light
of the moon tonight.
The only thing I'm sure
Is you're
My little flower.

Everchanging as they come and go
Makes me wonder why I'm up so high
When really I am down so low

Of all the wonders I was one allowed
I think that I would always choose a cloud
Always brings my feelings right out loud
Whether I'm ashamed or proud

On this airplane comin' home to you
Sometimes I think I've flown my whole
Life through
My whole life... through
As I wing my way to you

See the clouds they're giving life below
In colors that the canvas cannot show
Keeping secrets no one else could know
For I'm the one who told them so

Now and then I get up close to you
I'd like to stay but I'm just passing through
So I'll have to say goodbye...
Until next time I fly.

Comin' in on the midnight flight
Touch the ground and soon you will be
Safe inside reality

Change your mind-change your name
Still the music it sounds the same

Rainfall don't bother me at all
You see the world reflected on the highway
Come on rainbow-I can't let you go
Before I reach the end of you someway

So the next time raindrops fall
If it makes you climb the walls just think
Of green.

To take a chance
So if you like the music baby
Get up and dance

And if we grow together daring to dream
I know we'll find our shares of
Peaches and cream
And when the juices flow
I don't want no no no excuses
Just want your full time love
For me
Just want your full time love
For me.",Part-Time Love
David Gates,"Sunday riders-ridin' out along the highway
Sunday gliders-glidin' up along the skyway
Some must fly and some must speed
To satisfy the human need

Paper dresses-wear them once and throw
away
Plastic flowers-try to smell them anyway
No matter what the future brings
Nothin's like the real things

Sunday lovers-sneakin' in forsaken places
Under covers-so's to hide the guilty faces
Take my wife and take my pay
But don't take my Sunday lady from me.",Sunday Rider
David Gates,"Took the last train to St. Tropez
Had in mind to dance the night away
Experimented with a cognac high
When in france you give everything a try

Soon the crowd dwindled down to two
Not a soul around but me and you
You just smiled in french and took my hand
Spoke the words i tried my best to understand
You're tellin' me-

Viens chez moi
Ce soir va jamais terminer
On va rester toujours ensemble-you're
Tellin' me

Come with me
Tonight will last forever
We wiii stay together always
In love

Woke the next day and found her note
Love ya, goodbye that's all she wrote
And every night down at the place we met
I wait for her and those sweet words i
Can't forget

Cause she's my heart my inspiration
Lucky is the man who find the child of love


Like a haunting melody
You allowed to sing forever
She always seems to where so well with time


Everybody knows musician needs somebody special
Always just the same who keep the crazy dance
Better around enough to know for me there's no one finer
And she's mine, she's my lady valentine


Your the music your my song
Here with me is where you belong
I need my February near


Your the rhythm, your my ryhme
Keep me right into the time
And I'm so happy when you're here


Everybody needs somebody that you can be sure of
Life alone is nowhere that you want to be
Sentence isn't long and hopin'
Brother you've gotta choose
Cause I've got mine
Got my lady valentine

Cloudy skies and start to rain.

I should have warned ya, it might not work and you just might break.
Now I fore Lorne ya, Yes I know it was my mistake but
Who hasn't tried it, I wanted love that was slightly out of reach.
Now it's over, it's all over.

No matter how hard I tried I couldn't seem to keep her satisfied
No matter what I went together could've, always been a little bit better.
I couldn't make it fast enough-the money, the money wouldn't last enough.
I couldn't keep her satisfied no matter, no matter, how hard, how hard, I tried.

Still I can't pretend
My heart is torn just knowing that
I'm losing my best friend
If it's easier said than done
Then someone tell me why
Though I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye

I can tell her that I'm sorry
And hope she'll understand
And she'll have to do with someone else
All that we had planned
I'd rather her hear the truth
Than hurt her with a lie
So I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye

I know I have to go
There's no other way
But goodbye is not what I
Can bring myself to say

I can tell her ""see you later""
But then I might be wrong

To find where I belong
I know I must leave her now

For the hearts that never played in tune

But where was June

If it did it never made a sound,
Maybe I was absent or was listening too fast,
Catching all the words, but then the meaning going past,

And I'd go a thousand times around the world just to be
Closer to her than to me

Wish that I had found the way
And the reasons that would make her stay

And started reading about me
The words she's written took me by surprise
You'd never read them in her eyes.
They said that she had found the love she waited for.
Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it.

When she confronted with the writing there,
Simply pretended not to care.
I passed it off as just in keeping with
Her total disconcerting air
And though she tried to hide
The love that she denied,
Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it.

And as I go through my life, I will give to her my wife
All the sweet things that I can find.

I found her diary underneath a tree.
And started reading about me.
The words began stick and tears to flow.
Her meaning now was clear to see.
The love she'd waited for was someone else not me

And as I go through my life, I will wish for her his wife

Who's gonna steal the show

He can make you cry

Miles and miles a day
To find another place to play

You go listen to the guitar man

Then he comes to town
And you see his face
And you think you might
Like to take his place

Miles and miles away
Searchin' for the songs to play

Then you listen to the music
And you sing along
You want to get the meaning
Out of each and every song
Then you find yourself a message
And some words to call your own
And take them home

He can make you love
He can get you high
He will bring you down
Then he'll make you cry
Somethin' keeps him movin'
But no one seems to know
What it is that makes him go

And the sound is getting dim

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,

You're a Botticelli, You're Keats, You're Shelley,
You're Ovaltine.

We're swept apart too soon.

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Seeking to justify the part you play
And hide, fearing it incomplete, to try
To make it any more or less than short and sweet

As we are wont to try to make it be
We're caught watching the dark in the sky, who knows?
Helpless as time itself to hold the time of day

And you, you are a fantasy, a view
From where you'd like to think the world should see
Be true and you will likely find a few
Building a vision new and justice to our time

And we, we, the immoral men, we dare
Naked and fearless in the elements
And free, carefree of tempting fate, aware
And holding off the moral nightmare at the gates

Toward a new day breaking in the east
We'll meet as every future dream unfolds
And surely quality that is the very least",Short and Sweet

Is love that is
Demands to always be unchanged
But then all lovers are deranged.

We walk away with memories
And clutch them to our hearts
We're disembodied entities
We move in fits and starts
For burning wine

And takes all caution in its flames

Turn around and you're looking at a stranger
She steals your savings from under your bed
And leads you into places even angels fear to tread
She's a blue light

She's not amused, when you're trying to upstage her
So you choose to do nothing to enrage her

No one will control me by pain
No one will cause me to cry

I learned how to sigh
On the ribbon and wires
It's a habit that's so hard to weaken

No one will ever manipulate
Make me promise to do or die
No one can make me hesitate
What can I lose if they try
I was looking for love
Like the very first time
Didn't realise love never left me
Contradicted - conspired
I connived and designed
Nothing on earth could arrest me.

As if there was something that they thought they might find
Taking some strength from the feelings that always were shared
And in the background, the eyes that just stared

What was it brought you out here in the dark?
Was it your only way of making your mark
Did you get rid of all the voices in your head?
Do you now miss them and the things that they said?

On your own admission you raised up the knife
And you brought it down ending another man's life
When it was done you just threw down the blade
While the red blood spread wider like the anger you made

I don't want this anger that's burning in me
It's something from which it's so hard to be free
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page",Murder

And when you feel you're near the end
And there's a stranger where once was a friend
And you are left without a word
Only the whispers that you've overheard

Standing in silence, holding my breath
Disconnected and dry
And though I'm certain that there's nothing left
To hold on to, to give or to try
Some things never change, no don't ever change
And I'm feeling the cold
Thinking that we're getting older and wiser
When we're just getting old

And when you feel you're near the end
And what once burned so bright is growing dim?
And when you see what's been achieved
Is there a feeling that you've been deceived?",Near the End

To be safe from the storm

Out of the blue, with wings on his heels

For the time that he steals

But steal it he will, my children's and mine
Against our desires, against all our needs

Over and over we call, no one hears

Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The light was brighter
With friends surrounded

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon

In his world he won't go under

Says he doesn't care who's saved

Along by the river we feed bread to the swans
And then over the footbridge to the woods beyond

We walk ourselves weary, you and I
There's just this moment

I light a campfire away from the path
We lie in the bluebells, a woodpecker laughs

Time passes slowly our hearts entwined
All of the dark times left behind

The day is done
The sun sinks low
We fold up the blanket, it's time to go

We walk ourselves weary, arm in arm
Back through the twilight
Home again

We waltz in the moonlight and the embers glow
So much behind us
Still far to go",Where We Start
David Gilmour,"Would this do
To make it all right
While sleep has taken you
Where I'm out of sight

[Chorus]
I'll make my getaway
Time on my own
Search for a better way
To find my way home
To your smile

Wasting days and days
On this night
Always down and up
Half the night

Hopeless to reminisce
Through the dark hours
We'll only sacrifice
What time will allow us
You're sighing, sighing

All alone
Though you're right here
Now it's time to go
From your sad stare

David Gilmour,"Lime and limpid green the second scene
The fights between the blue you once knew
Floating down the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground

Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon there on the run
Titanian, Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

Winding signs flap
Flicker flicker flicker flam pow pow
Stairways scared and death rules there

David Gilmour,"Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run rabbit run
Dig that hole,forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to start another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave",Breathe (In the Air)
David Gilmour,"Home, home again
I like to be here when i can
When i come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells",Breathe (In the Air) (Reprise)
David Gilmour,"Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.

Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.

You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze.

Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.

Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.

Well you wore out your welcome with random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.

Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!",Shine on You Crazy Diamond
David Gilmour,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain

You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's
Sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half page of scribbled lines

Hanging on in quite desperation is the English way
The time is gone the song is over, thought I'd something more
To say",Time
David Gilmour,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a leading role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Wish You Were Here
David Gilmour,"Something I never knew
In silence I'd hear you
And a boat lies waiting
Still your clouds all flaming
That old time easy feeling

What I lost was an ocean
Now I'm drifting through without you
In this sad barcarolle

What I lost was an ocean
And I'm rolling right behind you
In this sad barcarolle

It rocks you like a cradle
It rocks you to the core
You'll sleep like a baby
As it knocks at death's door",A Boat Lies Waiting
David Gilmour,"Maybe I should have shown you a clearer plainer truth
That doesn't care about summer and less about youth
Now in this silence, what more is there to do?
Something has broken in me and in you

In watchful dependence, a satellite spins
Cautiously circling the space that I'm in
It's bouncing me signals distorted by time
And I'm stuck here waiting for the stars to align

Dancing right in front of me, all the lives I once could see
Slipping to and slipping fro, disappearing
Who's to know where they have gone just out of sight
Into the shadows of my night
Who started out as stars in my eyes

There's a wide horizon, go on now take a chance
Your star is shining it lights a brighter path
It's all there inside you, take one day at a time
Reeling, freewheeling, I want to watch you fly",Dancing Right in Front of Me
David Gilmour,"Faces of stone that watched from the dark
As the wind swirled around and you took my arm in the park
Images framed, hung high in the trees
And you talked of your youth 
But the years had turned dry as the leaves

Your lover was gone, his replacement to hand
And just what the difference was, you could not understand
In darkening grey we walked back through the streets
Then you talked all night long of your childhood home by the sea

And I, my disguise a mask chosen by you
Believed every word I heard
At least I think that's what I tried to do

We sat on the roof, the night overflowed
No more was said but I learned all I needed to know
Your Hollywood smile shone a light on the past
But it was the future that you held so tight to your heart",Faces of Stone
David Gilmour,"She mesmerizes with a smile 
Dark eyes as compelling as the bourbon 
That girl in the canary yellow dress 
Says yes

She flips a pack of cigarettes
He doesn't smoke, but he takes one nonetheless
It helps to keep his motives true, the girl was blue
What else is the poor boy supposed to do

She bounces like a flame, clothes on her
Eyes closed
Yellow dress
Runs and swirls

It's late, the hour's growing horns
The band seems to draw her ever closer
This girl gets right down in the groove, grooves a move
Leads him out to where they play the blues

She dances like a flame
Has no cares, yellow-dressed flame
Eyes closed, clouds above
She shakes pearls and snakes

Too late in this folie a troix
He sees that the heart is pounding for
Big daddy who falls down to his knees, begging her please
Lifts his sax, says ""here's my little tease""

Her dancing sets the place on fire
Heaven and hell
The flames come up his spine
As she shakes pearls and snakes",The Girl in the Yellow Dress
David Gilmour,"Home and done it's just begun
His heart weighs more, more than it ever did before
What has he done? God help my son
Hey, stay a while, I'll stay up
No sugar is enough to bring sweetness to his cup
I know sorrow tastes the same on any tongue

How was I to feel it
When a gun was in my hands
And I'd waited for so long
How was I to see straight
In the dust and blinding sun
Just a pair of boots on the ground

On the screen the young men die
The children cry in the rubble of their lives
What has he done? God help my son
Hey, stay a while, I'll stay up
The volume pumped right up but not enough to drown it out
I hear ""Mama"" sounds the same in any tongue

When my faith stands in the way
And the wailing is long done
How am I to know you

When the call to arms has come",In Any Tongue

Keep safe this night and dwell upon
Such murmurations, sun sunk deep
Now close your eyes and go to sleep

What a day it's been
A day of shoot the breezes
What a day it's been this time of year
oh yes it is

Just a day when the weight of the world slides away

Feel that sun on your back
See the shadows falling
See me ? and choose it with a song
Oh yeah

If this should be my last day on earth I'll sing along

New day, always
Lets forget all the skies cast over the rain
and the sqouring tempest of doubt
Holding on clinging tight in the wreckage of love
But today

What a time to dream
What a day of easy
What a day it's been this time of year
Oh yeah

David Gray,"Cast your eyes into the distance
Try to focus on it all
Find a spirit of resistance
Instead of pride before the fall
Forge some opposition
From disparate strands
It ain't the prettiest position
As a century ends

Unstable situation
Faces made of wax
Streams of melting glass
Sheets of butchered facts
The roar of the machine
Hooded hearts and jeweled hands
And anger spilling out like gasoline
As a century ends

Everything I seen, 
Everything that I heard,
Ain't even the tip of the iceberg
Fire down memory lane
So pass me my rose tinted glasses again

Through a fog of contradiction
Out to the lake of tears
See society admiring its own reflection
Chase a light that shines and disappears
Careful what you say 'cause reality offends
Just sit back and let your soul decay
As a century ends

And it's easy to get weary
As you fight to get it done
'Gainst a popular theory
That it's over

Tend a wound that never mends
And honesty's still out of fashion

David Gray,"The hour is out of joint
Black sun has risen
And the river of words
Is flowing on through 
The cages of tradition
And they're handing out emptiness
We'll take it 'cause it's given 
Free with this plastic innocence 
And these standards of living

Questions lighted questions
Burnin' holes into my head
Hanging like shadows o'er the sun
Staring out like the eyes of the dead
And sometimes my soul flickers
When the wind of change blows cold
Over the mire of repetition
Down the corridors of rigmarole

What I say, what I think
What I put down in ink
I'm only trying to find a way to understand
And I mean no harm
I'm just searching for calm
In the storm of mankind

Do you find it there 
In the sea of faces
That drowns you everyday
Or in the silence and rubble and empty spaces
Where children and rottweilers play
Is it buried in the praise
Given so cheap
With a meaningless movement of the jaws
In the looking glass 
That flatters you
Or in the rattle of hollow applause

Blind circle, moon and sun body willing, mind undone
One pain ending while another begins
Lies, ruin disease
Into wounds like these
Let the truth sting

From the hub to the limit
Through the urban hollows
Out into the poles of the extreme 
To echo through the numbness
Of these godless minutes
In the shadow of delusion's regime

And here watching the night
As it opens like a flower
And the day starts to rust
Feeling time pound
Like a silent hammer
On this empire of dust
And I'm thinking bout the bullet
And the TV screen, the dollar, and the clenched fist
And if we're searching for peace
How come we still believe 
In hatred as the catalyst

Oh through the borderline
In front and behind
One pain ending
While another begin
Lies, ruin disease
Into wounds like these
Let the truth sing
Yeah 
Let the truth

And I feel it from the pit of my stomach
Into the ditch of my mind
Inside the chambers of my heart
As I stare half blind
At these walls of cardboard
At this space that I've rented
At your beauty that is crumbling
Though you try so hard to prevent it

On and on
Body willing, mind undone
One pain ending while another begins
Lies, ruin, disease
Into wounds like these
Let the truth sting
Let the truth sting
Let the truth sting",Let the Truth Sting
David Gray,"I can see it in your eyes
What I know in my heart is true
That our love it has faded
Like the summer run through
So we'll walk down the shoreline
One last time together
Feel the wind blow our wanderin' hearts
Like a feather
But who knows what's waiting
In the wings of time
Dry your eyes
We gotta go where we can shine

Don't be hiding in sorrow
Or clinging to the past
With your beauty so precious
And the season so fast
No matter how cold the horizon appear
Or how far the first night
When I held you near
You gotta rise from these ashes
Like a bird of flame
Step out of the shadow
We've gotta go where we can shine

For all that we struggle
For all we pretend
It don't come down to nothing
Except love in the end
And ours is a road
That is strewn with goodbyes
But as it unfolds
As it all unwinds
Remember your soul is the one thing
You can't compromise
Take my hand
We're gonna go where we can shine
We're gonna go where we can shine
We're gonna go where we can shine

You lie on the floor with me
Come closer my love
I'm badly in need
Of an afternoon's debauchery",Debauchery
David Gray,"I care little for my body she said 
I couldn't care less about my soul 
And as she led me upstairs in whispers 
My whole summer turned cold 

I'll lead you upstairs 
I'll lead you upstairs 
If you've got no worries 
Then I've got no cares 
I'll lead you upstairs 

I told her people had been talking 
About how dark she was inside 
She said said my hopes are buried in the soil Deep in the earth outside 
And with one twist of the world 
She brought me to her side 
She asked me for the truth one time 
And I all I did was lied",Lead Me Upstairs
David Gray,"I can see it in your eyes
What I know in my heart is true
That our love it has faded
Like the summer run through
So we'll walk down the shoreline
One last time together
Feel the wind blow our wanderin' hearts
Like a feather
But who knows what's waiting
In the wings of time
Dry your eyes
We gotta go where we can shine

Don't be hiding in sorrow
Or clinging to the past
With your beauty so precious
And the season so fast
No matter how cold the horizon appear
Or how far the first night
When I held you near
You gotta rise from these ashes
Like a bird of flame
Step out of the shadow
We've gotta go where we can shine

For all that we struggle
For all we pretend
It don't come down to nothing
Except love in the end
And ours is a road
That is strewn with goodbyes
But as it unfolds
As it all unwinds
Remember your soul is the one thing
You can't compromise
Take my hand
We're gonna go where we can shine
We're gonna go where we can shine
We're gonna go where we can shine

David Gray,"Tears falling slow.
From the bridge into the river below.
In your eyes I start to see.
A starry veil and the oceans of infinity.

Moon and stars above me.
Mingle with the blood inside my veins.
Empty arms that should be
Holding me close through nights of winter rain.
And I'm trying to spell what only the wind can explain.
It's colder than ever
Coming down

Now I'm drowning in shallows
'Cause I'm in so deep
There's neon melting in the rain
I took too much powder to sleep
When I hold you naked
When I hear your laugh
I got a sword to stem the rivers
And cut the moon in half.

Frozen stars above me
Mingle with the blood inside my veins
Empty arms that should be
Holding you close through nights of winter rain
And I'm trying to spell what only the wind can explain
It's colder than ever
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down

We danced wild
Kicked off our shoes
Not a cloud in the the sky to confuse.
Now the sky is cold and the sea is white
And there's nothing to be done except reflecting the sun
And scratching the mountain side",Coming Down
David Gray,"All of my senses overthrown
By the might of your skin,
And the lamplight on your cheekbones
Drawing me further in.

No sentence I can speak
For the wonder so unique
Breaking like a wave upon the shore.
Mercy me
I'm falling free
Since you opened up the door.

See how the sky is made of sapphire
The color flowing through our hands
The moon is fire in your hair
A million miles beyond what science understands.
Smell that mountain heather,
I don't remember ever
Feeling like this before.
Mercy me
I'm falling free
Since you opened up the door.

And if every window pane should shatter,
If every wall should fall apart,
Well it might hurt a bit
But would it matter
With this diamond in my heart?

And there's no need to nail it to the ground,
No need to smother it with sense,
Just listen to the rhythm of your heart, that pounding,
And trust it all to chance.

'Cause we're standing face to face
With the angel of grace
And don't it just taste so pure?

Mercy me, I'm falling free,
Mercy me, I'm falling free,
Mercy me, I'm falling free,
Since you opened up the door.",Falling Free
David Gray,"As the bell must strike the hour
As the west must stab the sun
So our hearts must heed the flow
Of deeper tides that run

Far beyond this bare indifference
That prosperity esteems
Where the spirit raves and dances
Through our very veins

At winter's edge you found me
By the fields of wild gold
My hands still filled with ashes
From fires long cold

You pulled me from the wreckage
Of bitterness and blame
Flung open the page
And put some flesh on the bones of my dreams

On the streets the blossom snowing
And the drum is beating slow
To hear you speak so clear
Well I'm slicing through the fear
And setting all the beacons blazing oh!

It's staring out plainer than ever
Brighter than all the fool's gold that gleams
It's simply now or never
Putting flesh on the bones of my dreams

Putting flesh on the bones of my dreams
Putting flesh on the bones of my dreams

And they can plunder the cave of sorrows
They can strip the gallery bare
Try to build a fence around the visions
In our heads, choke every spark
In a cloak of despair

But we got something they can't stifle
With their price tags and picture frames
Got a flower for every rifle
Putting flesh on the bones of my dreams",Flesh
David Gray,"You turn off the light,
And the dark sucks on the embers of the fire.
My heart smolders in the night,
And these tumbling boulders of desire

Come rolling out the shadows at me,
Rolling out the shadows at me,
Rolling out the shadows at me.

You say, ""I thought time was meant to take away the hurting?""
As your lonely silhouette closes the curtain.
We're back on the road, destination uncertain,
So let's get in this car and drive.

And this feeling I feel is so strong,
So powerful, it can't be wrong;
And now the whole frosted night is just a song,

A song for you,
A song for you,
A song for you.

Now the moon is splashed right over the street
Like my tears on your thighs so pale.
It's just you and me and the sheets,
And the whole, the whole wide world is just a jail,

When you're away from me,
You're away from me,
You're away from me.

And it's rollin' on by,
Here come the night.

You turn out the light
And the dark sucks on the embers of the fire;
My heart smolders in the night
And these tumbling boulders of desire

Come rolling,
Come rolling,
Rolling, rolling,
Rolling, rolling,
Rolling, rolling,
Rolling, rolling,
Rolling, rolling,
Rolling, rolling out the shadows at me

You turn out the light.",The Light
David Gray,"Its a sad old world
That's turning tonight
As I slide through the streets
Moonlight and memory burning 
And in my hand your broken dream

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window 
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul 'til the night is dead

All these useless emotions 
Churning round
As I search these bare walls for a clue
And all the time
The truth is flashing in my mind
That when a heart gets broken 
There's nothing you can do

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul 'til the night is dead

And I'm packing my belongings
Hey I'll be gone before the noon arrives
'Cause I know there's no use pretending
Soon it'll all be alright

But hey
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head 
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul 'til the night is dead

See the dawn break gold
When the night is dead

Hear the bells",Lullaby
David Gray,"Down from the doorway and into the street 
I hear the morning bell 
Over and over the pattern repeat 
I hear the morning bell 
And all the faces cold as stone 
In the January chill 
You have led me into worlds unknown 
And I'm walking there still 

Every time now 
Every time now 
I think of you mine now 
I just can't contain 
I'm seven feet tall and 
There's nightingales calling 
Shooting stars falling 
Like jewels in the rain 

I ask myself, I ask myself 
Can this life be the same 
That spun me round and put me down 
And filled me up with shame 
And all the heads are turning now 
Down the Tottenham Court road 
Cause I just can't help but sing it out 
Case I just might explode 

Every time now 
Every time now 
I think of you mine now 
I can't comprehend 
The saxophones blowning 
Cherry trees snowing 
Emeralds growing 
Right here in my hand 

A dance in the moonlight 
So high on a June night 
Magazines strewn right 
Over the chair 
Your spine a white ladder 
Your eyes singing sadder 
Nothing else seems to matter 
As soon as you're there 
And every time now 
Every time now 
I think of you mine now 
I just can't contain 
I'm seven feet tall and 
There's nightingales calling 
Shooting stars falling 
Like jewels in the rain

David Gray,"Hey now, you got me by the tongue
I feel like there's nowhere I belong
And they're working it pretty hard
And they're selling it by the yard
But it's more than I can afford
That's all that I know

Leader, it comes as no surprise
See now, these are coins that were his eyes
Silver dollars and hoods of steel
Tell me nothing can be revealed
The more you get it the less you feel
That's all that I know
Starts a shivering in my spine
And a fever I can't define
It gets colder the higher you climb
That's all that I know

You kill me with every word you say
I'm dead now, along with faith and chivalry
Silver dollars and hoods of steel
Tell me nothing can be revealed
The more you get it the less you feel
That's all that I know
Colder the higher you climb
Colder the higher you climb
Colder the higher you climb
That's all that I know","Faster, Sooner, Now"
David Gray,"I have waited the night over
For some word to come
I asked the moon o'er the clover
But the moon she is dumb

You have made me a promise
At midnight we'd go
And that we should be married
Sailing westward ho

Such words you have spoken
You have told me a lie
That it could not be broken
When you knew it must die

There's no light in heaven
My eye can see
That my heart be imprisoned
While the devil go free
Go free

Like honey the ocean
In the morning breeze
I'll take my tears to the water
That the rivers may freeze

There's no light in heaven
Can shine for me
That my heart be imprisoned
While the devil go free
Go free

What folly is beauty
What trick of the skin
Desire it's fancy
And ruin its whim
Your child within me
And what can I do
My blood fill with needles
That he look like you

There's no light in heaven
My eye can see
That my heart be imprisoned
While the devil go free
My heart be imprisoned
While the devil go free
No light in heaven
No light for me",Folk Song
David Gray,"A gutter full of rain
An empty picture frame
A house out at the edges of the city
Never noticing the war
'Till it's right there at your door
And suddenly your hands are bloody

I was seeking to possess
Now another girl's caress
Is on your flesh
The bitterness is tasted
There's nobody in your chair
No hand to touch my hair
The sun even the air seems wasted

Let it go now, let it all slip away
And we'll start it all over again
Me, like a million others before
Trying to make sense of the rain

Were these twenty years a dream
Was it ever as it seemed
Get to wonder if it really existed
'Cause the thief who stole my life
Has taken, too, my faith
I can see now how the world gets twisted

Let it go now, let it all slip away
And we'll start it all over again
Me, like a million others before
Trying to make sense of the rain

In spite of all the shame
Some times I hear your name
I think of us when we were younger
Then I'm shutting out the noise
Ans I'm trying to hear the voice
That used to tell me love was stronger

Light another cigarette
But the one I got's still lit
I can't seem to keep my fingers steady
Never noticing the war
'Till it's right there at your door
Ans suddenly your hands are bloody",Gutters Full of Rain

To the walls and to the sky
It seeks no explanation
It waits for no reply
Really it is nothing
Just a cry to the wilds

I'm delirious with chaos
I'm wonder struck with awe
In my soul I'm dreaming only
Of your velvet shore
When I'm walking there my face
Untangles like a child

And only the lonely
Only the lonely
Lonely could know me

I've been talking all night long
There's nothing more to say
So I'm searching every mirror
For a trace of yesterday
But the air it holds no traces
Where the eagles were flying

I'm haunted by the skyline
The concrete and the rain
The window speaks of winter
So I'll set my heart again
Somewhere in the dust 
A curlew is crying

And only the lonely
Only the lonely
Lonely could know me
I'm talking all night long
Talking all night

There's a copper moon that's buried
Where solitude expands
And distant planets moving
They're weighing on my hands
They're darkening my pages

And there's daylight in my fingers
But it's snowing in my bones
Been sucking on the echo
Of a thousand telephones
And when we meet again
We will be strangers

Lonely could know me
And only the lonely
Only the lonely
Lonely could know me",Only the Lonely

The time is
Twenty five past eternity

Hear you listening
To the silence
Coming closer
Now further away

What we gonna do
When the money runs out
I wish that there was something left to say
Where we going to find the eyes to see
The bright of day

I'm sick of all the same romances
Lost chances
Cold stone

Propping mountains up
On matchsticks
Dragging baskets
Full of bones

Honey please don't stop
Your talking
'Cause there's a feeling
Won't leave me alone

What we gonna do
When the money runs out
I wish that there was something I could say
How we going to find the eyes to see
The bright of day?

If I act a little strange
For I know not what I do
Feels like lightning
Running through my veins
Every time I look at you
Every time I look at you

Help me out here
All my words are falling short
And there's so much I want to say
Want to tell you just how good it feels
When you look at me that way, ah
When you look at me that way

Throw a stone
And watch the ripples flow
Moving out across the bay
Like a stone I fall into your eyes
Deep into that mystery, ah
Deep into some mystery

I got half a mind
To scream out loud
I got half a mind to die
So I will never have to
Lose you girl
Won't ever have to say goodbye
I won't ever have to lie
Won't ever have to say goodbye

Whoa I,

It was a kind of so-so love
And I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen again,
You and I had to be the standing joke of the year,
You were a runaround, a lost and found and not for me, I feel,

Take your hands off me, hey,
I don't belong to you, you see,
And take a look in my face, for the last time,
I never knew you, you never knew me,

We tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt
And me in a suit but it just wasn't me,
You're used to wearing less,
And now your life's a mess, so insecure you see,
I put up with all the scenes,
This is one scene that's goin' to be played my way

Under the deep red light
I can see the make-up slidin' down,
Well, hey little girl you will always make up
So take off that unbecoming frown,
As for me, well, I'll find someone
Who's not goin' cheap in the sales,
A nice little housewife, who'll give me a steady life
And not keep going off the rails,

Take your hands off me, hey,
I don't belong to you, you see,
And take a look in my face, for the last time,
I never knew you, you never knew me,

Two ice cubes melting in a glass of white rum
Head for the places that I've never gone
(I can't get through to myself)
(Just can't get through to myself) 
Eight beggers choking on a slice of red pie
Two rivers freezing in a broken goodbye
No hesitation, just a kick in the eye
(I can't get through to myself)
(Just can't get through to myself) 
And we do a lot of learning everyday 
Or so it seems but the road it keeps turning 
And I'm right back here again
Blue leather jacket and a helium voice
(I can't get through to myself) 
My head is reeling from too much choice
(I can't get through to myself)
I can't get through to myself
Just can't get through to myself...

Cheap hotel furniture

Yeah, but no one just a stranger I did find
I never noticed, hadn't seen it as it grew
The void between us where the flame turns blue

Different places, yeah, but they all look the same
Dreams of faces in the streets devoured by names
I'm in collision with every stone I ever threw
And blind ambition where the flame turns blue

Words dismantled, hey, and all the books unbound
Conversations though we utter not a sound
I heard a rumor, I don't know if it's true
That you'd meet me where the flame turns blue

So I venture underneath the leaden sky
See the freight train with it's one fierce eye
And then I listen as it tears the night in two
With a whistle and the flame turns blue

In the morning I will sing
In the morning I will sing

Through the lemon trees, the diamonds of light
Break in splinters on the pages where I write
That if I lost you I don't know what I'd do
Burn forever where the flame turns blue
That if I lost you I don't know what I'd do

Singing ain't this life so sweet

This years love had better last
This years love had better last

'Cause whose to worry
If our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't you know this life goes on

And won't you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet

This years love had better last

This years love had better last

This years love had better last",This Year's Love
David Gray,"Don't know where you gone
But it seem like a mighty long way now
Don't know where you gone
But it seem like a mighty long time
Since I seen your face
So I dream and I'll dream of that day now
See you coming honey
With that sunny sky

Everywhere I go
Everything that I do and I say now

Cause all I want is you
So I wish and I wish and I pray now
To see you coming honey

That I'm getting nowhere
And time is dragging so slowly
So tired now hunny
So tired of me
O-oh so tired of me

Don't need you say that
You'll stay with me baby forever
Don't need you to tell me
Your heart and your soul are all mine
It's okay with me
You can smile say nothing whatever
I see you smiling honey
I'll be feeling fine

That's when I knew 
All the dreams I held in my heart
Had suddenly come true
Knock me over stone cold sober
Not a thing I could say or do
Cause baby when I'm walking with you now
My eyes are so wide
Like you reached right into my head
And turned on the light inside
Turning on the light
Inside my mind hey

Come on baby it's all right
Sunday, Monday, day or night
Written blue on white it's plain to see
Be mine, be mine
That rainy shiny night or day
What's the difference anyway
Baby till your heart belongs to me

If I had some influence girl
With the powers that be
I'd have them fire that arrow at you
Like they fired it right at me
And maybe when your heart and soul are burning
You might see 
That every time I'm talking with you
It's always over too soon
That everyday feels so incomplete
Till you walk into the room
Say the word now girl
I'll jump that moon hey

Come on baby it's OK
Rainy shiny night or day
There's nothing in the way now
Don't you see
Be mine, be mine
Winter summer day or night
Centigrade or Fahrenheit

Be mine, be mine

How can it be wrong now mercy me

Not a wind that breathes
Just the bullets whispering gentle
'mongst the new green leaves

Only wish I could

Then I'm leaking blood

Don't see no fiery hell

Like an ocean roar
Won't you take my hand darling

David Gray,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide

The dreamer has woken
The spirit has spoken

When the rain comes
Through on your pretty head?
Is it so easy to pretend?

Like vision of [Incomprehensible]
The silent destroyer
They're raising your body

Never heard a single word you said

You don't have to turn the sound up

Baby baby you're the world to me

I woke up, the room was cold
Looking tired, feeling old
Cursin' all the changes I've to say
The more I cursed into the flood
The less it seemed do me good
Clearer became my mind than I could say
Baby baby you're the world to me

My head is roaring like a waterfall
Give me everything or not at all

And carnivals of silverfish

Need to take some heart

Always so much harder
So much harder when you have to try
Could we at least agree upon the size
And the shape
The relative dimensions that the lie
Ought to take
For your delectation a scenario
Taken so much further than it needs to go
Always so much harder
Always so much
If we could get away just for a week or two
Baby let it burn the way it used to do
Always so much harder
So much harder when you have to try

And swallow me

I'm going nowhere 
All the lights are changing green to red 
Turning over TV stations 
Situations running through my head 
Well looking back through time 
You know it's clear that I've been blind 
I've been a fool 
To ever open up my heart 
To all that jealousy, 
that bitterness, 
that ridicule 
Saturday I'm running wild 
And all the lights are changing red to green 
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing 
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream 
Only wish that you were here 
You know I'm seeing it so clear 
I've been afraid 
To tell you how I really feel 
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made 
If you want it 
Come and get it 
Crying out loud 
The love that I was 
Giving you was 
Never in doubt 
Let go your heart 
Let go your head 
And feel it now

Sunday all the lights of London Shining , 
Sky is fading red to blue 
I'm kicking through the 
Autumn leaves 
And wondering where it is you might be going to 
Turning back for home 
You know I'm feeling so alone 
I can't believe 
Climbing on the stair 
I turn around to see you smiling there 
In front of me 
If you want it 
Come and get it

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Whenever you're around me dear my heart just won't stand still
And when it comes to kissing you I'll never get my fill
They said I'd never settle down that I would always roam
That I could never be the type for a loving wife and home

I'd sail all around this old wide world

You caused me to leave my home;
Oh, that lonesome pine and those good old times,
I'm on my way back home.

There's somethin' you can tell 'er;

",Home Is Where the Heart Is
David Grisman,"Many, many years ago when I was twenty-three
I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be.
This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red.
My father fell in love with her and soon they, too, were wed.

 This made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life
For my daughter was my mother, 'cause she was my father's wife.
To complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.

My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle, though it made me very sad
For if he was my uncle, then that also made him brother
To the widow's grown-up daughter, who, of course, was my step-mother.

My father's wife then had a son who kept them on the run
And he became my grand-child, 'cause he was my daughter's son.
My wife is now my mother's mother, and it makes me blue
Because, although she is my wife, she's my grandmother too.

If my wife is my grandmother, then I am her grandchild
And every time I think of it, it nearly drives me wild
For now I have become the strangest case you ever saw
(This has got to be the strangest thing I ever saw)
As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpaw.

but it really is so
Oh, I'm my own grandpaw.",I'm My Own Grandpaw

   On mother's ""gone but not forgotten""

Where they laided them down to rest
I can almost hear them whisper

Where they'll meet there friends and loved ones

David Grisman,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
David Grisman,"Nestled in the heart of the Tennessee Hills
There neat the pines midst the rocks and the rills
There stands my old homestead of long long ago
It brings back sweet memories of the one I loved so
I'll tell you the reason why I left her there
To roam this old world with its sorrow and care
I saw her one night in the arms of a man hugging and kissing as two lovers can
I went to my home with a heart full of woe packed my belongings determined to go
For many long years this old world I did roam
With thoughts of my sweetheart my darling my own
[ fiddle ]
While dining one day in a little country town
A stranger walked in and he chanced to sit down
While talking of loved ones I happened to find
That his sister was that old sweetheart of mine
When he heard my story to me then he said
The one you left there has a long time been dead
She waited so long for the day you'd return
And why you had left her she never did learn
Now I was the one who you saw that fatal night
Wrapped in the arms of my sister so tight
She loved you so dearly but you broke her heart
Stranger from her ever more you must part
",Tragic Romance
David Grisman,"I'm wanting someone that's loved and lost
Someone that's known the thrill and paid the cost
Someone that says they'll never take a chance
Of another broken heart by false romance



    Wanted an unwanted love
    To share all the misery and pain
    Of a heart that's unwanted in love
    And unwilling to gamble again



I don't want to love again I'm sure
Someone who's love is not sincere
I don't want someone that hasn't known
How it feels to love and then be left alone



  * Refrain



I know there are others like me
Alone, foot loose and fancy free
Yet chained to a love they'll never claim
And afraid to ever love again


",Unwanted Love
David Grisman,"I wandered today to the hill, Maggie
To watch the scene below
The creek and the rusty old mill, Maggie
Where we sat in the long, long ago.
The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie
Where first the daisies sprung
The old rusty mill is still, Maggie
Since you and I were young.

A city so silent and lone, Maggie
Where the young and the gay and the best
In polished white mansion of stone, Maggie
Have each found a place of rest
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie
And join in the songs that were sung
For we sang just as gay as they, Maggie
When you and I were young.

They say I am feeble with age, Maggie
My steps are less sprightly than then
My face is a well written page, Maggie
But time alone was the pen.
They say we are aged and grey, Maggie
As spray by the white breakers flung
But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie
When you and I were young.

And now we are aged and grey, Maggie
The trials of life nearly done
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie
When you and I were young.

David Grover,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

It's alright and it's OK

You know, sometimes you go through such trouble

You think that nobody nobody cares
It's gonna be alright and it's gonna be OK honey
Because the universe, yes, well, let's go do what too much
You know that you can feel good about yourself 
'cause nobody else is gonna do it for you
So you got to make up in your mind that you are gonna get there

And do what you got to do
Make, what you want to happen, happen
And that's all I'm saying
There is a winner in you
There is a greatness in you
There is somebody in you 
That wants to come out and let you know that you are somebody

You know what?
You are gonna go higher 
And you are gonna go higher 
And you are gonna go higher
And it's alright you know
There is somebody in you 
That wants to come out and let you know that you are somebody

No man can take it away from you because
That's your gift that was given from god
So you know what? It's gonna be OK

Won't take advice that you give
I've got my own life to live
I'll make it right through the rain
And be the winner of the game

One life to be
Winners of the, winners of the

You pushed to be what you see
On magazines and tv
Is it as hard as it seems
If you just follow your dreams
Is it truth or a lie
To work in safe till you die
Or this too, all insane
And be winners of the game

Winners of the game
One fight for glory
One life one destiny
Winner of the game
We've got one story
We all can be
Winners of the game

One life one destiny

David Guetta,"After tonight, there'll be no coming home soon
No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume
No more dancing feet, to the beats that go boom
While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room

Tonight there'll be no pouring rain
No eyes wide shut to your never ending game
After tonight there'll be no me and you
No distant memories past for me to hold on to

See everybody's working to hold on to what they know
So I guess I kept believe in my tonight will never go
Some spend a lifetime searchin' trying to figure out
When hell stops and heaven begins

How soon is now?",How Soon Is Now
David Guetta,"I've been fragile for a long time
A big old hole inside my heart
And I was searching through the valley
Stumbled on love in the dark

Was afraid to try but afraid to never know
What it feels like to be loved
Had a hill to climb
But the places we could go
Oh, I gotta know

So if we ever, fell in love
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh
So if we ever, fell in love
Oh, oh, oh

I was empty, it was all gone
The birds would sing but made no sound
Till I met you, found I was all wrong
You picked me up right off the ground

Was afraid to try, and afraid I'd fall again
Crashing down from the sky, you know
Had a hill to climb, but with you my heart wont mend
That's the one thing, we all wanna know

So if we ever, fell in love
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh
So if we ever fell in love

Like footsteps in the dark
The pain stirs in your voice
Cuts like daggers to my heart

Don't you be afraid
Baby I'm here
Stop running from love
Baby don't you fear

Cause it's louder
So much louder than words
Baby it's louder
So much louder than words

Cause it's louder
So much louder than words
Baby it's louder
So much louder than words

Play the simple game
With all your broken rules
I'm calling out your name
But my heart just still refuses

Don't you be afraid
Baby I'm here
Stop running from love
Baby don't you fear

Cause it's louder
So much louder than words
Baby it's louder
So much louder than words

Cause it's louder
So much louder than words
Baby it's louder

Look at her dancing, just take it off
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again

David Guetta,"I was walking, was living
My melody was acapella
There's a beat I was missing
No tune, or a scale, I could play

The sound in the distance
No orchestra playing together
Like a boat out to sea,
The silence was too deafening

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing

Everything was the same
One color was just like the others
An assembly routine
My memories were all black and white
Till I stopped over thinking
Decided to draw back the curtains
And I cleared all the cobwebs
And began to let in the light

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing

You are the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

You are the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

You are the drum in my heart beat
Bass and guitar lead
Stuck on the notes you play
My heart that you play on
Red like a crayon
I can't walk away

My whole life was acapella

David Guidice,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
David Guidice,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller

Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,

David Gurland,"She said we're much too different
We're from two separate worlds
And he admitted she was partly right
But in his heart's defense he told her
What they had in common
Was strong enough to bond them for life
He said look behind your own soul
And the person that you'll see
Just might remind you of me

I laugh, I love, I hope, I try
I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry
And I know you do the same things, too
So we're really not that different, me and you

She could hardly argue
With his pure and simple logic
But logic never could convince a heart
She had always dreamed of loving someone more exotic
And he just didn't seem to fit the part
So she searched for greener pastures
But never could forget
What he whispered when she left

I laugh, I love, I hope, I try
I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry
And I know you do the same things, too
So we're really not that different, me and you

Was it time or was it truth
Maybe both lead her back to his door
As her tears fell at his feet
She didn't say ""I love you""
What she said meant even more

I laugh, I love, I hope, I try
I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry
And I know you do the same things, too
So we're really not that different, me and you",Not That Different
David Haas,"All that I am sings of the God who brings new life to birth in me
My spirit soars on the wings of my Lord

1. My soul gives glory to the Lord, rejoicing in my saving God
who looks upon me in my state, and all the world will call me blessed
For God works marvels in my sight, and holy, holy is God's name

2. God's mercy is from age to age, on those who follow in fear
Whose arm is power and strength, and scatters all the proud of heart
Who casts the mighty from their thrones and raises up the lowly ones

3. God fills the starving with good things, the rich are left with empty hands
Protecting all the faithful ones, remembering Israel with mercy
the promise known to those before and to their children for ever",Magnificat
David Hahn,"I'm through with love
I'll never fall again
Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you or no one
That's why I'm through with love

I've locked my heart
I keep my feelings there
I have stocked my heart
Like an icy Frigadere
For I need to care for no one
That's why I'm through with love

Why did you lead me
To think that you cared
You didn't need me
For you have your share
Of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion

I'll take a stand. I'll be a man of steel.

In my life for one man to stand

I will overcome my fears, and I'll be a strong as I appear.
I'll be a man of steel. I am really REALLY real.



",Man of Steel
David Hallyday,"Avant il y a longtemps
Je croyais pouvoir bruler le temps
Voyager dans le moment présent
Sans me souvenir

Pourtant dans ma mémoire
Je dévore le livre de mon histoire
Qui m'enchaîne et me permet de voir
Dans mon avenir

Le temps ne veut rien savoir
Il donne l'espoir et puis il le détruit, le temps
N'efface jamais
Le manque à donner
À recevoir l'amour

Je vois dans la douleur
Le poison s'étaler sur mon cœur
Des regrets qui survivent au erreurs
Coulent dans les larmes

J'entends dans mon naufrage
Un silence dont j'ai oublié l'âge
Je ne sais pas traduire son message
Ni même son nom

Le temps n'efface plus rien
Pas un seule chagrin ne lui resisterait autant
On n'oublie jamais
Le manque à donner

À recevoir tellement d'amour
Tellement d'amour
Le temps s'en fout de nous, de nous
Comme toujours

Adieu , je ne suis pas
Prés à renoncer à d'autres vies
Même si ce que j'aime n'existe pas
Dans ce monde en ruine

Le temps se fout de moi
Il nous tient et il nous sépare
On nous dit non, il n'existe pas
Tout est comme avant tu penses

Le temps n'oublie rien
Les plus beaux chagrins
Infantiles ou bien dérisoires
Le temps n'oublie pas
Les heures et l'endroit dans les ténébres

Le temps se fout bien de nous
Nous fait croire en tout
Pour se donner encore le temps
N'efface jamais
Le manque à donner
À recevoir l'amour

",Le Manque a Donner
David Hallyday,"S'éviter les premiers signes d'usure
C'est mieux comme ça
Les reproches qu'on s' jette à la figure
Et qu'on ne pesne pas

Ne pas vouloir qu'l'amour se fissure
C'est mieux comme ça
Et faire l'impossible pour que ça dure
Ça changerait quoi

On s'en va, on s'en va
Chacun pour nous
On s'en va , on s'en va
L'autre pour soi

Ne pas succomber aux bleus, aux blessures
C'est mieux comme ça
Enfermer son cœur dans une armure
Ça ressemble à quoi

Trouver des faux-semblants qui rassurent
On vaut mieux qu'ça
Laissons nous une histoire sans rature
Entre toi et moi

On s'en va, on s'en va
Chacun pour nous
On s'en va , on s'en va
L'autre pour soi

S'eviter des mensonges, les parjures
C'est mieux comme ça
Lorsqu'on ne devient plus qu'une aventure
C'est déjà trop tard

Partir quand on s'aime encore, bien sur
Ça n'se fait pas
Mais souhaitons cette déchirure
Plus belle
Plus belle comme ça

On s'en va, on s'en va
Chacun pour nous
On s'en va , on s'en va

",On S'En Va
David Hallyday,"Demain ou après
On ne sera plus là
Pour faire ce qu'il faut faire
Ou n'pas faire

Il sera trop tard
Pour revenir en arrière
C'est maintenant qu'on fait la terre
De nos enfants

Qu'est ce qu'on laisse derrière nous

Si c'est un monde en poussière
Un paradis, un enfer
Qu'on laisse, qu'on délaisse

Une mer, sans dauphin
Des fôrets sans arbres
Un ciel où ne vole rien
Qu'des vautours

Est-ce qu'on dort tranquille
A ne plus rêver d'amour
Peut on vivre
Sans voir plus loin
C'que s'ra demain

Qu'est ce qu'on laisse derrière nous
Si c'est un monde en colère
Un paradis, un enfer
Qu'on laisse

Qu'est ce qu'on fait de nous
De nos mains, de nos prières
Un oasis, un désert
Qu'on laisse, qu'on délaisse

Car demain ou après
On ne sera plus là
Pour revenir en arière
Il sera trop tard

",Un Paradis un Enfer
David Hallyday,"Un petit peu de toi
Pour échapper
A la solitude

Quand tu n'es pas là
Un peu de toi

Un peu de toi pour réchauffer

Un peu de toi pour retrouver
Un peu de tes nuits dans mon sommeil

Un peu de ta voix
Pour me guider
Quand je ne vois plus

Un petit peu de toi
Qui m'attendra

Les fantômes d'autrefois qui tournent autour de toi
Les fantômes d'autrefois qui tournent autour de toi

Pour toi, toi que j'ai dans les veines
Pour toi, qui est partout en moi
Pour toi, pour que tu te souviennes

J'ai arraché un bout de rêve
Qui dépassait un peu de toi

Je l'ai attaché à moi en souvenir de toi
Je l'ai attaché à moi en souvenir de toi

Pour toi, toi que j'ai dans les veines
Pour toi, qui est partout en moi
Pour toi, pour que tu te souviennes

J'ai ramassé dans tes rêves
Un petit mot juste pour moi
J'ai volé dans ton sommeil
Quand tu murmures tout bas
Reste auprès de moi

Pour toi, qui est partout en moi
Pour toi, pour que tu te souviennes

La vie derrière les barreaux
La liberté qu""on arrache
Est le pire des maux

C'est vrai, je t'avais promis
Des rêves plus qu'il n'en faut
Il n'y a rien que je nie
Même si j'ai tout faux

A regarder le soleil
J'ai pas vu que tu n'étais plus là
Il ne me reste que le ciel
Pour rêver, pour rêver de toi

On se montre souvent lâche
Pour ne pas tomber de haut
Les sentiments que l'on cache
En dise souvent trop

Saches que tout ce que j'ai dit
C'était pas seulement des mots
Mais les prières et les cris
Restent sans échos

A regarder le soleil
J'ai pas vu que tu n'étais plus là
Il me reste le ciel
Pour rêver, pour rêver de toi

La nuit, le jour, c'est pareil
Je ne vois plus rien, plus rien sans toi
Quand, je cherchais l'essentiel
J'ai oublié que tu étais là

You look my way, That I love you,
It's clear you trust each word I say. Let me say one time, maybe two,
When life is long and problems come, That I love the way that you love 
me,
You'll always be my only one. And I wish I knew more of you.
So now we're standing face to face, Let me say once more that I love you,
And with one look your eyes embrace me. Let me say one time, maybe two,
Squeeze away each haunting fear, That I love the way that you love me,

David Hamilton,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

David Hamilton,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?
And so, all else above,
I'm waiting for the man I love.",The Man I Love
David Hamilton,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

David Hamilton,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee,

You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite,

He was staring at his coffee cup,
Trying to get his courage up.
The talk was small when they talked at all,
They both knew what they wanted,
There was no need to talk about it,
They were old enough to talk it out, and still keep it loose.

Fill every room with the harmony
Seeing the world trough each other's eyes

And every burden has been lifted

And, I was looking round at all the usual sights
Suddenly there right in front of my eyes
I saw this girl and I sighed je t'aime

Felt my passion rising as I watched her go by
I speak a little francais so I gave it a try
I was confused - she'd put my mind in a haze
Then I remembered a phrase - je t'aime

Stay with me - mon chérie
Maybe then
You'll say je t'aime
Stay with me - please say oui
To a rendez-vous
Je t'aime - means I love you

Parlez-vous anglais didn't bring no success
And she won't say her name or even write her address
Don't wanna lose her in the champs elysées
Only one thing I can say - je t'aime

Mademoiselle has got to me like no-one before
And I just wanna love her
And then love her some more
Wish that I'd learnt - my lessons better at school
I'm standing here like a fool - je t'aime

Needed a place to hide

Break through this sheltered heart

Oh won't you tear down the walls
I've built all around me
I wanna learn to win
I think I could love again
Break down these walls
Break down this sheltered heart

My distance safe
Behind this guarded wall
Concealing my feelings
Till I couldn't feel at all

I closed and locked the door

I need her, I want her; I just can't take it

But I can't get her out of my head
Yes I keep on sayin'

She's yesterday's dreams
I know tomorrow will come
But I'm somewhere lost in between
She's yesterday's love
She's yesterday's dreams
I know tomorrow will come
And she'll live her life without me

She said she was mine
To have and to hold
Forever till death do us part
I gave her my love
She carried my name
But I couldn't carry her heart

So I'll just be holding my pillow tonight
Trying to stay warm in this bed
And I'll keep on telling myself that she's gone
But I can't get her out of my head
Yes I'll keep on saying

Reminding me of what I once was living for
Though now that she's gone I'll try to go on
With whatever's left of me
A handful of hopes and a heartful of memories

You're all I ever think of
Since you left me crying
In the pouring chicago rain

I swear by the stars up above
I'll still go on trying
To stop living in yesterday

I did what I did but she only did her best
And I'll never know why I let her go

I loved you then and I always will.
 
How time has its way with things,
And all the changes it brings, baby.

There will always be a part of me for you.
If I could find the reason why.
If I could only say goodbye.

Thought the sorrow would never end.
Then the tears came, and all the joy
Was out of my life.
Felt the heartbreak would never mend.
 
Seems times like a stormy sea.
Look what it's done to you and me, baby.

There will always be a part of me for you.

Will you always be a part of me?
How can real love ever end?

And you wonder why.
When the rain comes down, I'll be there,
I'll be there through it all...

Sinking like a stone in a well.
My luck was out of time.
I needed you to break the spell.

some twenty years ago
I was born a rich man's son
I had everything that money could buy,
but freedom I had none

I've been looking for freedom
I've been looking so long
I've been looking for freedom
Still the search goes on
I've been looking for freedom
since I left my home town
I've been looking for freedom
Still it can't be found

I headed down the track
my baggage on my back
I left the city far behind
Walking down that road
with my heavy load
trying to find some ease of mind

Father said: ""You'll be sorry, son,
if you leave your home this way
And when you realize
the freedom money buys
You'll come running home someday""

I've been looking for freedom
I've been looking so long
I've been looking for freedom

I've been looking for freedom
Since I left my home town
I've been looking for freedom
Still it can't be found

I made a lot of dues
had plenty to lose
travelling across the land
Worked on a farm,
got some muscle in my arms
but still I'm not a self-made man
I feel the run for many years to come
I'll be searching door to door
And given some time
some day I'm gonna find
the freedom (freedom, freedom) I've been searching for

I've been looking for freedom
I've been looking so long

Looking like a silver angel
Till I got a closer view
Baby till I moved on to the wilder side of you

When I felt your body wrapped in mine
It was like a great big bolt of lightning
Burning up and down my spine
You've got such a wild imagination
You made all my fantasies come true
Baby I just never knew the wilder side of you

When we're in a crowd of strangers
People think you're soft and shy
When they see the way I'm smilin'
Baby they must wonder why
They don't know you drive me crazy
How you thrill me through and through
Baby when I push on to the wilder side of you

No one has your beauty and your freedom
Now you've got me cravin' wantin' more and more
Baby I can feel myself exploding
Everytime we close the door
Don't know where you got this magic power
How you do the special things you do
Baby I just never knew the wilder side of you

You're my private party
You're my one woman show
No one's more exciting baby
When you let it go

Can't remember so much satisfaction
Can't remember when I felt so free
All we have to do is touch and baby
I become a wilder me
You know how to keep my passion flowing
You know how to start me up on cue

No more looking over your shoulder
For someone to appear
Maybe you should be looking right
Into these eyes

All the things you search the world to find
But know nothing of

Through the fire and rain
Know there's one who won't
Desert you again
If you believe in love

No one seems to care
But I've found somewhere within this
Heart a friend for life
To hold me close
Till all my fears subside

Do you believe in love and
All the things you search the world to find

We've got the power, we've got the lord
Everybody hands up, what a feeling
To sing for freedom around the world

It's an illusion that I'm dreaming
Only wishing of what could be
But we can make it really happen
Share my vision, sing with me
Catch a rainbow, and let your love flow
Dream on and on
Let's love each other like sister

Fallin' in love again
Baby baby fallin' in love
Fallin' in love again
I could never see
What fate had planned for me
And then you came and made my dream
This man's reality
Maybe you can see
All the things you meant to me
But my simple fate is at the gate
And girl you've got the key
Baby baby fallin' in love
Fallin' in love again

It seems like yesterday
You and i first felt this way
But now i know our love can grow
In each and every day
We lay at midnight's hour
And feel love's hidden power
So strong and bold
As love unfolds
It's mystery to me

David Hasselhoff,"Daddy, why do children cry?
Can`t you make it better?
 
Take a look around the world
See the tears in children`s eyes
Make it better and give them all your love.
 
I see no reason for hunger and pain
Be aware we`re all the same
Let`s come together for a better life - right now.
 
Now it`s time to make changes
That millions are hoping for
There`s a way if we all lend our hands
To the lost and poor.
 
Save the world, save our lives
Stop the fear in children`s eyes
Give your love, heal the need
Save the dreams for you and me.
 
There`s a light to guide the way
If you try to save the world
Make a choice help them with lovin` care.
 
Now it`s time that we have to do
Something to change the world
Stop pretending and let love lights shine -
For peace on earth.
 
Save the world, save our lives
Stop the fear in children`s eyes
Give your love, heal the need
Save the dreams for you and me.

Comes the queen of rain

When you were near me I felt so secure
But the day when the summer faded away
Our love was gone
 
Was it more than a love affair
Was it more than a summer we shared
I'm searching for a helping hand and I pray
For the queen of rain
 
When the summer fades to autumn
Comes the queen of rain
When a love will fade forever
Comes the queen of rain
 
If no one helps to pull you through
The queen of rain will follow you
When a broken heart is crying
Comes the queen of rain

So many nights we spent together
So many days we enjoyed the weather
So many times you had been so close to me
Now I feel so lonely

Cause you're the star of my fairy, tale

Just you and me
And the hazy moonlight
All the palm trees were swaying
To our sweet melody

Santa monica nights
Don't you know that we will always share

Whenever I feel tired and blue
I close my eyes
And start dreaming about you
In my mind I'm replaying
Such a sweet memory

Just remembering that we once shared
Santa monica nights
Don't you know that we will always share

I can't be me

What a sweet sensation

Were only passing through

I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on blue bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes
Workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on blue bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may on blue bayou
Where you sleep all day
And the catfish play on blue bayou

All those fishin' boats, with their sails a float
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
(Baby)
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy again on blue bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may on blue bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world's mine on blue bayou

Oh, that girl of mine, by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

I'll never be blue
My dreams come true

David Hasselhoff,"Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty five sacks of mail

Their out on the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' towns that have no names
Freightyards full of old grey men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Singing good morning America, how are you?
Don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' card with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't't no one keepin score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin Â'neath the floor

And the sons of the pullman porters
And the sons of the engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel

And the days are full of restless
And the dreams are full of memories
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Singing good morning America, how are you?
Don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles before the day is done

Well, its twilight on the city of New Orleans
Talk about your pocketful of friends
Half way home and we'll be there by mornin'
No tomorrow waitin' round the bend

Singing good morning America, how are you?
Don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles before the day is done

Singing good night America, how are you?
Don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles before the day is done

Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowin' like a breeze

Country roads...take me home
To the place...I belong

Take me home...country roads

All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads...take me home
To the place...I belong

Take me home...country roads

I hear a voice in the morning how she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling that I shoulda been home yesterday

Are in rhyme

And make some sense at last

Scheming and screaming
Become one 

This is the day
See it sparkle and shine 
When all I've lived for
Becomes mine 
For all these years,
I've faced the world alone,
And now the time has come
To prove to them
I've made it on my own 

This is the moment
My final test
Destiny beckoned,
I never reckoned
Second best 

I won't look down
I must not fall

The sweetest moment of them all

Damn all the odds

Singing the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game

And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where they lights are shinin' on me

Like a Rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a Rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when your riding the train
That's takin' the long way

And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where they lights are shinin' on me

And folks dressed like Eskimos.

Help to make the season bright.

Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way,
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh,
And every mother's child is gonna spy,
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase,
To kids from one to ninety two.

She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

David Holmes,"I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home
Conceding defeat with a low moan

Hangin' in a sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone

I bought him coffee and a snack
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach will burst
Feel like I've been cursed
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock

You got eternity for takin' stock
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys

Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part

That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal Hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest
From just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to Hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges
At the thought of syringes

J, I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest

You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near human pitch

Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears
To find the key to this cage
And write another stage into a new age
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on gone",Gritty Shaker

Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.

Then she came and sat down at my table
As she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you,
Take me away from here and be my man.""

David Houston,"Now love is comin' through the window comin' in the door
And I can feel it creepin' through the cracks in the floor
Bouncin' off the walls and the ceiling up above
Since I found you I'm livin' in a house of love

All of my life my heart's been walked on
Women said to love me and my how they talked on
Tellin' me lies and fillin' my eyes with tears that I couldn't control
I couldn't get a hold to myself long enough to realize
They were only tryin' to pull a wool over my eyes
Then I found you and the skies turned blue
And I'm livin' in a house of love

Now love is comin' through the window,
Comin' in the door
And I can feel it creepin' through the cracks in the floor
Bouncin' off the walls and the ceiling up above
Since I found you I'm livin' in a house of love

Once I lived in a hole like a rabbit I couldn't find a love and the blues were a habit
A lonely man I couldn't understand why everything I tried went wrong
Then you came along bless your heart and showed me the right way
Dried my eyes and turned my night to day
Since I found you my skies turned blue
I'm livin' in a house full of love
Now love is comin' through the window

David Houston,"There's a place you can go when you're lonely
And the world turns its back on you
So if you've got a heart at last on apart
Someone's there to tell your troubles to

To a man on the street it's a barroom to a wife
A place where cheaters go
To a girl with green eyes it's a place to hear sweet lies
And the only home a fool would even know
It's a loser's cathedral a chapel for tears
A loser's cathedral and you're always welcome there

Many times I've heard temptation calling
With a voice that whispers soft and low
But I never get that fool and I owe it all to you

One of the wonders that keeps me from losin' my mind

If you walked in right now, you'd think, I owned the world

But when the warm red wine is gone and I remember you
It's all that I can do to fake a smile

I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

I may go out to Alberta weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I could go to workin' for
Still I wish you'd change your mind if I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

David Houston,"It's knowin' you don't try to buy my freedom
With some promise made of gold
That for you my door stays open
And our love becomes a simple two-way street

And it's knowin' we're not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you on the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on some column now that binds us
Or somethin' that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world
Will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I drift in through the market place and find
That you're movin' on the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
For hours you're just gentle on my mind

Oh the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and you were gone

I still might walk for hours
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see

You movin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

The shutters creak and Autumn winds
That make me draw inside myself in silence
Cross-legged now I sit and watch
The endless chase of leaves across my garden

And layin' down my hairbrush
I lean backward in my window seat and find
That you're movin' on the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind
",Gentle on My Mind
David Houston,"See the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day
That she planted it was just a twig

Then the first snow came and she ran out
To brush the snow away, so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself and I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so

I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from working late
'Cause I would know that she'd been sittin' there
And crying over some sad and silly late late show

And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be guess
You could say she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and found her crying
Needlessly in the middle of the day

And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom
And robins sing she went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day while I was not at home
And she was there and all alone the angels came

Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived
And honey played and love grew up

A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed where honey loved
See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day
That she planted it was just a twig

I spoke to her that I don't think she understood
So just forget about the plans that you were making heart we did all that we could

They used all the tender words that they should
And if you break and fall apart I couldn't blame you heart we did all that we could

When we walk in the room they stop talking

Let them think what they're like you and I both know we're right
They'd give the world if they had what we got
We got love and that's all that matters and it gets a little stronger day by day
There's a ring on your hand you're my girl and I'm your man
You got me I got you we got love

They're just jealous because they know we're happy
And I guess that it does show on my face

So move a little farther along find somebody who is too weak to be strong
Check faces down the line stop looking at mine move a little farther along

Just because I've been by here a few times and stopped

I was sittin' alone in a bar yesterday
Just passin' the time when I heard a sweet voice say
How's about one far the road you and I
Then I turned and saw an angel with smokey blue eyes
We talked of the weather and things that we'd done
We've laughed at each heartache like two kids a having fun
I was in heaven I won't try to deny
When I danced with an angel with smokey blue eyes (smokey blue eyes)
The jukebox was playing when I heard my heart sing
For on her third finger I placed my class ring
Well I'm not pretending oh I'll love her till I die
As I turned and kissed the angel with smokey blue eyes
Smokey blue eyes smokey blue eyes I fell so in love with smokey blue eyes

David Houston,"I was just a lonely boy stickin' close to home
Content to be there with my folks without a thought to roam
But late one night a change of my mind turned to left down low
This was the time I had to find where that gravel road did go
I got into a city about the break of day

All worn out from a long long walk I stopped at a small cafe
They served me coffee black and strong they were servin' liquor too
And I saw this girl with honey hair and eyes of visual blue
My heart jumped right into my throat I thought that it would fail
Too green to see the invisible sign wild honey keep for sale
I walked right in sat right down and soon my plans were made
A lonely boy too starved for love too dumb to be afraid
Her every wish was my command it only took a smile

And I spent my hard earned money like it was goin' out of style
Now there's no money in my jeans and you find to to be her man
I have to the things she ask with the pocketful in my hand
I'll take my heart back to the farm with mem'ries quite a few

I'll tell her that I love her like I've done so much before
And she'd better listen well cause I won't say it anymore

I'd give the world to keep her I've done all a man can do
But I'm down to my last I love you

Tonight I know I'll find her way downtown with those same old party friends around
One last time I'll tell her she means the world to me

David Houston,"I found a place that you won't believe a place
Where your memories fade away
And I'm here with a friend that's so good to me
So good, I can't remember yesterday

But it's just one of the wonders of the wine
One of the wonders that keeps me from losin' my mind

If you walked in right now, you'd think, I owned the world
'Cause the women come around just to watch my style
But when the warm red wine is gone and I remember you
It's all that I can do to fake a smile

But it's just one of the wonders of the wine
One of the wonders that keeps me from losin' my mind

But as long as I stay here, every thing's gonna be fine
And it's one of the wonders of the wine",Wonders of the Wine

David Ippolito,"Here we are
Alive and free
Far away in time from our darkest day
That took our young and brave

From the cradle to the grave
70 years ago on July one 1916 on the Somme
The enemies had never seen fighting like this before
Such a simple plan--

How could any German man
Survive through that ordeal?
Company 'A' to Company 'be	'
""Morale is high here, sir, but I don't think it's safe to go""

Company 'A' from Company 'be	'
""Mister you have your orders and you must obey""
So the first line rose, and the first line fell
And a poet who survived later wrote about

A ""Sunlit vision of Hell""
And ""Larks singing""
Because after all it's just another summer's day in France
And the Tommie's on the Somme sang

""We are fighting to turn no-man's land into a common ground""
A common ground",Common Ground
David J,"Her fatal charm is a beautiful knife
How tempting to caress the blade
Your fingers touch its cutting edge
The first incision is then made

The cruel and unusual punishment
Of her dismissive smile
In her cruelty, her beauty, her indifference
Her gift to beguil

She pulls a poisoned arrow
From her quiver of disdain
She feels no shame as she takes aim
A butterfly pinned to showcase cork
It's just a game
Only a game

She strikes her matchless Garbo
She beckons as she double locks the door
Her sign says ""closed"" on both sides

But all the lonely boys come back for more

She gives the brush off to invisible dust
Fastidious to a fault, shows dirt the door
She is untouchable within her guilded cage
Alone but for cuttle fish to claw

Laiden with gifts
Her suitors fall in line
To suffer the inevitable ""No""
With each rejection and the passing of time
These infatuations grow

The cruel and unusual punishment of her dismissive
Smile
In her crueltv, her beauty, her indifference
Her gift to beguil",The First Incision
David J,"Justine Justine
Phantom of the trail
I cast you as the love interest
An unwitting portrayal
If fate decrees reunion
Then how, where and when
A part of me was lost to you
For me to find again

I'm riding on the back of luck
Luck's an empty shirt
Lost my ring in a handshake
Those sharks know how to hurt
I hit the bottle
The bottle hit back hard

Always longed for fleeting beauty often seen

You are omnipresent

David J,"They say that there's a broken light for every heart on
Broadway.
They say that life's a game, then they take the board
away.
They give you masks and costumes and an outline of the
story
Then leave you all to improvise their vicious
cabaret...

In no-longer-pretty cities there are fingers in
kitties.
There are warrants, forms, and chitties and a jackboot
on the stair.
Sex and death and human grime, in monochrome for one
thin dime,
But at least the trains all run on time but they don't
go anywhere.
Facing their Responsibilities either on their backs or
on their knees
There are ladies who just simply freeze and dare not
turn away
And the widows that refuse to cry will be dressed in
garter and bow-tie
And be taught to kick their legs up high in this
vicious cabaret.

At last! The 1998 Show!
The ballet on the burning stage.
The documentary see
Upon the fractured screen
The dreadful poem scrwled upon the crumpled page...

There's a policeman with an honest soul that has seen
whose head is on the pole
And he grunts and fills his briar bowl with a feeling
of unease.
But he briskly frisks the torn remains for a
fingerprint or crimson stains
And endevours to ignore the chins that he walks in to
his knees.
while his master in the dark nearby inspects the hands,
with a brutal eye,
That have never brushed a lover's thigh but have

squeezed a nation's throat.
But he hungers in his secret dreams for the harsh
embrace of cruel machines
But his lover is not what she seems and she will not
leave a note.

At last! The 1998 Show!
The Situation Tragedy
Grand Opera slick with soap
Cliffhangers with no hope
The water-colour in the flooded gallery...

There's a girl who'll push but not shove and is
desperate for her father's love
She believes the hand beneath the glove maybe one she
needs to hold.
Though she doubts her hosts moralities she decides she
is more at ease
In the Land Of Doing What You Please than outside in
the cold.
But the backdrop's peel and the sets give way and the
cast gets eaten by the play
There's a murderer at the Matinee, there are dead men
in the aisles
And the patrons and actors too are uncertain if the
show is through
And with side-long looks await their cue but the frozen
mask just smiles.

At last! The 1998 Show!
The torch-song no one ever sings
The curfew chorus line
The comedy divine
The bulging eyes of puppets strangled by their strings

There's thrills and chills and girls galore, sing-songs
and surprises
There's something hear for everyone, (reserve your seat
today)
There's mischief and malarkies but no queers or yids or
darkies
Within this bastard's carnival, this vicious cabaret.",This Vicious Cabaret

David Jalbert,"Ma mère disait souvent si tu penses qu’à mourir
C’est que t’as jamais dû souffrir 
T’apprécie drôlement la vie 
Quand tu te bats pour survivre
Ma mère disait que le temps 
Ça vient ça passe comme un coup de vent
Dans le meilleur comme dans le pire 
La vie est trop courte pour s’haïr

Ma mère disait que les enfants 
Meurent après les parents parfois ça se passe autrement 
On part jamais avant son temps 
Et puis jamais au bon moment
Que l’avenir est au lève-tôt 
Quelque part entre dormir et dormir trop
Qu’il y’a un ciel pour les Dieux
Et un ciel pour les yeux

Ah maman maman maman les gens
Me pleurent déjà depuis  longtemps 
Toute ma vie ah toute ma vie 
Je me suis senti différent

Ma mère disait garçon l’argent
Fera jamais ton bonheur
Bien sûr ça n’en prend assez pour se remplir la panse 
Mais la panse ne remplit pas le cœur
On nourrit son âme à travers la glace 
Mais maman quand je m’ regarde en face
Je cherche et j’ vois rien
J’suis vide en dedans et j’ai l’âme qui crève de faim

Ah maman maman maman les gens
Me pleurent déjà depuis longtemps 
Toute ma vie ah toute ma vie 
Je me suis senti différent
Toute ma vie différent

David Jalbert,"On aimerait naître sex-symbol performer sur les bancs d’école
J’envie l’époque du rock n’ roll  j’aurais voulu un petit rôle un peu drôle 
J’voudrais avoir tout plein de cheveux arrêter de me sentir trop vieux 
Porter des chandails serrés les enlever pour me baigner en été en été en été

Gagner le gros lot à la loterie payer la traite à mes amis
Travailler un peu moins souvent mais la santé sera suffisant pour l’instant 
Dire tout haut ce que je pense tout bas rester coucher quand ça va pas 
Avoir l’argent pour prendre le temps avoir le temps de faire de l’argent évidemment… 

Y’a tellement de choses que je voudrais 
Mais quand je songe à tout ce que j’ai 
J’regarde autour soudain je pense 
Au fond j’ai peut être la chance
La chance d’être né du bon côté
La chance d’être né du bon côté

J’aurais voulu un plus beau corps  ou à  limite un plus gros…char	
Peut être une Porsche une Cadillac en vérité j’me fou de la marque j’me fou des marques
J’rêve de richesse et  d’abondance  j’veux  la jeunesse et l’expérience 
Une carte de mode de la tête au pied  des belles dents blanches  un teint bronzé pour emporter

Y’a tellement de choses que je voudrais 
Mais quand je songe à tout ce que j’ai

David Johansen,"Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all of your hope is gone,
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion,
And your world around is crumblin' down;  
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach on out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you.
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through.
I'll be there to always see you through.
 
When you feel lost and about to give up 
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold, 
And you're drifting out all on your own, 
And you need a hand to hold:
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you, 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you.
I'll be there to love and comfort you.
 
I can tell the way you hang your head,
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me)

And I'll be there, you can always depend on me.",Reach Out (I'll Be There)
David Johansen,"There's been a lot of talk around
That you've been seen with a certain party
And now I'm so afraid I'm losing you
Oh, baby don't tell me you don't want my love
I couldn't give it to just anybody
Baby won't you say it isn't true

Don't leave me baby
Don't tell me it's over
After I trusted you
And did my best to make you happy
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby
There was a night when you held me tight
And you said you'd always love me
You said you'd never hurt me

What will there be left for me
It's such a cruel world to be alone in
I always needed you to look out for me
Oh baby, I'm gonna miss your lovin' arms
They're the only arms I feel at home in
Don't you know how lonely I'm gonna be

Don't leave me baby
Don't tell me it's over
After I trusted you
And did my best to make you happy

And you said you'd always love me
You said you'd never hurt me",Is This What I Get for Loving You?
David Jordan,"You may be beautiful
We've had a magical time together
Exploring each other's sexual needs
We get along so well
But I think you should know
That I might not be in love with you

When we're together
I love those nights
But when we are apart
I feel the emptiness

But there are times
When I look in your eyes
And I see that I am losing
The whole of my life

Oh, if I'm in love, I'll let you know
If you're the one I'm thinking of
And if you're not the one
Then I'm moving on
'Cause it's not worth hanging on

Ohh, you're insatiable, girl
You know how to pull my strings
You without me is a match
That we can never seem to bring
Ourselves to talk about us I really think
That if could be in love with you

When we see each other it feels so right
But right from the start
You steal my emptiness
But in the heat of the night
When it all feels alright
I'm left thinking what am I doing

Oh, if I'm in love, I'll let you know
If you're the one I'm thinking of
And if you're not the one
Then I'm moving on
'Cause it's worth hanging on

Please, understand
I don't mean to hurt you
But I've gotta grab a hold of my life
And I feel that in my heart
That we're better off apart
I'm left thinking what am I doing

Please, understand
I don't mean to hurt you
But I've gotta grab a hold of my life
And I feel that in my heart
That we're better off apart
I'm left thinking what am I doing

Please, understand
I don't mean to hurt you
But I've gotta grab a hold of my life
And I feel that in my heart
That we're better off apart
I'm left thinking what am I doing

Oh, if I'm in love, I'll let you know
If you're the one I'm thinking of
And if you're not the one
Then I'm moving on
'Cause it's worth hanging on

I'll let you know if I'm thinking about you

",If I'm in Love
David Jordan,"I'm sick of what I'm hearing
I'm sick of that whole sound
I'm sick of that whole vibe that I feel when you come around
I don't like confrontations
They really drag me down
I don't like hiding my feelings cause my head it starts to pound

I'm having trouble fighting demons that surround me
Regain my self control, head back to what I know
Dragging me down I'm still your clown, why do we
Always have to fight
Have to fight

Why can't we just get along
Why does one of us have to cry
Why do we keep breaking our hearts (oh why oh why)
How come we never kiss each other
Just to say goodbye
How do you save two breaking hearts
That are torn beneath the tide

We never used to argue
We never used to fight
But now we've thrown ourselves away
And we stay apart all night
What can I do to help you, how can I help myself
How do I rebuild the base of this relationship if there's nothing left

I'm Suffocating from these demons they won't let me be
They came to take control and wipe out all we know
Who gets the blame, we get the blame
Too late to put it all aside, all aside

Why can't we just get along
Why does one of us have to cry
Why do we keep breaking our hearts (oh why oh why)
How come we never kiss each other
Just to say goodbye
How do you save two breaking hearts
That are torn beneath the tide

We never consider each other
What we do and how we feel
Because we are stringing out the past won't come again
Why do we play these games and force them
Onto breakdown what we had, just think of what we had

Why can't we just get along
Why does one of us have to cry
Why do we keep breaking our hearts (oh why oh why)
How come we never kiss each other
Just to say goodbye
How do you save two breaking hearts
That are torn beneath the tide

We tried and tried but it's all wrong
Baby it's time to say goodbye
How do you save two breaking hearts
It's too late to save our broken hearts
How do you save two broken hearts",Love Song
David Jordan,"Ego don't ever get you anywhere
But now I know to speak up
Let my voice be known
I won't sit back pretend
My name hasn't been called

As if I'm running from my goal
I'll face the music with my soul
Don't talk to me like I am just a child
I've sold more stories than you've ever told

Don't be fooled
Softest touch but selfish growth
This driving force won't let me go

If you tell give me truth
Should be something plain to see
And you don't even know
What the truth is meant to be

Listen to what I say
'Cause unassailably
And scientifically
It's on the money

Advice is something we can choose to take
I've learned from teachers
That could orchestrate this whole wide world

You've got to think between the lines
And on your feet
Step up to the grade with no defeat
Appearances are deceptive, look at me

If you tell give me truth
Should be something plain to see
And you don't even know
What the truth is meant to be

Listen to what I say
'Cause unassailably
And scientifically
It's on the money

You'll say what you can
To try and break my stand
You just try your best
But I'll keep on bouncing back
It's all in your head
Go deal with that instead

On the money
On the money
On the money

If you tell give me truth
Should be something plain to see
And you don't even know
What the truth is meant to be

Listen to what I say
'Cause unassailably
And scientifically
It's on the money

If you tell give me truth
Should be something plain to see
And you don't even know
What the truth is meant to be

Listen to what I say

Just here doin' what I can 
No I don't want a family who would damn me 
And resent everything I am

Feel that I need to fit in 
No I won't ever tell you that I failed you 
I'd rather start life over again 

No I'm sorry to say 
There'll be no sacrifice today

David Kahiapo,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
I am a living legacy to the leader of the band",Leader of the Band
David Kamakahi,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
David Kamenir,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

David Kenneth McComber,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
