BeBe Winans,"Time I spend with You
Makes me feel that I can do
The impossible, yeah

It's the little things You see
That mean so much to me
Makes You incredible, yes it does

I don't know how I ever lived without You
You mean everything to me, now

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm living my life to please You, yes
In every way 'cause I want You to know
I love and need You

In my heart I'm singing Your praises
Every beat and every part, 'cause I want You to know
And show how much I do
'Cause I do

Hard to concede and at times I still believe
That I'm dreamin', dreamin'
Turn my sky from gray
Then You wipe my tears away
And gave me reason, yes You did

I don't know how I ever lived without You
You mean all the world to me
That's why

[Chorus]

In my heart I'm singing Your praises
Every beat and every part, 'cause I want You to know
And show how much I do
'Cause I do

My love, I pledge to You
The happiness I long for
Has come true

And if ever I've been sure of any one thing
It's here and now
When I knew no one could love me
You found a way somehow
That's why

[Chorus]

In my heart I'm singing Your praises
Every beat and every part, 'cause I want You to know
I love and need You

[Chorus]

In my heart I'm singing Your praises
Every beat and every part, 'cause I want You to know
I love and need You

And show how much I do
'Cause I really really do

Time I spend with You
Makes me feel that I can do
The impossible, yea",Everyday
BeBe Winans,"How do we

Often we live for tomorrow
When all we really have is just today
Where did the joy turn into sorrow
How did we let it all slip away
I never ever meant to hurt you
Even time can't undo what's been done

[Chorus]
How do we mend a broken heart
How do we find a place to start
How can we learn to trust each other
How do we wipe away the tears
Just walk away from all these years
Or can we put it back together?
Asking down on bended knees how do we?

Seems like a hopeless situation
If no one forgives no one wins
Beyond  the pain is our salvation
Change of mind change of heart
Change within
I miss your touch and conversation
I miss your simple smile when I awake
Um,um

[Chorus]

How do we say good bye
When goodbye is 0what I don't want to tell you
How do we break down all these wall
How can I leave when I still love you
To be happy again would be worth it all

[Chorus]",How Do We

BeBe Winans,"Lift every voice and sing, till earth and Heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise, high as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet,
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered;
Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,
Thou Who hast brought us thus far on the way;
Thou Who hast by Thy might, led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee.
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee.
Shadowed beneath Thy hand, may we forever stand,
True to our God, true to our native land.",Lift Every Voice and Sing

Sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing; 
Land where my fathers died, 
Land of the pilgrims' pride, 
From every mountainside let freedom ring! 

My native country, thee, 
Land of the noble free, thy name I love; 
I love thy rocks and rills, 
Thy woods and templed hills; 
My heart with rapture thrills, like that above. 

Let music swell the breeze, 
And ring from all the trees sweet freedom's song; 
Let mortal tongues awake; 
Let all that breathe partake; 
Let rocks their silence break, the sound prolong. 

Our fathers' God, to thee, 
Author of liberty, to thee we sing; 
Long may our land be bright 
With freedom's holy light; 
Protect us by thy might, great God, our King.","America, (My County Tis of Thee)"
BeBe Winans,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on. 

[Chorus]
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!
While God is marching on.",The Battle Hymn of the Republic
BeBe Winans,"Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!",Star Spangled Banner (Reprise)

Over and over, I want you to know how much I care.

How can I let you know the way I feel about you
Certainly a hero, just wanted to say ‘thank you’
Though it may have cost your life,
Did you ever once think twice
Yet, you’re willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Days and nights you were afraid,
Convinced your heart be strong and brave
Not here to judge who’s right, who’s wrong
But from my heart I sing this song
Wanting to say you ‘thank you’

Come together united, hand in hand.
Wipe the tears from all the faces from every boy and girl
Giving them the chance to live free and dance.

O nosso amor não vai parar de rolar
De fugir e seguir como um rio
Como uma pedra que divide o rio
Me diga coisas bonitas

O nosso amor não vai olhar para trás
Desencantar nem ser tema de livro
A vida inteira eu quiz um verso simples
Prá tranformar o que eu digo

Rimas fáceis, calafrios
Fura o dedo, faz um pacto comigo
Um segundo seu no meu
Por um segundo mais feliz


Translation:
Happier

Our love is never going to stop
Running away and flow like a river
Like a stone dividing the river
Tell me beautiful things

Our love won't look back
Disenchant or be the theme of a book

To transform what I am saying

Pinch a finger, make a pact with me

After all, all I have in my mind
Is just silence all around
A thousand times I have tried to find
Pieces of dreams. visions and sounds
And then I pray for better days

Do you know how it is without anyone
Do you know anyone?
Don't let it go
Never forget that when
I think of you
You're not alone

After all, all I have in my heart
Are the pieces, that I found
Shades of blue, swimming in the moon
Counting the stars all around

Up in the sky

And my mouth so dry
Where were you
All this time?

Belongs to you
And as days like these
Come and go
I still remember

It's all because of you
The night is dark and the moon so high

Then upon this heartbeat
I could fly
Just to sing this song for you

If I could name
A fruit for you
It would be jabuticaba
Blue, black and small
On the outside
And soft and sweet within

My favourite memory
Was under that tree
That's been there since
I was three
Now I would like to
Sing for you
My jabuticaba song

Isn't she lovely
Like purple rain
Walking on sunshine with you
(over the rainbow)
Quiet nights, quiet stars
It's summertime
Quiet nights, quiet stars and you

If I could name
A tree for you
It would be
Jabuticaba
Under the shade
Of the cool green leaves
It all comes back to me

So when that taste
Reminds you
You know just where
To find me
And now I would like to sing for you
My jabuticaba song

There was just nowhere to go
Cause standing tall on every side,
The mighty fear of letting go
She said, my God I'm so ashamed,
Thirty years a tragedy
I still believed that he could change,
But he pulled me down like gravity

He broke my will, but it's deeper still, deeper still

She told me morning was the time,
When the sun burned bright and clean
And love grew fragile on the vine,
All wrapped up in gold and green
Cause after all we know we all
Are after all the same things
But for the sun no rain would fall,
And it burned him up and turned him mean

This fire that kills me, it's deeper still, deeper still

Tonight I rose up with the moon,
And looking down from high above
I saw a world carved and confused
Into valleys deep in need of love
And falling down all thick with grace,
Heaven's cloud of mystery
Was filling every empty space,
Down to the depth of human need

This love that heals, it's deeper still
(Love that heals me, love that heals me,
Love that's deeper still)
(Love that heals me, love that heals me,
Love that's deeper still)

My final shape, my final form
I'm sure I'm bound to find

So dream a little, dream for me
In hopes that I'll remain
And cry a little, cry for me
So I can bear the flames
And hurt a little, hurt for me
My future is untold
But my dreams are not the issue here,
For they, the hammer holds

And the water, it cools me gray,
And the hurt's subdued somehow
I have my shape, this sharpened point,
What is my purpose now?
And the question still remains,
What am I to be?
Perhaps some perfect piece of art
Displayed for all to see

So dream a little, dream for me
In hopes that I'll remain
And cry a little, cry for me
So I can bear the flames
And hurt a little, hurt for me
My future is untold
But my dreams are not the issue here,
For they, the hammer holds

The hammer pounds again,
But flames I do not feel
This force that drives me, helplessly,
Through flesh, and wood reveals
A burn that burns much deeper,
It's more than I can stand
The reason for my life was to take
The life of a guiltless man

So dream a little, dream for me
In hopes that I'll remain
And cry a little, cry for me
So I can bear the pain
And hurt a little, hurt for me,
My future is so bold
But my dreams are not the issue here,
For they, the hammer holds

This task before me may seem unclear
But it, my maker holds",The Hammer Holds
Bebo Norman,"I can tell by this crack of light 
Oh girl this is gonna be, 
It's gonna be a beautiful day 
And I can tell by this stretch of silver 
Spreading all out across the curves of your face 

And for the love, for the love of God 
I've gathered up my pride, 
I've gathered up my bits and bone 
And in a world that broke me down 
I'm standing up, but not alone 

'Cause this is a healing song, oh 
And I've got a heart that fails 
But love is pushing me along, 
I'm lifting up above this veil 
This is a healing song, oh 
And I don't know if you can tell 
But love is pushing me along 
I'm pressing up against the rail, 
Pressing up against the rail 

I can smell the summer in the air 
And I swear I can almost see, 
I can almost see my soul 
Son, I know that it don't seem fair 
But I'm turning away from here, 
And oh Lord, I am coming home 

I've got friends here that love me 
I've got all this mercy beating in my blood 
And I've got friends here that love me

Bebo Norman,"I've got a little hope in my pocket, 
I want to share a bit with you 
Just be careful that you don't drop it, 
But don't worry if you do 
'Cause I got broken down inside me, 
And I might just need some help 
But I will get by 

And I've got demons in my history, 
Got bone beneath my skin 
But I've been taken by a mystery, 
Yes, I've been taken in

What have I got to live for 
When this world starts turning? 
It's burning me up 
I'm alright 

I used to think love was just a barter, 
Second hand coincidence 
What doesn't kill you just makes you harder, 
So I used my common sense 
Keeping cold to keep my distance, 
Till you took my pride away 
Now I will get by 

I am not afraid, no, I am not afraid 
And I will not go crazy here

Because my heart and my hopes, 
They're in your hands 
If I don't seem certain 
It's just a common fear 
From a common man 
But I am in your hands 

Just so you know, I have never 
Done this sort of thing before 
I've never given up my very soul

Making me look up from my precious world 
Forcing me to see your point of view 

This broken sidewalk, not so broken as 
The man who likes to walk, jumping all the cracks 
Pushing his old bike, he's sure to smile at you 

I was looking for the quick way home 
But you were happy just to be alone 
Something magic must have caught my eye 
I saw the secret of the man inside 
I saw the secret of the man inside 

It's not the sun-baked brick lines in your skin 
Thick with chain grease, aged and clumsy hands 
It isn't struggled words you fight to say 

Beneath the man-suit, beneath your purple skin 
There is a boy who don't know that he's a man 
He simply close his eyes and he can fly away 

I was driving in the same old car 
But you were dreaming of a land so far away 
I was looking through my corner eye 
But you were singing with the man inside 
You were singing with the man inside

some think they got a lot to give

But some people know to truly live",The Man Inside
Bebo Norman,"A page is turned by the wind to a boy in curly grin 
With a world to conquer at the age of ten 
But as history unfolds and the storybook is told 
He finds salvation but not at the hands of man 

And the God of second chance 
Picked him up and He let him dance 
Through a world that is not kind 
And all this time, preparing him, the one 
To hold him up when he comes undone 
Beneath the storm, beneath the sun 
And now a man, here you stand 
Your day has come 

A page is turned in this world to reveal a little girl 
With a heart that's bigger, as it is unfurled 
By the language in her soul, that's teaching her to grow 
With a careful cover of love that will not fail 

And the God of second chance 
Picked her up and He let her dance 
Through a world that isn't kind 
And all this time, preparing her the one 
To hold her up when she comes undone 
Beneath the storm, beneath the sun 
And grown up tall, here you are 
Your day has come 

Beneath the air of autumn, she took him by his hand 
And warm within the ardor, she took his heart instead 
And high upon the mountain, he asked her for her hand 
Just for her hand 

A page is turned in this life, he's making her his wife 
And there is no secret to the source of this much life 
When the grace that falls like rain is washing them again 
Just a chance to somehow rise above this land 

Where the God of second chance 
Will pick them up and he'll let them dance 
Through a world that is not kind 
And all this time, they're sharing with the one 
That holds them up when they come undone 
Beneath the storm, beneath the sun 
And once again, here you stand 
And once again, here you stand 
Your day has come",A Page Is Turned
Bebo Norman,"Lay down softly in our sorrow
Lay down sister to die
And cover over, my sweet Father
Cover over her eyes

Your broken body, it cannot weather
The years your youth still longs to spend
So go down graceful, sleep with the angels
And wake up whole again

'Cause it was not your time; that's a useless line
A fallen world took your life

But the God that sometimes can't be found
Will wrap Himself around you
So lay down, sister, lay down

Slower passing are the hours
To tell this tale that takes its time
But the finest moment, no man can measure
Is to look your Savior in the eyes

So take her tender to Your table
Take her from this killing floor
To taste the water that is forever
Let her be thirsty no more

It was not her time; that's a useless line
A fallen world took her life

But the God that sometimes can't be found
Will wrap Himself around you
So lay down, sister, lay down

And the God that sometimes can't be found
Will wrap Himself around you
So lay down, Rita, lay down

Your spilling soul that somehow always fills me up

Every word is true
Gathered hearts are here just to sing their soul to you
And every word is true
I'm happy when I'm here with you, oh with you
At Selwood Farm

I see the sisters smiling
I see the light upon their face
Here is the promise that fills this place
There is an edge of winter
But there is fire that keeps us warm
This is the harvest at Selwood Farm

Gathered hearts are here just to sing their soul to you
And every word is true
I'm happy when I'm here with you, oh with you

And these are the sons and daughters
They turn in the leaves then come inside
I welcome the healing of all my pride
And this is a day worth keeping
This is a day worth dwelling on
This is the day at Selwood Farm

And I don't know why, but my heart just smiles
And I know that each day we're growing older
But I still know the way
So take me to the day
Take me to the day

And I don't know where the angels sleep

I think they buried part of me
Because I've been searching, I've been looking all around
But I cannot find the heart of me, the heart of me

So I'll put my fingers in this soil upon her grave
And I will plant for her a garden
And every flower, a reminder of her face
Will grow up graceful as a pardon

And all that grows is her story told
As life unfolds here before us
The peace I've found in this broken ground
I can see her in the harvest...of all that I have sown

Long before I was covered up in gray
Before the old had bent my bones
We grew our children in the red Georgia clay
They were our garden and our home

And all that grows is our story told
As life unfolds here before
The peace we found in that broken ground
I can see them in the harvest...of all that I have sown

And when my life is done
I pray the kingdom come
And take me to Glory
It's living inside me
It was planted like a seed
All to tell a story

I believe when they put me in the ground
There will remain a part of me
Because I've been seraching and the joy that I have found
Is living in my family...it's all that I have sown

Bebo Norman,"Angels on a subway
She's buried in a magazine
Stuck inside a replay
Of someone else's dream

Prophets made of paper
Don't tell her anything
She wants something just to save her
So she lifts her head and screams
She lifts her head and screams,

[Chorus]
""I don't know you
But I love you anyway
I can't see you
But I hope you're here to stay
I don't know you
But I need you here with me
'cause I'm falling down
I'm falling down""

Now angels on a runway
Looking for a big jet plane
To take her to a new day
She won't be back again
She won't be back again
And she says,

You're on my side
You're just in time
I'm on my way
Don't know who you are
But I want you back again

Bebo Norman,"Sometimes at night
I am afraid
I cover my eyes,
Cover my shame
So here in the dark
Broken apart
Come with your light
And fill up my heart

Oh great light of the world
Fill up my soul
I'm half a man here
So come make me whole
Oh great light of the world
Come to impart
The light of your grace
To fill up my heart

The wind of this world
Can push us around
Folding us up
Backing us down
But here in the dark
I'm not alone
So come with your strength
And carry me home

Oh great light of the world
Fill up my soul
I'm half a man here
So come make me whole
Oh great light of the world
Come to impart
The light of your grace

Oh great light of the world
Fill up my soul
I'm half a man here

Bebo Norman,"I would give my soul just to look at you 
And everything I know just to see it through 
To let all the others fade away 
And turn all my darkness into day 
My love, I would give my soul just to look at you 

Would you believe in me 
Or would you walk away in need 
Would you believe in me 
Or would you turn away and leave 
Either way, my love
I would give my soul just to look at you 

If you found my heart would you run it dry 
And break it all apart just to run and hide 
And make all the colors fade away 
Into another shade of gray 
My love, I'd still give my soul just to look at you 

Would you believe in me 
Or would you walk away in need 
Cause I don't know where, and I don't know how

Bebo Norman,"It's a long way home, 
And the fists have flown 
In the silence, there's 
Nowhere left to run 
It's the battle of our pending love 
In the shadow of 
Another smoking gun 

When we dreamed this dream 
For the first it seemed 
We could live this love 
For a lifetime....you and me 

[Chorus] 
I will not give up this fight 
I will not lay down and die 
I will not carry this heart of stone 
I may not be your place to run 
I may not be your kingdom come 
I may stumble through this great unknown 
But I will be all that is true 
I will not give up on you 
I was made to be with you alone 

Cause you and me, 
We're gonna see...the long way home 

It's a long way home, 
And crying is done 
But the sorrow is still 
Wet upon your face 
Our colding hearts 
Sometimes break apart 
But now the pieces 
Are gathered up in grace 

When we dream this dream 
For the last time we'll see 
That we lived this love 
For a lifetime....just you and me 

[Chorus] 

Cause you and I, 
We're gonna fly..the long way home",Long Way Home
Bebo Norman,"My love, will you take my hand and run 
My love, can't you see that we have just begun 

When she walks into a room, 
The whole world freezes 
To watch her spin 
Just like the wind above the ground 
She won't break into you heart, 
She just eases 
Without a sound

My love is deeper than the darkness of my soul 
And my love has the habit of forgetting to let go 

And the crowd was pressing in
Like perfect strangers 
That was the day I felt 
Her hand slip out of mine 
She looked at me and 
I don't think she even wavered 
As she waved goodbye
She did not cry
But she waved goodbye

My love, why did you take my heart and run 
My love, can't you see that we had just begun",My Love
Bebo Norman,"Feels like a brand new day

And I need you

Your love won't bring me down 

I'm living a long, long life 
And I will not let you go 
It's taken a long, long time to get here 
It could be a long, long night 
But I will not let you go 
Love will be our mystery 

So let's leave this world behind 
And see what we can find 

Cause I don't need it

That I'll find myself alone
Looking for a savior, looking for a home
I am so afraid
That I'll find myself alone
Lookin for a savior, lookin for a home

So don't leave me here alone
Don't leave me here alone

All your hope, and all my pride
All this time to watch it all collide
When everyone seems to say,
â??You can work it outâ??
Under my skin, I'm shaking
And I can't get out

So don't leave me here

This is not what you said
It's all in my head 
When I throw my anger at you instead
So don't give up on me

That you'll never leave me

That I'll find myself alone

Bebo Norman,"Every breath I breathe 
And every song I sing 
And every love I've ever known 
Will never be enough 
To ever fill me up 
Like the calling of my soul 

I know that everything 
One day everything will cry out

Everything under the sun 
Voices sing out to the one 
Who made the stars up in the sky and you and I 
Every heart that ever hurt 
And every kingdom on the earth 
Will see the heavens open up 
Over everything under the sun 

From the city streets 
And from the fields of green 
And up from every crying stone 
There will rise a voice 
That will leave no choice 
It will come to call us home 

I know that everything 
One day everything will cry out

Let it come inside and take you over

And every song I sing 
And every love I've ever known",Under the Sun
Bebo Norman,"Everyone it seems 
Is looking for the grass that's greener here 
And through my window pane 
The scenery flies by and disappears 
So tell to me the secret 
That won't let the memories fade away 
Until I am home again, where the trees stand still 

Yesterday it seems 
I traveled in a younger man's clothes 
Living out this dream 
And wandering through fields of touch and go 
Moving on forever 
Watching the distance fade away 
But now I just want to land, where the trees stand still 

All this time 
On this line 
Here then I am gone 

Tonight I want a life 
Where the faces are the same most every day 
Tonight I want a wife 
To sit with me and watch our children play 
All the world between us 
Watching the years fade away 
And when the laughing's done, we'll watch the trees stand still 
Everyday, where the trees stand still 
We will make a home, where the trees stand still",Where the Trees Stand Still

And walk with me awhile 
Because it seems your smile 
Has left here 

And don't give in 
When you fall apart 
And your broken heart 
Has failed you 

I'll set a light up 
On a hilltop 
To show you my love 
For this world to see 

You can borrow mine 
When your hope is gone 
You can borrow mine 
When you can't go on 
Cause the world will not defeat you 
When we're side by side 
When your faith is hard to find 
You can borrow mine 
You can borrow mine 

And take my love 
When all that you can see 
Is the raging sea 
All around us 

And don't give up 
Cause I'm not letting go 
And the God we know 
Will not fail us 

We will lay it all down 
As we call out

When you are weak 
Unable to speak 
You are not alone

Bebo Norman,"On a day like this I want to crawl beneath a rock
A million miles from the world, the noise, the commotion
That never seems to stop

And on a day like this I want to run away from the routine
Run away from the daily grind that can suck the life
Right out of me
I know of only one place I can run to?

I want to hide in You
The Way, the Life, the Truth
So I can disappear
And love is all there is to see
Coming out of me
And You become clear
As I disappear

I don't want to care about earthly things
Be caught up in all the lies that trick my eyes
They say it's all about me
I'm so tired of it being about me?

I would rather be cast away
Separated from the human race
If I don't bring You glory
If I don't bring You glory
If I don't bring You glory",Disappear

I don't know if I can
Take another breath

Crashing like a raindrop
Can you make my heart stop
Shaking like a leaf?
Standing at the floodgate
Steady as an earthquake
Can you hear my heart break
Tearing at the seems?

I am drifting in my deep end
Holding on to your hand
Is all that saves me now
Life can treat you like a beggar
You hold me together
But I don't know how

Falling from a rooftop
Crashing like a raindrop
Can you make my heart stop
Shaking like a leaf?
Standing at the floodgate
Steady as an earthquake
Can you hear my heart break
Tearing at the seams?

Some say home is where the heart is
And my heart is in your hands
You are all I need

Rising from the ashes
Lifted from the madness

Deep enough to dream

In everything that shines

Cause your love is so alive

Maybe you could stop time
Hang it on the daylight
Doesn't ever have to go away
I could sing a new song
Maybe get the words wrong
But you know just what I want to say
Cause when you look at me
You know I still believe

You bring me to life

Where I will see all that you are
More than a sky full of stars
And the worries of this world will fall away
On the other side of day

Is it time that gets the best of us?
Reminding all the rest of us
That it's fading
That it's fading

And pave the way of paradise
Can you take me?
Can you take me?
Cause the world is just the shadow of the sun
Only you remain the hope on what's to come

And taking back my hand 
When all I could think was how long can I follow you 
And where do I stand in this world 
I lost my faith, my reason to believe 
When I refused to see 
Oh Lord, you carried me 

And just like a soldier 
You battle for my soul 
But more like a father 
You come and take me home 

What is the worth of a man living for himself 
With a heart of his own 
And every day goes in and out, still without a sign of life 
But father won't you please give me more 
When everything is closing in on me

All weary from the race 
And the voices in my head 
You stepped inside and changed my will 

Oh me, oh my 
I am standing in your silence 
Gonna stand here for a long, long time 

Well, it's cold behind the earth 
For a drifting satellite 
But you know for what its worth 
I've been praying for daylight 
So slow my eyes to see 

But it's finally breaking day 
And the morning time has come 
And if I am fields of green 
Well, honey you're the sun

You'll probably find me all over the place 
In pictures of me back in school 
A slight crooked kid like the smile on my face 
And my first guitar by the bed 
With circles of dust clinging to wood 
It drew the first song from my head 
Singin' if I was gone, I'd be gone for good 
I'm afraid to grow up 
But somewhere inside is the will of a man 
And all I've ever wanted 
Was something to give and love if I can 

[Chorus]
You make me want to try 
You make me want to fight 
You make me want to live 
You make me want to give 

And inside my room looking out 
The colors of night all faded and bruised 
But out from the shadows of doubt 
You held up your heart and stepped into view 
And under the streetlight we kissed 
Never more tried and never more true 
It drew a new song from my lips 
Singing if I can fall, I'm falling for you 
I'm afraid to grow up 
'Cause somewhere inside I don't think I can 
And all I've ever wanted 
Is someone to love, and to live like a man",Try

God, my God, I cry out

Your beloved needs You now

God, be near calm my fear and take my doubt

Your kindness is what pulls me up

Your love is all that draws me in

I will lift my eyes to the Calmer

of the oceans raging wild

I will lift my eyes to the Healer

of the hurt I hold inside

I will lift my eyes, lift my eyes to You


God, my God, let mercy sing

her melody over me

and God, right here all I bring

is all of me

Your kindness is what pulls me up

Your love is all that draws me in



I will lift my eyes to the Maker

of the mountains I can't climb

I will lift my eyes to the Calmer

of the oceans raging wild

I will lift my eyes to the Healer

of the hurt I hold inside

I will lift my eyes, lift my eyes to You



'Cause You are and You were and You will be forever

Don't close your eyes

It's over now
Step out into the sun, for you have only begun to know
What it's all about
As the hungering dark gives way to the dawn, my love
It's over now

Time will let the story told grow and grow 'til it unfolds
In a way that even you cannot ignore
You can say the seasons change but never if you just remain

Bebo Norman,"They never knew a dark night
Always had the Son's light on their face
Perfect in glory, broken by the story
Of untold grace, come that day

Majesty had come down, glory had succumbed now
To flesh and bone
In the arms of a manger, in the hands of strangers
That could not know, just who they hold

And the angels filled the sky
All of heaven wondered why
Why their King would choose to be
Be a baby born to die

And all fell silent for the cry of an infant
The voice of God
Was dividing history for those with eyes to see
The Son would shine from earth that night

And the angels filled the sky
All of heaven wondered why
Why their King would choose to be
Be a baby born to die, be a baby born to die

To break the chains of guilt and sin
To find us here, to pull us in
So we can join in heaven's song
And with one voice around the throne

All the angels filled the sky
And I can't help but wonder why
Why this King would choose to be
Be a baby born for me, be a baby born
Be a baby born to die

Dressed in holiday style
In the air
There's a feeling like Christmas

Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures

Hear the snow crunch
See the kid's bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all
The bustle you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

How can mine compare?
For so long, I've wondered if I'm lost behind
A thousand tongues there, a thousand tongues there

It's all been done before, but I'll do it again
'Cause I know that You want me to
It's all been said before, but I'll say it again
'Cause I know that You love to hear it from me

I see all the ways I don't add up
And all that I never did
But You seek empty hands still lifted up
With nothing to give, nothing to give

It's all been done before, but I'll do it again
'Cause I know that You want me to
It's all been said before, but I'll say it again
'Cause I know that You love to hear it from me

More beautiful to You
Than the songs of angels and gifts of kings
More beautiful to You
Are what empty hands can bring
And what desperate tongues can sing
And when broken hearts cling to You

It's all been done before, but I'll do it again
'Cause I know that You want, You want me to

It's all been done before, but I'll do it again
'Cause I know that You want me to
It's all been said before, but I'll say it again
'Cause I know that You love to hear it from me
So hear it from me, so hear it from me

I could take it in, without much money

I'm not looking for freedom

I’ll sing of your glory now
I’ll sing of your glory now and forever

But I’ll sing of your glory now
I’ll sing of your glory now
I’ll sing of your glory now and forever

And my feet of clay the weight can no longer carry

When love is not a feeling
And hope feels like a cop-out
The ground beneath my feet a sudden shift and I’m buried

And all my heart
And all my soul
All my faith to pieces fall as we go

I’ll sing of your glory now

Beborn Beton,"On fridays we usually went for a walk
Tasting dew dripping down from the fruits as we paused, 
Sweet as honey the dew even sweeter were you 
Back then I could have sworn you're the one

On the way we would cross our bridge made of half rotten wood 
And you'd tighten you grip in your eyes something blue's, 
Begging me to be true, and I promise to stand and be strong

Should I cry for you 
My love died with you 
One fine day I will follow elaine

As we set in the shadows and talked 
I heard some kind of noise interfering and lowered my voice 
Hooded men drew their sword for to use them of course 
Took our property, left us in pain

Left me heavily wounded and killed my ellaine 
Stabbed her into the heart that she kept for my reign 
Vengeance will be mine 
Til the end of all time 
I'll be after the men that have killed my ellaine",Elaine
Beborn Beton,"The street's running under our feet
Worlds between us, although you're near me

The cold came creeping in the night
And this rain weakens my brain 

Hate is the kiss when you awake
A vision of a red, red rose

So the clown starts his last song
While a light end the sun 

Now we're 200 miles away from the sea
And I'm standing in the doorway

Your eyes are lying at me still
And then you slowly shut the door 

The smell of death is hanging in the air
And I see little children burning

While it rains dead cats and dogs
I look to the sky - where's a god? 

Can't you see it's torture for me
And this is why I hate you now,
All I want is to forget you
I can live without you now!

Beborn Beton,"Listen to the voice of Buddha
Saying stop your seri-culture
Little people like your offspring
Boiled alive for some gods stocking
Buddha's watching, Buddha's waiting
Just because the kid's an orphan
Is no excuse for thoughtless slaying
People don't forget this torture
Just because you call her mother
Doesn't mean that she's your better
Once more with the voice of Buddha

Who cares for the little children
You may slice with no conviction
Blind revenge on a blameless victim

Watching it come
Watching it come up 
Over the rooftops

Cloudy and warm
Maybe a storm
You can never quite tell
From the morning

And it's going to be a day
There is really no way to say no
To the morning

Yes it's going to be a day
There is really nothing left to
Say but
Come on morning

Waiting for mail
Maybe a tail
From an old friend
Or even a lover

Sometimes there's none
But we have fun
Thinking of all
Who might have written

And maybe there are seasons
And maybe they change
And maybe to love 
Is not so strange

The sounds of the day
They hurry away
Now they are gone 
Until tomorrow

When day will break
And you will wake
And you will rake your hands
Across your eyes and realize

That it's going to be a day
There is really no way 
To say no to the morning

Yes it's going to be a day

I would rather stay in bed

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You

I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

Beccy Cole,"They call me the clown
I can juggle while I?m spinning round
Take all the dark clouds away 
With a well rehearsed display

The spotlights on me
And everybody wants the clown to be
The one who laughs at the world
They think I?m their funny girl

With a painted on smile
And laughter like a shield
When it hurts the most
I make a joke to hide the way I feel
Nobody wants you when you?re down
But everyone loves a clown

I balance between 
The truth and what lies hidden up my sleeve
And when it all gets too hard
I just play the joker card

Another curtain call
Another routine where I did it all
Every trick and surprise 
To keep my thin disguise

A painted on smile
And laughter like a shield
When it hurts the most
I make a joke to hide the way I feel
Nobody wants you when you?re down
But everyone loves a clown

Did you hear the one about the girl,
Who hid inside her circus world?
Now she wonders what it?s all for
Coz it?s not funny anymore

Painted on smile
And laughter like a shield
When it hurts the most
I make a joke to hide the way I feel
Nobody wants you when you?re down
But everyone loves a clown
Everyone loves a clown

There's times the devil on my shoulder gets to leave

You think you know me but you ain't seen nothin' yet
I look more towards the guture than the past
I still try to live each day like it's the last

And I love black cars don't ever break
And I give much more than I take
Like the flowers growing wild
I believe in the promise of a child
Rainbows, dreams and butterflies

I find twenty seven hours in one day
No time to dwell on things that didn't go my way
I know there's something lost for everything that's found
I won't let the fear of falling hold me down

And the wildlife was growing wilder by the day

There was a band of brothers who rode unto me
Throwing accusations I could rarely see

And hung me upside down
And then emptied out my pockets
And kicked me on the ground

They took out the hot poker
And branded on my chest
Twisted my ear off
Gasoline on my vest

Set me all a-flaming
Periled and defeated
Pelted me with stones
That felt like certain death

They went on to my lady
And made her kneel low
Tore all her hair loose
And cut through her clothes

Laughed and they hollered
And they painted the horses orange
Put the kids together
And tied them to the porch

Then blaze upon blaze
Did the devils rally 'round
With rifles and sticks
Did they pound on the ground

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Cut 1/2 Blues

Is it disinfected, disconnected 'til it grafts some wires?
Is it sped up, spun around brown and yellow in the fires?

What is this town? they said I got no place to be
The money need is taking everything I see
Is it comes in lovely bones that put their shirts on ice?
Is it fireflies that cross out eyes with any spice?
Is it normal, born-again? let the vultures drink and drown
Is it's force from weathers, birds of feathers never found?

What is this town? they said I got no place to be

There's no relief, no soul, no mercy

You can't behave
You gamble your soul away

Measuring a jinx of this life seems
Like the gristle of loneliness

Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'

Like an ice age, nice days on your way
Sipping the golden days on a riptide
Freak's ride, sleep inside
A parasite's appetite

Oh, say can't you see the chemistry
The parasites that clean up for me?
Death never hails, recycled cans
Get well cards to the hostage vans

Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'

You're a deadweight, right straight
On your way, sunk in the midnight shade
Skies burn, eyes turn
Learning to counterfeit their disease

In this town where we roam
We bluff our souls
On canteen patio
Drink the latest draft

And pose alone

All banged and blown 
On a backwoods river

In the stench of belief

I'm over the rails 
And out of the race 
And the crippled psalms 
Of an age that won't thaw 
Are ringing in my ears

But your daddy's off the hook
Where do we go now?

Give these pious soldiers
Another lollipop
Cause we're on the good ship
Menage et tois
Peaches and cream
You make a garbage man scream
Such a delicate thing

Keep your lamplight trimmed and burning",Peaches & Cream
Beck,"The countryside is overgrown
There's a lighthouse in her soul
Wrestling with butcher girls
She don't ever change her clothes
Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears
I could sleep inside her bones
A hundred years

Lizards in the pressure zone
Mother knows it's only a phase

Cherry gardens feel like ice
Hazard lights from her past
Underneath the broken bridge
Hookers hug illegal dads
Masterpieces liquidate in fertile tears
I could sleep inside her bones
A hundred years

Lizards in the pressure zone 
Mother knows it's only a phase",Pressure Zone
Beck,"Can't you hear those cavalry drums
Hijacking your equilibrium
Midnight hags in the mausoleum
Where the pixilated doctors moan
Carnivores in the Kowloon night
Breathing freon by the candlelight
Coquettes bitch slap you so polite
Till you thank them for the tea and sympathy

I want to defy
The logic of all sex laws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
I'll let you be my chaperon
At the halfway home
I'm a full grown man
But I'm not afraid to cry

Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine
Perfumed blokes on the Ginza line
Running buck wild like a concubine
Who's mother never held her hand
Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz
Wearing hepatitis contact lens
Bed and breakfast getaway weekends
With Sports Illustrated moms

Beck,"Bazookas and fisticuffs, meditating in Porsches
98-karat stickshift, Chinatown late night meals
Alfonzo giving me a backrub, 2 pm lazer bizzaginal rejuvenation
Triple album project, detonatin' tracks like these

Magnums and Berettas, part-time hostages at pottery classes
Blind date at the wax museum
Norwegian hockey players passed out in government limos
Prime ministers with cryogenic faces, Louis Vuitton suitcases

Autographs and paid vacations, divorce papers and synthetic lubrications
Playing you like top-40 stations, ah you know the deal
Arabian nights, white satellites
Voodoo is tight like sleek diamond ice 

Airbrushed memories strewn like pamphlets into thick Mississippi's
Time-lapse footage of duct tape lies
Animal frequencies piercing deodorized nerves
Cosmetic procedures on the cartilage of apocalypse

Mannequin tycoons with airport piano bar mystiques
Remodeling conjugal amaracus
Flexing like suburban Spartacus
Getting smacked up by unemployed hand models

Running out into traffic with Beaujolais bottles

Voodoo is tight, like sleek diamond ice",Arabian Nights [*]
Beck,"Brother are you really here?
The package I received is gone
Are you a phantom detective
Can you read my soul backwards?
I will glide with you
If you are a backwards ghost
I will hire you
Brother are you really home
Holy as a blessed worm
Paradise ambassador; bring me to your room
And I will throw you rocks today
""Watch them pass right through"" you say
""This is not a game or test
We both have done some grieving'""
Brother with your vast reward
Treasury who can't afford
Surgeries in innocence abounds
And I have read in paper books
My eyes are glands on twisted hooks
Never have I felt or looked
So sorry for you now
Brother are you trained to spy
One eye open, one eye dry?
When I die will you be my neighbor?
Tell me things I'd like to know
Dress it up from head to toe
Let them know to and fro,
From here and tomorrow

Are you a phantom detective?
Can you read my soul backwards?

Beck,"Bust a move with what you can
Dead phone machine piled on the table
Disappointment is a feather in your cap
You want the truth
Not when it's unplanned

There's no map
That could tell you where you are
You're in between things
That only go halfway
You want the best
You want contests
Where everybody loses on purpose by mistake",Feather in Your Cap
Beck,"Kiss the girl slay a hag 
Feel the flavor freedom fag 
Get up early, do your chores 
Chase the murder with the rancid pores 
The thyroids with friendly blade 
The haunted beast with faces flayed 

Silver chicken make a fuss 
Reveling in molten puss 
Favorite patrons crack their death 
With arteries and tinsel breath 

Revolution purple fist 
Pummeling your angel piss 
Sour powered wussy soul 
Solid darkness goddess show 
Weaving heirlooms through the hour 
From the cradle monster cowered 

Waking up delicious ghost 
They'll eat themselves from coast to coast 
Dancing in their bandages 
The victims grow leaving messages 

Hear the commune cocaine blast 
Earthly mothers with flattened chests 
Sloping gardens, mystic hours 
Fried vibrations overpowered 
In the mangles of their hair 

Shrouded spirits and underwear 
Crazy wires fuse their brains 
Drinking water sugar cane 
Playing drums and broken flutes 
Homeless gods and iron boots 

Flying wicked love control 
Circus storm and demon skull 
Entering the solar sphere 
Planets meld crystal clear 
Thrashing in the astral glow 
Flashing in their fleshly show 

Waking up delicious ghost 
They'll eat themselves from coast to coast 
Dancing in their bandages

Beck,"Dirty dirty nights
Underneath the flashing lights
Crawling on the basement floor
I can't see you anymore
What you do, you do for me
Don't forget I'm on my knees
Make you feel what isn't real
You don't know my face is steel

Dirty dirty
Make it never ending
When you feel this dirty, dirty
Dirty dirty
Make it never ending
When you feel this dirty, dirty

Baby I'm surprised
Yellow diamonds in your eyes
Tell me what your daddy knows
Does he buy you fancy clothes?
Whichever way the wind blows
That's the way she goes
Now I think I'll never know
What it could've been like, girl

Dirty dirty
Make it never ending
When you feel this dirty, dirty
Dirty dirty
Make it never ending
When you feel this dirty, dirty

Saw you in the elevator late last night
You looked like you were off duty
Followed me down to the gym
Chromium sweat and a switchblade
Do you think I knew something you didn't?
Because you play keyboards at the west bay lounge
Traffic school, trying to pay your bills
With those millionaire dreams
I frequent places that take american express
Watching liquid crystal displays in taxi cabs

Dirty dirty
Make it never ending
When you feel this dirty, dirty
Dirty dirty
Make it never ending
When you feel this dirty, dirty

I've seen the end of the day come too late
Seen the love you had turning into hate
Had to act like I didn't even care
But I did so I got stranded standing there
Standing there

It's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before
No it's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before

I've seen the end of the day come too soon
Like the prison dogs they set out after you
You owe nothing to the past but wasted time
To serve a sentence that was only in your mind

Let the golden age begin
Let the window down
Feel the moonlight on your skin
Let the desert wind
Cool your aching head
Let the weight of the world
Drift away instead

These day I barely get by
I don't even try

It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view
There's distant lights
But here they're far and few

It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine

All the battlements are empty

Yellow roses in the graveyard
Got no time to watch them grow

Now I bade a friend farewell

It's only tears that I'm crying

We're so tired now
Altogether in a snake pit of souls
New days
To throw your chains away
To try to hang your hopes on the wind

Little one
Just a little way
Today all we need is waiting

Night rise
Like the evening prize
In a turnstile backwards we fly
Cold bones
Tied together by
Black ropes we pulled from a swing

Little one
Just a little way
Today all of the dreams are waking

Can't stand on crooked legs
I'm cross-eyed to the wall

Drown, drown
Sailors run aground
In a sea change nothing is safe

Push us every way
In a stolen boat we'll float away

Scrape down at the bump of my fingers
Holdin' over the devil I know

See me kickin' the dog with my boots
Broke down at out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes invoked at the back of your room
Handin' out a confection of venom
Heaven's drawn the poison you use
Thunderbolts in the eyes of a gambler
Now I seem to come to you
Hammer my bones in the anvil of daylight

She lives in broken down buildings

We'll shake and rattle our bodies
To keep it warm at night
My tambourine is still shaking

And I feel like I'm giving in 
We've been drivin' through a desert 
Looking for a life to call our own 

I push I pull the days go slow 
Into a void we filled with death 
And noise that laughs falls off their 
Maps all cured of pain and doubts 
In your little brain 

Something's coming sky is purple 
Dogs are howling to themselves 
Days are changing with the weather 
Like a rip tide could rip us away

Beck,"Fourteen miles away from a landfill grave 
Never pawned my watch and chain 
To the landlord living inside my head 
Never paid my rent till the lights went dead 
Then I saw my sign comin' up the road 
A dead ditch waiting for to bury my load 
On the avenues in the plain of day 
I threw a Roosevelt dime in a bucket of rain 

Now hold your hand onto the plow 
Work your body till the sun goes down 
What's left of death is more than fear 
Let dust be dust and the good lord near 
It's a little too much to ask of faith 
It's a little late to wait for fate 
So tell the angels what you seen 
Scarecrow shadow on a Nazarene 

Kindness will find you 
When darkness has fallen 
Round your bed 
Kindness will follow 
Children will wander 
Till 
The end",Emergency Exit
Beck,"Two white horses in a line carrying me to my burying 
Ground some need diamonds some need love some need 
Cards some need luck 
Some need dollar bills lining their clothes 
All I need is all I need is two white horses in a line taking 
Me for my farewell ride some may say this might be 
Your last farewell ride 
I don't see the face of 
Kindness I don't hear the 
Mission bells I don't smell 
The morning roses all I see 
Is all I see is 
Two white horses in a line 
Carrying me to my burying ground 
Some may say this might be 
Your last farewell ride",Farewell Ride
Beck,"I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

My sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a land filled life
Scrawlin' her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I would not try

Beck,"I'm comin' over 
See me down at the station 
By the lane 
With my hands in my pocket 
Jingling a wish coin 
That I stole from a fountain 
That was drowning all the cares in the world 
When I get older 
Climbin' up on the back porch fence 
Just to see the dogs runnin' 
With a ring and a question 
And my shiverin' voice is singing 
Through a crack in the window 

I better go it alone 

Down on the corner 
See me standin'
On a makeshift road 
With the dust storm blowin'
In a long black shadow 
Pull a hammer from a coal mine 
Down where your daddy was workin' 
Comb my hair back 
Strike a match on a bathroom wall 
Where my number was written 
Drivin' on the sidewalk 
Lookin' back and the sky is burning 
In my rear view mirror 

I better go it alone",Go It Alone
Beck,"Looking for my place 
On assembly lines 
Fake prizes 
Risin' out of the bomb holes 
Skeleton boys hyped up on purple 
Smoke rings blow from across the disco 
Bank notes burn like broken equipment 
Lookin' for shelter readjust your position 
Thought control ghost written confessions 
Two dimensions dumb your head down 
Duck don't look now company missiles 
Power is raunchy rent-a-cops are watching 
Makin' their dreams out of paper mache

Beck,"I prayed heaven today 
Would bring its hammer down on me 
And pound you out of my head 
I can't think with you in it 

I dragged all that I owned 
Down a dirt road to find you 
My shoes worn out and used 
They can't take me much farther 

Something always takes the place 
Of missing pieces 
You can take and put together even though 
You know there's something missing 

The sun burned a hole in my roof 
I can't seem to fix it 
I hope the rain doesn't come 
And wash me down the gutter 

She rides in a car like a queen on a card 
And the guns of her mind aim a line 
Straight at mine to a heart that was broke 
Tried to feel but got choked in the smoke of 
A desert 
A beach with no leisure a night that's so blue 
Feed the aching in you and the background 
Birds take a flight from the earth 
Where the bonfire burns and the night 
Current turns on a lifeboat floating 
Down a river of sleep 
I can't see her hollow eyes 
I'm walkin' along with my boots full of rocks 
I can't believe these tears were mine 
I'll give them to you to put away in a box 

Something always takes the place of 
Missing pieces you can take and put 
Together even though 
You know there's something missing 
Something always missing always 
Someone missing something",Missing
Beck,"See the vegetable man in the
Vegetable van with the horn that's honking
Like a mariachi band in the middle of the street

Crown never wake them up mas cerveza till

Beck,"Hey now girl what's the matter with me 
We're on a back road something to see 
Straight as a razor kickin' the dust 
Diggin' through ditches and fallin' to rust 

Takin' me far 
Far as a rental car can go 

Hey now girl at the end of the road 
Down where the reaper is walkin' alone 
Singing a death knell 
Clappin' along

Beck,"I'm walkin' to the other side 
With the devil tryin' to take my mind 
And my soul's just a silhouette 
In the ashes of a cigarette 

Illusions never fake their lies 
Trick cards fool the eye 
Carry zeros over till they add up 
Bury tears in the chapters you shut 
Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell 
And the rain's too plain to tell 
All alone by a barren well 
The scarecrow's only scarin' himself 

I've been diggin' the ground 
Through the dust and the clouds 
I see miles and miles 
And the junkyard piles 
I wanted hope from a grave 
I wanted strength from a slave 
What gives you comfort now 
Might be the end of you then 
Crows are pullin' at my clothes 
The wind got my fingers froze 
Standing all day keepin' watch 
Over all the treasures we lost 
Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell 
And the rain's too plain to tell 
All alone by a barren well 
The scarecrow's only scarin' himself",Scarecrow

Cutting the lines
The red lights going round
Like insanity sirens
The end of the galaxy
The middle of the road
Where the blackout moons
Cut the weather of souls
Black engines grind down
Teeth are raw
The rubber juggernaut
Rots in a shattering jaw
Helter skelter bulldozers
Runnin' over the block
Where a pawnshop clock
Is ticking out like a bomb

It's a chain reaction, yeah!
It's a chain reaction, yeah!
It's a chain reaction, yeah!

On a chain reactor
Blowing out of my arms
Shoot every paranoid phantom
That's done me harm
Like a desolate specter
With a pummel of fists
Kicking against the pricks
Burning black like wicks
They spit pig iron
Tell you nothing is wrong
Put a heart on a pike
Sing a resurrection song
For a paralyzed mind
In a kerosene jar
Barracuda believer
With a heathen guitar
Apocalyptic nostalgia tokens
Dark arks set sail
For Antarctica oceans

Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holdin' onto the devil, I know
All my troubles'll hang on your trigger

Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Shoot your mouth off if you know where you're aimin'
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Talkin' trash to the garbage around you

See me kickin' the door with my boots
Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handin' out a confection of venom

Heaven's drunk from the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of the gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight

I won't give up that ghost
It's sick the way these tongues are twisted

Vegetable van with the horn that's honking 
Like a mariachi band in the middle of the street

Sleeping on the side walk with a burger king 
Crown never wake them up mas cerveza till 
The rooster crows vatos vergallos

Rancheras on cheap guitars abuelitas with 
Plastic bags walking to church with their 
Spanish candles dirty boracho says ""qué putas? 
Andelay joto, your popsicles melting""

Beck,"Walking to the other side
With the Devil trying to take my mind
And my soul's just a silhouette
On the ashes of a cigarette

Illusions never fake their lives
Trick cards fool the eyes
Carry zeros over till they add up
Bury tears in the chapters you shut

Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell
And the rain's too plain to tell
All alone by a barren well
Scarecrow's only scaring himself

I've been digging the ground
Beneath the dust and the clouds
I see miles and miles
Of junkyard piles

I wanted hope from a grave
I wanted strength from a spade
What gives you comfort now
Might be the end of your vein

Crows are pulling at my clothes
The wind got my fingers froze
Standin' all day, keepin' watch
Over all the treasures we've lost

Sometimes the jail can't chain the cell
And the rain's to plain to tell
All alone by a barren well
The scarecrow's only scaring himself

Scarecrow's only scaring himself

Beck,"Space ships can't tame the jungle
And I feel like I'm giving in
We've been drivin' through a desert
Looking for a life to call our own

I push, I pull
The days go slow into a void
We filled with death

And noise that laughs
Falls off their maps, all cured of pain
And doubts in your little brain

Something's coming, sky is purple
Dogs are howling to themselves
Days are changing with the weather
Like a rip tide could rip us away

I push, I pull
The days go slow into a void
We filled with death

And noise that laughs
Falls off their maps, all cured of pain
And doubts in your little brain

I push, I pull
The days go slow into a void
We filled with death

And noise that laughs
Falls off their maps, all cured of pain
And doubts in your little brain

",Terremoto Tempo (Earthquake Weather) [Mario C Remix]
Beck,"Now I'm comin' over, see me down at the station
By the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jinglin' a wish coin that I stole from a fountain
That was drownin' all the cares in the world though

When I gettin older, climbin' up
On the back porch fence, just to see the dogs runnin'
Ring and a question and my shiverin'
Voice is singin' through a crack in the window

Na, na, na, na, na, I better go it alone
Na, na, na, na, na, I better go it alone
Na, na, na, na, na

Down on the corner, see me standin'
On a makeshift home with a dust storm comin'
In a long black shadow, pull the hammer
From a coal mine down where your daddy was workin'

Comb my hair back, strike a match
On the bathroom wall where my number is written
Drivin' on a sidewalk, lookin' back
At the sky, it's burnin' in the rear view mirror

Na, na, na, na, na, I better go it alone
Na, na, na, na, na, I better go it alone
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

I'm comin' over, see you down at the station
By the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jinglin' a wish coin that I stole from a fountain
That was drownin' all the cares in the world though

When I gettin' older, climbin' up
On the back fence, pointing to the dogs standin' firm
With a ring and a question, dime a dozen
And a voice that was singin' underneath the window

Na, na, na, na, na, I better go it alone
Na, na, na, na, na, I better go it alone

",Wish Coin [Diplo Remix]
Beck,"Black hearts in effigy 
We sing a song that was hated 
All dressed in rag and bones 
Sharks smell the blood that I'm bleeding 
I know there's something wrong 
Might take a fire to kill it 
Might take a hurricane 
Don't know what life that I'm livin' 

Black tambourine 

My baby run to me 
She lives in broken down buildings 
Can't pay the rent again 
These spider webs are my home now 
And when the sun is down 
We'll shake and rattle our bodies 
To keep it warm at night 
My tambourine is still shaking 

Black tambourine",Shake Shake Tambourine (Black Tambourine)
Beck,"See me comin’ to town with my soul
Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holding onto the devil I know
All my troubles, I'll hang on your trigger

Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Shoot your mouth off if you know where you're aiming
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Talking trash to the garbage around you

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

See me kickin’ the door with my boots
Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handing out a confection of venom

Heaven's drunk from the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight

Throw my hopes

A disappointment condition, a perfunctory prescription
Of an indigent mindset of belligerent silence
We got all we need droning out of a tin can
Thinking about the rain under the sweatshirt hood
Listen to the noise on the battery tape deck
A Judas train wreck, anonymous suspect
Hovering in carbon monoxide cremations 
Loners waste away inside of vacant locations
Think tanks empty, international dream bank
Plug in my reactor to the fallout zone
The enemies' story is a lot like mine
And if you get to the point then you know better than I

Dark star like an eye that's closing
Sees through the shards from a scar that's open

Autopilot drivers riding out on the ice age
Infidels swallowed in a vanishing point
Ammunition souls shooting holes in the ozone
Widow's tears washing the soldier's bones
Sterilized egos delirium sequels
Punctured by the arrows of American eagles
Robot to teach you all the rules that delete you
Backspace my brain, my equilibrium guns

Sees through the shards from a scar that's open

Alright...

I'm uptight stupid, get it out of the flame.
I shake a leg on the ground like an epileptic battery man.
I'm making my move, lettin' loose like a belt.
Little worse for wear, but I'm wearing it well.
Tell me what's wrong with a little grind and bump
When the stereos erupt with a kick-drum punch?
Once you do it once, probably do it again and again.
You did it before, but you're more erratic then them.
And you had a rough night, and the vibe's just begun.
Let a little bit of this, the past week is done.
Don't let it hold you back, but you're already set.
No dead flowers gonna grow till the dirt gets wet.

Put the elevator music on.
Pull me back where I belong.
The ambulance sings along.
The fly on the wall
Doesn't know what's wrong.
If I could forget myself,
Find another lie to tell.
If I had a soul to sell,
I'd buy some time
To talk to my brain cells.

Gut bucket and a bottle of pains.
It's like the schoolhouse lights will never turn on again.
Till the bottom wears off of these high-heeled boots.
The bodies all move, some backbone roots.
Everybody workin' hard till the yard's all clean.
The dishes wash good in the washin' machine.
Now you brush your teeth and you comb back your hair.
You drive your vehicle like you just didn't care.
You're walkin' to work with the boys and the girls.
And you're doin' it to death, cause it's the end of the world.
Now everybody's sweatin', forgettin' what's on their minds.
With your hand like a mirror, you can see what's inside.
When you're down and out, poundin' and there's nothing that's real.
It's like a plastic heart, too amputated to feel.

I got a soda can bible song, paranoid Jumbotron.
The lord took the weekend off.
The fly on the wall doesn't know what's wrong.
If I could forget myself, find another lie to tell.
The bottom of an oil well, cell phone's ringing
To talk to my brain cells.

Come on! What!?
All the dudes with banjos.
Chicks with the wigs.
Animals with bananas.
Got my hand like a mirror.

I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I watch your sea birds flying

There's no submarine

Bigger than a road
Farther than an ocean
Closer than a soul

Hovering in carbon monoxide cremations
Loners waste away inside of vacant locations

Becker & Fagen,"A race of angels 
Bound with one another 
A dish of dollars 
Laid out for all to see 
A tower room at Eden Rock 
His golf at noon for free 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me 

His lady's aching 
To bring a body down 
She daily preaches 
On where she wants to be 
An evening with a movie queen 
A face we all have seen 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me 

A case of aces 
Done up loose for dealing 
A piece of island cooling in the sea 
The whole of time we gain or lose 
And power enough to choose 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me",Brooklyn (Owes the Charmer Under Me)
Becker & Fagen,"I recall when I was small 
How I spent my days alone 
The busy world was not for me 
So I went and found my own 
I would climb the garden wall 
With a candle in my hand 
I'd hide inside a hall of rock and sand 
On the stone an ancient hand 
In a faded yellow-green 
Made alive a worldly wonder 
Often told but never seen 
Now and ever bound to labor 
On the sea and in the sky 
Every man and beast appeared 
A friend as real as I 

[Chorus]
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall 
When there wasn't even any Hollywood 
They heard the call 
And they wrote it on the wall 
For you and me we understood 

Can it be this sad design 
Could be the very same 
A wooly man without a face 
And a beast without a name 
Nothin' here but history 
Can you see what has been done 
Memory rush over me 
Now I step into the sun

Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby

My old man never thought me how
I don't like lying all alone in my bed
Nobody calling my name
I can't say thank you for a kick in the head
But I need you just the same
See me sitting by the side of the road
People staring and smiling
They got no mercy for a man and his tears
Can't you hear me cry

And I lose control

Becker & Fagen,"Will you walk a little faster?, said a whiting to a snail
There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail

They are waiting on the shingle, won't you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
(3x)
You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters in the sea
But the snail replied ""Too far, too far!"" and gave a look askance
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance
[Chorus]
(2x)
[Ba ba ba ba ba ba etc continuous background to end]

I've had enough of your integrity
Your devotion sickens me
If there's a fracture in your moral ground
I'll find a break and I'll bring you down

And you will swear to a brand new allegiance
Hope to die and cross your heart
You'll abandon the things you believe in
With total disregard

And as the flag of your past life is burning
We'll dance around the fire
Swept away by the tides that are turning
You'll succumb to my desire

Deny me if you think you can
But I always get my man
And before this night is through
I will corrupt you

And when your thoughts have been cleansed and corrected
We'll celebrate the day
When everything that your were is rejected
That's when I'll have my way

Deny me if you think you can
But I always get my man
And before this night is through
I will corrupt you

Deny me if you think you can
But I always get my man
And before this night is through
I will corrupt you

So you say you've tried but just can't find the measure

Try to resist, all the bad things all around you
If you taste them, they will haunt you
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah, get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
What ya, what ya, what ya, what ya know?
Watch all the stars, they lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Yo, first grade, Oak street elementary
A few blocks from the Inglewood cemetery
I lived through hard times, according to my memory
Then I learned to rhyme like I’m reading up the dictionary
I still walk to the Kelso Market
Even though I get to walk them red carpets
My family lived in my grandpa’s garage
So I started working just to help out my pops
It all started when my grandpa crossed over
Now one day I'mma be a crossover
Right now it’s just who is that girl?
But one day I'mma be all around the world
I still get grounded, always stay grounded
Still do chores even when I’m on tour
One thing’s for sure, I'mma always be me
That west side? Becky, Becky, Becky G

I won’t stop till I get to the top

I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Yo, what you know about the in and out lines?
And what you know about that 4×5 drive?
My life is changing quickly right before my eyes
It hits me every time that I’m on Hollywood and Vine
If you wanna date me, you gotta ask my Daddy
And my 30 uncles, you can meet them in an alley!
And one day I'mma bring home a Grammy
But no matter what I’ll be bringing home randies
Donuts, so what? Holler when you see me
I’m still the same B, even when I’m on TV
Still rocking Js with my diamonds and pearls
You can take me out the hood, but not the hood out of the girl
Yes I love sushi, love my calamari
But ain’t no better chef than my very own mommy
If you can’t catch me roaming in my barrio
I’m with my litas praying the Rosario
Inglewood, Inglewood, Inglewood

I won’t stop till I get to the top

And no one is in need.
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease,
No hungry mouths to feed.

Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace.
They're the songs of every man.

From a distance you look like my friend,
Even though we are at war.

What all this fighting is for.

It's the heart of every man.
It is the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves.

Becky Taylor,"When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
When I am still and wait here in the silence,
Until you come and sit awhile with me.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be.
There is no life, no life without its hunger,
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly,
But when you come and I am filled with wonder,
Sometimes, I feel like man's eternity.

I am strong, when I am on your shoulders

Can't you see it's written all over my face 
Why don't you get on your feet 
It's about time you got to think 
What ever happened to peace 
Well open your eyes and you'll see children laughing, 
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' ah...

Your always talkin' right and talkin' about 
The world and it's corruption and moral decay 
But what you gonna do about it, nothing, 
'Cause you're more like children then children while they play 
Why you're so clean through and through you won't shake hands 
With a negro who's maybe cleaner then you 
Well listen around and you'll hear children laughin', 
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' like they always do 
So what's wrong with you, ah... 

You're so blown up with anger about the world 
You write the songs about 
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name 
Now you want to go the the moon and live there 
When you know it'll only end up the same 
How can he give you any gratitude, 
With your endless sickenin' attitude 
You strive to get ahead 
But you leave each other dead 
Can't you see, children laughin', 
Voices singin', hearts beatin' like they always do 
So what's wrong with you, ah...

Bee Gees,"The sun shines down on a South Dakota morning
And I can see their faces in my eyes
I wish they were behind me
My enemy can find me
If only to remind me that, I'm really not alone
All the South Dakota mornings I have known
 
The eagle flies on a South Dakota morning
And I don't see my eagle anymore
Now stranger, I must kill you
You must survive, but will you
I may just beat you down, but will it even up the score
I think I saw the eagle just once more
 
The rain comes down on a South Dakota morning
And I can't see the sadness in my town 
So let it be my pillow, for underneath your willow 
Want to go back to you though your nothing but a town 
On the South Dakota grass I lay me down",South Dakota Morning

Am I wise

There's gonna be some confusion 
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes and you'll look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play

Maybe I got it wrong

I was hungry and I was cold , had a father far too old 
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be
In a tree trunk in the park , he was living in the dark 
Keeping other dogs like him for company
 
In the evening I'd go down to a nightclub in the town 
Try to get some bread to make another way
Back to the park I'd go , dig him out of the snow
You know he's lived a thousand years day to day
 
Well , the days get shorter and the nights get longer
And you never learn to know
If you love one another , could you look at each other
Could it ever really show
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind
Now could you ever understand
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on 
Will I be the one you run to in the end 
And all my dogs need a friend
 
It was a quarter to three in the summer of '73
When I heard somebody call outside my door
Said ""Are you friend or are you foe"" 
He looked up and he said ""no, but I'd like to come inside and know you more"" 
 
Well the days get shorter and the nights get longer

So much pain in love
And so alone inside.
I never thought
That I'd believe in love so much.
But darling when you came close to me,
Suddenly, suddenly

You will never know 
What you have done, my love.

Close to me.

And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there

Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,

Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
""Can I take you out to the pictures,
Joa, oa, oa, oan?""

But as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again.
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene,

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be
So, o, o, o""

But when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.

Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures.

Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o.

But as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise comes from behind.

Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

Takes him out to look at the queen

Bee Gees,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

Swimming in a fish bowl

Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears

When your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves  you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way

What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm

Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves  you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out

I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die

I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves  you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way

And darling till the day I die (baby never stop believing)

You and I, I 

Suddenly, all the world gets in the way 
You disappear into the crowd 
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came 
But I still call your name out loud 
I want to know you , but I never met you 
Reality can be cruel 
If a wandering soul meets another 
They shouldn't be separated 
Better in love with your head on my shoulder 
But I'll never be satisfied 
And if I can't see you 

Life goes on for the lonely man 
When love goes wrong, only love knows why 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons 
You and I, I 

Living your life in someone else's heart 
A lover's dream that has no end 
There may be somebody you can base your world upon 
I'll never be the same again 
And there's a part of me here 
And there's a part of me with you 
But all of me loves you 
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me 
I'm so proud of 
All of my days I will be here for you 
And the love keeps running 
And if I can't hold you 

Life goes on for the lonely man 
And there's a million words for the one goodbye 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons 
You and I, I 

Life goes on for the lonely man 
And there's a million words for the one goodbye 
Life goes on for the lonely man

Bee Gees,"I know how I feel 
Lonely in the black of night 
There can be no love for me now 
Nobody listens when the words ain't right 
And you get into someone else 
It's hard for me to know 
Who's lovin' who 
And where do I stand 
What did I do it all for 
There's no one I could love more 
I did it for your heart alone 
All that I try to be growin' inside to me 
I can be strong if you're there 

And there is someone belonging to someone 
And I got no one belonging to me 
I live in a world where the face of an angel 
Is all that a fool can see 
You got the power to find me whenever I'm lost 
Where are you ? Who are we? 

I believe in time 
Can eat away a heart of stone 
And baby if I leave you too late 
It's just a feather and the bird has flown 
It's colder when the fire dies 
With all the trouble I'm in if I lose you too 

Then what is my life 
If I don't want to go through 
Anything without you 
Couldn't be life at all 
I could be lyin' on 
You are the only one 
We didn't make it by chance 
And there is someone 
Belonging to someone 
And I got no one belonging to me 
I'm caught in a world on 
The edge of tomorrow 
It's all that a fool can find 
I don't belong in the arms 
Of a love that is lost 
Nowhere to cry 
There must be something we 
Can say my love 
Something except goodbye 

And there is someone belonging to someone 
And I got no one belonging to me 

And there is someone belonging to someone 
And I got no one belonging to me",Someone Belonging to Someone

So little time
We do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You win again
Some never try
But if anybody can, we can
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me
You win again
So little time",You Win Again
Bee Gees,"It hurts me when you cry
When you feel the love is gone
Don't give up on us
When you got so much to believe in
And I beg you please stay
Strangers in the night
A flame that never dies
In a world of lonely faces
You need someone to survive
A heart like yours
Should never live alone

[Chorus:]
Let me be your bodyguard
I can be useful to you
We can just get excited
Stop before we go too far
Let me be your bodyguard
Living in my protection
We can just get ignited
Lost inside
It's only you and me

There's things you shouldn't do
You lose your self control
Should the eyes of a perfect stranger
Take you down to a new sensation
Just turn back to me
Don't wait till its gone
Don't go where you don't belong
In this world of pain and sorrow
Every wish is your command
A heart like yours
Should always find a home

I know the signs and I'm telling you
You're living on borrowed time
But a heart needs love
Like a flower needs rain
Like I'm making you mine

Let me be your bodyguard
I can be useful to you
We can just get excited
Stop before we go too far, my love, my life
Let me be your bodyguard
Living in my protection
We can just get ignited
What we had never known all our lives
I pray its not too late
I would die by your side my love
I'm the life that you save
In this world of pain and sorrow
Every wish is your command
A heart like yours should never live alone

I used to dream of a special one
And now I feel it coming true
But I could'nt let go, I'm a jealous guy
What you're putting me through
I'm begging you

Let me be your bodyguard
I can be useful to you
We can just get excited
Stop before we go too far my love, my life

Lovers in ancient time, caught in the fire
Only the strong survive -- how can we face tomorrow

 Go now, girl, don't look back. This is your one big chance.
 I place my fingers to your lips and I tell you my love flies with you
 On a wing and a prayer, on a wing and a prayer

No muscle and bone -- rhythm is the key
There's everything to play for -- you're everything to me
The game of life -- win it and your love comes tumbling down
You'll never be alone

As oceans are far apart 
 
A summer song 
Keeps playing in my brain, 
And I feel you 
And I see your face again 
There's no escape, 
I lost everything 
In losing you 
 
Ah I wish you were here, 
Drying these tears I cry 
They were good times 
And I wish you were here 
And calling my name, 
But you're dealing with a man insane
The cost how hopelessly I'm lost, 
I tried to throw our love away 
And I can't let go 
 
And so I awake 
In somebody else's dream (it's not what it seems) 
It's only a lie, 
I've yet to decide who's real 
 
The blood red rose will never never die, 
It'll burn like a flame 
In the dark of the night 
I'm not afraid, 
I'd give everything 
If you hear me there 
 
Ah I wish you were here, 
Drying these tears I cry 
They were good times, 
It's that time of year 
For being alone 
'Cause you're dealing with a heart of stone, 
Try to kiss and say goodbye, 
Try to throw our love away 
And that storm will blow

When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow

But I was never told about the sorrow
How can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?

What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart

And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by

We could never see tomorrow
But no one said a word about the sorrow
How can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down

How can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round

And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart

When the sun first strikes the trees
All the morning birds are sing above
Still bring back memories
Of a girl who stood beside me
When the rights I did were wrong
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong

But the letter say goodbye
Now my mornings are for wondering
And my nights to reason why 
Why the stranger comes to steal the love
Of a girl I had hold
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong

Bee Gees,"There's a law in what we do
We got a quest for something new
Everything you witness seems to
Let you down
If someone gets you from behind
I got an open mind
And you've been thirsty for the friend you found

Close your eyes and make a wish
I don't wanna mess with mother nature
Knowing that you're mine
You said I could see
You with another and we all get satisfied

[Chorus:]
It's a form of evolution
It's a kind of movin' on
An eternal source of pleasure
In being the one
When your love is for the giving
It's a case of destiny
You know we look for the same insane games
Got to be commital to be a little deviation

So I get all wound up inside
I can see your scene unwind
You dance together or you dance alone
And leave the real world in the air
Love it in leather I don't care
Everything is legal in the danger zone

Close your eyes and make a wish
Later we could cater to the animal
Knowing that you're mine
It's straight in my face
You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed

It's a form of evolution
It's a kind of movin' on
It's a cycle of emotion
In being the one
In the storm of revolution
What is done can be undone
You know we look for the same insane games
Got to be committal
To the subtle variations

It's a form of evolution
It's a kind of movin' on
It's a cycle of emotion
In being the one
If your love is for the givin'
It's a case of destiny
And you can find your source of pleasure
In being with me

When it leaves I get my hands on you

I fool myself if I turn any other way
I still keep searchin' for that girl of mine

Hiding in the shadows of the night, 
Holding you and knowing the wrong is right.

I shield you from the rain. 
I've been slow to get you but I'm working as hard as I can. 

This time, it's what we believe is true. 
And whether you believe I'm in love with you 
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean. 

Is it only a dream to a teenage queen? 
And all the years of tears and laughter 
We could go through, 
Will it be happy ever after 
For me and you? Ooh. Ah. 

Heaven is a place inside of me 
Living with your heart as company. 
Only you can change the way I feel 
And make it feel good. 

Where there is love there is no crime. 
I'm only trying to get mine. 
Let me be the one to dry your eyes. 
We can be the promise that never dies. 

Light of an angel, 
Blinded by the vision I'm wishing we could travel on. 
Stay with me, baby, 
Any less than an hour you be leaving me lonely too long.

And whether you believe I'm in love with you. 
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean.

Made myself invisible

Needing me forever
I don't believe the words are true
That only she could be my savior

Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love

And she's all alone with me
Every night
And lighting all my days of sorrow
On my own
If there was any more to give
You know I'd sacrifice it for her

And in the prime of my life
I was blessed and I was sent
Someone sweet and innocent
And nervous when she kissed
And in the face of my
Forbidden fruit forever
Miracles are mine
And knowing I'm the first
In her secret universe
There's no sense of space and time

You take a small town, young girl
Someone warm and wonderful
That any man would understand
That love is like the wind
Something deep inside to give you
And when the words get in the way
The only thing you need is silence

Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love","How to Fall in Love, Pt. 1"
Bee Gees,"Never more aware of what you do. 
I got you leaving me and missing you 
And me believing that you've never done right 
When you've never done wrong. 
  
You been coming to me late at night. 
It's not the eye alone that gives you sight. 
I've never given anybody my soul, 
But I'm coming undone. 
  
I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low, 
But I'm not ready to die.

I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.

Watch them hold you. 
Count their faces, 
A never-ending line. 
  
But they're only 
Imitations, 
Existing out of time. 
  
So now you're telling me it's just a ring. 
You say it's nothing but it's everything. 
I'm under pressure and I'm under 
Your gun and I'm fingers and thumbs. 
  
You got the questions and the answers I know. 
I'm being buried alive. 
  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh. 
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh. 
Just give me the kiss of life. 
  
I can't stay here 
Lost without you. 
Strangers in the dark.

Bee Gees,"I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man I had a master plan
But I was alone

I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone

Always end up alone, always end up alone
So I'll play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time

Living love between the line
We came (sha la) so close (so far)
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine, and I don't want to be alone

Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone

I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone

And is there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la
And I pray it's not too late
We came (sha la) so far (so far)
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine
And I don't want to be alone

And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told

So I'll play I'll wait
And I'll pray it's not too late
We can so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone

Building castles in the shifting sands

She'll suck you dry, but look at how much I drip. 
At the point of ecstasy I write a symphony 
Of poetry in motion, and leaving me there to die. 

I tell myself let no one take her place. 
To confide in someone and look at how much I paid. 
I want you next to me, call it telepathy. 
We drifted into vision and look how much we see. 

I just want to get closer than close to you. 
I know that one way or the other 
Any test of my faith will do.

But I just want to get closer than close to you. 
Baby, I just want to get closer than close to you. 

Your soul is naked, it tells you what it wants.

Thieves in the dark, you ought to be locked in chains 
but you wind up on my side, and what will be will be. 

That you wear a disguise, the epitome of deceit. 
The face of a friend invisible on the street.

I can't look
I can't say no more about it

Just as long as the river flows

He will be your king but someday
He may let you down

I believe I may be losing you

Who can justify the truth?

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know

Just remember when we lie to each other

Bee Gees,"Say you never send me away. 
Making me a memory and 
Telling me to find me a life 
Change, there's no changing, 
What cannot be changed. 
And you are witness to a silent conversation. 
  
Nothing but the black of night. 
No-one ever takes your place. 
Gotta let the pantomime play. 
Not to worry, my telepathy. 
I bring you into me ,there's be no separation. 
  
And I tell you 
I will climb inside your world, 
And at the dawn of history 
I was born to find this girl (ah). 
  
And I can see you with my eyes closed. 
I can feel you when you're near me. 
Just the knowing that you 
Hear me, could be, 
You could measure my love. 
  
I can touch you with my hands tied (words of love). 
It don't take no extra feeling (you won't believe). 
Let your imagination, just run (take a hand). 
You can measure my love. 
  
And they tell you 
They can stop those tears you cry. 
And we can ride that storm together, 
And all the love that lasts forever, 
And forever and forever. 
  
Cling to the vine and the vine never breaks. 
It's a message from a ship to shore. 
For the soul and the sacrifice, 
Pain. 
There's no fury like a woman scorned. 
We could be victims of a lethal combination. 

It's the hour. 
It's the sword that hides the stone. 
And one of us holds the power 
There to forge our hearts together, 
Here forever and forever. 
  
And I can feel you with my eyes closed (words of love). 
I can feel you when you're near me (where you are). 
Just the knowing that you hear me, could be, (I'll survive), 
You could measure my love. 
  
I can touch you with my hands tied (words of love).

Baby I know
It Gets you through the night
And love is like a red rose baby and so
It's coming around again
If we can take the same direction we'll find
The road that never ends
But love never dies
It goes on forever love never dies
Love never dies it goes on forever

This is the love you've been talking about
You led her in till she couldn't get out
You made the little girl cry
No sad stories to deny

I go through holy war for you baby you know
You say you ain't got a prayer
I'll answer if you call for me
Baby I'm yours
To God above I swear
I only wanna live in the shadow you make
The soul never lies
But love never dies it goes on forever
Love never dies, love never dies
It goes on forever

You better run to the heart of the flame
She don't change like the sun in the rain
She don't understand why
You made the little girl cry

Love never dies, it goes on forever love never dies
Love never dies it goes on forever

this is the love you've been talking about
You led her in till she couldn't get out
You made the little girl cry
No sad stories to deny
You better run to the heart of the flame

I lose the love that has always freed me
Not knowing angel , what's coming after
Never hearing you're golden laughter

Nowhere to run, I cry

Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain
I was losing you before I ever held you tight
Before you ever hold me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do

I've got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high
Above the rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need
It's the only show
And it's you on an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere
Are the tears of yesterday
We killed the pain
We blew away the memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Take me out of the cold, give me what I've waited for
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more
I was yours before the stars were born
And you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try

Bee Gees,"He'd sing his song most every night
Wishing she was there behind the light.
The people danced and sang along
On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong.
And the piper played the tune.
And the drummer wore his spurs.
But the song that the singer sang was for her.

Now the singer's song is never heard.
And the visions he once saw are disappeared.
Now they never dance or sing along.
But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong.
And the piper played the tune.
And the drummer wore his spurs.
But the song that the singer sang was for her.",The Singer Sang the Song

In the prime of my life I'll remember you 
Livin' and breathin' and some misbelievin' 
But I can't hold you women, no piece of you

Searching for romance and showing affection 
I guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark

Bee Gees,"Must be a thousand million times I've seen your face in laughter
And ev'ry time meant something new to me
But being broke and living low
I sensed what you were after
And time has said 'get out before you bleed'

Oh , with every second glance, you killed my pride
And ev'ry second tear
You held my life in your hands
And you never knew of all the things you could do
If you wanted to

Too many looks in your eyes, breaking my heart
And I don't want to start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And it's easy to see, you're thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Too many looks in your eyes

I've often thought of things I'd do if I had money
But money's always been my dream to me
But ev'ry time I saw that face, those riches never mattered
To have you close was wealth enough for me

Imagination stopped , where life began
And I had always felt a little lost in your love with no way through
But you could pull me through if you wanted to

Too many looks in your eyes, breaking my heart
And I don't wanna start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And it's easy to see, you're thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Too many looks in your eyes

With every second glance, you killed my pride
And ev'ry second tear, you held my life in your hands
And you never knew of all the things you could do

And I don't wanna start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And it's easy to see, you're thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Ah yeah

Too many looks in your eyes, breaking my heart
And I don't wanna start fighting with words that somebody heard

Bee Gees,"Words and music make a song for our hearts to sing along
Like a choir within the air, there'll be music ev'rywhere
A bitter tear across your cheek
A smile from you is all I need
We'll give them cause to breathe the air
There'll be lovers ev'rywhere

I'll be your singer and your song
for all the love you've brought along
I'll be your day , I'll be your night
I'll see that ev'rything's all right
I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then ev'ryone will know that we're in love
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And when the morning brings it's light
And Mister Moonlight says goodbye
My hand is shaking when you smile
You make me feel just like a child
My mind is searching for a way
so that you won't have to say
You've got to go and can't come back
But I can't think you'd make me sad

I'll be your singer and your song
for all the love you've brought along
I'll be your day , I'll be your night
I'll see that ev'rything's all right
I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then ev'ryone will know that we're in love

(Take away the pain in me)
I'll be your singer and your song

(Soon you'll see a change in me)
for all the love you've brought along

(What's the point of going on)
I'll be your day, I'll be your night

(The story ends, the feelings gone)
I'll see that ev'rything's all right
I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then ev'ryone will know that we're in love

(The story ends, the feelings gone)
I'll see that ev'rything's all right

Bee Gees,"Wine and women and song will only make me sad
Love and kisses and hugs, the things I never had

If this should end, I will find

What shall I do?

Cars and buses and trams make a lot of noise
All my women have gone out with other boys

I feel you touch me in the pouring rain

I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze

Run to me if you need a shoulder

So darling, you run to me.

And when you're out in the cold,
No one beside you, and no one to hold,
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

And when you've got nothing to lose,
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose,
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me

Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?

But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love

Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frost the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

And the children say he could laugh and play

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Oh, Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there, all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""stop""

Hey, Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin', ""don't you cry
I'll be back again someday""

And mail it right away

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Beegie Adair,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

I could live without love

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Your back's been broken you can't make the rounds the tables are turned as the litany goes...
You're a rotten old man who'll be covered in dirt on your knees
And pray to the maker that caused you to bleed

Turn back the hand on the clock
You're a bitter old man who's done nothing
But work your hands to the bone on the assembly lines
You've grown cold to the touch of the ones that you love
Ignorance is something you can't over come but you've passed it on down
And that's something much worse for a bitter young man...
Is now taking the torch

Silent scorn - you've taken it out on the ones you adore Inside rage
They've left you before but they'll come back again
They'll pray for you with all their love
But this time your indifference just can't be excused Forced amends

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance.
