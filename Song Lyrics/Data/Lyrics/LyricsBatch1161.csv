She & Him,"You keep trying to forget about the good times
Does it make you fall a little better?
I’m not alone, I only pick the flowers
Kind of makes you feel a little worthier
But the chillin' turn out fine
I got the pieces if you got the time

And I want you, I don’t wanna forget
If you go I’ll surely get distracted
And I want you, I don’t wanna forget
If you go I’ll surely get distracted
And I want you, somebody sweet to talk to,
Somebody sweet to talk to

I don’t wanna get stuck in my ways again,
I’m just asking you to stay a couple hours
I gotten back to the road where I started
Looking instead of always picking flowers
Plus the children who turned out fine,
I’ve got the pieces if you got the time

And I want you, I don’t wanna forget
If you go I’ll surely get distracted
And I want you, I don’t wanna forget
If you go I’ll surely get distracted
And I want you, somebody sweet to talk to,
Somebody sweet to talk to, somebody sweet to talk to

And I want you, I don’t wanna forget
If you go I’ll surely get distracted
And I want you, somebody sweet to talk to
And I want you, somebody sweet to talk to
Somebody sweet to talk to
Somebody sweet to talk to
Somebody sweet to talk to
Somebody sweet to talk to
Somebody sweet to talk to
Somebody sweet
Somebody sweet",Somebody Sweet to Talk To
She & Him,"You seem to be having fun,
Raising your glass to no one, no one
What’s a girl to do when something’s haunting you again?
When something’s haunting you.

You always love a race,
Placing your bets on no one, no one
What am I to do when something’s haunting you again?
When something’s haunting you

Your love is a blessed curse,
Actually that gets worse, supernaturally

The steps on the hall just hopped,
Seem to be going nowhere, nowhere,
What’s a girl to do when something’s haunting you again?
When something’s haunting you again
When something’s haunting you again
When something’s haunting you",Something's Haunting You
She & Him,"I know a girl from a lonely street,
Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet,
Dry your eyes, Sunday girl.

Hey, I saw your girl with a different girl,
Looks like he’s in another world,
Running hot, Sunday girl.

Hurry up, hurry up and wait,
I stay awake all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me.

She can’t catch up with the working grind
The weekend lude and she’s feeling bright
Living dream, Sunday girl.

Baby, I would like to go out tonight,
If I go with you, my folks will get uptight,
Stay at home, Sunday girl.

Hurry up, hurry up and wait,
I stay awake all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me.

Hey, j’ai vu ton mec
Avec une autre fille
Il semblais dans un autre monde
Go caucher, Sunday girl.

Quand je t’ai revue
L’était, j’ai décidé
C’est ton t’apparait
Je peux retrait, Sunday girl.

Dépêche toi, dépêche toi, j’attend
Tout c’est mareleuxement like peut’en j’attend
J’ai les couffeur, je t’ai previen voire
C’est un je meure et peuvant peux moi.

She & Him,"I won’t hold it against you,
Never hold it against you someone else’s heart
And I am not holding back now,
Just give you some slack now,
And I’ll becoming around

And I like you, but you think too much,
And I don’t wanna be your mother
And you could just lay down
And just lay down

And we’ll all go through it together
But we all go at it alone
Yes, we all go through it together
And we all go at it alone

And I, I don’t wanna offend you,
I know that I sense you
Of someone else’s heart

And I have a slimmer of love now
I won’t push and shove now,
I hope you’ll come around

And I like you, but you think too much,
And I don’t wanna be your mother
And you could just lay down
And just lay down

And we’ll all go through it together
And we all go at it alone
Yes, we all go through it together
But we all go at it alone

And we’ll all go through it together

She & Him,"I took a picture, your form was cloudy in the night
You wrote a letter, you said you try to shed some light
On the good and the wicked things we do.

Face my direction, I wanna see you better, dear.
You’re a distraction from everything that I feel
And the good and the wicked things I do.

Sometimes, oh, sometimes,
I think I could fade away.
In the light, oh, the light
Of an ever sunny day.
But I’m stronger than the picture that you took before you left
In the light, it faded to white.
In the light, the colors turn to white.

Indian summer, I caught a glimpse of things to come
Racing to finish, I never think before I run
To the good and the wicked things you do.

Sometimes, oh, sometimes,
I think I could fade away.
In the light, oh, the light
Of an ever sunny day.
But I’m stronger than the picture that you took before you left
In the light, it faded to white.
In the light, the colors turn to white.

In light it faded to white.
In the light the colors turn to white.
In light it faded to white.
In the light the colors turn to white.
In light it faded to white, ooo ooo ooo.",Turn to White
She & Him,"Each time I hold somebody new
My arms grow cold aching for you
No one can take your place
Darling, in my embrace, I'll never be free

And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss puts out the fire
Though I may try and try, no one can satisfy
This longing in me

I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh?

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you, made me
A slave to you, I'll never be free

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you, made me
A slave to you, I'll never, no, 
I'll never be free",I'll Never Be Free
She & Him,"Whenever its early twilight
I watch 'til a star breaks through
Funny, its not a star I see
It's always you

Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, its not a rose I touch
It's always you

If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are, you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you

If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are, you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you",It's Always You
She & Him,"It's not for me to say, you love me
It's not for me to say, you'll always care
Oh.. but here for the moment
I can hold you fast
And press your lips to mine
And dream that love will last

As far as I can see, This is heaven
And speaking just for me, It's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow
With every passing day
Or we may never meet again
But then it's not for me to say

She & Him,"When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all, I had faith in you
I just kept on saying

Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to what she said
I just kept on saying

Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys

You and I, we got a special thing
We go together just like summer and spring
They're all jealous of the love you bring
And I'm gonna keep on saying

Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby

Oh no, not my baby
Not my babe

She & Him,"She may be the face I can't forget
The trace of pleasure or regret
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay
She may be the song the summer sings
May be the chill the autumn brings
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day

She may be the beauty or the beast
May be the famine or the feast
May turn each day into a heaven or a hell
She may be the mirror of my dreams
The smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem inside her shell

She who always seems so happy in a crowd
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
No one's allowed to see them when they cry
She may be the love that cannot hope to last
May come to me from shadows of the past
But I'll remember till the day I die

She may be the reason I survive
The why and wherefore I'm alive
The one I'll care for through the rough in many years
Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I've got to be
The meaning of my life is she
She
She",She
She & Him,"We lived our little drama
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night

I can't forget the glamor
Your eyes held a tender light
While stars fell on Alabama

I never planned in my imagination

She & Him,"Lyin' in my bed I hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion
Is nothing new
Flashback warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time

Has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time

I read your secrets and didn't sleep
They say you'll never let me see your face

And dream sleep maybe

Paying half attention as you're pointing the way

It's cold outside and there's no place else I can go 
And it feels so right
Why can't I just spend the night? 
We'll keep our clothes on and we'll leave on the lights
Only if you like

Anticipation taking hold and second thoughts will never get you the cure
Though it had occurred to me that this might go bad
The obsession got me stuck to the plan
I ran up the steps as my heart pumped fast
Then I knocked perhaps a bit too light
And she opened up the door wearing only her coat
And the smile that said ""this better be worth it""

She Wants Revenge,"Got a big plan, this mindset maybe it's right
At the right place and right time, maybe tonight
And the whisper or handshake sending a sign
Wanna make out and kiss hard, wait never mind

Late night, and passing, mention it flipped her
Best friend, its no thing maybe it slipped
But the slip turns to terror and a crush to light
When she walked in, he froze up, believe it's the fright

It's cute in a way, till you cannot speak
And you leave to have a cigarette, your knees get weak
An escape is just a nod and a casual wave
Obsessed about it, heavy for the next two days

It's only just a crush, it'll go away
It's just like all the others it'll go away
Or maybe this is danger and he just don't know
You pray it all away but it continues to grow

I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right

I want to hold you close
Soft breasts, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart

Then he walked up and told her, thinking that he'd passed
And they talked and looked away a lot, doing the dance
Her hand brushed up against his, she left it there
Told him how she felt and then they locked in a stare

They took a step back, thought about it, what should they do
'Cause there's always repercussions when you're dating in school
But their lips met, and reservations started to pass
Whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last

Either way he wanted her and this was bad
Wanted to do things to her it was making him crazy
Now a little crush turned into a like
And now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her

I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, and close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right

I want to hold you close
Soft breasts, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart

I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, and close your eyes girl

And smack me in the mouth , my love

From hunger you call and it falls upon the ears of faith
A half open mouth and the whole truth that no one would take
Pretend all you want you can cry to your hearts own beat
We will take love and swear upon the things that we just can't keep

But then she noticed me glance at her
I had no choice but to dance with her.

Does a hair flip

If the record keeps spinning then so will I

Tells me don't stop dancing and she's pulling me near

He had the whisper of lust
He said 'no touching tonight'

She said 'tuck me in'
He knew his judgment was sound
Still he pulled back the sheets
And said

You better lie down 'cause the angels are watching

'you can hurt me do whatever you like'

In a dark room,
With our secrets,
Thinking no one sees
But still they always know.
Whisper to me softly, ""I'm yours""

Until we know it's time to leave.
Act as if this is forever,
Assume the roles we could never be.
Cause all these friends of mine would like to think that they've found the one.
But tell me that with us it's different, tell me that we've just begun.

Someone's going home alone again tonight.
A quiet drive back to a cold house down the road.
With nobody left to right,
And no one to hold you tight.
Someone's going home alone again tonight.",It's Just Begun
She Wants Revenge,"Cast shadows through the days
And swing the night and come with me.
There's nothing to believe in here
So just believe in me.
Your sense of apprehension suits you,

You wear troubles well.
I've nothing left to hide from you,
I've got no God to sell.
Just put your hand in mine,
Then cast your doubts aside.

[Chorus]
We can hide away for days,
Pretend the world has ended.
No more drama, no more pain.
Pretend the world has ended.
We can run away tonight,
Pretend the world has ended.
No matter what they say we'll work out fine,
Cause you and I know this is heaven.

Your hair is damp from the rain,
Hungry eyes that look like lust.
The ghosts of lost loves follow you,
You feel but you can't trust.
Time disappears inside you,

'Till there's nothing left but us.
We wave goodbye to everyone,
And hope our love's enough.
Just put your hand in mine,
Then cast your doubts aside.

She Wants Revenge,"There's a poem that she wrote and hid under the mattress,
And if you find it please leave it alone.
With a picture she took of a girl on the subway,
With orange barrettes and the saddest face she's ever known.

As Rachael starts to wonder was it hers to begin with,
Or was the memory from someone else's sleep.
Cause there's a hole in her heart that still harbors a question,
Whose answer just might break it so she's hanging on.
At least it's her to keep.
So I asked her

""What if this does not belong to you,
And all these things you thought were true
Turned out to just be someone else's lies.""
Baby this does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you.

There's a fleck in her eye that no one ever noticed,
A pretty birthmark for such a beautiful face.
All the men from her past seem to have left her abandoned,
I guess there's some things that you can never erase.

I've seen her play with her hair in a moment of tension,
I've seen her with her guard down ready to cry.
But there's a whole in her heart that still harbors the question,
Whose answer just might break it, still she's hanging on,
Cause no one wants to die.
Then she asked me

""What if this does not belong to you,
And all the things you thought were true
Turned out to just be someone else's lies.""
Baby this does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you.

""What if this does not belong to you,
And all the things you thought were true
Turned out to just be someone else's lies.""
Cause baby this does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you.",Rachael
She Wants Revenge,"Oh my lover look what you've done,
You've gone and took your love away.
It seemed to me the only way out was run,
Despite you're trying to beg me to stay.

It started as an honest attraction,
Began under the guise of a flirt.
Till you were screaming at the edge of the bed
""Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!""

[Chorus]
You said
""Come back baby, please don't go,
Come back baby, please don't go,
Come back baby, please don't go,
Come back baby, you hurt me so.""
Wake me on the other side,
You can hold your breath,
I'll be dreaming she's easy.
We can always say we tried,
If we both come clean, maybe then you can please me.
Wake me on the other side,
You can hold your breath
As the thought of her drags her down.
She cries like a baby
And she only learned to dream in sound.

Oh my lover the clock runs slow
Ever since the day you went away.
And though I've tried a hundred ways to forget you,
Still the emptiness is always the same.

No matter who is lying beside me
All it does is make me wish it were you.
And if I close my eyes tight I can almost pretend,
And for a moment it's as if it were true.
You said

[Chorus]

You can't pin it all on me,
The blame is mine to bear.
With all the things I've done to you,
We're far beyond repair.

But still sometimes I think of us,
And how things fell apart.
And how you knew from the first kiss
That I would break your hears.

[Chorus: x 2]",Replacement
She Wants Revenge,"She buys a new dress for the party,
She always looks good in red.
Turns around in front of the mirror
And disappears inside of her head.

She wonders if he'll even remember,
She asked him in a casual way.
Just in case he didn't want to go with her,
In that event she knew just what she would say.

She thought of maybe asking a girlfriend,
Even though she only has one or two.
She's always done much better with boys anyway,
So who needs girlfriends?

Pacing nervous across the floor of her bedroom,
Gripping tight the phone in her hand.
Fighting beck the rush of emotions,
And dreaming of just having a man.

[Chorus]
It's a long walk, and the music is loud.
She sees an old friend,
As she walks through the crowd.
Puts on her best smile,
But underneath she's a broken girl.
But It's a long walk, and the music is loud.
She sees an old friend,
As she walks through the crowd.
Puts on her best smile,
But she will always be a broken girl.

She struggles with an awful decision,
Stay at home or walk in alone.
Her mother does her best to console her,
Her father doesn't know what to say.

Puts on her makeup, puts on the new dress.
Holds her head high, then gets in the car.
Tells herself that no one will notice,
Assuming she can make it that far.

On the way she imagines reactions.
Cupped hands whispering into ears.
Secretly hoping that he'll be there watching,
And she's also hoping he won't.

Walking tentative alone up the driveway,
Sees some people smoking off to the side.
She stops and waits until they go back in,
Crosses her fingers and follows behind.

[Chorus]

He'll never get you,
He will never understand.
He'll never get you, you can find a better man.

Never making connections
Keep your story straight
If they question you,
Try to separate the feeling
From the truth.

You're pulled in many directions,
It's never a gamble.
Low risk low reward
Love is all you need.
But did you think that
You could walk away so clean?

Yet you're staring at another
Strange ceiling again,
Though you swore
You'd stay home and read,
Wondering when it is alright to leave,
So you just get dressed.

The sun rears its head,

No long talks and
No breakdowns in the way.
But isn't that what makes it worthwhile anyway?
Now you're pressed against somebody
Who you don't even like,

Though they're cute
And they'll pass the time,
Kissing around their neck
And not their mouth,
So they don't look in your eyes.
You lie down exhausted

And riddled with doubt,
Then wait 'til they're sleeping
And sneak towards the door,
Careful not to make noise
Across the creaky wood floors...

They're not as cold as yours.

Before we went to bed,
No I never could be the one for you.

Because your feelings never got in the way

I know that you never cared at all,
Maybe just one more dance
Cause that's as close as you're gettin' to a true romance

Tell me you don't feel the same.
I dig down deep for forgiveness,
And still you're busy placing the blame.

She says she told her we broke up

Why am I the last to know my fate?
I take a deep breath and call her
I can no longer wait
But it goes straight to message
And I'm deep in the zone
'Cause its 12:45 and you said you were home

I don't know why you'd hide from me

And so I take all my past attractions
And project on you.

Some resentment from a one-night heartbreak.

My hands go damp,
But still I force an introduction

And I ask you to dance.

Though we've just met tonight .

Drawing circles with your fingernails across my back.

I turn you over and look in your eyes,
Promise you that this is forever
Or till one of us dies.
You taste like tear stains

And could have beens,
But I love a good train wreck.
Your hair balled up inside my fist,
You tell me don't get too attatched
Like this is just entertainment.

Shearwater,"Hurts so bad that you know it's not sinning. 
The funny thing is it's just beginning to feel good. 
And downstairs all your friends are waiting, 
They're talking low and filling their stories with angels, 

And they imagine intervening in true crime photos and placing meaning within them 
From blue to red to black-and-white. 
Don't look too long, you'll be up all night among them, the sudden dead. 
The last thing he said was,

""You should have been here before the camera arrived, 
Maybe I wouldn't have to die. But just live out this long life jangling, 
And as old men you could watch my hand dangling, cold and white."" 

Baby, don't worry tonight; I know it's too ugly to hold yourself upright. 
So fill a clean glass, cold and smooth. Take the reds, then take the blues. 
Away, you can hear a voice that's singing, 

""angels could come but you wouldn't believe them, 
And those that believe still can't see them anyway."" 
And The Suicide slides out of his skin and he climbs inside of the bed 
You're in and touches your face. 

He says ""what right had I to die when all these little cells just tried to keep me alive? 
What right had I to leave the human race behind? 
Do you really think you're better, with your shotgun and your suicide letter? 
Do you think you're right? 

Well baby, don't worry tonight, I know it's too ugly to hold yourself upright.

SHeDAISY,"She stares all night at the plaster peeling
Off of the shadows she painted on the ceiling
Trying to find some philosophical meaning
To life
But the truth is Ruth is ready to hatch
She's gotta break the door down,
Gotta bust a latch
She's gotta super-sized itch
That's gotta be scratched, alright

She stands up and gets down
And digs her heels out of that
Pea-pickin' town

Hey, hey, hey, hey - yeah, what a waste
There's more to life than just takin' up space
Hey, hey, hey, hey - this is supposed to be fun
5 4 3 2 ready run

So she sold her diamond ring
And bought a Winnebago
Found her way to Heaven on the
Way to San Diego
Chased her ruby red boots anywhere
That they'd go, anytime
She got sidetracked and backpacked
Her way to Atlanta
Picked a pocketful of posies, got
Here busted in 'Bama
Truck stop trollop, selling roses
From a van for a dime
She woke up and broke down
Collect call to that pea-pickin' town

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Run, run, run, run all the way back home
Run away from the great unknown
It felt good for a minute, 'til she got
Stuck in it
Stuck in it

Her yellow brick road crashed
Right through the rose-colored glass

You're gonna break it clean

Nobody else can feel this wrong
And in one moment I am light
Another dead as night
I should have known I'd never own

Too deep into the passage
Of love so overgrown
And now forever I'm cast
As heavy as sinking stone
I can't rise when I want to rise
In this bed I sleep with ghosts

Nobody else can make me right
Nobody else can feel this wrong
And in one moment I am light
Another dead as night

In his golden years
His hair of black now quickly fades to gray
The limp as he walks is his only souvenir
From those purple-hearted war time days

But you don't hear him complain
No matter how the fall
I don't have a lot, he'd smile and say
But lord I have it all

He's a hero
In my mother's eyes
He taught her how to raise me right
And never compromise
He always says he has the
Finer things in life
Somewhere to live, someone to love
And the Good book to live by

Some say his heart is big
All though his fortune's small
I don't have a lot, he'd smile and say
But lord I have it all

A rembrandt in his own right
A master at his craft
Creating something beautiful
A memory that will last
And always last

He's the constant
In our family
Beginning this long line of love
We've cared
And even when he's gone he'll watch over me
When I close my eyes at night I feel him there

Wear my name, well my child
Be true and stand tall

I won't be the prize you flaunt
And I won't be your Martha Stewart, baby
Or your all-night restaurant

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will  but

I won't be your crutch to lean on
I won't wear stiletto heels
I won't walk a mile in your shoes
Just so I know how it feels

I won't be your obligation
I won't be your Barbie doll
I won't be the portrait of perfection
To adorn you wall

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will  but

Hey, you know, you know I will
All right

I won't be your lifetime girlfriend
I won't be just one of the guys
I won't be your mama's favorite
I refuse to be the last in line

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will  but

Yeah, I will, I will, I will be your everything
I will, I will be the whole shebang
I will, I will be your everything
I will, I will, I will, I will, yeah

Yo it'll revolve, when I'm mad he's cool
Knife game like Daddy cool's, since Valley Shoes
This is real life street shit, truest and the deepest
Known niggaz that go to jail just to get they teeth fixed
Think I give a fuck what you heard em say?
When I got the nigga that you trying to be watching my wordplay
Now everybody want to be 'Pac
Till they ass really get popped and they die on the third day
The Des'why got a beautiful ring
I can hit any one of why'all, options a beautiful thing
Body is finished, maybe then can save the tooth
Call me Kiss or call me the Black Babe Ruth
That many hits, fuck that, that mean he bricks
D-Block that many niggaz' gats to your lips
My dope is two toned, but I had to change my spot
Cause it turned into a drug free school zone (let's go)

Yo, I don't give a fuck about pull out cockbacks
Spin a muhfucker out, empty his chest
Leave your muhfucking whip a mess
All over the dashboard, in backseat pieces of flesh
Send niggaz to the grave wit they face half gone
Stomach ripped open, the beef back on
That nigga Sheek rude, I'll spit in your food
Tell the women in ya family to suck my dick
No respect, fuck that I'll murder you quick
Mad weapons in your trunk bitch take your pick
Stick a gernade up under your fender
Stick a pineapple bomb in ya blender, I don't care about you
You say fuck Sheek Louch? well fuck you too
Your father, your mother, the hole you came through
Niggaz don't learn till they're carasined out
Lighter to their face they'll spit gasonline out
You want me dead, I'm right here do it bitch
Make me bleed till I'm motherfucking fluidless
I ain't new at this and don't give a fuck about you
Sheek'll run up and smack the shit out you
I live this shit, it's never gon stop
Open niggaz face wit a octopus top
Face all ripped up, catch me on the block
Shells all loaded up, catch me wit the glock
Pussy muhfuckers don't want no beef
Trip niggaz down to their platinum teeth
Chase you in the house with the all black heat
Leave you just boxers and slippers on your feet
I talk reckless, I really want the coke and the money
But I'll settle for your necklace

Fuck being broke, I'm trying to cop a tan four
Trap you up like niggaz get pussy in The Sopranos
You really want beef? I'm busting the tech
I'll hit you up in the park while you're doing your sets
It's (Jadakiss: D-Block) (yeah yeah why'all!)
You can't get no streeter nigga
I'm nice wit the hands but I'm better wit the heater
Old school style stash haze in my sock
I'll bust at you and turn your Ac' Jeep to a drop
You niggaz talking like why'all can't get stuck up
I ain't an +Icon+ but why'all will still +Get Fucked Up+

[Verse - Styles P]
As we continue on, your hood you finish
Write a suicide note and get a window on
Nigga that's the type of shit we on
Redrum Redrum spin it back like a Missy song
Take a cold heart to twist your mom
But it's wintertime, shotty under the snorkle
Will flip when it's dinner time
+Strange Days+ without +Angela Bassett+
Middle of the hood niggaz handling plastic
Gotta watch ya head and not get popped with lead
And watch ya bread, not get popped by Feds
Anywhere we gon be in the hood
Wit the burners and the hawks nigga being the hood (watup!)

And I'ma be there for you from now on, you know what I mean

And I'm not afraid to say it, I love you, I love you, I love her, fuck it, I love her.

Haha
Uh huh

Ha, I ain't afraid to say it, uh uh, I'ma thug, (How I love you)
More than that, I'ma man, ya know what I mean (How I love you)
I'm in love, you my bitch, my bitch (How I love you)
Let's go

(Verse 1)
Uh
I used to dream about you watchin every move you made (yeah)
I was young though, I think third or second grade (ok)
I'd go home, write a poem, put it right to a beat
What I would do, what I would say if we would one day meet
Started getting older, still lovin your style
How you dressed, how you drove the whole 80's wild
I was proud when you first got on MTV (ooh)
You was in the video chillin with Run-DMC
That's my girl (that's my girl)
Little nigga fiendin to hit it
Knowin one day in the future I'd be right up in it
Started doin talent shows, I had it off the hook
You was there but you was too big, you wouldn't even look
I ain't mad you ain't noticed til I got with a group
But even then it wasn't nothin 'less I got in the coupe (Damn)
Got me goin crazy, every day you switch up on me
Puttin that in my face knowin me so horny
see'mon

(Chorus)
{Styles P}

(How I love you)
You all I got (all I got)
You all I want (all I want)
You all I need (all I need)
(How I love you)
From day 1 (day 1)
Till my death bed (til I die)
You all I breathe (uh huh)
(How I love you)
I'm disciplined (disciplined)
I'm dedicated (dedicated)
And determined too (determined)
(How I love you)
You got your ups and downs (ups and downs)
But I don't really mind (I don't mind)
I still ride wit you still ride

(Verse 2)
{Sheek}
Ok, listen
The group doin good (yeah), still in the hood (uh huh)
Got a nickname Sheek now you startin to speak (Sheek)
Said you want to fuck wit all three if that's ok (ok)
I'm like cool, once I hit it it was that anyway
A couple years gone passed, still havin a ball
A million times got the pictures on my wall
When I first hit it, I was like Sheek the man (you the man)
I stopped givin you the attention I originally planned
Then you stopped fuckin wit me (oh)
And left me alone
And people only seen you with Jada and P (That's my mans)
You even went around town and started doggin me bad (Damn)
But it was my fault ya know, I couldn't even get mad (Ok)
Had to grab the pen and pad and get right back
Write some more poems to your ass and get back on track (Whoo)
I ain't go no problems telling you I love you to death
And that I'm whipped
And my shit'll be blown if you skip
Let's go

(Chorus)
A'yo I had to hit the streets, they said you be out there a lot
And I can find you around any nigga out that's hot
Every club, every whip, every gambling spot
You know you'd rather be with me, you like to bug out
Love to bring the thug out
Plus I be keeping it tight
We even go to work together, let you play all night
Mad loud while I sit and I write
Haha
We gon' see the world together
But not on cable
All your friends lovin me, you even got me a label
Got the magazines lovin our relations
People love to hear us talk, DJ's record our conversations
You good around other people, 'specially kids
You make them happy, even brothers doin their bids
And I ain't jealous at all (uh uh), go out and spread your wings
And you can hang with Pop, just pick up the phone when it rings
Let's go

I ain't gon' lie to why'all, I'm whipped (whoo)

(How I love you)
(How I love you)
(How I cry)
(How I love you)",3-5-4 Tarrentino
Sheek Louch,"I don't know
Maybe we can make a change, maybe not

I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of living
I'm tired of niggaz, I'm tired of women
Just want to be myself
Keep the fame, keep the wealth, give me my health
Take me to a place where they a'int hating no more
Where I don't gotta raise the hammer and clap the four
Where I don't gotta kick your door and ask for more
Where I don't gotta dig your floor and ask for more, whoa
Where I don't gotta serve no heads, cook no coke
And there's no such thing as feds
And there's no such thing as AIDS
And little kids live the age to walk the stage
No little babies crying, mama a'int dying
Papa live at home, he got a steady job
Everybody fall, he don't gotta rob

[CHORUS]
Walk with me talk with me
Some times I just sit and think
You know it's hard to express it why'all
That's why I put it all in ink

Where we ain't black or white
Matter fact we are, but we don't have to fight, or kill
Maybe Malcom would have been alive still
Maybe Martin would have been able to chill
Maybe a black face on a dollar bill
I keep hope alive, that I stay alive
I think it's coming, I try not to drink and drive
A place where the death penalty is gone
No abortions, life only lives on
Nobody getting shot for their chains
And no hard labor jobs, we all using our brains
And you don't have to strip through school
Cover your body mama, everything is cool
Let you daughter know here moms is smart
And that's your heart, before you tear her apart
I think I'm asking for too much man

[CHORUS]
No murders on the 5 o'clock news
No bodies over Jordan tennis shoes
Nobody laying on me, waiting to blast
I feel the spirits of my niggaz that past
It's like they right here, I just can't see them
Sometimes I'm jealous of them, damn I want to be them
Everybody fake, when will this ever end
If you don't know your enemy, the you don't know your friend
A place where there's no more wars, no more tears, no more liquor, no more beers
No more stocks, no more shares, no more fights, no more jails, no more kites
A place where you don't value money, just the air you breathe
And every day is sunny
I know it can never happen and it's just rappin
And I'm dreamin, again

A'yo hold up man, let me take why'all back to the beginning
Let why'all know what happend that night, listen
I don't even know these niggaz hangin in front
Usually we woulda been asked them what do they want
What they came here for, this is 354
What you tryna get some gas or some shit from the store
But nobody asked these motherfuckers what do they want
It was bitin, mad traffic, the first of the month
It was me, Chep, Bizzy and Hit
B.G. and Lickalone and yeah I think Earth was there and shit
And a few other niggaz in and out of the buildin
Tryin to catch every sell but not to children
Got a sixty of that yack in the store in the back
Chep about to go home and get more of his pack
Jake ain't fuckin wit us, what's the miracle
Niggaz moms ex heads now turn spiritual
want to preach to us talk about Christ
And how fuck sand, how he could bring the beach to us
That's when I noticed niggaz still outside
Hoody on with some shades like they tryna hide
So I cocked the hammer then I walked to 'em
No beef, just a friendly little talk to 'em
Listen

Still clappin, got everybody runnin scared
They ain't backin down and we ain't bitchin
Niggaz comin out the house with the hitchelin under the michelin
Throwin back a clip or two
You would think we went to war with Colin Powells crew
Police comin now but we don't give a fuck
Rhas' tryna grab all his niggaz in the truck
That's what I get for lettin niggaz blend in
And they ain't really wit us, niggaz really tryna get us

Of that sticky icky in the pocket of my dickie
Just drunk a half of sixty, kinda bended
Hat low, knockin, bout to fuck up the rented
I'm a general, I stepped up from a lieutenant
This is D-Block, join us, don't get offended
'Cause I ain't lettin' up and you ain't lettin' off
Plus I already know that most of why'all is soft
The hood love me, put it in the air for me
And boy cop mixtapes if they don't hear from me
Got cake but occasionally you catch me bummy
I'm too smart on the streets you fuckin' dummy

[Chorus:]

A'yo, real niggaz relate to me
Jealous niggaz can't wait to send the shell of a tray-eight through me
Don't miss cause it's uh-oh like Lumi
Sun out, Sheek make the sky get gloomy
I bail it all to you, I give you my life
I write it in ink or blood, nigga pass my knife
I'm takin' it there, even if they give me the chair
I'm blacked out in the gear, Huey new in the wear
My fist stuck screamin' black power
I ain't gon' lie, that shit could wash off in the shower
'Cause I don't care what color you are
Nigga clap at the kid, the kid tryna levitate your car
I'm not a star
I'm a nigga that'll issue the star
I'm that nigga wit his hammer on him, at the bar
Sheek a straight up crook who got you shook
A'yo Alchemist, bring in the hook

Two twelve gauges take you threw the stages
Bullets running low but yours been there for ages
Cob web niggaz iced out slob like I'm on a fucking bob sled niggaz

Flesh burner like somebodykeep puttin in wood
Don't add nothin, don't count nothin unless it's yours
Let me see, he done been on atleast three tours
Bad cars, he atleast get thirty for bars
See that's the problem motherfuckers don't know
But they think that they know what you do and what you don't
Where you live, what it cost, what you gettin for a show
Who your girl, where she from, what you buyin for that ho
So at that I tell you mind your biz
Punch out, take the bus home and mind your kids
Before ya kids be pumpin my work, bitch doin the jerk

And I done made so many hits, I'm about to cop cleats

Yo, I don't think you understand what I mean
When I aks you to Walk Witt Me, I got the hawk wit me
No talk wit me, in the yard wit my dickies (whoo!)
Young but I remind you of somebody in the sixties
I knew it was on when our God was shown
But I was caught up in the mix of some glittery shit
A.T. him and Mase makin' mils wit it (damn!), I ain't mad
But that shit wasn't me (nah), had to get up off that
Jewelry and Cristal, couldn't talk that

To this day him and Busta got the best show (word up)
Ya know I'm sayin' yo fuck yo yo yo, yo feel me though
Back wit my niggaz, Double are
Before X blew it up, before Eve was a star
We are the streets, they couldn't wait for it
Interscope couldn't wait to get a plate for it
Grammy night, couldn't wait to get a date for it
Not, we sold over gold
Finally reached platinum status and near that is
Still in the hood, still tryin' to learn the biz
Jadakiss dropped a solo they lovin' his voice
I'm lovin' his shit but the hood thought it was moist
Styles P dropped Gangsta and a Gentleman
Hard, no need to speak but the promotion was weak
Sheek never had solo plans
Till I dropped a freestyle in the studio with some a my mans
Lobson tweaked that, Mario leaked that
Your shit hot you could bring the muhfuckin streets back
Nah, I dunno I'm just tryin' get a label
Sit behind the desk you know, watch a lil' cable
Put my lil' man out, throw a few grand out
Get into some pop music, put a rock band out
Got wit my nigga K, cool and Whop
Green Lantern had my shit on the block (Hold me down)
Killed it in Flex now these labels tryin' to jump on our cock
If we could get Sheek album we'll sign D-Block
P and Kiss was like fuck that we gettin' you off
We up in there, the rest of these labels is soft
Mario had a meetin' or two
Brought us to the you-N-I-V-E-are-S-A-L, what up Sue?

I will sleep in my bed you don't woke the dead
Feel me you keep truttin' I'm a hit you wit the lead
And leave your whole shit flatter than the first broke head
Thanks to why'all niggaz it couldn't be

Sheek Louch,"Oh, oh, we gon' do it like, oh, oh, we gon' do it like, oh, oh
We gon' do it like, oh, oh, we gon' do it like

Sheek usually white tee thugging, blue steel hugging
See me with a chick, most likely be fucking
Neighbors too nosy, chain all rosy
Fresh white airs, one squirt of dolce

Coupe all kitted, wrist all glitted
You would think I'm hot in how low I wear my fitted
Dutch already twisted, 'gnac all poured
'Bout to hit the hood and find me a nasty broad

I like 'em with some weight, at least around eight
They don't gotta be a 10 long as they can bring a friend
Come on, pile in, let your hair out
Reach into that little mini-bar and pull a beer out

Loose, there's cranberry if you need it for the gray goose
By now I got my pants around my ankles
Ooh, come here mama, let me thug you out
Let me whisper something to you that'll bug you out

45 minutes to Broadway
I can be downtown, I'm only 5 minutes from the boogie down
45 minutes to Broadway
We can come back up to Y.O. where I blow your back up

45 minutes to Broadway
We can get drunk ma, and hang out right in the sports bar
45 minutes to Broadway
Or you can fly to New York bitch, the home of this D-block playa

She like take it off
Do you mind if I take a picture of you and send it up north?
My homey in his cell and all he got is black tail
He need a polaroid so he can let 'em know it's real

And you ain't gotta stay indoors
I got a house key for doing the choors
Chef in the mornin, mines scrambled baby, how you want yours?
I take 'em to the hood, send 'em to the store

Introduce 'em to my homies, Sheek so raw
It's all fair game, I come back with four more
Don't be scared ma you heard a lot about D-block, right?
Well, you here ma, let's go

45 minutes to Broadway
I can be downtown, I'm only 5 minutes from the boogie down

45 minutes to Broadway
We can get drunk ma, and hang out right in the sports bar
45 minutes to Broadway
Or you can fly to New York bitch, the home of this D-block playa

I don't wanna talk about it
You keep telling me your house is crowded
What you wanna move in? I doubt it
I'll let you sleep over, use the robe and go get you an outfit

I like my freedom baby, I already got a baby
I lay my game down flat soon as I meet a lady
We can do it up, I don't care if you married
Divorced with kids, I don't give a fuck

45 minutes to Broadway

And she talk about she lea-vin (aiyyo calm down)
Said she won't, be back
'Til we get e-ven (what'chu mean get even)
Said she gon' take, my kids

I know she try to be there for me
It's fucked up I got caught cheat-in

[Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo, I ain't gon' lie, I got weeded all drunk and I cheated
After the club, shorty gave me what I needed (yeah)
That freaky side in the back of a ride
In the back of the park, where we used to hide (oh)
First it was a fling cause I kept her in the wing
She knew I had a wife cause I kept her on my ring
But she ain't even care, she just wanted to be down
And come around the lab when I lay a song down (right on mami)
And even when I seen her with my lady
She'll walk by, I'll walk by, no actin shady
No prank calls, no baby momma brawls (none of that)
Real grown lady like, up in the malls
This whole thing is like way too good
You almost never catch a shorty like that up in the hood (uh-uh)
So I kept it on the hush (yeah) brought me a bat line
And called shorty up when it was time to crush

[Chorus] w/ slightly different ad libs

[Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo - couple of Louis bags, the kind that J-Lo has
Could be just lookin at the picture, she don't gotta ask
(You want that right there?)
I like to spend the cash, she like to throw that ass (turn around ma)
I remember when she first flew first class (calm down)
I let her push the whip in, until she started flippin
Axin me am I messin with some other chicken
I'm like ""WHOA, baby NO NO NO""
This ain't gon' start (uh-uh) and please be smart
You know I got a girl, what'chu care what I do
She like ""Fuck you Sheek, whatever, we through"" (whatever)
Next day she drivin by, smilin and wavin hi
Right in front of my house, what this bitch wanna die?

[Chorus] w/ slightly different ad libs

[Sheek Louch]
Hey yo, yo, I never thought it would go down like this
This bitch got my baby momma suspicious
My door ringin while she doin the dishes
A dozen roses with a note sayin ""kiss""
Wait 'til I see this witch
She got me on the couch like a muh'fuckin slouch, I'ma kill this bitch

Hey yo, I got a letter from the governor, the other day

It's time for you to get yo' stack right
The bitch don't act right, whatever put that bitch on the next flight
Whatever nigga step in your way, hit his ass with the K
And leave his body where his children'll play
I cook somethin up like Emeril's kitchen
I put the heat to these rap dudes, whatever let me know who's bitchin
And your security as pussy as you are
The burners come out, his big ass be the first to the car
I got goons that'll make it spark, and I don't gotta throw a blow
Niggaz ready to stage dive like they Linkin Park
The hood love a nigga cause I ain't above a nigga
I eat the same shit in the hood as another nigga
White tee, pants saggin, ready to mug a nigga
Get the hell up out your seats and everybody jump

Yo - yo Sheek lemme get some of that, yo

I rip your hottest MC like eenie mynie moe
Fuck dough I do it for fun, ""Juice"" like Bishop
""American Pie"" nigga, hit your momma like Stiffler
Redman and Sheek Louch, you got a brief clue
Who will tie you up like E did to P in ""Beef Two""
I cheat dude, give me a Maybach to breathe
So I'm determined, like AJ after Free
I don't play games I'm grown, on 26 chrome
Inside of my truck is ESPN Zone
Shame on a nigga, that try to run game on a nigga
I bring pain on a nigga

Hey yo fuck that nigga, buck that nigga
Chase him to the roof, somebody cut that nigga
Pushed 1100, one wheel up (c'mon Sheek)
Lil' entrepeneur; shit, I'm already one deal up (D-Block)
Grants to a bird - okay, I ain't sell a lot
But shit Jigga ain't go platinum 'til his third
I'm one song away, but you would think I did
How the house got that long ass drive-a-way
Benz in the back, doors do Karate Kid
If they knew I get the same time Gotti did
240 when it's floored, trey pound on my lap
Beyonce bobblehead on the dashboard
Can't be ignored, I'm the coke niggaz can't afford
I'm the town niggaz haven't toured
I got a dutch or two, we can smoke a few
But first this is what y'all motherfuckers gotta do

And just the other day Lil' Troy got shot

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea

There was a screech of tyres, but he'll be back for sure
Now through my apartment wall, I can hear her sweet tears startin' to fall

So cry, baby, wash out your heart
Hang your life out to dry and make a new start

Then came a telephone ring, it was a logical thing
I left it for a while, I let her hang up and redial
Then I picked up the telephone, and I said ""Don't worry, honey
No no no, no no no, you're not alone""

So cry, baby, wash out your heart
Hang your life out to dry and make a new start

And nothin' I could say would ever ease her pain
Still I picked up the telephone, 'n I said ""Don't worry, honey

Until it's time to leave her dreams on the underground

I don't think I've ever known so much happiness
I never had one touch change so much, and oh what a feeling
This time, I'm sure that heaven must have sent you from above
'Cause I get butterflies when you whisper sweet love
No other heart will do, oh it's only you
 
[Chorus:]
You take my breath away, every time you hold me, I want to say I love you
My cup is to the top, and emotions overflowing
Baby this ain't no ordinary love, this ain't no ordinary love
My love, you've given new meaning to romance and my world
Would never be the same again, no more tears in the rain
No more hidden inhibitions

It's a brand new day and it's filled with your magic
We both know that it's real and what we feel inside
No mountain's too high to climb, no river can divide
After all is said and done you're the one, I'm already gone

Sheena Easton,"You hold me like a flower, afraid that I won't last
Then you touch me like I'm glass
But I don't shatter all that easily, if I cry it's not for me
What you see are sweeter tears, they fall


[Chorus:]
I hear no sound but a heart, beating softer every breath
Growing stronger every touch, I listen for the love
And hear no sound but a heart, thunder through the shadow room
When I lie with you and listen to the love
No need to hurry now, love takes the time it needs, it opens from a seed
To tangle two of us in twisting vines, passion grows like roses climb
Praying that the morning sun won't rise

[Chorus:]
Say no words, I can hear your beating heart, that's all I need to know
So say no words
But I don't shatter all that easily, if I cry it's not for me
What you see are sweeter tears, they fall

No sound but a heart, no sound but a heart
I hear no sound but a heart - beating softer every breath
No sound but a heart - growing stronger every touch
No sound but a heart - when I lie with you
No sound but a heart - I listen for the love and hear
No sound, no sound...",No Sound But a Heart

And still it ended with a broken heart
And I vowed I'd never fall again, 'cause I couldn't stand the pain
Of losin' someone I cared for, I'd be torn apart forever
Then came you, and I got that feeling again
Oh, I'm still willing to try love
What can I do when the road leads back to you
Still willing to try love, you are the reason I share this heart again
Somehow, the tears were not enough
I tried to put the pieces back together again, start all over

The moment that he's with me, everything's alright

Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him

All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him, and he's crazy mad for me
When he steps off that train, I'm makin' a fool, a fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

Some day I'm gonna reach for the sky

while i've been trying to make tears disappear......

Now i'm almost over you
i've almost shook these blues
so when you come back around
after painting the town, you'll see
i'm almost over you........

You're such a sly one with your cold, cold heart
maybe leaving came easy
but it tore me apart
time heals all wounds, they say
and I should know
'cause it seems like forever
but i'm letting you go.....

Now i'm almost over you
i've almost shook these blues
so when you come back around
after painting the town, you'll see
i'm almost over you.....

I can forgive you and soon i'll forget
all those shattered dreams
although you've left me with nothing to show
full of misery....

i've almost shook these blues
so when you come back around

Sheena Easton,"I used to think that I was made of stone
I only wanted to be on my own
It gets so lonely when you're on your own
And you just can't take anymore

[Chorus]
Give me no heavenly knight
Make him a devil in a fast car
Send me no angle in white
I want him just the way that you are

Other eyes are watching everywhere
Trying hard to catch us but I just don't care
I gotta touch you just to prove you're real
Not some dream I left before

Here comes that feeling that I can't understand
Can't put it in the back
Can't hold it in my hand
Gave all the love time on those one night stands
Just to see what lies in store

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Flying eat to the rising sun
For ninety minutes I'll be under the gun
I'll dream about you while I'm on the run
Til I just can't dream anymore

Sheena Easton,"Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

Do you feel the same connection, make it right some way, some how
Does it come from your emotions, open up the door a little wider now
Do you try to find the feeling, that should never go away
Can it really be so easy, just to make the feeling stay

But when you hold me tight, oh, I know why you're doing it
Cause love can't be denied, when you prove it, do it for love

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
(C'mon and prove it for love)
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

When you promise it's the real thing, promises that stay the same
Is it really love that you're feeling
Or just another pleasure you can't explain
Lift the lid from your emotions, does it matter what they say
Will you follow your own footsteps, baby let your heartbeat show you the way

But when you hold me tight, oh, I know why you're doing it
Cause love can't be denied, when you prove it, do it for love

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do it for love

C'mon and prove it for love

When you do me, when you hold me, when you fool me
When you do it, do it, do it, come on and do it!

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

Sheena Easton,"For your eyes only, can see me through the night.
For your eyes only, I never need to hide.
You can see so much in me, so much in me that's new.
I never felt until I looked at you.

For your eyes only, only for you.
You'll see what no one else can see, and now I'm breaking free.
For your eyes only, only for you.
The love I know you need in me, the fantasy you've freed in me.
Only for you, only for you.

For your eyes only, the nights are never cold.
You really know me, that's all I need to know.
Maybe I'm an open book because I know you're mine,
But you won't need to read between the lines.

Get my share
Of someone's tender loving care.
But there are people
People ev'rywhere
Whose hearts are broken beyond repair.
You took your choice from the display
Wrapped me up
Took home to play.
When love ran out
Threw me away
Cost more to mend than you would pay.
I feel used and confused -
You know I do
You know I do
You know I do.
I'm no freak
I'm not unique
I'm not alone but no one really cares.

I'm just another broken heart
I'm just another broken heart
I'm just another broken heart
I'm just another broken heart.
You feels like I was loaned to you
A library book you won't renew.

You're overdue
You get replaced by someone new.

I do believe my illusions are in tatters

I breathe a sigh coz it's only the beginning
When I see reflection deep in his eyes
I know he's got the power to hit it

I don't believe what he said to me
I feel just like a piece of machinery
Gotta get in closer coz I can't see
When you're telling me the truth
I still refuse to believe

Running on the ground with my innocence fading
I do believe there is something I'm gaining
When I get that red hot fever inside
I want to give it hell and behave like a goner
I want to stay and reduce the things I want to

Why don't you use your imagination
Nations go to war over women like you,
It's just a form of appreciation

Come on over here, lay your clothes on the chair
Now let the lace fall across your shoulder
Standing in the half light, you're almost like her
So take it slow like your daddy told you""

Strut pout, put it out, that's what you want from women
Come on baby, what'cha taking me for
Strut pout, cut it out, all taking and no giving
Watch me baby while I walk out the door

You make me feel like a girl for hire
All this fascination with leather
And lace is just the smoke from another fire""

Before it reaches its destination
Lie down here beside me, oh, have some fun too
Don't turn away from your true vocation""

No more his eager call

The dreams you dreamed
Have all gone astray

The man that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen a final inning
I don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game

No more that all-time thrill
'Cause you've been through the mill
And never a new love
Will be the same

Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher
Lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up

There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman

See the motion, feel the heat of the city
Something's happening in the streets of the city
Cool breeze on the river, making you aware that you're alive
Bodies start to shiver, passions start to shift to overdrive
Picture feelings that you can't control
Elementary voices calling deep inside your soul

Sheena Easton,"I have waited all my life for you, and now I've got to leave you
When we're half a world apart, it's not so far, and I can feel I'm near you
I'm not a kid, a clinging rose, we're wise enough to know
The cost of letting go
And I'll bet my life on you, so don't make promises, 'cause you don't need to

Crosses on a card, a midnight call, just to say hello, then I'm gonna know
All the days and miles can't change at all, who you're thinking of
I don't need your word, I only need your love
All the days and miles can't change at all, who you're thinking of

Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever, and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then

Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him

All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him, and he's crazy mad for me
When he steps off that train, I'm makin' a fool, a fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

On est seuls sur terre
Quand on va à l'Olympia.
Tu fais les lumières
Le plateau s'éclaire
Mais moi, je ne vois que toi.
Rien ne te résiste
Tu es mon artiste
Quand on va à l'Olympia.
Ah, ah,
Notre amour tranquille
Aura deux ans pile
Aux prochains jours de galas,
Quel anniversaire,
Quand la salle entière
Chante à l'Olympia.

Mais, moi, j'y vais pour toi,
Oui, moi, j'y vais pour toi.
Là-haut dessous les toits,
Ah, ah,
Près du grand projecteur
Que tu diriges en douceur
Il fait chaud
Près de toi
Mais on ne nous voit pas.

On voit sur la scène
Des chanteurs qu'on aime
Quand on va à l'Olympia.
Je suis ton étoile
Internationale
Quand on va à l'Olympia.
Tu es ma vedette
Mon amour poète
Quand on va à l'Olympia.
Ah, ah,
Je suis ton idole
Et ton monopole
Et comme on ne nous voit pas.

J'ai un frère qui est trop jeune encore
On n'aime pas le voir traîner la nuit
C'est pourquoi il me dit qu'il m'adore
Quand il veut que je sorte avec lui
Il m'entraîne en disant : ""sois gentille""
Mais à peine est-on dans l'escalier
Il avoue : ""je vais voir une fille
Laisse-moi seul et va de ton côté"".

Dans trois mois ce seront les vacances
Il faut bien choisir où l'on ira
C'est pour ça que longtemps à l'avance
On étale des cartes devant soi
On discute pendant des heures entières
On se fâche je me demande pourquoi
Puisque chaque année de toute manière
On s'retrouve toujours au même endroit.

La famille ça fait partie
Des p'tits soucis quotidiens
Mais pourtant c'est une vie
Qu'on aime bien.

Quand on est réunis tous ensemble
Des beaux-frères jusqu'aux petits cousins
Y a les murs de la maison qui tremblent
J'vous assure qu'on nous entend de loin
Mais si un étranger veut s'en mêler
Pour savoir qui a raison ou tort
Il nous voit bientôt réconciliés
Et tous unis pour le flanquer dehors

Tout au long du chemin il faisait soleil dans les marronniers

Allons faire un tour au bord d'un ruisseau et voir la campagne en fleurs

Ça va bien quand il pleut mais puisqu'il fait beau prenons la journée
On a tout l'hiver pour faire les bilans et terminer l'inventaire
On n'a au contraire que bien peu de temps pour profiter du grand air

Bonjour, Monsieur le Directeur,
Allez, quittez ce front boudeur,
Faites-moi plutôt un grand sourire
Et dites-moi ""oui, ça me fera plaisir""

Sheila E.,"She wears a long fur coat of mink 
Even in the summer time 
Everybody knows from the coy little wink 
The girl's got a lot on her mind 

She's got big thoughts, big dreams 
And a big brown Mercedes sedan 
What I think this girl, 
She really wants is to be in love with a man 

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
But without love it ain't much 

She saw him standing in the section marked 
If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie 
She threw him bread and said make me scream 
In the dark what could he say 

Boys with small talk and small minds 
Really don't impress me in bed 
She said I need a man's man baby 
Diamonds and furs 
Love would only conquer my head 

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
But without love it ain't much 
 
They made haste in the brown sedan 
They drove to fifty five Secret street 
They made love and by the seventh wave 
She knew she had a problem 
She thought real love is real scary 
Money only pays the rent 
Love is forever that's all your life 
Love is heaven sent it's glamorous

I love our noon rendezvous
I know U tell me U missed me
And I want 2 make love 2 U

Your words, they intoxicate me
I shiver each time that U speak
How much more can I endure, my love?
The sound of your voice makes me weak

If my bodily functions operate
This way when U just call my name
I'd hate 2 see when we are finally
Playing that nasty love game

Your words, they intoxicate me
I shiver each time that U speak
How much more can I endure, my love?
The sound of your voice makes me weak

The words are all over your face, my love
What shall U or shall I do?
U could show me some new tricks, my love
I'd love 2 be taught by U

Sheila Jordan,"I weave with brightly colored strings
To keep my mind off other things
So, ladies, let your fingers dance
And keep your hands out of romance

Let the stitches
Keep your fingers under control
Cut the thread, but leave
The whole heart whole

Merry maids can sew and sleep
Wives can only
sew and weep
Falling in love with love
Is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love is
Playing the fool

Caring too much is juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just
For children in school

I'm a fool to want you

To seek a kiss, not mine alone
To share a kiss that devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say

But right or wrong, I can't get along without you",I'm a Fool to Want You
Sheila Jordan,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

With nothing to do

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again

Sheila Jordan,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen grey faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah yes I was wrong, again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain
Romance is mush, stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life
Sheila Jordan,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

I concentrate on you.

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Sheila Jordan,"Before Lord God made the sea or the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star in the wind down there
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost no more

Now, a man don't mind if the stars get dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over him
Keeping track how it all goes on

But I've been walking through the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
Forgetting his promise and the word he'd say

And we're lost out here in the stars

And we're lost out here in the stars

In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

",Come Love
Sheila Jordan,"Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-knighting

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel
I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
And they sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain

Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again",Autumn in New York
Sheila Jordan,"Hello young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave young lovers and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down the street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet, not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my mem'ries are happy tonight
I've had a love of my own

I've had a love of my own like yours
I've had a love of my own","Hello, Young Lovers"
Sheila Jordan,"If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the skies
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

The birds in Maytime
Would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
No wind in winter would blow
With you beside me
A rose would bloom in the snow

I gave you my love
But I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain
If I lost you",If I Should Lose You
Sheila Jordan,"When an irresistible force such as you
Meets an old immovable object like me
You can bet just as sure as you live

Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist

Somewhere, somehow
Someone's gotta be kissed

So, en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store
From their vast mysterious sky
I'll try hard ignorin' those lips that I adore
But how long can anyone try?

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might
Chances are some heavenly star-spangled night
We'll find out just as sure as we live

Something's gotta give

Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

So, kiss me my sweet

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart",When I Grow Too Old to Dream
Sheila Jordan,"A small boy walked down a city street
And hope was in his eyes
As he searched the faces of the people he'd meet
For one he could recognize

Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
(Looking for a soul brother all around him

Sheila Jordan,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last
And how did I guess that the long loneliness was past
I merely looked at you and I knew then and there I knew
It's you or no one for me

Now and forever when forever is done
You'll find that you are still the one

So please don't say no to my plea

That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh.

In everything that's light and gay

Though the weather here is fine, maybe
There's a storm rolling over those hills
Don't let it soak you,
Don't let it choke you

Cause you're the only ancient king that I've ever known
And my weekly injection, on your passion throne
And you reveal what's concealed in this smiling town
Re-sensitize me, and your condemned to be free

And I saw you in the garden
In the middle of the storm
And both are questioning our sanity
Both are pleading to be born

So I asked you for the direction
To the place that's calm and clear
And as I looked at your reflection
I saw my face in the mirror

Don't die on the vine, baby

Inviting hope for a moment that's real",Don't Die on the Vine
Sheila Nicholls,"It's so calm, I am suspicious without a storm
Here on my farm, it is harvest and the sun is warm
And I yearn for upheaval, oscillation of the depths
The water's calling, and there is flood warning in all my steps

And I am leaving light behind to find an equal in my mind
To find an equal in my head 
Where all the boys contributed more than tangles in my sheets
Breakfast shadows in the streets 
To make it safe so I won't drown
One more time in Eiderdown

Tiptoe below where it is dark and the walls are cold
And I see shadow I face my monster while I still feel bold
He beckons closer with no eyes and with no respect
He'd overdose her but he's to scared 'cause he hates me

The emperor Defiance in my mind sits on his throne
With face to be mine presumes I'll serve him beef and wine
His importance is so divine as I refuse and smile at him
I feed myself and learn to swim
To make it safe so I won't drown 
One more time in Eiderdown

And as the dust begins to clear
I know it's still taught that you are free
And I will consume this condition until there's no more division
'Cause freedom outside of equal conveys
Let the privilege rule and everything else obeys
'Cause freedom outside of equal conveys
Let the privilege rule and everything else obeys

And I am leaving light behind to find an equal in my mind

I'm with the sun I see the moon I touch the sky

I'm with you

And how long would it take 
If we were trapped in an elevator after the earthquake
Five stories under debris
You and me in the garden indefinitely

After 10 hours were thinking about food
We lost our voices from shouting, and screaming 
And crying and singing and being really crude
My tummy rumbles but theres' no guitar so we have sex instead and we go so far
And we do that for days til we're knee deep in cum
Dehydrated , exhausted, insane aquarium

Sheila Nicholls,"Hannah's friends were watching
When she met him at the end of the bar
Hannah's friends were thinking
That he wouldn't even make it that far

""This is for you"", he said
Her gaze unbroken as she licked her spoon
He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the moon
He gave it to her

Her breathing stumbled and her eyes became wide
And as she swallowed cream
She could already feel him inside
She'd seen similar before

A book, a ring, a key, and more
But never as clever and as clean and as pure
And he said, ""You're the one

You're the only one I've been waiting for""
So she took his eyes and trusted
And they slipped through the door

Texas girl in New York, don't call her naive
Though she's seen it before, she just risks to believe
She still has the faith in her battered ideals and she

She still holds the courage to scale her fears
Well, spontaneous love has crossed everyone's mind
Most lose hope when that's not what we find

I saw her in the morning and she was crying in the park
She said his girlfriend came home and screamed through the dark
She said that she called her a whore and then she spat in her face
So, Hannah had left in silent disgrace

And then she turned to be, she said, ""Now what do I do?""
And I witnessed her shame, how it was mine too
And now she even calls him from Texas, she gets his machine
He made her question herself, her worth, her esteem

So, don't say she's the one and then forget
Don't hand her the moon and then charge interest on debt now
Don't give her your lines 'cause your mask may be flawless
But you're full of shit and your campaign is coreless

And the moon won't do if it's just a snapshot
And hell neither will you if that's all that you got now
Neither will you if that's all that you got now
Neither will you if that's all that you got now
Neither will you if that's all that you got

Well maybe now you'll let me a little closer she said
But she just sacrificed her identity instead

Be careful how you trend
Be careful how you tread

A commercial for deodorant, tampons, so now we won't smell see

Buy your shame for free
Buy your shame for free

And all the smiles that we spill
Because it's part of the drill
The shame that we bear
For the floors that aren't there
The unfulfilled will be dismissed
For a savior, a kiss
The memories we repress ... when we undress

She went channel surfing 
And all that was seen
Were decorative women arrive on the screen
Conventional images of adolescent male dreams
When men aren't around they fall apart at the seams
Passive exposed
Peaches and cream
Survive like an object to blow off your steam
Interchangeable fragments
And outlines and shapes
They say no they mean yes to little girl rapes

And all the smiles that we spill
Because it's part of the drill
The shame that we bear
For the floors that aren't there
The unfulfilled will we dismiss
For a savior, a kiss
The memories we repress ... when we undress

The rage trapped inside
Smothered and dried
The words that we use
They divide and abuse
The wound between women keeps the war-mongers grinning
The war between women stops recovery beginning

Around her face

Appalled by what I see
As nothing less 
Than manufactured images of my happiness
Insults all over work
Humanity
And corporations dictate who's a slave
And who is free

Well they said
Desire would design the market
But if you have the money 
You can plant desire in peoples heads
And make them believe 
They need something that they don't
People buy an image before they buy their food
And if we keep selling based on people's insecurities
We'll just make them bigger
And perpetuate mass blindness

He wants a T-shirt, the sneakers, and the sword

He's only four but he's learned to consume til he's bored

Where the external consumption is merely temporary

In my theories algebra and sums 

I've kicked myself for months now 
It's bread and water without you 
Bread and water 
It's bread and water without you 

So you stare at me through keyholes 
Like I'm some religion in the rain 
Your defences highlight my weaknesses now 
When before you loved me all the same
Yeah you loved me all the same

Sheila Nicholls,"We talked about loss and the patterns of past
And the pieces of ourselves, we'd killed over time
We thought then of love and surrendered our eyes
And I looked for myself through your dissolving disguise

My breath in is your breath out, we begin
And for a moment lifting this
Deception of being separate from you

My breath in is your breath out
We walk in, into the ocean
Shifting my perception of being one drop of dew

We talked about God and the limbs on the floor
And the legalization of deviance
We thought then of sense and how often its veiled
And how the machines and their components have already failed

It's been years and I'm still here
Longing for what has always been true
Life and death, us and them are two parts
Of one whole just misconstrued",Breath

It's all I know how to protect myself
Oh you say you wanted more
And I reveal and then I shout
OH Oh, I'm the fool
If I can't find you anywhere
And I am left here on this beach
With these fruits of ours, they are rotting in the sun
Come, Come to me, again
This time I will give you mine
Come to me, again
This time...
I've been quizzing all the trees
One by one
What they know of your alchemy, please
Cause you reveal myself to me
In my darkest place, you've unlocked and left my cells
And disappear without a trace

This time I will give you mine now

I could not define it or invite it in

To let it in would be to liberate

When you have faith
You will be willing to wait
When you have faith
Through all that logic and haste
It's never too late
So try to create
'Cause the last thing that breaks, the last thing that breaks,
the last thing that breaks
Is your faith

I'm looking too closely to recognize
To gain perspective think it would be wise

And taste the raindrops sweet and wet and warm
And may I never loose this faith I've found
It keeps me anchored down to solid ground
So let lightening flash and wind swirl around

Sheila Nicholls,"The words I have to say may well be simple but they're true 
until you give your love there's nothing more that we can do

Love is the opening door 
Love is what we came here for 
No one can offer you more 
Do you know what I mean, 
Have your eyes really seen

You say its very hard to leave behind the life we knew, 
But there's no other way and now it's really up to you

Sheila Nicholls,"I knew I was treading water,
And your baggage floated all around.
There were no life rafts,
Should I grab a suitcase?
It was sink or swim to higher ground.

And I stretch between, telling you everything
And nothing at all.

Delilah saw the yellow flowers before us,
Just in case you didn't know.
They rooted for me 'cause I wore their colors,
Told me not to linger, just grow.

And I'm glad us girls could get over Salem,
And not divide each other and not watch each other fall.

And I deliver what I want you to see,
Just like you have always done for me,
But his can never be a war.
The object of this game is to leave with equal score.

And the moth and the streetlight were in their infinite tease,
And Icarus shouted down from the clouds and the trees,
Well, he tried to warn them both.
Be careful of the fire,
Be careful of the air, 
For he will never tire and she is rarely fair.
Love's not the illusion of desire,
Still he tried to break their stare,
What choices will you make he said with failure in his smile.
I'm sure this beauty's fake, and I'm sure this love is vile.

But the moth just saw the fire, beautiful fire,
Kept her warm and was fuel for her dance.
The lamp marveled as she swam through the air.

Maybe something there.",Moth and the Streetlight

Speak the truth girl so the slaves will understand 
We'll find our real smiles hidden in the desert sand.
No one suspects her no one can see a difference, 
Because she smiles the way you taught her, candy-coated. 
She can play you better than you ever could play her but its boring she's kind of bloated; 
And sometimes she finds she will play herself now that is dangerous that is lying. 
That is lying. 
So she is leaving she is taking everything, she's not coming back, no she's not coming back.
Ruby take us...
We've seen this smile before on Lilith's as she slammed the door. 
Left Adam standing in the Garden of Eden he had a hard-on 
And was ready for breeding, she didn't want but he couldn't hear.

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Shel Silverstein,"Now a friend of mine, way back in Chicago 
You know, he finally made his pile.
Well he got himself a mansion on Butler and Sheff
An' he was livin' in the latest style;
But I run into him, he was eatin' in a greasy spoon
While parked in front was his big limousine.
I said, ""Buddy, you've got so much money
How come you're in here, eatin' beans?""
An' he said 

After you've been havin' steak for a long time,
Beans, beans taste fine.
An' after you've been drinkin' champagne and brandy
You gonna settle for wine.
He said ""The world is funny, and people are strange,
And man is a creature of constant change, and
After you've been havin' steak for a long time

Now, you know I ran into another friend of mine
In a rowdy old Clark Street Bar.
I said, ""Friend, is it true what I heard about you?
I heard you married a beautiful 18-year-old shapely movie star,
Yet here you sit, tryin' to make out with some barfly
Who's too old and ugly to be true.""
He said, ""Shelley, you're still a very young man
So sit down. I'll explain it all to you.

Shel Silverstein,"In a pad with no heat, up on Sullivan Street
The last of the hipsters lay dyin'
Wearin' his shades, so like no one could tell
Like whether or not he was cryin'

Were all gathered 'round his bed

Of some imported stuff
And this are the last words he said

He said, ""Send my sandals home to Mom,

We left his T-shirt lay
We sold his guitar
At the corner bar

And for the next five hours right there I sat
You know that chick went home with some other cat

Shel Silverstein,"Well, for a long time now I’ve been aware
That like I’m alright but like the world is square.
So I’ll tell all you people you can take my tip
It does not pay to be hip.

Now just last week I found myself in the red
With no way to meet my overhead
So like I went to my buddy
And asked him for some bread,
And here is what he said:
He said, “You want white bread,
Rye bread, pumpernickel, whole wheat
Cracked wheat, challa or bialy?”
I said, “Later”.
He said, “You mean three or four o’clock?”
I said, “Later”.
He said, “You mean Thursday or Friday?”
I said, “Forget it”.

Now I was feelin uptight, so like I went to see the man.
I heard he always had some stuff on hand.
I said, “Tell me, baby, can you spare some pot?”
He said, “You’re welcome to anything I got.
And I’ve got steel pots, brass pots, cast iron, aluminum
Pyrex, Winbex.”
I said, “Cool it”.
He said, “You mean put it in the refrigerator?”
I said, “Cool it”.
He said, “You mean turn on the air conditioning?”
I said, “Forget it”.

Now I was feeling strung out
And hung up and brought down.
There was nobody hip like in the whole damn town.
So I run upon a chick, and she was long and tall
And asked her would she care to ball.
And she said, “Football, baseball, volleyball, or basketball,
Handball, pinball, bowling ball?”
I said, “You’re putting me on.”
She says, “On the train, on the plane,
On the bus or on the sidewalk?”

I said, “I wanna make it”.
She said, “Make what?”
I said, “A scene.”
I said, “I want to make a scene!”
She said, “Shakespeare, Clifford Odetts,
Arthur Miller or Pirandello?”
I said, “Forget it”.

She says, “you know what I’d like to do?”
I said, “No, what?”
And she said, “I’d like to make love to you”.

He said anyone try to stop him would be just one more notch on his gun

When she finds he's gone she'll be prayin' and Lord I know just how she feels
Because he's comin' down the road...

His right hand is slowly descendin' to the sixgun that rest on his hip
Then his lower lip strated tremble and he started cryin' as he looked up at me
And I picked him up I said son you're only four years old
And you know Jinny's only three

Shel Silverstein,"As I walked down to Bishop Street,
I met a girl with a smile so sweet.
Now she was young and pretty, too.
And on a string, she walked
With a thing called a Floobie Doobie Doo.

Oh, a Floobie Doobie Doo. Now what is that?
It ain't no dog and it ain't no cat.
It's nine feet tall with eyes of blue.
I never seen such a thing
As a thing called a Floobie Doobie Doo.

It had one tooth and five purple toes,
Sixteen elbows and a twelve foot nose.
You'll never see one in the zoo.
I mean a thing like a thing
On a string called a Floobie Doobie Doo .

I told that girl ""Lemme take you home . . .
And maybe we can be alone."" ( Ha - ha Ha - ha )
She said, ""I'd love to go home with you,
But I'd have to bring my thing
On a string called a Floobie Doobie Doo.""

Well, I took her home that very night.
We talked a while and I dimmed the light.
She cuddled close and the next thing I knew.
Just as soon as it seen us
In between us jumped the Floobie Doobie Doo!

It stayed all night. It stayed all year.
I never got to hold her near.
I said ""Sweet Baby - I wanna cling to you,
But you wanna cling to a thing
On a string called a Floobie Doobie Doo.""

Oh, a Floobie Doobie Doo. Now what is that?
It ain't no dog, it ain't no cow and it ain't no cat.
It's nine feet tall with eyes of blue.
You just can't swing with a thing
On a string called a Floobie Doobie Doo.

Well, she cried a cry. She wiped her eye.
She said, ""Farewell… so long… goodbye.
For though I love you …yes I do…
I can't reveal the love that
I feel for the Floobie Doobie Doo!""

I never see her anymore.
She never knocks upon my door.
And every night alone and blue
I sit and I swing about a string on a thing
I mean I sit and I think about a swing on a thing
I mean I sit and I sing about a thing

And I was bound to settle down
Hey I wonder if she's still in town.

Yeah, I knew another woman,

And I really learned the way to wiggly wag
And still, I'm such a modest man, you know I'm twice as great as I think I am.

And they'll build me a monument forty feet high sayin', ""It's a shame he had to die.

And your wives, they like the way I carry on

I can make you creep, I can make you crawl, make you scream and climb the wall,

Shel Silverstein,"(Spoken Intro: When I was twelve years old I used to see the pictures of mermaids in all the books and magazines. Not mermaids but mermaids (pronounced MAREmaids), that's what we called them at home. And all the pictures, yeah, they never had no bras on, they didn't have anything on! And I was old enough that I knew that they didn't really exist, but, I also wondered, if they did exist, what the hell would you do with one if you caught it?!)

When I was a lad in a fishing town, an old man said to me,
""You can spend your life, your jolly life, a-sailing on the sea.
You can search the world for pretty girls 'til your eyes grow weak and dim,
But don't go swimmin' with a mermaid, son, if you don't know how to swim!
'Cause her hair is green as sea-weed,
Her lips are blue and pale.
I'll tell you now before you start,
You can love that girl with all your heart,
But you'll only love the upper part;
You will NOT like the tail!

I signed on to a whalin' ship, and my very first day at sea,
I spied a mermaid in the waves, a-reachin' out to me.
""Come live with me in the sea,"" said she, ""and down on the ocean's floor.
I'll show you a million wond'rous sights you've never seen before!""
So I jumped on in and she pulled me down, down to her seaweed bed.
A pillow she made of tortoise shells, and placed beneath my head.
She fed me shrimp and caviar from a silvery dish.
She was just my taste (down to her waist), but the rest of her was fish!
Her hair was green as seaweed.
Her lips were blue and pale.
Her face it was a work of art,
But I only gave her half my heart,
'Cause tho I loved the upper part,
I did NOT like the tail!

And then one day when I looked up, I saw a sailin' ship,
And I met the stare of a millionaire out on a fishing trip.
A diamond ring he tied on a string and lowered it down to her,
And my love divine, she went for the line and went for the usual lure!
So I sighed in the rolling tide, and I cried to the clams and the whales
How I missed her hair and her seagreen eyes; I missed the shine of her scales.
Just then her sister swam on by, and set my heart a-whirl --
For her upper part was an ugly old fish, but the bottom half was GIRL!
Her toes are round and rosey!
Her legs are slim and pale!
Her face might not be a work of art,
But I love that girl with all my heart.
And I don't give a damn about the upper part --
That's how I end my tale! ('Cause now I'm getting tail!)",Mermaid

Don't give a dose to the one you love most.
Give her some marmalade...give her some toast.
You can give her the willies or give her the blues.
But the dose that you give her will get back to youse.

I once had a lady as sweet as a song.
She was my darlin', and she was my dear.
But she had a dose, and she passed it along.
Now she's gone, but the dose is still there.

So, don't give a dose to the one you love most.
Give her some marmalade...give her some toast.
You can give her a partiridge up in a pear tree,
But the dose that you give her might get back to me.

So if you've got an itchin'...if you've got a drip,
Don't sit there wishin' for it to go 'way.
If there's a thing on the tip of your thing or your lip,
Run down to the clinic today, and say...

""I won't give a dose to the one I love most.
I'll give her some marmalade...give her some toast.""
Give her the willies or give her the blues,
But the dose that you give her will get back to you.

Would not take the garbage out!
She'd scour the pots and scrape the pans,
Candy the yams and spice the hams,
And though her daddy would scream and shout,
She simply would not take the garbage out.
And so it piled up to the ceilings:
Coffee grounds, potato peelings,
Brown bananas, rotten peas,
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.
It filled the can, it covered the floor,
It cracked the window and blocked the door
With bacon rinds and chicken bones,
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,
Prune pits, peach pits, orange peel,
Gloopy glumps of cold oatmeal,
Pizza crusts and withered greens,
Soggy beans and tangerines,
Crusts of black burned buttered toast,
Gristly bits of beefy roasts...
The garbage rolled on down the hall,
It raised the roof, it broke the wall 
Greasy napkins, cookie crumbs,
Globs of gooey bubble gum,
Cellophane from green baloney,
Rubbery blubbery macaroni,
Peanut butter, caked and dry,
Curdled milk and crusts of pie,
Moldy melons, dried-up mustard,
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,
Cold French fries and rancid meat,
Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.
At last the garbage reached so high
That finally it touched the sky.
And all the neighbors moved away,
And none of her friends would come to play.
And finally Sahra Cynthia Stout said,
""OK, I'll take the garbage out!""
But then, of course, it was too late 
The garbage reached across the state,
From New York to the Golden Gate.
And there, in the garbage she did hate,
Poor Sahra met an awful fate,
That I cannot right now relate
Because the hour is much too late.
But children, remember Sahra Stout
And always take the garbage out!",Sahra Cynthia Sylvia Stout Would Not Take the Garbage Out

Yeah, and other fellahs they just wanna swing
But all I wanted all my life
Was a TV set and a truck and a wife
And a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

Yeah the TV and the truck I got on credit.
And I got that girl with a little old Woolworth ring
And life was warm and life was sweet
But still, it was kinda incomplete
Without a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

Hey, John you walk the line,
Do ""Deelia"" one more time
And when you do them Cottonfields
You warm this heart of mine.

So, one day I thought, Hey, I'm gonna do it!
(That's what I said)
So, I mortgaged the farm and pawned her wedding ring.
I sold the gold tooth out of my mouth
And jumped in the pickup and headed South.
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

I hit Nashville cold and wet and hungry.
I said, ""I'm here, bring him on let him do his thing.""
But they told me down at the Old Pit Grill
I'd have to go all the way to Andersonville
For a front row seat to hear ole Jonny sing.

I found his house knocked on the door and it was opened
By a brown-haired girl and a baby with a teethin' ring.
I said ""I seen you somewhere before
But don't stand there and block the door
I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

She said I'd have to go down to The Opry
And the feller there said I'd have to wait till Spring.
He said, ""We've been sold out for months and months
And this poor insane fellah wants
A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

Well, he said a couple more things, and I started cryin'
And then he laughed at me and that's when I started to swing.
Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage,
Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

(chrous)

Then some crazy guard started shootin'
I shot back, and the next thing I know I was winged
And on the floor
When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low
Says, ""Boy that's a mighty long way to go
For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing.""

And I guess that judge, he weren't no music lover.
I got fifteen months but that don't mean a thing.

And rolled himself a righteous smoke.

On the cusp of nowhere and nevermore.

The carpenter he tried with pliers the telephone man tried with wires
The firemen they tried with fire but couldn't melt that peanut utter sandwich
With ropes and pulleys drills and coil with steam and lubricating oil
For twenty years of tears and toil they fought that awful peanut bbutter sandwich
Then all his royal subjects came they hooked his jaws with grapplin' chains
And pulled both ways with might and main
Against against that peanut butter sandwich
Each man and woman girl and boy put down their ploughs and pots and toys
And pulled until kerack oh joy they broke right through the peanut utter sandwich

And then in voice so faint and weak the first words that they heard him speak
Were how about a peanut butter sandwich",Peanut Butter Sandwich

Shel Silverstein,"(Spoken Intro: Speaking of legends and tale tales, there's a big 'un going around 'bout the guy that writes a few songs and grabs his guitar and jumps on a bus and goes to Nashville and overnight becomes a smash. Now, friends, this works for some of the guys sometimes but there's a whole lotta guys running up and down 16th Avenue South here and you can see them at Tootsie's and you can see 'em at The Country Corner. And these boys have a whole lotta dreams, same way I had mine, but sometimes they come true and sometimes they don't.) 

I was hanging 'round Nashville writing songs
And playing 'em for all of the stars,
Watchin' 'em laugh and hand 'em back,
Living on hope and Hershey bars.
So, I pawned my guitar and bought a ticket home,
And I's a'headin' for the Trailway bus
When I seen an old fountain pen laying in the gutter,
So I stopped and picked it up.

It was worn-out, bent and cast aside --
Kinda sorta like myself,
So I sat down on the curb and wrote a little song
That told the world how both of us felt.
Then I run that song down to Music Row
And before I had time to spit,
It's pitched and sold and cut for a record
And moving up the charts and, damn, it's a hit!

So I wrote me another winner,
Then I wrote me a smash again,
And I's a'flyin' off the ground,
'Cause I knew I'd found me a sure hit songwriter's pen.

So the songs they just kept a'pourin' out,
And the money kept pouring in.
I just couldn't miss, all it took was a twist
Of my sure hit songwriter's pen.
Remember when I won the Grammy,
Then I won it again and again?
Well, none of you knew it was all due
To my sure hit songwriter's pen.

I was darling with all the ladies.
I was a hero among the men...
Making big dough, working rodeos and TV shows --
Me and my sure hit songwriter's pen.

But then one night in Wichita
I was just coming off of the stage,
Folks all lined up screaming for my autograph...
Lord, I was a national rage.
One little freckled face girl was there, she said,
""I got no pencil, sir.""

So I signed it with my songwriter's pen
And then handed the pen back to her!
Four o'clock that morning, I woke up with the shakes and the bends
With terror in my eyes 'cause, good God, I realized
I'd lost my sure hit songwriter's pen.

I offered rewards in the papers
I pleaded on the Sympathy Line,
And a whole lotta folks and a whole lotta pens,
But none of them pen's was mine.
So my songs got worse and my money ran out
And so did all my good-time friends.
And there was no doubt I was nothing without
My long-lost sure hit songwriter's pen.

So I rolled like a stone down to old Skid Row
Where I feed my blues on wine
And I rest my chops in a two-bit flop
And I tell my story for a drink or a dime
And I sleep with my shoes underneath my head
And dream about days back then
When I blazed my name across the sky
With my sure hit songwriter's pen.

Somewhere in Wichita some little girl
Who's a freckled face nine or ten
Is doing her arithmetic homework tonight
With a sure hit songwriter's pen.

And I say, God bless ya, honey
You got yourself a sure hit songwriter's pen there
Write a song for me, baby.
You got a sure hit songwriter's pen.

Send me some money.

Shel Silverstein,"""This next song is dedicated to all the cop outs in the world. My friends mostly, including me.""

It was Sat night at the slammer
The gavel was falling like a hammer
As they dragged in every freak
From off the road
One by one they entered the cell
And the stories that they had to tell
Were all different 
But all seemed to end on the very same note

""They held me down and they put it on my nose
They even sprinkled a little bit on my clothes
Yeahâ?¦ I know what you're thinkin
But I ain't one of those
Noâ?¦ they held me down and put it in my nose.""

This wino in the corner got up and shook himself outâ?¦.
He said, 
""Well they held me down and poured it down my throat
That's what they did.
They even planted the bottle in my coat
Anybody want some?
Yeahâ?¦ the reason why my pants so wet 
Is they pushed me off the boat
After they held me down and poured it down my throat.""

And this chick in the next cellâ?¦
She said,
""I heard you guys talking
And let me tell you somethingâ?¦
He held me down and he put it you know where
Ohhhhâ?¦ I told him I was a virgin
But he didn't care
Nooooâ?¦ the pig!
Ahhhhâ?¦ you see his wallet's in my purse.
What's it doing there?
He held me down and put it you know where.""

And then this cat got up.
Wellâ?¦ he half got up.
He lifted his head and, 
He said,
""Hey, manâ?¦ hey held me down and they put it in my vein.
They even held a pistol to my brain
Or I wouldn'ta done it
Ohhh.. these scars on my arms are where I crashed through the window paneâ?¦
Tryin' to get awaaaaaaaaay
When they held me down and put it in my vein.""

And then this cat.. a rollie-eyed cat in a raincoat, and shoes 
And the bottom of his pants were cut off at the knees
He said,
""She held me down and put it in my face.
Oh, the disgrace.
And that's the fact on which I'm gonna base my case.
She was overweight and underage.
And we was at my place.
But she held me down and put it in my face.""

Shel Silverstein,"Well, big John Henry Rucker
He was a greasy motor trucker
And he drove them big ol' diesels to L.A.
Drivin' outta Mobile
His darlin' wife, Camille
She would kiss him in his driveway
And she'd say
She'd say:


(Camille) Don't go to sleep on the road, baby
(I won't)
Don't go to sleep on the road
(Lord, protect me)
Take what it takes (uh huh) to keep you awake
(I will)
But don't go to sleep on the road.

Then Camille started singin' country music for a friend
Well you know a girl can't stay too long alone.
First for friends
And then in bars
Then she soon became a star
And sometimes he'd hear her record
And he'd groan...
Singin':


(Camille) Don't go to sleep on the road, baby
(Shel) (Tears in his eyes)
Don't go to sleep on the road
Take what it takes (uh huh) to keep you awake
(Shel) (I will)
But don't go to sleep on the road.

Yes... and her records started movin' up the charts
And became number one
And she got.. she got entertainer of the year
And she got her hair done
And got a boob job
And got her an affair with the bass player.
And he got hemorrhoids.

He was drivin' hell for leather
Through the California weather
When that California sky began to rain
And that hill was wet and steep
Oh, he shore could use some sleep
But his darlin's words kept ringin' through his brain.

(Camille singing chorus in the background while Shel sings:)

That eastbound rig was hummin'
Lord, he never seen it comin'
And he woke up starin' at the sky
In the wreck and in the rain
With the radio still playin'
And the last words that he heard before he died
Was Camille
Still singin':

(Camille) Don't go to sleep on the road, baby
(Shel) (What a way to die)
(Camille) Don't go to sleep on the road
(Camille and Shel) Take what it takes to keep you awake
Oh, but don't go to sleep on the road.

Shel Silverstein,"'Twas sunset down in old Key West
The locals all were high.
The tourists snapped their photographs
And munched their Key Lime pie.
And meanwhile down at Sloppy Joe's
The drinks were standin' tall
With Buffett on the jukebox 
And Hemingway on the wall.

Then up spoke Sam the Shrimper:
He said, ""I've been a shrimper all my life.
My daddy was a shrimper
And my mom's a shrimper's wife.
And I'm tired of bein' a shrimper
'cause a shrimper's life's too tame
So I'm gonna ride the Conch Train, boys,
And be like Jesse James.
Gonna be like Jesse James, boy...
Gonna be like Jesse James.
Case you didn't hear me the first three times...
Gonna be like Jesse James.""

Now the Conch Train is a tourist toy
That rolls through Key West Town
Like some weird ride from Disneyland
It drives the tourists round and round
While the engineer on her P.A. 
Points out all the sites
""Well, Tennessee did you-know-what 
To you-know-who that night.""

""The tourists all have money"", said Sam
""Their wives all have rings of gold.
Their mopeds all are pawnable.
Their cameras can be sold.
And think of all the glory, boys,
The money and the fame
To be the first and only man
To rob the Key West Train.""

Now the engineer of the Conch Train
Her name was Betsy Wright.
She drove the Conch Train all day long
And loved Shrimper Sam all night.
And with some sweet persuasion,
She agreed to join the game:
She'd slow it down and flag the lad
And let him ride the train.

The conch train made its turn
Down the Smathers Pitch
When Shrimper Sam with a snorkle eye
Leaped naked from the sea.
His fillet knife was in his hand.
He jumped aboard the train.
""Give up your bucks, you tourist schmucks.
I'm Key West Jesse James.
I'm Key West Jesse James, boy...
Key West Jesse James...
Case you didn't hear me the first three times...
I'm Key West Jesse James.""

Now unbeknownst to Shrimper Sam
In the third car from the rear,
Sat Kelso Bolls from Muscle Shoals,
An American Legioneer.
He was a redneck of respect
And a marksman of reknown.
From under his fat
He drew a Gat,
And shot the shrimper down.

Now the first time that he shot poor Sam,
Sam groaned and clutched his side.
The second time that he shot poor Sam,
Sam fell to his knees and cried.
And the third time that he shot poor Sam,
You could see in both their eyes
Lash LaRue and Randolph Scott
Beneath the Western skies.

We laid poor Sam upon the sand
And we lifted up his head.
We listened close to hear the words
The dying shrimper said.
He said, ""Boys, you know I had my chance
But I went and botched the job,
But how can a boy named Jesse James
Without a train to rob?""
Then Kelso Bolls took off his hat
And the tears streamed down his face.
He said, ""Son, I know just how you feel.
This world's a changin' place"".
When history is written,
Uh... they won't recall our names,
But I only got to play Pat Garrett
'cause you played Jesse James.

We buried Sam in the southernmost sands
Close by the southernmost waves
Where sweet Betsy Wright
Cries tears every night
Onto his southernmost grave.
And on his tombstone say the words
""Stick to your own game.
And if you are a shrimper,
Do not try to rob a train.""",The Great Conch Train Robbery

From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!?
Now you gonna die!""
Yeah that's what I told 'em

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when

And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help ya along

And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye

Shel Silverstein,"He's a giver, he'll give her
The kind of attention that she's never known
He's a helper, he'll help her
To open the doors that she can't on her own
He's a lover, he'll love her
In ways that she never has been loved before
And he's a getter, he'll get her
By gettin her into the world she's been hungerin' for

'cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted
Then he'll take off and leave her
Takin' all of her pride as he goes

Yes, he's a taker, he'll take her ...

He's a charmer, and he'll charm her
With money and manners that I never learned
He's a leader, and he'll lead her
Across pretty bridges he's planning to burn
He's a talker, he'll talk her
Right off of her feet, but he won't talk for long
Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her
The way that I never
And damned if he won't do her wrong
'cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted
Then he'll take off and leave her
Takin' all of her pride as he goes

Yes, he's a taker, he'll take her ...

Shel Silverstein,"A long time ago, when the earth was still green,
There were more kinds of animals than you've ever seen;
They'd run around free while the earth was being born,
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.

There was green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.

Now God seen some sinnin' and it gave Him pain.
And He said, ""Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.""
He said, ""Hey, brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do.
Build me a floating zoo.""

And take some of them green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
Don't you forget my Unicorn.""

Old Noah was there to answer the call,
He finished up making the Ark just as the rain started fallin',
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through,
""Hey, Lord: I've got yer....

Green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord, I'm so forlorn,
I just can't see no Unicorn.""

Old Noah looked out into the driving rain,
Them Unicorns was hiding, playing silly games,
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring,
Oh, them silly Unicorns.

There was green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Noah cried, ""Close the doors 'cause the rain is pourin',
And we just can't wait for no Unicorns.""

The Ark started movin', it drifted with the tide,
Them Unicorns looked up from the rock and they cried,
And the waters came down and sorta floated them away,
That's why you'll never see a Unicorn, to this very day.

You'll see green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
You're never gonna see no Unicorn.",The Unicorn

We'll see the start of a brand new day
Heaven help us when it arrives
One more day with tears in our eyes
For the only one, lonely one
Lonely one, where can she be?

The figure stands at the windowpane
Up to the hill he looks again
Thinking back, he knows he was wrong
How could he leave his home for so long
And he's back to find no change of mind
He was blind, where can she be?

Why does he stand just outside the door
It does no good, he's stood there before
And just waved his hand, I don't understand
There's no one there, so who can explain?

Open your mouth and I will speak for you.""

Alive and well and in the best of health
Although it's been through hell since you left it
Hasn't shown no sign of giving up it still won't let me love nobody else
My love for you is still alive and well

I didn't know that love could ever live this long all by itself
And keep on feeling just as strong as it was feeling on the day you left
In this cold and lonely bed your memory should die just from the chill
But it stays warm inside my heart cause all my love for you is still

Alive and well and in the best of health

Alive and well and in the best of health",Alive and Well
Shelby Lynne,"You can't turn your back and walk away
Until the cards are stacked against us
And you thought it through
But you're gonna lose when it crosses over
Then life turns defenseless and it'll turn on you
Oh if you've loved before don't try to deny it
You can't ignore the way you feel inside

[Chorus]
Don't cross your heart
It's a fight you can't win
You lose your mind
Don't cross you heart
Your heart gonna break you every time
What you do is up to you
If you wanna play it smart
Honey don't cross your heart

You don't dispatch a perfect love
It takes time to make it
You gotta start somewhere
If the truth be known
A (diamond ring) is just a piece of stone
Until it shapes it with tender love and care
Chip away until you get to the truth
Oh I can't make you stay
But whatever you do

Shelby Lynne,"Like a child lost in the wilderness I knew not where to go
Surrounded by the emptiness of a love that left me cold
I stumbled through the darkness of nights that have no stars
And days that have no sunshine to warm my naked heart

Like a bird in flight brought down by stones from an unknown assailant's sling
A stranger took you from my arms and I lost everything
In days to come I nearly run out of ways to stay alive
But through it all I never lost the will to survive

And I'm not over you and I doubt that I'll ever be
But I've learned to live and you won't be the death of me oh no
Yes I've learned to live and I'm doing well but I'm not over you

Like a thief who takes just what he needs and he leaves the rest behind
You took the heart right out of me and you left me with my mind
And I've almost gone out of it at times believed I did
But gradually I learned you're someone I'll have to live with

But I'm not over you and I doubt
Yes I've learned to live and I'm doing well but I'm not over you",I've Learned to Live
Shelby Lynne,"I can see it your eyes

Your heart has grown weary
Just trying to find a little truth

It might be me
Lord, it might be me
If you still have an ounce of faith
I might be what you need, oh

It might be me, oh
It might be me to set you free
If you're still reaching for the light, Lord
Well, it might be me

Ooh, baby, baby, baby, take my hand

Well maybe I can make it on my own
I don't stay up wonderin' if you'll call
And some nights I don't dream of you at all
Your memory's still hurtin' me inside
That's something I'm still learnin' how to hide
Though this heart of mine has lost an ache or two
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

Looking down the line sometimes I think I see a change
But then I think again and think of you
Here and there I've turned a stone but the mountain hasn't moved
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

I'm still afraid of turning out the light
And it takes all my strength to face the night
Cause that's the time I face the bitter truth
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

Looking down the line sometimes",A Lighter Shade of Blue

Baby I knew
The moment that you touched my face

Oh, who would believe
And who would have ever thought
That deep in my soul

A little time apart would tell us what we need to know

A little time apart to try to make it on our own
Well I don't know about you, but I'm feelin' kinda lonely tonight

I would never fall in love again
Cause when you love somebody love s you
Their only gonna hurt you in the end
So I wrapped up all my memories
And put them all the shelf

No I've realized after all these year
S I need a heart to come home to
Someone I can tell my secrets to
I need a heart to hold on to
I need a sweet sweetheart
Like you

I can buy the groceries
And I can cook them on my own
I can pay the bills

That's what I'm longin' for,

Any fool could see that I'm
Fallin' fast, dancin' slow
Wonderin' where we go from
Here, tonight

Could it be friends
Could find so easily, love at last

Tell me where we go from here

We both know that life is so uncertain
A night like this may never come again
Maybe this is our one chance
For all we know

Payin' baby
Why'd you say you loved me - walk around and carry on
Hurting 'bout your love is gone, the song I sing is sad
And long, wonder if you are alone
I don't know if I belong

Your lies won't leave me - alone",Your Lies
Shelby Lynne,"Faith, hope, stay

Allow me to introduce you
To a place where trust talks to you
Taste

Take a moment, take one hundred years
It's sweet
No matter what comes, I am here

I just want to talk to you
Got some questions on my mind
I feel like you have gone away
I can't find you

I wonder where your head has been
Just want to be near you again
Feel like you are hiding from me
Gotta find you

Let's ignore off all our troubles
I will hold you like no other
I'm your father, I'm your mother
Trust me

Forget the past, we are the future
Together we're the perfect picture
I'm your cover, I'm your lover
Trust me

We're gonna go places
I'll take you there

Forever since you let me touch you
Did you forget how much I love you?
Don't you know how bad I want you?
Remember

Take a step back in my eyes
When we took up each other's time
With you in me I feel alive
You're my everything

Let's ignore off all our troubles
I will hold you like no other
I'm your father, I'm your mother
Trust me

Forget the past, we are the future
Together we're the perfect picture
I'm your cover, I'm your lover
Trust me

Back up, give up, hold up, time's up
Get up, look up, rise up, clean up
Baby, you know I got you
It's under control

Side ways, any way, new way, back way
Some way, other way, all way, my way
Baby, let go of it all
It's under control

Let's ignore off all our troubles
I will hold you like no other
I'm your father, I'm your mother
Trust me

Forget the past, we are the future
Together we're the perfect picture
I'm your cover, I'm your lover
Trust me

Oh, baby, let go
We're the future, perfect picture
Stay, this way
I am yours

Shelby Lynne,"Roses are red
Always trying to get ahead
Next thing you know ya dead
I used to think I could never
Make it without you
Then I was watching your eyes

[Chorus]
I say now ain't it, oh
Ain't it the truth
Don't you know about it, ain't it the truth

I was tattered and torn up
Never really felt brought up
Oh you told me it was OK to be
On my own
So I ran with the freedom
That you gave me

[Chorus]

I remember when you told me I was
Pretty amazing
I remember telling you, that you were crazy
Oh we were so under, overtime,
And what a good time it was",Ain't It the Truth
Shelby Lynne,"Engines rev and trumpets roar
I don't hear your voice no more
And living isn't worth the fear of dying
Wrapped up package torn up clothes
Empty days and deep dark holes
The only thing that keeps a man from crying

Oh if I don't get you back I'll fall upon a railroad track
And let the steel wheels cut right through my bones
Oh if I don't get you back I'll cover up my bloody tracks
With sorrow hopes and hide my dying pride
Oh cause I'm alive

Whispers in a losers dream
Holding on to not a thing
Cause these arms now are paralyzed without you to hold
Bold with crazy have no fear
Children cry and then I hear
The message my lies tell me in my dreams

Oh if I don't get you back I'll fall upon a railroad track
And let the steel wheels cut right through my bones
Oh if I don't get you back I'll cover up my bloody tracks
With sorrow hopes and hide my dying pride
Oh cause I'm alive

Maybe if I caught the rain
In pails that filter out the pain
I'd realize why you had to go
Days of lightning show the way
And night time creeps and holds at bay
The missing you, the mean, the cold, the ugly

Oh if I don't get you back I'll fall upon a railroad track
And let the steel wheels cut right through my bones
Oh if I don't get you back I'll cover up my bloody tracks
With sorrow hopes and hide my dying pride
Oh cause I'm alive



",I'm Alive
Shelby Lynne,"One with the sun
You and me
One with the sun
Living is free
I got you now
Won't let you go
Tomorrow's a memory
We'll never know
One with the sun
I'm listening to you
One as the sun
I hear what you say
I love you so much
You are the way it is

The planets are the stars
I think they are your eyes
And all of the stars will always be ours
We'll always be
One with the sun

Because we are one
With the sun
And we've just begun
There's another sun
Sun is on it's way
And we'll be one
With the sun



",One With the Sun
Shelby Lynne,"I can't be here anymore,
Just want it to be over. (Over.)
Wanna walk where the clouds are big,
An' covered in clover (Clouds of clover.)
I'm sorry I ever called.
Shoulda never, ever, ever picked up the 'phone. (Shoulda forgot your number.)
It's turned into a scary dream.
I never want it back at all.

I never really thought you would answer.
Now it's a big blown up thing.
I wish you hadn't been at home when the telephone rang.
When the telephone rang.

I've looked in faces that just looked away.
The eyes were dim and cloudy. (Can't see a thing.)
The pain of livin' with the hand that's dealt,
Is more than I can stand. (Can you take it? Can you take it? Can you take it?)
I can't forget all the mistakes I made,
It'd take a lifetime to erase them. (No, I can't go back.)
An' even I would never change a thing,
I can't waste any more time. (Time's a wastin', time's a wastin'.)

I never really thought you would answer.
Now it's a big blown up thing.
I wish you hadn't been at home when the telephone rang.
When the telephone rang.

Instrumental break.

I'm gettin' old an' my friends are few;
We're crossin' that big mountain. (Almost to the top, almost to the top.)
The sky fills of with the stars and moon and rain,
Pours like a fountain. (Water fallin' down.)
Oh, I could sit here in the midnight air,
An' look at what this life takes from me. (An' what it gives to you.)
An' count the reasons why I can't stand myself.
Just had to say these things anyway.

I never really thought you would answer.
Now it's a big blown up thing.
I wish you hadn't been at home when the telephone rang.-acap



",Telephone
Shelby Lynne,"Before you go walk out on me
Take a look around tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked
'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself a while
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
You could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart

So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best
If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake

If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake",Old Times Sake
Shelby Lynne,"Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world",Track 12
Shelby Lynne,"Can't believe the words you said your voice keeps hitting me in the head
I remember when you told me you'd never say mean things like that.
Thought you had your love in tact but I was wrong thinking things like that
Might be time to reconsider what my plans have been.

Cause when the girls walked by I could see that you never really wanted to be with me
Out the corner of your eye you were saying hi you're never satisfied.

You don't have a heart.
You don't have a soul.
You don't see things clear and baby I'm too old
To teach you about love
Or get down on my knees
I wish you the best but it's time for me to leave
No, You don't have a heart.

Oh I used to think that you had it all you said the words and I'd start to crawl
What a fool believes is the everything.
Oh I must have had a head made out of wood wasn't thinking with my brain like I know I should.
My heart led the way but I'm not ashamed.

Cause when a woman's blind to all the heartaches she never knows the price she's gonna have to pay
You stole my heart and took my pride but I'll survive and come out on the other side.

Chorus

Oh we all reap what we all sow your times coming you don't even know.
It's worth the wait to watch you burn
I'm front row center as the tables turn.

Shelby Lynne,"Willie & Laura Mae Jones
Were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us
In a shack just like our shack

The people worked the land together
And we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land
You don't have the time to think about another mans color

The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time

Sit out on the front porch
In the evening when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing
And everybody would mess around
Daddy'd bring out his guitar
And play on through the night
Every now and then ol Willie would grin and say
Hey, you play all right
Made me feel so good

I remember the best times of all
When Saturday came around
We all would stop by willies house and say
Do ya'll need anything from town?
He'd say no, but why don't ya'll stop on the way back through?
And I'll get Laura Mae, yeah, to cook up some barbecue
And you know thats good

The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine, yes it was
But that was another place and another time

Oh, the years rolled past the land
And took back what they'd given
We all knew we had to move
If we were gonna make a living

So we all moved off
And went about our separate ways
It sure was hard to say goodbye
To Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world",Sleigh Ride/Winter Wonderland

Wide with braces from ear to ear,
You doubt that you will ever be appealing.
Then Hallelujah! You are fifteen

How lovely to be a woman,
The wait was well worth while;
How lovely to wear mascara
And smile a woman's smile.
How lovely to have a figure,
That's round instead of flat;
Whenever you hear boys whistle,
You're what they're whistling at.
It's wonderful to feel
The way a woman feels;
It gives you such a glow just to know
You're wearing lipstick and heels!
How lovely to be a woman
And have one job to do;
To pick out a boy and train him
And then when you are through,
You've made him the man you want him to be!
Life's lovely when you're a woman like me!
How wonderful to know
The things a woman knows;
How marvelous to wait for a date
In simply beautiful clothes!
How lovely to be a woman
And change from boys to men,
To go to a fancy nightclub
And stay out after ten.
How lovely to be so grown-up and free!

Shelly Burns,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

Sweet little words coming out of your mouth

You're a silver tongued devil that had me believin'
Every promise you were bound to break
But you ain't getting back through this door

That you don't know where the time went

Should I be more sexy
Should I be more friend, than mom

Out on Highway 10
Was it the sting of leavin'
Or usin' her maiden name
That took all of the fun
Out of runnin' away
And she cried like a baby

Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

And that happy tune is your step

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

Which leads us to more suffering, tragedy and vice
Everyone's a victim, only few are safe
So we must take control before we become total slaves

Don't like where they're going, what they're doing
They're just waiting around
And you say you gotta move
You better think it through
All around the whole wide world
There's faces, different places
That we run to like we're running a race
Traveling around the whole wide world
Won't mean anything
If I can't sit in peace in one place
We're changing places
Always moving to escape our life's pain
In every city, different places, different faces
Keeps life new all the time
And I know I won't be happy just moving around
It's all just the same 'cause everywhere you go
You'll discovered that you're chased by your mind
We don't like standing around
Standing in one place
All that we can do

Shenandoah,"I’ll be the first to admit
Sometimes I seem to forget
To tell you how I feel
To show you my love is real

But, darling, let me tell you now
If you ever have any doubts
Just look in these eyes and you’ll see the truth
Girl, when it comes to my loving you

Always have, always will
Take my word, I will love you until
The night has no stars
And the beat of my heart stands still
Always have, always will

Times may not always be good
But whoever said that they would
But girl, when life’s not fair
Just know that I’ll be there

With a shoulder to always lean on
And a heart that will always be strong
Through valleys and hills, gray skies or blue
Girl, through it all, I’ll be loving you

Always have, always will
Take my word, I will love you until
The night has no stars
And the beat of my heart stands still
Always have, always will

Till the night has no stars
And the beat of my heart stands still
Always have, always will

Shenandoah,"Now you caught my eye without trying girl
You stole my heart away, from clear across the room
And somehow it was plain you felt the same
Looking back now we can’t say exactly how we knew

All a wise man needs
Is one glimpse of destiny

There’s an ancient fire deep in every heart
That no one but that perfect match can start
Like a bolt of lightning flashing in the dark
When fate lights forever up call it magic, call it love

Until that night, love at first sight
Was just a childish fantasy, like wishing on a star
If you ask me now, don’t ask me how
All I can say is I believe, the proof is in the heart

Natures strongest source
Will always take it’s course

There’s an ancient fire deep in every heart
That no one but that perfect match can start
Like a bolt of lightning flashing in the dark
When fate lights forever up call it magic, call it love

That no one but that perfect match can start

It's hurting to stay in this frame that won't fade,
You promised a kiss in a bottomless pitt,
And you wonder why I'm lying awake.

You say you've had enough, you say we're outta love,
But this is something that we both thought we could rise above.
You say you're missing me, we're both in agony,
Or is it just the thought of someone else taking me?

I'm flying,
I'm flying
I'm flying, away
I'm flying away
I'm flying, I'm flying, away!

Spun like a mummy but they missed our eyes

Her trench coat hangs inside her door

A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here

People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much

Sherrié Austin,"He was a hot-blooded rebel, he was aiming to please
He had more than a tattoo up his sleeve
Marylou, Peggy Sue, Suzy Q, Norma Jean

He was pretty as a picture on his motorbike
He never met a mirror that he didn't like
Sorry dude, with your rude attitude, take a hike

Goodness, gracious, mercy me
Somebody tell me when will I be

Lucky, lucky in love
Roll myself a seven when I throw the dice
I've been waiting for the king of hearts
Still I get the joker every time
When will I be, lucky in love

I met a sweet-talking guy from Paris, Tennessee
He bought me French fries at the Dairy Queen
He came on strong, before too long, he was on bended knee

Now when I hear his footsteps up my block
I hear the tick of his biological clock
Sorry hon', gotta run, it's been fun, still in shock

Goodness, gracious, mercy me
Somebody tell me when will I be

Sherrié Austin,"I was trapped in a castle tower
Locked up in chains
I waited for my prince to save me
But he never came

I woke up with my heart pounding
Convinced that I was cursed
I picked up a romance novel
And read the last page first

Oh, oh, oh it's me
I want to fall in love so hard it hurts
I want the kind of love that moves the earth
Oh, I want more than I can take
Till my poor heart starts to ache
I want to fall in love so hard it hurts

I took a ride with a guy from Tupelo
In his Chevrolet
He said, ""Baby, we're moving way too fast
And slammed on the brakes""

We got out and he lit a cigarette
We didn't say too much
He packed up his emotional baggage
And left me in the dust

Oh, oh, it's me
I want to fall in love so hard it hurts
I want the kind of love that moves the earth
I want more than I can take

Well that's no news to me

In the parking lot I saw two cowboys
Fighting for a handicapped space
So what is a girl to do now boys
To make sense of this place

There's too much wrong in the world tonight
Too much I can't understand
I wanna board up these windows and turn out these lights
And lie down with an innocent man, oh lie down with an innocent man

I don't need a strong man's protection
No I don't want a faithless man's love
Just a little respect and affection
Would be more than enough

'Cause I've been shot down by love's aimless arrows
And I've shot a few wild ones myself
But these days the choices are narrow
And you've got to aim well

Sherrié Austin,"Your love was reckless baby I fell deep
Easy to hold but you were hard to keep
You were a heartache waiting to be
We took off flying down a dead end street

I never knew that love could hurt so bad
When you said goodbye with a tip of your hat
I watched you leaving across the welcome mat
And though I know that you ain't coming back

One solitary tear is all I'll cry
One solitary tear falling, falling,
Falling from my eyes
I'll get over you I'll get by
One solitary tear at a time

Little things remind me that you're gone
The mailman still brings all your catalogs
The radio just keeps on playing our songs
But I tell myself that I have to be strong

One solitary tear is all I'll cry
One solitary tear falling, falling,
Falling from my eyes
I'll get over you I'll get by

Are buried in the sand

Further and further apart

A house divided will not stand
Hold on, hold on
We gotta hold on to each other

The only place to start

And you can only say so much with the slamming of a door
Maybe with a kiss
And a little forgiveness

In a frame on a mantle in a house
Piece by piece they put their world together
Some kids a mortage and a pair of wedding vows
She's a mother and a working woman
He sweats 9 to 5 with big dreams in his head
There's too much month at the end of the money
Wolf's at the door and the bankbook's in the red
I guess every fairy tale has a monster underneath the bed

That wide-eyed boy and girl
What happens after happy- ever-after

He phones in messages to say he's working late
So hard to find a tender moment together
So many modern ways to miscommunicate
Guess every honey moon has and experation date

May be faded and worn

Sherrié Austin,"Some hearts don't get far
Like a shootin' star they burn out fast
Some loves are like worn out shoes
You got used to not made to last

But our love's as big as the sky
A million miles long and just as wide
Deeper than the deepest will
One little push and then I feel

And I'm still
I'm still fallin'
Fallin' for you darlin'

Every day, evey way, everything you do or say
Hear me callin'
I'm still fallin' for you

Your kiss gives me a thrill
I can't get my fill of this desire
I know a touch takes me straight to the moon
Like a hot air balloon we go higher and higher

I don't need no parachute
'Cause I got you to hold on to
They say what goes up must come down
But I'm nowhere near the ground

'Cause I'm still
I'm still fallin'
Fallin' for you darlin'

Every day, evey way, everything you do or say
Hear me callin'
I'm still fallin' for you

Well, have I landed on my feet again
Just like I do every time?
And if you want to be my friend
Treat me right

People say I'm so aloof
Well, it's just because I have learned
To stay away from that hot tin roof
So, I won't get burned

Like a cat, I'm the cautious kind
Yeah, I'd usually be gone by now
But it's something 'bout you that I like
And I just might stick around
I just might stick around

You don't play those silly games
Just like all the others do
You laugh at my peculiar ways
And I laugh back at you

Oh, I'd usually be gone by now
But it's something 'bout you that I like

Places I shouldn't go

Let's put our fears to the test

Come to me now with a love unafraid
Lay your heart down and stay
Leave the window open, don't pull the shades
Let the morning sun show we've made, love unafraid

The moonlight is chasin', the shadows away
We got no more secrets to hide
So don't fight this feeling, don't be ashamed
Of the need we've been keepin' inside

Come to me now with a love unafraid
Lay your heart down and stay
Leave the window open, don't pull the shades
Let the morning sun show we've made, love unafraid

Make no promises, tell no lies
And don't close your eyes

Come to me now with a love unafraid

Let the morning sun show we've made, love unafraid

Sherrié Austin,"See our picture on the wall
Why were we smiling, I just can't seem to recall
Remind me
Do you see this wedding band
Wasn't it once worth more than just gold on my hand
Remind me

Chorus:
I don't care who's right or wrong
But my memory of love is almost gone
Won't you take me in your arms
And remind me
You criticize and accuse
Oh, but honey you've had amnesia too
Kiss me like you used to do
And remind me

It's a short walk to that door
But didn't we have something good
That's still worth fighting for
Remind me

(chorus)

How did we end up this way
Me against you
In love one is never to blame
It always takes two
Do you remember, my dear
The first time we made love, come over here
And let me remind you.

Sherrié Austin,"In a pair of faded coveralls and her mama's old high heels
She wobbles up and takes a shaky bow
She smiles a little smile that hides her missing baby tooth
And she manages to sing that way some how

Why she starts with 'Delta dawn' and goes into 'Amazing grace'
Then squints her eyes and sings 'I fought the law'
And when the wind comes sweeping in and ripples through the corn
To her it sounds exactly like applause

She's just singing to the scarecrow, dancing through the fields
With a kitten and bo-jingles in her arms
Trying to let the whole world know how wonderful it feels
To be here on this South Kentucky Farm
Singing to the scarecrow

She looks his patchwork eyes and looks into his heart
And tries to find a song to ease his pain
And she sings 'Faded love' until the sunny sky grows dark
And his tears are falling in the somber rain

And she's singing to the scarecrow, dancing through the fields
With a kitten and bo-jingles in her arms
Trying to let the whole world know how wonderful it feels
To be here on this South Kentucky Farm
Singing to the scarecrow

Well, now that little girl is grown, she's in a band out on the road
She left those Green Kentucky fields behind
But she sings herself back home when she's at the microphone
And she smiles that funny smile and shuts her yes

Yeah, she's still singing to the scarecrow

Visiting hours are over, time for our bedside tug of war.
This sleeping child between us may not make it through the night.
I'm fighting back the tears as she fights for her life.

Well, it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
She's much too young to be on her own:
Barely just turned seven.
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven?

Tell me God, do you remember the wishes that she made,
As she blew out the candles on her last birthday cake?
She wants to ride a pony when she'd big enough.
She wants to marry her Daddy when she's all grown up.

Well, it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
She's much too young to be on her own:
Barely just turned seven.
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven?

Lord, don't you know she's my angel
You got plenty of your own
And I know you hold a place for her
But she's already got a home
Well I don't know if you're listenin'
But praying is all that's left to do
So I ask you Lord have mercy, you lost a son once too

And it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me: what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
Lord, I know once you've made up your mind,
There's no use in beggin'.
So if you take her with you today, will you make sure she looks both ways,
And would you hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven.

Call it the chance of a lifetime
Call it the deepest blue
Season two, a change in the storyline
Well I'm not afraid of what lies ahead
I remember something that someone said
""If you never think, you never change your mind""

So I'll be looking my best tonight if I lose the fight
Or fall asleep for the final time
You can come with me but you'll be cutting in line
So listen to me yeah

I can make you feel alive (alive)
And if the world is racing by tonight
We'll watch it run
And even if the end's begun, its fine
We can walk across our line
With our hopes and spirits high
Who knows what we'll find together on the other side

Oh my love, you think that its over
But I think it's just begun
And season one was a tap on your shoulder
Well I'm not afraid of what lies ahead
I remember something that someone said
""If you never blink, you never feel your eyes""

But you'll be trying your best tonight not to lose the fight
Don't fall asleep, even close your eyes
But to your surprise love, the whole whole tunnel is light
With walls of the purest white

I'm, alive, tonight

I can make you feel alive (alive)
And if the world is racing by tonight
We'll watch it run
And even if the end's begun, its fine
We can walk across our line
With our hopes and spirits high
Who knows what we'll find together on the other side

I guess its not for us to decide

Where the brightest blues and greens just turn to brown

Making sense of all that you left behind
When I arrange it into columns and lines
I always think it's adding up, but it never does
So in the morning maybe I'll be alright
And through the day I'll prepare for the fight
With a fever on a Saturday night
Cause this is giving me the shakes and butterflies, oh

And if you don't stop running you can never breathe
When everything you want is everything you see
But when it comes to decision baby, him or me
Well I hope you can feel the need

What made you an alley cat scratching me?
You dig deep with your nails and flash your teeth
And run off to where your next big meal could be
What made you an alley cat scratching me?
You dig deep with your nails and flash your teeth
And run off because you must be tired of me
Run off because you must be tired of me

And there's a scene I will always replay
At the moment when my hand touched your face
I could see your eyes turning away
But I've been standing my ground with you babe

And if you don't stop running you can never breathe
When everything you want is everything you see
But when it comes to decision baby, him or me
Well I hope you can feel the need

What made you an alley cat scratching me?

And run off to where your next big meal could be

And now I fall in love with somebody everyday
As they step aside when I'm walking by, or smile at something I say
But I promised you it would never get in the way
Of stability but the joke's on me

Well he carried you away, oh

I'm far away to night you feel it, but I'll creep in your room, tell him our plans and lights before us, and he'll do the same for me. Recount the history, of love and lost in lie, and giving up this crown of city lights. But he's content to shine and stay.
(Chorus:)

What a dream we have to offer, (what a dream.)What a try to make this all our own(all our own.)To take this town and make this home. What a plan to set in motion (what a plan) What a try to make this all our own (all our own) To take this place and make this home. Make this home (make this home) Make this hoOome. Make this home. Make this home...
",Home
Sherwood,"


And I've been spending too much time in California
Where your feelings change but seasons never do
And in my dream last night I felt a storm was coming
But awoke to sunny skies of baby blue

And I call her up to let her go today
For a moment thought it easier then being away
But through the tangled thread the needle finds a way
And I'm asking her to stay

And I've been spending all my time composing letters
To a girl who lives a thousand miles away
But writing never takes the place of living
And I need her arms, I need her smile again

And she called me up to let me go today
For a moment thought it easier than being away
But through the tangled thread the needle finds a way
And I'm asking her to stay

Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?






",I'm Asking Her to Stay
Sherwood,"


Tonight I'm staring at the moonlight
Tonight I'm wondering how this could've felt so right
And I could say it was a good time
But I can hardly say a thing
He's got you right where he wants you
Right where he wants you

He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
No I'm fine, I can go another time with you
But tell me why would I want to

And will you still be feeling alright
In the morning with the sun creeping through the blinds?
And will you say it was a good time?
And you will you tell him anything?
He's got you right where he wants you
Right where he wants you

He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
No I'm fine, I can go another time with you
But tell me why would I want to
He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
No I'm fine, I can go another time with you
But tell me why would I want to

And I've been away for far too long it seems
And this new group of friends is making me, ready again to leave
I'm ready again to leave

He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
No I'm fine, I can go another time with you
But tell me why would I want to
He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
No I'm fine, I can go another time with you
But tell me why would I want to
But tell me why would I want to






",Middle of the Night
Sherwood,"This room's been dusted
And it's covered in prints from 
The month you spent with me.
And I've cataloged it,
Arranged the report with a chapter every week
And I've studied sleepless
Biting my nails and grinding my teeth.

And I think I've had it,
But that makes two of us,
'Cause you've had it with me.

And here in the meantime,
I'm a fly on the wall, and glued to the action.
A twist in the plotline,
A demand for a call, the loss of attraction.

And I'll tell you the worst part:
You're exactly the way that I thought you would be
So I'll stay for the last call
'Cause I'd move away, but I'm never ready to leave.
Whoa, whoa.
Well I'd move away but I'm never ready to leave.

This house is haunted
But not in the way that you've always heard it said
No dusty attic
No razor teeth making camp beneath your bed.

But I've heard them walking late at night
The twins of confusion and regret
And they share ths stories of things that I have done
That I'd rather just forget.

Here in the meantime,
I'm a fly on the wall, and glued to the action.
A twist in the plotline,
A demand for a call, the loss of attraction.

And I'll tell you the worst part:
You're exactly the way that I thought you would be
So I'll stay for the last call
'Cause I'd move away but I'm never ready to leave.

So this is how it feels to be 24
A thief without a key to an open the door
Just peering through the window
For any clue,
Or anything explaining a part of you.

I guess the real question is, I don't know,
Is, why I am afraid of letting go?
Why am I afraid of letting go?

Here in the meantime,
I'm a fly on the wall, and glued to the action.
A twist in the plotline,
A demand for a call, a loss of attraction.

And I'll tell you the worst part:
You're exactly the way that I thought you would be
So I'll stay for the last call
'Cause I'd move away but I'm never ready to leave.
Whoa, whoa
Well I'd move away but I'm never ready to leave.
'Cause I'd move away but I'm never ready to leave.
Well I'd move away but I'm never ready to leave.
",Never Ready to Leave
Sherwood,"And I'm ok
Seems I just needed a break
Sat down but now I'm up again
And finding out I'm alone
My friends left me behind
And into another town
Where this boy is not around
And I don't blame them
I'd do the same

And now I'm alone again

So I'll sing along to the only song I've ever known
And I'll sing it out to the lonely ones, oh oh oh
Those days are gone but the nights roll on taking their place
So I'm singing it out to the lonely ones

Hey, let's write the story again
Where I'm your lover and best friend
Pack our backs and we'll leave this old ghost town behind
And into another town
Where this boy is not around
He made the mistake of leaving you

That was mistake number two

So I'll sing along to the only song I've ever known
And I'll sing it out to the lonely ones, oh oh oh
Those days are gone but the nights roll on taking their place
So I'm singing it out to the lonely ones

Hey, let's write the story again
Where I'm your lover and best friend

So I'll sing along to the only song I've ever known
And I'll sing it out to the lonely ones, oh oh oh
Those days are gone but the nights roll on taking their place
So I'm singing it out to the lonely ones, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh",The Only Song
