Myrrh,"Oh, come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

God of God
Light of light
Lo, he abhors
Not the virgin's womb
Very God
Begotten not created
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of heaven above
Glory to God
In the highest

O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord

See how the shepherds
Summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks
Draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither bend
Our joyful footsteps
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus
To thee be glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord",O Come All Ye Faithful
Mysteries of Life,"Woke up this mornin' feelin' fine
There's somethin' special on my mind
Last night I met a new girl in the neighbourhood, whoa yeah
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')

She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
(she danced with me like I hoped she would)
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')

We only danced for a minute or two
But then she stuck close to me the whole night through
Can I be fallin' in love
She's everthing I've been dreamin' of
She's everthing I've been dreamin' of

I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
(I asked to see her and she told me I could)
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin', ahhh)

I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could

(somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good

To something good, oh yeah, something good

To something good, something good, something good",I'm into Something Good
Mysteries of Life,"Something moving in my backyard
Left a matchbook as a calling card
Tried to follow
The trail went dry
By a phone booth
So I went inside
Underneath the receiver
You left behind
A fingerprint
Two hours later
A car went by

It's a long shot
But it caught my eye
I've been driving around all day
In the same spot
Getting further away
I was paying a meter

No mistaking it
It's one of a kind
A perfect negative
One of a kind
Nearly positive
It was you

By a red door down a long hall

Another side of town
Partly on a dare
We both were there on an anonymous tip

There was something to it, all right
Couldn't be more clear
But I couldn't hear 'til you bit your lip

Don't let's talk around it

Mysterio,"In a time where the sun descends alone,
I ran a long long way from home
to find a heart that's made out of stone.

I will try,
I just need a little time
to get your face right out of my mind,
to see the world through different eyes

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
but when we meet it seems I can't let go.
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Tell me why?
When I scream there's no reply,
when I reach out there's nothing to find,
when I sleep I break down and cry

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
but when we meet it seems I can't let go.
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Fading like a rose,
fading like a rose,
beaten by the storm,
talking to myself,
getting washed by the rain,
it's such a cold cold town.",Fading Like a Flower

From what he didn't know

How did I behave?

Fixed sheets of mirror plate on my electric guitar

Well we were an odd couple you and I
In our strange and original attire
I thought, I thought it was love at first sight
My mother, my mother she shivered with fright

And I couldn't tell if you were boy or girl
My mind was in such a swirl
It was a case of grist to the mill
True love grows, it grows where it will

Alas oh Agnes, I still adore you
Oh Agnes [Repeat: x4]

Oh Agnes it all ended up in tears
But you still have your souvenirs
You've got scars from head to toe
It's getting hard to tell your friends from foes

When you picked me up at the station
After my back street operation
You broke me, you broke the painful news
You dumped me, you dumped me for a pretty young muse

So the lessons are there to learn
My scars are caused my cigarette burns
I have no mirrors and I spend my days
Reminiscing on your porcelain gaze

Alas oh Agnes, I still adore you

Mystery Jets,"Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Outside the school gates
We first met in a basement near the park
(Diamonds in the dark)
We danced all night and then we kissed
Your smile like diamonds in the dark

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

We would have little children
We would be together forever
(Diamonds in the dark)
We would live on Delancy Street
But then you cut your hair and it ended there

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Now I've nothing left to lose
I'm clinging to a cliff-face staring at your shoes
And tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me do you feel the same?
Or are we just waiting to a day we can't
A day that we can't change, we can't change?

And now there's this no man's land
Between you and me
(Diamonds in the dark)
But I still wander in between
The sheets and streets and other places we've been

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Back and back again, back and back again
Back and back again, back and back again
Back and back again, back and back again
Back again

Mystery Jets,"I have a plane
One of the few with roundels on its wings
A lullaby for me and you
When it flies high, it sings

Rock me to sleep with Que Sera
Dear Mum do you suppose?
As I feel my eyelids close
The other side is not so far 

I dug a hole under the ground
Made myself a den
It's there that I can be found
Not if you return but when

There's a place, a place called hell
I've spent some time there
In the dark I cast a spell
To bury all of my fears

Oh Dymphna! Oh Dymphna! Oh Dymphna!
I would that I could spell your name

Once I fell from a great height
""Are you ready? I've come for you""

""Not yet"" I said, ""I've got some things to do""

I once loved before does, it matter anymore

Dreaming of another you

The future gets shorter the longer we wait 
So let's step on the gas and if they come to find us 
We'll run to the hills they say hills never loved us 
But since we were children these wonderful wonderful people 
Will read of our love on our tombstones and cry 

And someone will get all the glory 
But I'll have yours and you'll have mine, you'll have mine 

So may the bridges we burn light the way 
Out of the darkness of where we have been 
Though at times it may feel like a lie 
We both know nothing is quite as it seems 
And I know when I look into the deep blue of your eyes 
Heaven will still be ours 

We'll be together until hell, 
Until hell, until hell freezes over 
Until hell, until hell, 
Until hell, freezes over. 
Together until hell, until hell 
Until hell, freezes over. 
Until hell, until hell, 
Until hell, freezes over. 

So may the bridges we burn light the way 
Out of the darkness of where we have been 
Though at times it may feel like a lie 
We both know nothing is quite as it seems 
Then when the world is itself about to die 
Our story will still play itself on the screens 
And all these stars that come falling from the sky 
Will always be ours",Radlands
Mystery Jets,"I was gripped with a bit of fear
Worried the one thing that I loved
Back when I was just a kid
Might now never be enough
That the body I was in
Might belong to someone else
Someone kinder
Someone surer
Someone innocent
Young and beautiful
Someone purer

I was scratching at my skin
Hopin changes would begin
But what laid beneath was blood
Well of course
What the hell was I thinking of
Won't you take me down to the creek
Wash away our sins of sleep
I feel so tired
As though I might
Not wake at all on the other side
That's no way to go

Oh my dear one
Bathe me in your glow
Cut out my lonely heart
And bury it in the snow
Nothing really means nothing
Is the saddest thing I know
So deliver me from sin
And give me rock and roll

Give me rock and roll

And in the morning there'll be hope
And in the morning there'll be light
And if I sleep and dream up a system
A solution
To fend off perils of the night
Come on in, I'll be born again
Born again as someone else
Someone kinder
Someone surer
Someone beautiful
Someone purer

And when I am you'll know
And when I am you'll know

??????
The devil knows my name
Will salvation come
And wash away my pain?
For I was once a kid
With a pure and innocent soul
So deliver me from sin
And give me rock and roll

Give me rock and roll
Give me rock and roll
A pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul

Give me rock and roll

Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people

Mystic Moods Orchestra,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?",Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)

Finally knowing the one
That I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again

Severed off from the vain

To someone less it runs deep on an unseen plain

Losing personality replaced by the devil's frame
Madness, uncanny love for the fact his life is lived in sadness

My relation to these words spoken over beats leaps to and fro
All around, bound the energy in miles
Piles up towards the sky
High quantity of thoughts

On the clock of life, the mirror view
The clearest of reflection
Inspection of the lie that lies deep behind the stressin'
And it's pressing me like time
Rhymes is just illusions
A world in confusion
A dream of revolution

Skip rocks, waves making ripple effects
Situations etched, lessons in stone tablets
For the reference to the habit
Forming addictions to the memories of past shit
I let go, it comes back

I want to shake my coat tails
They follow on the missions of my failure
Bring me down, crush me

Before you could taste the cream, they sliced it up and threw it out

Remember these good times and these hard times

Reflectin' signs of anger, reflection banger, reflection slanger
Reflection bombing hangars of 747's

[Murs the Problem Child] 
Damn! y'all fools conceited reaction to the title 
Heard the first time but quickly changed your mind 
Once the performance is completed seated in the back 
Too cool to throw yo' hands up; I never quite understood 
Alla that what you too tough to have fun? 
Frisked at the door so I know it ain't the gun 
In your waistline that got you shootin daggers in my face 
When I rhyme - times done changed and it's strange 
Got motherfuckers ain't smiled at a rap show in a while 
Probably since the Fresh Prince was in style 
So it's apparent that you just don't understand 
The meanest mug in the club, don't make yo' ass the man 
Now if you want to be a fan then that's fine 
But all I really want to do is just break through to your mind 
And show you just because you did some hood time 
Don't make it impossible to have a good time when you out 
See where I'm from, it's the hardest motherfuckers come to party 
All shermed out, so what's this really all about? 
You gelled, cause this man's double L, well hell 
PSC tells me, it's jealousy that grips the heart 
Quit wasting playing hard roles, when yo' ass is 
Really just a mark and I should NEVER feel threatened 
Cause you see that man behind me? 
MURS.. U.. R.. S.. 

""He's a living legend.""

[PSC] 
When night falls I enter; being of a higher breed 
Of emcee I'll injure all these would-be rap crews 
The wannabe fat fools, coulda been rap dudes 
Refuse 'em resist 'em like Prop 187 do Mexicans 
Again and again, it's the Legends 
Lucky am I on wax, and on everyone's tape 
PSC the best friend of chorus 
The poorest excuse for you, to quit your boyfriend 
Just give him a chance (baby baby gimme one more chance) 
He'll rap right, if not, check my mic all night 
I rap tight, see me catching flights 
At the international terminal, where you don't go 
So don't go and diss, big groups, will get ripped 
And tripped by mic cords, and choked, with cordless 
A gift, of smooth talk, walk the walk of a winner 
Far from a beginner, guess who's for dinner? 

[The Crow Eligh] 
Cerebral tornadoes rip logic like frolicking paperbacks 
The tone is incomplete extension, in all of the later tracks 
Extracting vitamins, from machinery that creates it 
As long as the people are fiending for the truth 
And not counterfeit, I'm the bounty sheriff merit holder 
Winner of awards in the midst, of clashing swords 
It's match point on the court, a point is scored 
Referee the rest will see my yellow warning on the toilet seat 
At least I have my dignity, infinity, a legendary entity forever 

""He's a living legend..""

[Aesop] 
A legendary flame of a character with no name 
Same instance, persistence to have latitudes 
Bruise your knees, you will lose 
A life or limb, whichever you choose 
Find some foe in him, words tend to catch a phrase 
That will amaze most from the gazing point, with a judgment standard 
Categorized into a tainted picture before it gets a chance to be painted 
There's no blanket for the truth (I can't see!) 
I got a loose end of a lie, this amateur he tried to get by 
The size is more greater, and equator more immense 
Since it makes more sense to make some sense, or maybe you know 
Out of these weak ass rhymes you roam but you stay in flow 
In this dense a body of mockery 

[BFAP Jenkins] 
Black lightning lighting up the sky, fighting the type 
Copywriting history - writing transistory 
Bay lines for your mind every time we enter the stage 
We split and fade, most, Sunspot Jonz, toast 
Goodbye to crust emcees; often lonely and homely 
If you could only capture the power of love 
Like ten albums in this glove, R.B.I. 
While you hittin pop flies.. and sacrifice your life 
And die in hurricane and methane 
We below shit like propane, Living Legends spiritual cocaine 
In a line if you know 
What's up with the times cause we straw the line 
(We straw the line) 

[Arata C7S - Japanese Rap (Unknown lyrics)]

[The Bad News Bear Grouch] 
Let's get literal it's me and my team, I got a dream 
(""He's a living legend.."") and a clean way to achieve it 
I conceived it myself, with a little bit of help, from my friends 
Made amends with my soul, now I'm ready to begin 
First ingredient is dope shit, and fool we already wrote it 
Mix up with the motives now we're forming perfect batter 
Had a vision it would burn, if I measured too precisely 
I add a pinch here and, there if the spice be right 
We might prepare this feast for many thousands 
So eat when you're aroused and enjoy - Legendary bitch!

[First Verse:]

BEWARE!
The man with the braids done walked in
Mild mannered like Clark Kent
I'M rougher and tougher than dead shark skin
This man gonna be have you flippin' like the pages of (???)
Evil like Cruella
Five minutes later I'ma still be hard as an armadillo
Roll like an eighteen wheeler
Shinin' like the slipper
Of Cinderella
And bad weather
And acapella
THIS FELLA
TOP SELLER!!!!
Gonna be that way til' I'm old as Mandela
STILL GETTIN' BETTER!!!!!
Writin' rhymes I'm best of 'em
I'm the arrester, I'm the professor
I'm the nigga that keep his picture on your girlfriend's dresser
Now really
Tell me what you muthafuckas know about gettin' ROWDY
Tell your whole Sunday gang bout it
BITCH I BEEN BOUT IT!!!!!
Now, I kick the rest of you into HASH
BOW GRASSHOPPER, BOW TO THE MAN!!!!!!!

[Chorus]

[Second Verse:]

AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Bet'cha runnin'
I bet'cha, bet'cha I'm best that I'm better
Run with a letter
Swift as a jet or keep up with the pace setter
Sparkle like glitter
HARD HITTER
HOE GO-GETTER
SIDE STEPPIN' FROM NO NIGGA!!!!!!
Whenever you bitches decide you gonna get too big for your britches
Leavin' you stitches
Diggin' ditches
Sufferin' hickeys, cuts, scrapes, bruises, welts
Don't fuck with the RHYMIN' BLACK BELT
WATCH YOURSELF!!!!!!!
BOOM!!!!! HERE I GO!!!!!!!
BOOM BOOM!!!!!!!!  I KNOW!!!!!!!
y'all niggas can't fuck with the man with two tongues, 'cause that's the way I flow
'cause I can get hot like fire
And you can't put it out, it's like tip-toein' on top of barbed wire
For instance, persistence
No resistance, stay your distance
Is vital to your existence
You leave it to me to show you the way out
I'm never gonna play ya
I'LL TAKE YOUR OLD LADY
EVEN IF I TOOK MY BRAIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDS OUT!!!!!!!!!

[Chorus]

[Third Verse:]

And I'm uh, ready, and it looks like ALL you bitches are rusty
y'all can't buss me, don't cuss me
Hit'cha, so much muthafuckin' we gone leave this bitch musty
You disgust me
Trust me
When Mystikal hits the door, you bitches be SCREAMIN' to touch me
I'm the invisible man you can't see me
I'm mackin' illusions and confusion
I'm abusin', your conclusion, and contusions, from the bruises
Issuin' these muthafuckas with the style that them bitches want
FIVE FOOT ELEVEN, screamin' to heaven
I say FUCK SHIT GOD DAMN
Bitch respect me like a reverend, and...
Congregation say ""Amen""
(Amen)
Come through this muthafucka swingin' like a CAAAAVEEMAAAN
And you against me, you better not say it go back in the water
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come
UP JUMP THE SHIT STORM!!!!!!
From the rats
Rollin' out
Since you want to BOW muthafucka
BOW to the master!

Mystikal,"Walking through the mind of Mystikal
No holds barred
Still don't give a fuck about y'all

I'm still not the nigga to fuck with busta
? the average nigga don't fuck with me
Fool a nigga in size, ain't much none of ya'll niggas can do with me
Typically speakin', I'm not what your seekin'
Now vision the rhymes that I be keepin'
I fuck like a Mahican, ain't drunk like them demons,
I'm quicker then one of those puerto ricans
Get it off your chest
Don't run on my set, I'm breakin' your neck
If you gettin' upset I'm breakin' a sweat
Y'all niggas ain't ready yet
I'm catching my breath, y'all niggas ain't findin wind
I'm keepin' they momma from tryin' again
I done fucked up more niggas then Heineken
Fuck, I'm cute as a puppy, you smart as a guppy
Now how you gonna fuck me, that bitch get lucky she fucked me
And now that hoe can't stop thinkin' of me
I'm thinkin' of much wealth, come tell ya how gettin' fucked felt
Ask them niggas that know me now
Even them bitches will tell you I'm somthin' else
Bitches, they like my good looks
But niggas can't stand that right hook
They might look but they stay put
I done stomped more niggas than Big Foot
What I mean is I'm grand, you can't fuck with this peacan man
You don't know who I am, you goin' too fast, slow down Tito, damn

Nigga go ring the alarm
I came in this bitch, and I'm in the swarm
My niggas are already armed
Were turnin' this bitch into Vietnam
Nigga go ring the alarm
I came in this bitch, and I'm in the swarm
My niggas are already armed
Were turnin' this bitch into Desert Storm

I stick to the left like a thumb tack
I hum that to the drum track
No wives, tote no knives,
Bitch I'm sharper then a pair of Filas
See I'm humble, you fuckin' 'em right, I'm makin 'em mumble
Don't stumble, hoe I ? the seen it for your fuckin' gumbo
When a homie compare me, but spare me i'm a rap figure
Please never don't dare me, bitch I barely kept an ? nigga
I run with the real niggas, they kill, they them ill niggas
You best to chill niggas,
I don't fuck with them run-of-the-mill niggas
Here's what you gonna feel nigga

Heavy pressure from both sides, as the brain collides

I'm tellin' them lip lies, I hang with hip guys
I split thighs, bitch don't ask me for shit
You get nothin', no tighter then grip ?
Fuck nigga, don't bother me and try to be, and tired of me
Walkin' out the hood with more bitches number then lottery
Look, I like fuckin' around, but I ain't fuckin' with no fuckery
Luckily, none of you niggas in here ain't cold enough to fuck with me
Fuck niggas can't touch that, no ?, get the fuck back
Fore you find yourself achin from you ass crack to your nut sack
I run these hoe brand niggas from the back of the map
To the front of China
Just when you thought it was safe to back in the water,
I'm right behind ya

We as one must combine to never be stopped nann man

Novice, servants, fiendins, demons, devils,
Griffins, goons, raidin' rebels
Women, wizards, warlocks, witches
Punk fags like bitches
Gold, platnium, silver, copper
Any kind of pussy popper gets wopped or chopped
When Mystikal hits that door, now watch
Nigga want a big cock, get popped like Hitchcock
When I rib shot, when I hip hop, that zip lock that's thick knot
Ohh, it's goin though me, got me struttin'
When E.F. Hutton talks everybody listens

Bust up and then I may get they lips bloody,
Your back nutty,
Aw, y'all niggas ain't ready for me,
But if you want me, who clamps?
I'm shell-bound, watch me throw down on my first go-round,
Here's our shit, properly did it and now you're evicted,
Now admit it, fuck that yin-yang, you talkin' behind my back Mr. Hood Critics,
You're all on my dick hun,
Get one, lick one,

Sharp as glass,
Bitch you might think this nigga be lickin' the pussy 'cause my tongue fast,
Hoe, but that's a no-no,
Oh, you mean you don't know?
Mr. Hood Critic told you what? I'm lickin' pussy on the down-low?
Now if I'd did it, I'd admit it and walk around proud,
But tellin' no fables, on this label, pussy eaters ain't allowed,
Now I be comin' around the mountain like ""Oh Susanna""

Home of the boot camp clicc,

And hit the bricks before I do you in

[Chorus]

[Mystikal]
Pull your shirt down bitch
I know you got a gat, but I ain't scared bout that bullshit
It don't matter how many fuckin guns you got
The only thing that MATTER, is a nigga, to get the first shot
'cause if I peep, that ass is fallin to the street
Bitch retreat or that ass is deeeeeeead meat
Smack your teeth, but I'ma knock you off your fuckin feet
They gone pick you up, piece-by-piece off that concrete street
When N.O. meet, who gives a fuck about a poor neat scene?
We got beef, so I'ma shoot'cha like a FAKE BITCH
Let you know just who you fuckin' with
But I ain't that type of nigga
that's liable to shoot you over no DUMB SHIT!
If I'ma pop ya, I'ma pop ya for just cause

So when you're out bitch, move or I won't step
'cause if I catch'cha I'ma drill ya in your fuckin chest
I ain't gone gone ride by and pop, cause I might miss
I'ma walk up to your FACE, Pop POINT BLANK BITCH!!!
That's what you get, from out there tryin to go act bad
Not even BRUCE LEE, could whoop a bullet ass
Got'cha, come, get this ass whoopin

Nigga fetcher, satisfied when you're on the stretcher
You might run but I'ma CATCH 'EM!!!!

[Chorus]

[Mystikal]
(Yo nigga you caught that bitch yet?)
FUCK NO! I ain't caught that bitch yet
I done been through every scandalous sight, and every project
But I bet'cha, when I stop, runnin behind em
Get up, pack my shit and I'll STOP, and then I'll fuckin find him
Yo dumb ass in the street
Fuck that shit, 'cause I'ma catch your ass this week
Monday, a one day when you go play [alot of gunfire], goes the A.K.
Sprayin on his ass like a roach, and if I approach, too late to duck hoe
Drop, run, fall, kick, scream, now curse
How in the fuck you gone duck a twelve round burst?
Hammin at that ass on Tuesday, put up the nine
Go get the A.K.
Bitch if I catch you in the mall Wednesday
That's the day that ass fall
Then it might be Thursday, three round burst day
The day I'm blood thirsty
Fuck that, wait til FRIDAY, PAYDAY!!!!
Shoot'cha in your face and take your money, J
Now wait til the weekend, heh, yeah
Saturday, that's the day you go CREEPIN
But you better be watchin your back 'cause I'm sneakin [door noise]
Waitin for my chance to do your ass in

All them bitches know what's up (How they know, 
How they know?) They heard me on the radio 
buddah I set up. Where-he-at hittin' dead home 
if it wasn't bumpin' in your ride it was bumpin' in 
your headphones. No it ain't gone to my head

This one go out to all the niggas that be getting loaded
All the ladies that be getting loaded

Score it up, roll it up, blow it up
I'm bout to let you niggas know something
'Fore you get mad and throw something,
Bitch you better smoke something
If it's on your chest, get's rid of that mess, for the end of that stress
Nigga told me that's sess was the best, so I got's to test
It's all in the roll, fuck how you hold it
If you didn't notice that I was fucked up, y'all niggas ain't loaded
Speakin' of myself I'm just a rap writer
But before I get my nerves bad, let me go get my let me go get my lighter
Blaze up a swissa full of herb, shut the door, shut the window
Close the gate, get the phone out, I don't want to be disturbed
I'm on too but I'm in my own home
High as Cheech N Chong, in my own zone, smokin' homegrown
Smoke all over this motherfucker
But never would have knowed it, if I wasn't loaded
So come and take a walk with me
Get spark with me what a brought with me
See ya'll nigga can't find this, niggas be moving in slow motion
Smokin' that Bionic Chronic

Mystikal,"Nigga you ain't shit

I woke up this morning dick rock hard
Had to piss so bad, that shit made me say God Lord!
Dick harder then a armadello
So I went in the bathroom and drained the little fellow
Flush the toilet, washed my hands
Took off my silk shirt, (whut else) and ? down my pants
I was rolling to meet this bitch in bout an hour (what you did)
????? and grabbed and towled and jumped my stankin ass in the shower
And now i'm feelin better, at least i'm smellin better
Instead of a combination of pussy and cheddar
I still smelled like last night's fuck
So washed my lips, fingertips, but I can't forget to wipe under the nuts
Blow my nose, wash my toes, then my asshole
Foggin up the mirrors, ?? all my fuckin clothes
Ain't that a bitch, i'm already runnin late
Thinkin I ain't got to do nothin, now I gotta change my outfit
Stepped to the closet and scanned the wardrobe
Seen that silk shirt, Tommy, fuck it, i'll wear that Polo though
Girbauds and Polo socks
Slipped on the Fila's cause it was too hot to bust the Timbo high tops
I looked in the mirror one last time for kicks
Like I really had to check, like I ain't know I was the shit
Everything was in place
Pearly whites, brown complextion, daily braids and daily face
Mirror, mirror, wasup, who's the most stuck up
??? bitch I just fucked that stankin slut
Thats the thought for the day
I'm bouts to cut that hoe (why) she can't fuck anyways
Now i'm back on my mission
But before I hit the fuckin front door, gots to hit the kitchen
Cause all the ? is gettin bigger
Man, I ain't ate shit (dawg, ain't you hungry) 
dawg, hungrier than three niggas
Grits and oatmeal, no time to cook though
Fuck it i'll grab that left-over cold cut combo
And now the stomachs at ease
I'm bout the jet, but first grab the beeper, the ring, the ?, and the keys
And now i'm ready for the street
Lookin neat, smellin sweet from my teeth to my fuckin feet
I guees it's part of my job (what job nigga)
Being colder then cold, smoother then smooth, sharper then sharp
So if you catch my in the club don't say shit
Sweatin a nigga like Micheal ?? Tyler don't pay bitch
Cause I ain't that nigga thats gonna play with ya
Or stay with ya, but i'll damn sure lay with ya
Cause i'm that type of nigga to tell a bitch that I love em quick
Better but not beleive it though (why) cause I ain't bout shit

That nigga ain't shit
That nigga ain't bout shit
That nigga ain't shit

I know y'all niggaz can't fuck with me and they can't but they try to
Some niggaz just need to be warned
It's gonna be harder to get it up on a my own
nigga go ring the alarm
Matter fact better know what it take
for the back of your head to hit that grass
Let' s get this straight from the jump
I ain't playing with your bitch ass
These outside niggaz that run to the mic better come clean
Fuckin with that Saudi Arabian
Desert Storm veteran 12th ward offspring
I'm runnin these niggaz to the jets
to the hills, to the back of the tracks
A-A-ask them hos, did I do that?
I'm coming boisterous with 5 million switches
I'm the man with single and double and triple
and four five six time them bitches
I'm the nigga with the go head, fuckin your bitch up in your bed
standin 5 foot 'leven dick crooked like a roach leg
Much bone and I don't fail a test
Little nigga fuck hos both sides of the river 
I can't be fucked with, you can't touch this better grab hold
Bitch I'm so cold I'm like a 24 year-old north pole!
Give a fuck about these raggly ass hoes
Grippin my nuts as I strut in my baggy ass Girbauds
Makin em stop, (bigidabounce) pause, Like Jubilee All

So Mystikal, in your own words could you explain your style?

I gotta get a rhyme that can tumble through the air like a Rambo spear
See y'all can stop lookin at another nigga
face cause bitch the man right here
You nigga didn't think that I could swing mine 
Bitch I'm doing bad and saying rhymes at the same time (I ain't lying)
Talking behind my back don't make me no nevermind
Cause all you can say is I'm smarter than Einstein
I'm fire like Cayenne!
You'll never catch me cause I'm swift as a hyena
Gimme the chance I'll rock the lakefront arena
like Teena Marie be rockin Tipitina's (damn Gina)
Tall dark strong long and lean ain't nobody comin cleaner
It's all in the way I lay my game down
Watch me swing with the gillotine rollin round nigga town
But everybody think these niggaz be wantin me
to prove that I'm the man
Bitch I'm colder than a freezer, cooler than a fan
I got no love for no b-i-e-otch
Matter fact's been that way since I was wearin osh kosh b'gosh
But yet y'all steadily trying to squab bout me
When I come in this door the only thing y'all can do is talk about me
Better get some business about yourself that's what you better do
Matter fact I'm a tell you mother fuckers three things I'm a never do
One : never gonna change my style
Two: never gonna bounce, three: never gonna bow
I'm gettin tired of being sick and tired
Nigga you got a problem with me gettin' high
Suck big dick and die
Same rhyme phrase get me paid, they can't fade
the tan shade man with the braids
Bitches peep as I creep through the 12th ward
I done offended these niggaz compare me
to niggaz that gotta practice looking hard
Bitch-a won't leave me alone
I'm not that Thug and I'm not that Ruggish but I do pack Bone
Black prince of the south that's my title
Bitch I'm whoo chka ckha oooooww! bad like Michael
I'm throwin rhymes at a steady flow
(Inhaling) whoo there they go y'all niggaz ain't ready yo

Bitch I'm entertaining like Cedric and I'm mac like Bernie
I'm black like Menace and I'm g like Slimm
I'm Sporty like T and I'm smooth like Tim
I can click just like the boot camp but I'm conscious like daughter
Bitch I'm insane but um, you still be wantin
to claim that I'm your partner
I'm Down just like Bust plus I'm Ice just like Mike 
And I'm the living lyrical miracle I'm just ice like precise
I'm the invisible man you blind you can't see shit
Picture I got more bitches on my dick than bitches at FREAKNIK

Thirteen motherfucking years! 
I know what to do to knock your stupid ass 
So bad you ain't no challenge. 
Thirteen motherfucking years! 
This ain't no fluke  this pure deep talent. 
Thirteen motherfucking years! 
I know what to do to knock your stupid ass 
So bad you ain't no challenge. 
Thirteen motherfucking years! 

Bow  when I hold the microphone and hold it 
Keeping me rapping until I hoarse and swollen 
Thirteen years and rolling 
I rate colder than coldest 
Getting part of this, niggas don't want no more of this 
Never leave you alone in your life, nigga I'm selecting and selling rhymes 
Slap a nigga that style sound some like mine 
Mad enough you screaming ""It AIN'T!"" 
(This line whispered, can't hear) 
You be pissing me off some the time, take you down one at a time 
I'm be known for fucking over your whole album 
Who want my rhyme? 
Keep declining, I'm keep climbing 
Keep ducking, I'm keep bucking 
Keeping heat seeking rhymes coming to get you bitches off me 
Disrespectors cow sled, (..?..) 
Hard to break, if it comes that way 
It took me thirteen motherfucking years just to make a tape 
But that don't mean that my rhymes one of the strongest 
All I know I been trying to make it for the fucking longest 
Fuck the side of all this, long as you done it 
When I done it, getting blunted bout to run this bitch 
Taking them riders down with me, clown with me 
Leave thirteen in your motherfucking chest and you can count em 

Nigga go pass the vibe, dividing mad this year 
Creative catastrophe, leave emcees in closed caskets 
Hit ya like full metal jackets, cut like hatchets 
Tight as ratchets, and burn like matches 
Thick than amino acids, flip like gymnastics, nasty as a pissy mattress 
Dropping like the temperature in December 
Clipping em, tipping em, been writing raps far back as I can remember 
Full of them rocks, everybody move key 
It was ghetto Djs and sucker emcees 
Handle your business in this industry of competition 
Or be at F.W. Bulls washing dishes 
Bitch I was born to write million dollar rhymes 
Battle in the hallways of Cohen back in 85 
86, 87, 88, hooked up with Big Boy records and made my first demo tape 
We dropped some real shit in the basement 
I had big ol' nigga tracks, raps like pavement 
To come from New Orleans made it hard to surface 
That's when I got discouraged and joined the service 
Pissed of and I (?) before long 
I went to war and served federal time before I made it back home 
No more rips in my jeans and getting my cream 
Ain't shit unlucky about my number thirteen 

I hit the bitch like Bosh! Ow! 
Never gonna bounce could rap and doing time before I bow 
How in the fuck you like me right now 
Told your ass she had said I'd be on top of the pile 
Cause my rap style is my hustle 
I shot niggas up like Muslims 
With the flex like muscle 
Use a, pretty delivery cause it's most important 
I form a style sharp enough to cut straight through the bones 
I came from my welts, gave up my belt 
I got off from Big Boy records to put my single on the shelf, now 
Do I do it? Fucking right I did it 
Should of seen the little children in the street singing I'm Not That Nigga 
Size ain't nothing nigga, I'm short 
Shocking nigga, rah! 
They gave me five hundred dollars, shit I quit both of my jobs 
Fuck em, got some other shit to do from nine to five 
My birthday came, and my sister died 
But next year, Mystikal signed a half a million dollar deal with Jive 
This shit that's tragic can't be no more 
Because of my rings I work at A&P no more 
I drive my land cruiser off the show floor 
Got the time to time to feel pain, sitting on Volvo's 
Coming with scheme, up in my dream 
Who'd a ever thought I'd be a No Limit soldier 
By the end of that thirteen

What's up niggas and bitches.
It's the motherfuckin' kisarme.
It's No Limit, Master P.

I'm a introduce y'all to the motherfuckin', 
One of the hardest lieutenants on the tank, Mystikal.
We was all born to be soldiers.
See, these evil thoughts,
They was scarred into our motherfuckin' souls from these wars,
The streets, the ghetto, the hood. The ghetto.

[Chorus: x7]
[Master P]
Bitch, I'm a soldier!
[Mystikal]
I was born to be a soldier!

[Mystikal]
Ah, ATTEN!
Hoo! Muthafuckas don't you move
I got what is takes to make your ass feel (?)
You don't want to rest in this parade
No Limit soldiers throwin grenades!
Strictly, heavy artillery, calm and gunnin
I got your ground troops runnin from INCOMING!
Go, go go go, the future caliber
Bout to rip your (?) vest, split your capita
The niggas be marchin in the land camp
Bitch we ghetto soldiers, the streets is what made us!
No LVE's, no MRE's
But we kill our enemies, and drive humvees!

[Chorus: x5]

[Master P]
Born, to be, a muthafuckin soldier
The colonel don't play, I'm out that tank
Money in the bank, make niggas thank
At ease when we rank, salute cause we cap
Fools run they trap, soldiers bust caps
Fools die a million deaths, solider dies once
Put that on my gold keys, my gat, and my blunt
Candy painted hummer, triple gold D's
We bout it, eyes on our CREAM cause we rowdy
Battle kicked advil, niggas load they carriages
Weapons on the mayor of the cash cause I know character
I'm ready to bust keys, niggas (?)
Niggas are fuckin, slanging them trees
They gon die in New Orleans

[Chorus: x4]

[Silkk]
I came out the motherfuckin womb, niggas want to combat tank
My ghetto antics, my ghetto tactics
I smack quick, stick another gat nigga to your ass and acrobatic
Nigga what? Black, my M-16, is black bitch
I was born to drop phat shit
Punk your ass like a sac bitch
Yeah, I keep a gat bitch (?) I react quick
Blow them soldiers, told ya, and that's it
But see, I set my shit off like a punt (Go, T, Go)
We roll, I said we roll like a muthafuckin blunt
See, don't come stunt and don't try to front
I'm Silkk the Shocker, I snatch your ass like a muthafuckin duck
I put on my camoflauge nigga, straight up my fuckin boot
Why would a muthafucka who ain't TRU laugh at old shoot
About face, salute!
Tell I'ma soldier, by the way I talk
Tell I'ma soldier, by the way I march (Right, left, left)
I was born to be a soldier!

[Chorus: x4]

[Fiend]
Bringin bags and weed
Lil Fiend live by the soldiers creed
Of broken no seed in the botton pockets of my fatigues
War fatigues, playing live chess games with the chain
(?) at the gun range, cause I'll bring pain
When I'm playing survival games, that's why I sport a vest
But niggas are put to rest, but got them right tatted on my chest
I was best on my recon, started harm and dis
The war from this, is that Fiend was born from this
Scarred from this, so all the armies now go hide
Cause the crime design, stay from nine to five
Enemies retire, and the bigger go up, till my gun show up
No Limit soldiers, the world blow up!

[Chorus: x3]

[Mac]
Assassin, soldier, sniper, murderer
Son of a bitch, arsonist, house burglarer
Been there, done most before the sun rose
We changin clothes, when the po po's chase
Narrow with the bass, got them hoes all in my face
And them fake niggas hate, so I started different ways
And even when I'm dead and gone
My legacy'll live on
Tatoo me on your arm and tell niggas he got his rhyme on
Murder murder kill killin and shit that I spit
For lunatics who be feelin this shit
Put the gat in my face, I never squeal, nigga keep it real
Pops gave me the game, bout to bag a feel
We attack like the Men in Black
You react, if you got a gat
I'll never die, camoflauge in my vein
I'll never change in the purple rain
My name manifest pain, I'm a soldier

Mystikal,"It's crazy out here (uhhhhhhh)
Yo mama I'm tryin to keep my head strong (whats up Mystikal?)

Uhhhhhh!  (uhhhhhh) I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

I feel like a bird nigga with no wings
I'm stuck in this ghetto trying to have a little change
My homies killing up each other cause we gotta eat
And I ain't tripping cause I'm running from the police
I done seen little kids in the projects starving
I done seen more hoes messing then Marvin
See in the ghetto the sun it barely shines
But so many niggas in jail and the welfare lines
And all my life I thought Bill Clinton ran the country
Until I found out Bill Gates had all the money
And the media starting east and west coast wars
I'm from the south, where they predijuce on us all
Come out of the powdered milk and eggs don't fill us up
But why the government sold us drugs and charges to clean us up
Gave us three halves and high interest student loans
Four dollar minimum wage and section eight, we call it home

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

It's real when you can do whatever you want to do
when you want to do it
Ain't to many niggas out there living like that
That's why the rest of you niggas aint never gone through it
How many niggas in the penn
how many niggas in the cemetary don't know why?
How many strikes y'all niggas need
How many innocent children in the ghetto got to lose thier lives?
WHY!!!!  Why you gotta make your momma cry?
HUH!!!!  She take you out of the street
cause that's where you gonna die
But you won't listen cause your mind is one track
and your head is hard
And your getting flipped, and your talking back
Showing your ashy act, ass straight up off the wall
Lemme talk to y'all, don't think it's too hard to fall
but that's far and all
And sore and all, it's cool when it started off
Now niggas duckin bullets like dodgeballs
Niggas got me scared to plant my seeds, fear of high's gonna grow
Living in a messed up time, a messed up court
I'm telling ya, you can't do shit no more!
It's bigger than us, it's out of our hands
that's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
Cause it's your world, and we your children
your sons and your daughters
We struggling, trying to get out of the ghetto
trying to make it to mars!!!

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Dear mama pray for your son, hoping I can make it through this game
Wishing I can change, I've been through so much
Seen so many things, couldn't find the words to explain
The only way to avoid stress is to get high, by drinking hennessey but I
But I can't get too high, cause I gotta keep my eyes on my enemies
I've seen harder times, but there gonna be some harder days
Penetentary close, but you know what?  Cemetaries aint that far away
Before I die I'm trying to make the whole world feel
like our people scared to stand there
The way we express ourself, they think that we all some killers
But look into the eyes of a ghetto child influenced by the street
Go to sleep to gunshots, wake up from the sirens of the police
See now my life aint been the same nigga, life as a thug
If I had to draw a picture of my life
I have to paint my picture in blood
Closest homie died, before he die little cousin told me this
Get you something cause cemetaries
packed full of niggas who had dreams to be rich
So keep your head up, to all my ghetto children it was hard 
To tell my family one day I was gonna grow up to make millions
When I told them, they seemed to laugh at my so called dream
I like to scream when I came home from jail
When I was told best friend turned into a fiend
I aint gonna lie, my conscience aint clear, when I close my eyes
Of course you gotta realize, god forgive me, I'm just trying to survive
They cut welfare and health care, that shit gotta stop
I got a positive note, my auntie having a baby
Congratulations, she on rocks

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Murdered my sister
The only thing I'm tryin to tell is to take it to that nigga
Get that mutherfucker what I tell myself
Make that mutherfucka feel what Chell felt
Heavenly father use your will to bring them tears to her eyes
Fuck the fussing and the fights, why she have to die
Couldn't believe my baby to leave away from here so goddamn early
I tried to tell her that nigga was bad news, but she ain't heard me
Fact was that she loved this bitch
But she found love on the graveyard shift
And how many mutherfuckin' quick lift, or spliff, on the fifth
Find my baby sister she ain't deserve that shit
Nigga you couldn't of, nigga you wouldn't
Put your hand on a women, how could it be my sister
Can't say I wouldn't miss her
But I wouldn't forget cha
Get that bitch for every time he hit ya
He gone pay for what he did ya

MURDER!
Motherfuckin' murderer [Repeat x 3]

Possesed that nigga that hurt her
100% black queen self every women
Nigga you lost your fuckin' life when you took hers from her
You took her from her brothers
And her baby mother from her
But after it's said and done, your ass gone burn like its summer
Even a fuck 'bout a system
Sister was your victim
Fuck, he said he did it
What the fuck you mean you're being a victim
Fuck him, I'll get 'em
Be that nigga to deal with him
Cut him and split him, reverse that feelin'
Committed mutherfuckin' centuries under my ceilin'
The paper said lacerations to her neck's what did the killin'
But that's on my first born to make him my first blood
Nigga you took her from her fuckin' close friends and first cous'
She would probably miss my partner she was cool with
Multiplied by the people she went to school with
Nevertheless, rest, my sweet sister
I'm about to handle this business
Get that thing and kiss ya picture
Heavenly father, he done put me in that water
But I got to get that bitch for what he did to my momma daughter
Never dreamed he'd be the one to hurt her
She died a bloody murder

MURDER!
Motherfuckin' murderer [Repeat x 4]

Into the tick-tock of the wee hour
Shit started to get sour
She was killed by that fuckin' coward
How could nothin' take so much and
No more was uppin', no more huggin'
But his conscience know the truth, so he fucked up and
Her memory was all that was left, so to that I'm clutchin'
She was taken out of your reach, now you can't touch her
Unfortunately also taken from us, so we gotta suffer
Gobblin' down to that last supper
Gotta hustle
Feelin' my album shake the devil up
Reconstruct this motherfucka
I never slowed down, just throw it down like I know how
Thought I do it like she would have wanted me to do it
I still can't believe I lost her in the worst way
She died wearin' my very first T-shirt on my birthday
Now what the fuck I'm supposed to celebrate
Would have celebrated if I caught his ass
But I got in my bed and it's too late
Everybody gotta roll they must play
No hollerin' when to pray
But this mutherfucka gotta pay
There will be no reasonable excuse for what you've done
Even ignored him when he started stealin' from me
'Cause them was crumbs
A raindrop to a river
Huh, a sinner to a christian
A holler to a whisper
She was the sole reason that I got along which ya
But I'm a never heal from the scars of what you did to my sister

Let me go right there, ok we on the air

[Verse 1]
We grew up with show business on our mind
In hope to make a big name
That's why me and my sister
Was a stiff competition show off when company came
Now I'm a live cause ????? shake that ass!
Although my sister was the one with the beautiful voice
I still had to go last everybody waiting
I'm kinda folling niggas laughing at goofy
I either came in the room ????? then just act stupid
But lately me and my people ain't been having to many family groups
Or maybe it just sometimes hurt us we medlin without my baby who be
You was there through the struggle shark
Coming trying to reach the big picture
I'm telling you you hurt when you plan to be a star
With somebody you love
And when it's time to do it they can't be with you
I'm feeling guilty to take a stand but better since you been gone
It don't matter much to fix the frustration
Ain't the same when you ain't home baby!
I'm gonna miss you forever forget you never
But you gonna see the world through my eyes and live what I endeavor
So, if you can see me in heaven over the clouds
You could be proud of your little brother so look down and smile
(chorus)
Shine my lady I miss you baby for your my baby our love is crazy
Your my sister I'll always miss ya
No one can get ya cause god is with ya
Shine my lady I miss you baby for your my baby our love is crazy
There's no other its from your brother
Your son and mother cause we gonna love ya
[Verse 2]
All the sad songs in the world
Probably couldn't express how much I miss my baby
I just thank god that I had a big sister
????? between all the years that he gave her
Even the day that I misbehaved
And I knew that she was gonna get that ????
I could see the aggrivation in your face
When my momma said you had to watch me
Selling your ???? like a witch and you know what that meant???
How your time gonna be spent cause I was too hard headed
But where you said not to go that's where I went
Always flippin, jumpin around like a jackass or I was climbin a fence
Bring me my rockin rock robin my double dutch bus
She had some song to sing to us
Wearing some ???? digust plus
I wouldn't tell her I'm sorry for leavin the toilet seat up
And not cleanin up the tub
And leavin peanut butter and jelly drinkin out the cool-aid jar
I pissed you off burned you up
When you told me cut that music down I turned it up
Causin conflict cause you doubt how we showed or love
You was my flesh and blood
We was brother and sister and it meant so much
Now I'm doin it you supposed to be here
We supposed to be writing songs together
I'm tellin that girl to show up with old Tina Maria records
What you left us with
Never be in vein
You gon be shining and they gonna know your name
To many damn things left unexplained
But since you was an angel down here an angel there you shall remain
And that's always until my time
Your my strength your my life Shine!

Shine on shine on cause we do miss you
There's no other like you
Shine on shine on cause we gonna miss you oh you!

Found nothin',fuck 'em fuck 'em

Don't want no confrontations, making me hit you with combinations
Kicking in bloodier faces, compilations, occupations
Back in hibernation, yeah you suffer with complications

Just more powerfully now, on time for that No Limit sound

We take it from a fuckin fight to a stage and a mic
If I don't take the limo bitch I'm pushin a bike
	* 2X - last line replaced with YEAYY-YAY! *

Verse One: Mystikal
Us big niggaz get pussy while songs get cooked
Fuck rough rhymes get hooked and young minds get shook
Duck, don't rock, don't break, don't bend, don't fall
Not gon' play, don't fake, don't stop to rest don't pause none
Top dough top pro on bitches
Chop funk, not gon' bitch ass niggaz
I wring they neck and slap they fuckin mouth
I run laps around the Superdome
Breast stroke the whole Mississippi to represent THE FUCKIN SOUTH
That's right, I said it!
I'm the fuckin boxer in your face is where I'm headed
Blaow, you gotta whole lot of nerve dissin the.. South
We ridin all the way to Jersey
We gon' keep up, but you keep on, keepin on
why'all gon', keep on, gettin the fuck on, bitch get gone!
why'all heard me? Mystikal and Naughty
New Orleans and Jersey!

Chorus
Verse Two: Vinnie
Yo, yo, yo
I heard somebody wantin Naughty to get raw, ha
I dismantle your fuckin crew just like Apartheid, nigga ya heard?
There's No Limit no gimmicks, to the shit I spit
Ain't no magazine you know could count these mics I rip
Comin straight from Jersey, motherfuck all those who curse me
I'm, running through you niggaz like Jackie Joyner Kersee
Now, how many niggaz comin better than this?
Naughty By Nature puts it down on some veteran shit
And chins I devour, while fuckin at your baby shower
Spittin lyrics on you a hundred miles an hour
Our Zoo got no problems gettin physical
Naughty By Nature down with Mystikal, you bitches foul

Chorus
Verse Three: Treach
You get your ass kicked when your only assets is ass bets
You cry quicker than Angela Bassett, cause your cassette
I'll trash it, like potatoes, beets, I'll mash it
Bust dust to dust and turn ashes to ashes in masses
I'm massive mashing bastards faster
Question bout my pimping tell your bitch to ask it
Chip-chop like all tops the store stops (it stops here)
Cause I'm raws likes strawberries on shortstops (it comes now)
The Beast from the East, the big future for the Pharaoh
Diss my crew, do some spine travel on gravel
Some fuhrilla shit, go and, peel your shit
I want my, scrilla quick, on some gorilla shit
Rhyme illest, no mimic, no quit it, gon' feel it
IllTown, divine mill it, No Limit, fuck the spillage some
hear my shit and go and switch they style
While I get down and wild with Mystikal

[Verse 1] 
I woke up this morning 
rocked up 
humping on the matress 
hard like I was fuckin 
I realized I was dreaming 
then I got up 
I hit the Vick's inhaler 
'cause my nose was stuffed up 
from the bed to the floor 
to the bathroom to the sink 
from the mirror to the toilet 
took a piss then shook the shank 
oops  don't look know I think I sprinkled when I tinkled 
so, I dip in the sides there be a sweeter by the seater 
cocoa powder, bubble-bath, and rubbing alcohol 
for 5 fuckin cent that you could buy at the mall 
I'm a long distance super-power, pussy-magnet 
I was born in the ghetto, made by the ghetto 
so fabulous! 

[Chorus] 
[Charlie Wilson] 
ghetto fabulous - living like this 
I'm so happy, yeah! 
'cause I'm ghetto fabulous (repeat) 

[Snoop Dogg] (enters over repeat, speaking) 

Yeah I feel what you're saying, Dog 
but, uhh, you could let these fools know how hard it is 
when a nigga ghetto fabulous, know what I'm saying? 
let's kick that shit! 

[Mystikal] 

[Verse 2] 
it's like a big rush with no time 
niggas be like ""whyyyyy"" 
kids be like ""let me get your autograph"" 
bitches be like ""ahhhh!"" 
ever since I said ""here I go"" 
braids or not y'all 
they know me wherever I go 
I'm real private 
the windows tinted, doors locked 
the damn crowd you make a scene 
""ain't you Mystikal?"" 
""no, I'm not."" 
lie to a diehard fan with a straight face 
and let the hour long picture signing session take place 
sign, hey, baby, how you doing? 
what's your name? 
stay real, stay sweet 
stay sexy, stay the same 
and never forget 
I'm never going to change 
I'm loving what I'm doing 
and you can put that on your game 
I got my piece of pie and my piece of mind 
fool, I'm a piece of coal 
don't call me, people, let me shine 
I know you see me on t.v. 
with Snoop, Fiend, Mia, see, Silkk, Serv, and Petey 
nigga we frontin' these street-ies 
but livin' like this ain't easy 
it's fabulous! 
I'm so fucking bad 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3] 
see, that's a cutie with her big booty 
and her big body 
her and her big fine potnahs 
take their ??? and take their vitamins 
be ordering drinks all down at the bar 
we don't got to buy 
just work that halter top 
and work them tight bell bottoms 
ohhh, you acting funny and trying to holler 
she project Tyra Banks 
the neighborhood super-model 
she shaped like a coke bottle 
hair whipping smelling good 
finger nails and her toes polished 
she did it how she lived 
'cause she got to have it 
first got them fucking kids 
by the baby's daddy 
her ass ain't never what she should have been 
go ahead on and act bad, I'll see ya when I get a hit 
see, she was so fucking bad

Mystikal,"I'm in the land  l.a.  land of the stick 
Watch y'all niggaz know bout dat purple weed nigga 
Show y'all niggaz some shit 
It's that sticky  that bud 

Indo  hydro  open up the window 
I'm about to blow 
It's that fire 
Nigga whach y'all  whach y'all  whach y'all got to roll em up wit 

Backwoods  see vegas  straight chocolate fillers  black n milds 
Huh bro  y'all niggaz don't know nuttin about ? 
Cognac, j.o.b., 1.5 
Break it up, chop it up, cut it up, tuck it in 

Take the filler out, roll it up 
Light it , hit it , hold it, pass 
Puff puff blow it up! 
See some of y'all niggaz be talkin bout blowin 

But can't handle the dolja 
Gettin sleepy and shit, quitting all early
Bitch, you ain't no smoker! 
Y'all must be used to hittin that dirt 

Sticks with the brown buds 
Me? I ain't got shit else to do 
Nigga I'm bout to get fucked up! 
Two cases of green optimo burned away 

A.m. to turn to p.m. 
And nighttime to turn back to day! 
I'm (still smokin) 
Feelin' sporty in my hotel 

Spent the whole day gettin loaded! 
It's nuttin but smoke til there's nuttin to smoke 
It's nuttin but sticky and nuttin but dolja 
Disconnect the smoke detector and 

Put a wet towel up under the door! 
Nobody around, more dope for me 
I got the whole tree 
Leftovers for me 

Hoo, dis bitch off da hee 
Button up, suck em up, this pet peeve 
First off, don't put my lighter in yo pocket 
Second, don't wet my goddamn weed! 

That's just two, before I can get to three and four 
Five and six, I heard a doo doo doo doo at the door! 
Evidence all over 
I been doin somethin' serious 

Gotta hide this shit 
'Cause I know that's hotel security! 
I played it off 
I said ""come back later, I ain't got on no clothes"" 

He said ""sorry sir, I don't mean to disturb you 
But I smell smoke! 
Fuck I just went to jail for that shit 
I ain't goin back, I done ate an ounce, and I'm a flush the rest 

'Cause I ain't goin' out like that! 
Sprayin cologne and cuttin' on da shower 
Tryin' to clear it up 
Workin' like a dog, but I gotta open the door 

Fuck it, here go nothin! 
The door swung open and some young nigga 
Talkin' bout ""what's happenin'"" 
He said ""I know you got dat fire, sell yo boy a sack"" 

(Mystikal talking) 
Ain't that a bitch 
Boy if you don't get yo bitch ass from outta here! 
Nigga, I'm thinkin you the motherfuckin' police! 
I done threw all my motherfuckin' weed away 
Fuckin' wit you, you ol' bitch ass nigga 
Nigga, get yo motherfuckin' hoe ass from outta here bitch 
Before I stomp yo bitch ass! 
Fuck, boy this nigga done blew my mother fuckin high 
(mystikal mumbling until end)",I Smell Smoke
Mystikal,"What the fuck? Shit.. 

It's.. HOT! 

I'm steamy  sweatin  tossin and turnin 

The whole house on fire  and I can't stop it from burnin 

The curtains and the walls all indulged in flames 

I yell  ""Somebody help me!"" But ain't' nobody came 

I try my best to put it out then I said  ""Fukkit!"" 

Break  full speed to the back door  one room away 

But the faster and harder I ran it seemed like the longer I took 

Prayin  ""Please God spare me; I don't want to cook!"" 

Knew I that I did done some things that I shouldn't of 

I knew I didn't come into Sunday service like I could have 

But have mercy for your child, forgive me for my sins 

I'm too young to die Lord, get me through this 

I gotta get to the back do', gotta get to the kitchen 

But they got thick black smoke comin from the kitchen 

Shit, all other exits are tossed, what I'ma do? 

Stay my ass here and burn or -- RUN THE FUCK THROUGH? 

Already havin trouble breathin when I started to cough 

But no more time to waste, I cover my face and took off! 

Dis-en-dehydrate, I'm gettin tireder 

I gotta, keep movin, cause it's gettin HOTTER 

and HOTTER, WHOO.. WHOAH, shit! I'm on fire! 

see-see-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire! (6X) 

Oh shit! Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers help me out dere? 

HELP!!! Motherfuckers it's me! HELP!!! 

I gotta get out of here! I've been trapped for over 55 minutes 

Looks like I'm finished, this could be a fucked up ending 

I done been in some fucked up shit but this the worst I ever been in 

""Call them people to me"" -- tell them send the fire engine 

I hope this ain't my calling y'all cause I ain't ready 

I'ma need some alerted emergency units to stand by, paramedics 

Runnin through the fire, and I can't turn back 

Somethin went {WHOOSH} and everything went black 

I can't see, I can't see, I'm BLIND!! 

Oh fuck I'm alright I just had my eyes closed the whole time 

Oops, shit damn! But that ain't my stop my shoes from movin 

cause outside, here I am! 

I smashed through the back door like a ram 

I made it! I'm still alive! I'm still a man! 

Out the house but still I got fire on my clothes 

So I stopped, dropped, and rolled nigga rolled 

Started goin wild on the ground tryin to get the flames out my shirt 

Windmillin in the dirt, but nuttin didn't work! 

I heard a {HORN SOUNDS} but that was just a barge 

See I live right by the river -- THAT'S IT, WATER!!! 

Every step I took made hot footprints in the tar 

Runnin over cars to the 12th Ward wall 

Get out the way cause everything I touch turn crispy 

I'ma be at the riverfront, tell them people come get me!! 

see-see-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire! (4X) 

Hello? Somebody get the fuckin fire off me! 

HELP! 

Sparks like aluminum foil, in the microwave oven 

Where them fuckin people? SOMEBODY DO SOMETHIN! 

Can't you see what's hap-pe-nin? 

Don't you see the smoke? Can't you hear the cracklin? 

Nobody want to listen, everybody was scatterin 

I grab a nigga he screamed so loud that shit was eardrum shatterin! 

I said, ""Don't scream Dawg, I need your help, I'm the one on fire!"" 

He said, ""Nigga you 'sposed to be dead, how you still alive?"" 

He was right -- by now they should be embalming me 

But the shit don't seem to be harming me 

Damn this must have been a bad dream the whole ? 

I heard them motherfuckin sirens, hollerin 

I guess they finally got the people to me, they must have saw me 

Huh, cause they was headed right for me 

A fireman walked up, and handed me a ticket 

And said, ""You just been put out, the fire went away!""",I'm on Fire

Gotta make sure they hear me cause I wants my attention!
Disturb the class, so I stayed in detention
Couldn't whisper when I was talkin so they sent me to the office
The principal say, ""Young man what seem to be the problem?""
Said, ""I try to be quiet but I just can't seem to lower the volume""
""Hmm, what's your name?"" 
""Michael Tyler""
""Perhaps you'd be interested in joining our school choir?""
Said, ""Nah that's for funny boys""
""Either that or a suspension,"" while you roll, here I come boy
I wanna holla, but I gotta try: 
DOE RAY MI FAH SOH! Ahh no!
That ain't gonna cut it, that ain't gonna get it
Then the teacher said, ""Maybe you can try something ath-letic""
But I'm too clumsy so I went to the band
But I made more noise honkin than I did when I was playin!
YIKES!!! That ain't workin so I'm leavin
The very next day I was in ROTC
Had no problems soundin off like I had a pair, three four
But I just ain't like them tight ass green pants that I had to wear
All this made me tired, on top of that
One of my teachers wanna see my ass outside
I went downstairs to the yard
When I got there I seen my teacher with about eight fine broads
I said, ""You lookin for me? I'm the one who be talkin loud""
She said, ""Damn, nigga we need you on our cheerleadin squad""
Hell no, never ever Trevor
Either that or a report card filled with the F letter
Go, team, fight, win

Got a loud mouth but I don't know what to use it for

Uncle Tom's and Lil' Sambo's get annihilated
Y'all ain't tolerated, 'cause only soldiers ride with T-R-U
On the Tank full of lyricists, hustlers, and gorillas
Killers, and we do what we gotta do to make it happen
All action, all cappin', fuck yappin'
Mappin', out the industry, gon' blow this joint
And take the royalties, the publishin' and all the points right with us

Shootin' sparks from the top of the Billboard charts
Watch out now, don't nobody move, 'cause you gon' lose

Stop disrespectin' the pistol I'm pointin' at y'all
Buck buck! Get down, get on your face or get handled
Bitch keep still 'fore I make an example
Cut up that fuckin' remake, and give me that sample
Give me the fuckin' recoup, you 'sposed to be payin' me!
Bag the loot then, cover the camera
Snatch a fuckin' hostage then run out with the manager
Fuck it, gotta have my paper, fortune and fame
Lay it down so the bitches won't forget my name!
Listen close motherfucker
If you don't meet my demands, this nigga gon' suffer
This ain't no fucking game, and ain't none of this funny
If you want this nigga to live, then gimme your company!

Y'all bitch ass niggas disbehave me since the first day
Worst way to kill 'em is hit the top of the charts
First week at number one, R&B be a war

Leave ya fake-ass manager home
And if you need a nigga to see about me, come along
I keep my enemies a far, don't need a friendly to me

Shake that ass, drop that pussy but stay in line ho

Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then bitch come on down

I heat up the way coffee be
Tasty like pastry
Got mo' flavors than parsely
With 9 aunties and 2 uncles

I got a lot of cousins, so watch how you talk to me
Good ol' places, good ol' times, doing good ol' thangs
That was just the good ol' days,
Most of my people still look the same

All though we deep in the numbers,
Our feelings is close as the lotto ya heard me
We originated in Louisiana way back in the 1930's
On the farm in the son of mister and misses Joyner and Mary Tyler

Hooked up with they daughter,
Daughter Josephine the difference do you know what I mean
She was on the cotton field
He was on the farm where the cows get killed

Then they moved off the plantation
Then [unknown] came in a few mo' years
First came Rosa Lee, then Lord June Bug, then Anna Lee
Then Louise and Alberta, then my mama came who they call Marie

Without a breather, um, here come Mary Alice, and Linda
Po' Grandma stayed bare foot, pregnant, and always baring
Don't worry be happy, whatever we got we was glad that we had it
After that, here come the last three, (Who was?)
Loyce, Alan, and Kathy

Don't that fuck with you???   can't you feel her?
That's what the fuck she get for givin' you her real love????

You stepped down on us,
Shipped that coward out his fuckin' cell and let him skip town on us,
Just like that,
And I guess I'm 'sposed to let that shit go down, ha?  just like that?

But I ain't gonna have it
Tryna talk about anotha muthafucka on a record
And the bitch ain't got no cabbage
Hopin somebody can tell me what's wrong with this picture
Don't think you can put out whateva you want
And I ain't gonna come back in the bitch and come getcha
Imma find out where ya hang at
Where ya old lady live and what time you be there
Go scope out ya ride

Monkey see, monkey do nigga
So you can't be the man right chea too
There's none afta this
Not anotha livin M.C. as hazardous
And as talented and handsome, ghetto fabulous
Keep em off my back
Wheneva they comin I bring that double
In a minute y'all niggaz don't show no love
Its gonna be trouble
These niggaz here get ya name bent
Washed up anybody y'all sent
Gotta watch these niggaz, they get outta line
I put em in they place every time they nut up
Gotta stop em from spreadin them lies
Bust em in they mouth and make em shut up
Get up! Come here!
Neva seen me cut up, ya must not be from here
I'm four and none here
Don't have me to bring up the shit I've done here
Reach blazin temperatures
So please come wit ya sun gear
Whoop the sleeves off of muthafuckas that try to run in here
Serious look on my face
And a boot in my mouth and balled up fists
These niggaz don't want my trouble

From the moment that I slid in the door
They know I'm back 'cause you can hear it in the floor
But afta I rap bitches ain't feelin it nomore
Want to talk that shit, betta kno what to come with
If you jump in the water
Then ya ass betta throw up before I start ballin
And if you eva fuck with what I be recording
Imma flush you down the toilet
And if you eva come at me wrong with a mike
Imma throw you in the gutter
I can't be scared these niggaz 
And they disrespect me 'cause I'm from New Orleans
We don't play that shit
When these niggaz and they really want me to get started
Make it painful 'cause I don't think so
I be bustin til I can't
That's what I where that tank for
Hittin with the speed of Roy Jones Jr. 
And the strength of Iron Mike Tyson
Triflin, exciting, well precise
And I gotta let em know that I still been right
You talk on me strong
Just 'cause I'm rich don't mean that it don't sound hungry
Count if you want to
Hope you think 'cause you little I won't jump on ya
You betta remember that 
When you be droppin that bullshit
You lucky I'm in a good mood right now
But I'm lettin you know how it could get
If I was the preacher
Y'all niggaz would run when I step off the pulpit
If I was you I'd leave me alone
'cause bitch I ain't nothin to fool with
But if it is on ya mind 
You got somethin to prove, then go head and do it
I get so vivid
I wouldn't be able to make a better picture if I could
You understand my platinum
Then fuck up my raps, semi tracks 
No matter wheter kickin a verse or smokin a sack
I'll fuck over you, yea
I'm makin a habit of hurtin they head and bustin they ass
Fuckin they woman and takin they spotlight, makin em mad

I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off

I'm fucked up in the head but everytime I go on, bitch, ran my coat on
Bitch gonna take my clothes off, you niggas are crazy like road dogs
You can do what you wanna do and say what you wanna say
Just don't play with me
Go wit'cha flow go, just don't call me bitch, okay?

Back off, back off! Mind your business
Damn dog, didn't know you were ever gonna drop
Nigga, soon as I finish, I'm gonna make your motherfuckin'

I ain't gotta stand up in this bitch, take your hands on
Throwed off, throwed off

I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off

Niggas be testin' the street like dick-birds
Then they start day-dreamin', watch my tons and hit curbs, oops
Then I fuck my eyes and spit in my face, they got bad nerves
I smoke funny ain't lust and use bad words
But I'm in another revolution, motherfucker seem with his ass heard

If you ever in your car and you play my game, throw the password
'Cause it doesn't rest it's head with an exquisite hand
And they blast first
I can't stand my next door neighborhood, so I'm here to get a transfer
They won't stay over my grass fur, I ain't right

I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed

Fe Fi Fo Fum, I smell a sticky nigga roll up one
Get back if you ain't got none
If you ain't about it, then nigga don't come

We tear this bitch up everytime we come through
Actin' stupid, bitch, you know what I do
Lookin' like I come from Artabozoo
Where the feeders gumbo and cross fetch too
I get down 'cause I come up around the checkin' line
Kell, stop that fuckin' track, I've lost my mind

I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off

Hickery-dickery-dock, get 'em, jump off my cock
Bitch, get out my face and whore stay out my pocket, that's right
Everytime I come in the kitchen, put two in the kitchen
Gettin' fat, eatin' all the fuckin' food up but ain't washin' the dishes

The fuck you mean, do I have somethin' else to drink?
You just got through emptyin' the jug out the hands, it's the same
That's it, gotta get the fuck out
Bitch about to scorch your hand to the door
Nigga, I don't play that shit, better ask somebody
Bitch, thought you know

I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off

This for my niggas in them big trucks
This for all my niggas in them SUV's, you heard me?
This for my big truck drivers, look nigga blow yo' big truck horn

You still could see me in my big truck boy
Smilin' like a lil' kid when I sped the corner with my brand new toy
I got a bark in they call, talkin' 'bout
They wishin' I'd would've came out the garage

But, I guess that's too bad
'Cause your truck used to be the shit until they saw my pad
Strobe lights flash, solar baric, boom boom
Big feet ten runnin' while they, vroom vroom

Another SUV can't do nothin' wit' me
I'm 23's so 22's ain't fuckin' with me
Car so big it make it hard to turn the wheel
I can't watch the TV's from the sturrin' wheel

Shit, plush stronger than the buckskin' ceilin'
Chocolate tan interior really big truck grill
Yeah, that's how you do that there
Got bling and bass, everythin' clean but the ash-tray

I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel
Singin' this song, I'm a big truck driver
In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill
Rollin' on big ol' chrome, I'm a big truck driver

And you know when you pass
Those small trucks you doin' them wrong
This is for my riders big truck drivers
Even on a bad day everythin' clean but the ash-tray

Dark lights with brights, the dark windows
With the pistols in the hot spots fuckin' well right
So when you bitches try to act hype
I get the gat get the gat 'cause niggas don't fight

When you get to Ruben 2, then make a right at the light
And you might catch my rims will-millin' 'round night light
I played a Jag' 'round rags
And now excursion and escalade 'round upscale

The Range Rover's don't even get gools
'Til it's time for rhythm city or either house of blues
My niggas wit' me at your seat to pick my friends up
My brother 'Rice in a mother-fucking Benz' truck

Fresh light don't need no buffin'
Just call a homie where I'm at, west coast custom
Put it on a trailer and ain't no rushin'
'Cause when I get it back y'all 'round can't touch it

I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel
Singin' this song, I'm a big truck driver
In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill
Rollin' on big ol' chrome, I'm a big truck driver

And you know when you pass
Those small trucks you doin' them wrong
This is for my riders big truck drivers
Even on a bad day everythin' clean but the ash-tray

Ain't no slack in my Mack, rollin' slow the windows down
They recognize me so you know how they act
Cuttin' up, fallin' out, tryin' to flirt and get nasty
Raisin' shirt, showin' titties, talkin' 'bout autohgraphs

I try my best to keep my fans happy
I sign my name I grab the nipple they pull off and start laughin'
Then it's back through the hood, tryin' to find somethin' good
And after that I'm on my way back to good

I knew that I'm on course at all time
And I love grindin' like alcoholics love sweet creamy and wine
2002 and you dodgin' me now
Big truck gonna come up ain't no holdin' us down

Grab eyes, turn heads, stop traffic
My black big truck half match my big truck jacket
Do shows and get paid when I travel stay busy it be gone
Now this a big truck driver

I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel
Singin' this song, I'm a big truck driver
In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill
Rollin' on big ol' chrome, I'm a big truck driver

And you know when you pass
Those small trucks you doin' them wrong
This is for my riders big truck drivers
Even on a bad day everythin' clean but the ash-tray

I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel
Singin' this song, I'm a big truck driver
In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill
Rollin' on big ol' chrome, I'm a big truck driver

And you know when you pass
Those small trucks you doin' them wrong
This is for my riders big truck drivers
Even on a bad day everythin' clean but the ash-tray

I'm a big truck driver, I'm a big truck driver
This is for my riders big truck drivers
Even on a bad day everythin' clean but the ash-tray

I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than batman and robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling they business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gon' respect me and appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much wanna see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
I know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep your chin up

You come up and here and do it again then it's shame on me

Sometimes we be getting in trouble we ain't gon' see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take 'em in stride and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody said fool you better keep on rapping
Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happin'
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life will be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters

Mystikal,"I was at the mall, and this girl passed me by
So I like her booty she said hey boy
That's when I made my move
I jammed up and jammed re-over there by the baby shoe
I said you got a chiled huh
She said yeah he live in Bogaluga out there by my momma
Give me yo' number and I hit you when I make it home
And after I take a bath I'll catch up wit'chu later on
That's exactly what I did
We went to the movies got some eatin' back to the crib
Being a man you know I'm thinkin' about hittin' somethin'
She said this you nice but this the first date you ain't gettin' nothin'
That's alright cause I respect your mind
It ain't no rush cause I'mma get you next time
We ain't got no beef, we ain't got no quarrel
You likin' me tonight, but you gone lovin' me tomorrow

I said go 'head, go 'head and move it baby
You've got 'em watchin', go 'head and do it honey
You've got 'em comin' now, you've got me watchin' baby
So don't you stop it baby, you got me so

Must be my baby cause I seen her everyday this week
And when we made love you know we went meat to meat
I think I'm headed for a Love Jones
This one hear supposed to be a jam not a love song
Girl you got me humpin' and don't ask me what I'm doin'
Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout my pumpin'
They call her pumpkin' cause she workin' with somethin'
I call her bia' cause she carryin' my youngin'
I made her Cavalier a Navigator, and put baby momma on a Jaguar bling
I for you and me for me
She built like a stripper I don't need to cheat
And when it's late she's always inside
Under the cover behind her cuddled up wit' her
And since we met you been the love of my life
We ain't married but we call eachother husband and wife

I said go 'head, go 'head and move it baby
You've got 'em watchin', go 'head and do it honey
You've got 'em comin' now, you've got me watchin' baby
So don't you stop it baby, you got me so

We always home and all we do is laugh together
Even watchin' T.V. takin' baths together
Went through the sunny and the nasty weather
My feelin' short so I ain't have to tell ya'
And I would never try and use you
I care too much to hurt you, and need you too much to lose you
We have mo' babies than my cousin' Weebie
I'm goin' be yo' King Tut you goin' be my Nefa Teenie
Tell me what you say to that
I be coming home from work sayin' where my ol' lady at
And you come runnin' from the back room
And you know how much I love to see you when you wear a cat suit
Now give me what I want want
I say where them trishes at I took 'em by the mall mall
You make me feel like a man, cause you can't get enough
Girl you got it you got it bad

I said go 'head, go 'head and move it baby
You've got 'em watchin', go 'head and do it honey
You've got 'em comin' now, you've got me watchin' baby
So don't you stop it baby, you got me so
I said go 'head, go 'head and move it baby
You've got 'em watchin', go 'head and do it honey
You've got 'em comin' now, you've got me watchin' baby
So don't you stop it baby, you got me so

I wan't-a load it up, cock back don't miss
Y'all ain't goin' believe this
Got the preacher's wife talkin' bout rock that shit
All they do is say the mans name

Hittin' hookers is a side high
Tuckin' guts stackin' paper formin' lyrics is my real job

Form a crowd like a fist fight
Take my time with it if it takes me sun-up to midnight

Too tight to out-write, too strong to out-sold, too much to out-bust
I'll talk shit and cuss, foul-dog rimp and the walk talk spit crush
The paper towels and toilet tissue, start your engine set the table
Clean your plate and wash the dishes
Can I please get a source cup
And if they don't give me my grammy, feel so sorry for your mother
And after I'm goin' get Jive

Ready to leave, but can't go nowhere 'cause looks like ya' stuck
Now get off the floe'
You don't know what you pull so don't try this no me
Stop that frontin', and if you can't handle it then give me my dope
Nothing but bud, tastin' no seeds
Swallow that shit, nigga you wastin' the weed
You don't know what I got, nothing but dro'
I'm to hold back why'all this about ten time I'm bout to start smokin'

[Chorus]

[Mystikal talking]
Moving in slow motion, moving in slow motion,

I got some more man. That bionic-chronic.
Yeah nigga, this the smoking one. fa -sho.

And uhhhhh, how many mutha fucking times

You ain't gotta know all that bra. Know what I'm talkin' about nigga?
Smoke something. Smoke something. Smoke something. Yes indeed.",Smoke One
Mystikal,"Oh bitch I'm country as cowboy boots
High debut, beating boy band groups
Nigga let me know what the fuck y'all want do
Either keep up or you can't, can't
Met him through a BBQ, cracker do your thang, thang
I ain't come here for no dumb shit
You tell me which one is the hardest nigga? Lyrics or the drum kick?
And when it's finished over and done with
I'ma smoke a blunt and knock the pussy off of some bitch
I ain't no speedy, you see I beat it too much
I ain't gone eat it, you ain't gone drown me, and I pound it enough
See me leaving with a big butt woman
With me, walking funny, pussy up in her stomach
Sittin' in the front cause T.V.'s running
Peanut-butter leather seat, with Big Truck on it
I must've kidnapped her, the nigga man-hunting
Cause I heard him hollering, ""Hold on baby I'm coming!""

We the stars (BABY I'M COMING)
Never thought we would get this far (I'm Coming Baby!)
But bitch I told you (Tarantula)
So do what you're supposed to (Tarantula)
Give me brains
Stop looking strange
Bitch shit changed
It's just like I told you (Tarantula)
Came up like I'm supposed to (Tarantula)

Man I'm the only mother-fucking Black Prince of the South
So Ba-Ba-Ba-Lu-Bop, bitch watch out
I make your momma shake her tail feather
Don't tell your daddy that I'm here, because you know I'll make him feel threatened
Go get your sexy dress to turn me on
While he down there quoting Betty Wright, ""I know you not gone sing that song""
I hit the charts and never move off
Little homie cool off
Before your nose looks like Rudolph's
I give it to him and this bitch can't handle it
Old ugly, jealous, mother-fucker, this shit jamming
Ridiculous amounts of raw uncut talent
On top of Bass, Strings, Kicks, and Piano
Callin' me big bucks, no whammies
This year I'm screaming, ""Jive Records, Big Trucks,"" cot dammit
Heads up, tighten up, so nigga move
Ranked CEO/Rapper/Fool!

I'm fixin' to blow up like the jaws of Dizzy Gillespie
Heavens to Betsy
Julio Iglesias couldn't out rock me, Speedy Gonzales couldn't come catch me
Grammy nominated, especially
The Soul Train award winner, call me Black Elvis Presley
You probably couldn't keep up with what you've seen me on
Either 106 & Park, Queen Latifah, Chris Rock, or Jenny Jones
I knock down buildings, and chop down trees
I kick so fucking hard they say, ""You Japanese""
I'm up in the minute because of what I invent
Look at you, over there with your seat belt light on approaching y'all into descent
A.k.a The Tarantula
Hot rhymes coming from a canister
They keeping my fans for something to brag on
These people in here ain't leaving until I finish my fucking last song
Bitch walk like a Barbarian
Tall, dark and cut, now keep your fucking hoes down

See can't nobody fly, through the swamp and bayou, like I do 

I know y'all niggaz can't fuck with me and they can't but they try to 

Some niggaz just need to be warned 

It's gonna be harder to get it up on a my own 

nigga go ring the alarm 

Matter fact better know what it take 

for the back of your head to hit that grass 

Let' s get this straight from the jump 

I ain't playing with your bitch ass 

These outside niggaz that run to the mic better come clean 

Fuckin with that Saudi Arabian 

Desert Storm veteran 12th ward offspring 

I'm runnin these niggaz to the jets 

to the hills, to the back of the tracks

Chorus 2x 



(Precise) 

So Mystikal, in your own words could you explain your style? 



I gotta get a rhyme that can tumble through the air like a Rambo spear 

See y'all can stop lookin at another nigga 

face cause bitch the man right here 

You nigga didn't think that I could swing mine 

Bitch I'm doing bad and saying rhymes at the same time (I ain't lying) 

Talking behind my back don't make me no nevermind 

Cause all you can say is I'm smarter than Einstein 

I'm fire like Cayenne! 

You'll never catch me cause I'm swift as a hyena 

Gimme the chance I'll rock the lakefront arena 

like Teena Marie be rockin Tipitina's (damn Gina) 

Tall dark strong long and lean ain't nobody comin cleaner 

It's all in the way I lay my game down 

Watch me swing with the gillotine rollin round nigga town 

But everybody think these niggaz be wantin me 

to prove that I'm the man 

Bitch I'm colder than a freezer, cooler than a fan 

I got no love for no be	-i-e-otch 

Matter fact's been that way since I was wearin osh kosh be	'gosh 

But yet y'all steadily trying to squab bout me 

When I come in this door the only thing y'all can do is talk about me 

Better get some business about yourself that's what you better do 

Matter fact I'm a tell you mother fuckers three things I'm a never do 

One : never gonna change my style 

Two: never gonna bounce, three: never gonna bow 

I'm gettin tired of being sick and tired 

Nigga you got a problem with me gettin' high 

Suck big dick and die 

Same rhyme phrase get me paid, they can't fade 

the tan shade man with the braids 

Bitches peep as I creep through the 12th ward 

I done offended these niggaz compare me 

to niggaz that gotta practice looking hard 

Bitch-a won't leave me alone 

I'm not that Thug and I'm not that Ruggish but I do pack Bone 

Black prince of the south that's my title 

Bitch I'm whoo chka ckha oooooww! bad like Michael

Mystique,"Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of a gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you are still here with me

You took me from the shelter of a mother
That I'd never known
Who loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon that you'll walk
Back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of a gold
And the dream of, of what love could be
If you are still here with me

Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone

Ooh, don't you know that I wait
In the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon that you'll walk
Back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone

All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of a gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you are still here with me

He'd hurt you again 
You said you wanted comfort 
I wanted to be much more than your friend

I stroked your hair while you fell asleep

When I woke up 
You were nowhere around 
Then I called out your name 
But I couldn't hear a sound 

I called you up 
Put the phone to my mouth 
Tried to tell you how I felt 

But instead no words came out 

I looked up 
As you leaned against my door 
I held you in my arms 
Once more 
Like a dream 
Your head was on my chest 
I slipped away 
While I watched you undress

Did you ever make love to a girl in tears 
And wonder why she was crying, crying 
Was it too intense? Was she full of fears? 
Did she think that I was lying, lying 
When I told her that I loved her and I whispered in her ear 
Before I made love to a girl in tears 

It's easier to kiss than to talk 
What does she expect? What does she want? 
There's so much I wish I could give her 
When I touched her I felt her shiver 

If I lose her in the dark of the night 
Will I regret it the rest of my life?

So he put his life on the line to gain respect in his neighborhood. 
Well the only respect he gets now 
Is from the maggots and worms that are snacking on his dead ass.

And you're feeling weak, 'cause the lead got you going to sleep 
It's getting deep, know your peeps? They gon' fuck your freak 
In between the sheets in they face they drop the leaky leak 
You hear the sirens, think about who was firing 
See your partner blurry from the spark of the iron

Time for your boys to beat hoes and kick bass 
While you sit in the dark, with maggots crawling on your face

She's in the back seat, catching it from the backside 
You wish you had some rum, feeling numb 
Where the noise at? Losing it, where my boys at? 
Hallucinate seeing caskets, your son a soon to be bastard 
'cause you slipped and got blasted 
Your ?? lies in your good times, 
Ambulance 59 minutes later, now you're on a respirator 
Get on this shit, you're losing consciousness 
Man flashing, in your phat ride crashing 
Unhappy family and it's costing black roses 
Beer on the concrete, bones in your coffin 
That's all you get, a lost soul on the trip 
Times up, clock ticked, hour to be witched 

(Looking at my Gucci, it's about that time, motherfucker)

Time to sit and cry about the fact that you're gone 
Time to say fuck it, Nitro is on 
Time for your people to clean out your place 
Time for you love to go through your tin case 
Time for your father to feel a little stress 
Time for you step-dad to give a fuck less 
Time for the world to keep spinning around 
Even with you dead in the ground, motherfucker!

Je suis tombé pour Kalina, ce soir c'est bon j'le dédicace

Tes histoires on les connaît pas
Même moi dans ma tête j'ferais pleurer un télépathe
Y'a pas d'biff, nous appelez pas
Bien que j'ai plus d'cardio
J'ai plus l'temps de faire les bras
Kalina, Kalina
Kalina, Kalina, Kalina, Kalina
Fuck les insignes et les clés de bras
T'es chaud, raconte
Mais faut qu'ça s'finisse à la Jacques Mesrine, Mesrine
Comme Tony Montana meurs, meurs à la Jacques Mesrine, Mesrine
Comme Manny qui meurt, meurs à la Jacques Mesrine, Mesrine
Comme Malcolm X meurs, meurs à la Jacques Mesrine, Mesrine
Et là j'serai impressionné

Toi Kalina, toi Kalina
À force de t'vouloir, j'ai fait pleurer Mama
À chaque fois qu'j't'ai conquis, oui
J'ai vu qu'du mal autour de moi, autour de moi
La jalousie, la poisse, les stups et leur malinois
Poto m'raconte pas ta vie
Moi aussi j'dois rendre des comptes à la fin du mois
Pas question d'mourir à la Jacques Mesrine
Car Maman compte fort sur son bébé chéri
J'suis toujours à la recherche d'un plan B
Fais belek pour Kalina, ça peut te plomber

Quand t'es vrai, mon gars, tu ne parles pas, tu prouves
Quand t'es chaud, mon pote, tu ne parles pas, tu bouges
Les gangsters se fondent dans la masse comme des bolosses
Les bolosses s'y fondent comme des gangsters
J'ai tourné, j'ai tourné
J'ai vu des carrures de lion avec les yeuks d'un hamster
Kalina, Kalina
Faut qu'tu leur apprennes à te faire
Ma mimi, j'pourrais pas te promettre la Lune
Mais j'suis partant pour bien chauffer c't hiver
Coucou, moi c'est la concu'
C'est fabuleux comment tous vos sons puent
C'est pas que j'en ai rien à foutre
Mais on a coupé le son en entendant ta réput'

Et encore je suis poli
Oui merci j'veux sortir de la jungle
Tout en étant fier d'être un gorille
On s'fait vieux et les délires s'font rares dans nos halls
Enfoiré, ton pote il est mort, mais t'as pas les dragon balls
On t'envoie les soins à l'hôpital en promo parce que t'es impoli
Même si j'ai quitté la street, fuck la police

Qu'aimerait voir sa Maman le sourire aux lèvres
Moi qu'ait toujours trouvé l'moyen de la mettre en colère
Des tribunaux aux convocations du collège
Des barrettes dans mon jean aux plaquettes sous mon lit
Elle m'a vu rentrer en sang à la maison
Car dans la ville son fils chéri s'est beaucoup d'ennemis
J'bosse pour qu'un jour elle dise adieu à ses collègues
Si ça marche pas bah j'irai braquer Colette

Posé das la street
Encore la galère d'un autre négro
L'avenir appartient aux bébés
Pas ces jeunes qui meurent tôt
Lumière sur le ghetto
Un ange il est mort donc adios
Woin, woin, les daronnes en pleurs
Les gars ruminent la vengeance en chœur
Malgré leur peur
Une story de rotte-ca, de ness-bi, de respect
Pour le coupable t'es mort, comme un jacteur
Qu'est-c'tu veux que j'te plaigne?
J'te connais pas moi mon ambiance est bonne
J'ai lu ton histoire dans les faits divers
En petits caractères, ils s'intéressaient plus à Chris Brown
Même les bastos que tu voulais gérer diront
""Paix à son âme, il est mort"" comme un bon pote

Comment ils ont pillé le peuple Noir
Dans l'journal ce soir
Ils n'parleront sûrement pas de la mort de ce jeune Noir
Leur mépris envers moi et les miens
A fait de moi ce Noir aux idées noires
Noir c'est noir, il n'y a plus d'espoir
Pourtant j'continue d'y croire
J'vis dans le ghetto depuis l'époque de la Nintendo
Ouais les fantômes d'anciens morts d'overdose
Ici les khos protègent leur dos, leur bande et leur bando
Pour te buter les négros cadreront leur péno
Pour te shooter les négros n'feront pas de air ball
Qui tue par le bang bang, meurs par le bang bang négro

Et on a fait l’tour de la ville

Elle mouillait tellement qu’elle arrosait les jantes
Chevaleret Street, pimp
J’ai flow d’Rochdi quand j’me trouve entre ses jambes

On commençait à s'enjailler mais la pétasse a mis pause
J'te jure, un aveugle a retrouvé la vue
Un pigeon lui a proposé d'partager son pain
Le temps s'est arrêté, 1+1 = 2 mais elle + moi égal à 1
Elle est pas bonne, elle est classe
Regarde-moi son boule, première classe
Oh no, oh no, comme la beuh: elle a boycotté mon cerveau
Un avion de chasse que je chasse
Y'a pas que ma bouche qui en bave
Oh no, oh no, comme la beuh: elle a boycotté mon cerveau

J'étais devant le block, avec deux-trois potes
Posés pas loin d'un Glock, on parlait de grosses sommes
C'était un soir d'automne où la nuit était bonne
Et la beuh était bonne, et cette meuf était
Elle est passée et tout s'est arrêté
Cette sorcière nous a tous envoutés
Faut que j'fasse belek, elle peut m'faire tomber love
Stop! La go a mis pause

Sur ma dope made in Afghanistan
Plus j'tire et plus je noircis ce papier blanc
Et j'plane comme un pélican

Ça t'brûle, tu t'tournes vers la Mecque ou le Vatican
Je contrôle le jeu, même quand la balle est dans mon camp
Et j'ai confiance en mon clan

Je connais les scènes de ménage des tours HLM

You gave me all my hopes and dreams
Oh sweet mama
And now I realize, all the joy you've put inside of me

I, I miss you
And I want you to know that I
I, I miss you
I really miss you mama
I, I miss you
Deep in my heart, I'm lonely without you mama
I, I miss you
I want you to know

Ever since you've been gone
I'm feeling so all alone
All by myself, I need your help mama
So many days
Memories of your face lingers on

I, I miss you
Want you to know that
I, I miss you
Sometimes the world feels like it's on my shoulders
I, I miss you
I still remember the day you said
Son, you've got to be strong
You've got to hold on
I, I miss you
Hold on
Now I'm holding on
I, I miss you
You've put the joy in my heart
I don't mind telling the world
I, I miss you
Everywhere I go...
Oh when I, when I look in the mirror...
I, I miss you
All I do is see reflections of your eyes
I, I miss you
Sunday morning, Sunday morning
Make us breakfast in the morning
We used to sit at the table
Say our prayers together
Oh mama
The tears run down my face
I, I miss you
'Cause there's no one to take your place
I, I miss you
Oh mama, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you

I love you mama",I Miss You

N Phase,"This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet another guy
Understand me won't you try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye",Kiss and Say Goodbye
N Phase,"You don't know girl, what I planned for you
A little bubble bath and some whip cream too
Just bring your body and an pen mind
And when i lay you down just let your soul unwind

I'm waiting patiently-please girl don't take too long
'Cause baby i promise that i won't do you wrong!!
My mouth is yearning for some of that tasty love
So bring it on girl,'cause tonight we're in another world

Turning tricks with you, 
Doing things that you want me to do
Turning tricks with you
Doing things that you want me to do

Now that you're here girl, I want to take my time
Put on some Luther and sip on a glass of wine
I'll lick your body, now I know what's on your mind
You want me to go there (yeah that'll be fine)

I want to turn you out,and make you soaking wet
'Cause tonight will be a night I know you won't forget
I like to you you sweat
And the look in our eyes is telling me that you want me to come inside!

[Chorus]

You feel so good baby
I hope this feeling never ends
So won't you hold me tight?
And I'll love you through the night

And when I'm through pleasing you,we're gonna
break for a minute or two
And then it's on again so won't you tell me when I can
turn another trick with you

N'Dea Davenport,"My love is deeper than the ocean higher than a mountain
And I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun
Can't no other steal my heart or dampen my desire
Oh yeah baby you're the one to turn me on
 
So bring it on, on, on - and I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun
So bring it on, on, on - come and get with this it's time to get it on

I've been waiting for some kind of sign your ship is sending
Patience is the thing my heart don't wanna know
Yeah we've come a long way but my love I am depending
Don't you try to fight the feeling let it flow

So bring it on, on, on - and I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun
So bring it on, on, on - come and get with this it's time to get it on

Don't take a fool, a fool to see 
That your are the one for me stop faking me out
It's still a thrill to be down with you so baby please don't mess me around,
come on

So bring it on, on, on - and I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun

Una parte de mi que se marcha

Con, la frialdad que tuviste
Al decirme adiós

Fuiste tiempo de amor por las noches
Hay que reconocer que lo hacías bien

Era llegar con la espalda
Hasta la pared

Fuiste tantas cosa a la vez
Que me cuesta creer que hoy no seas nada

Sobre todo porque no es verdad no consigo olvidar
Esa mirada que aun me hace estremecer

Fuiste amiga de mis enemigos

Que no se puede evitar lo de ser mujer
Fuiste mucho y fuiste muy poco así son las historias de locos

N'Klabe,"Tu amor esta completamente tierno
Forjado de recuerdos
Y sin saber el cielo en la ventana
Que me abre la mañana

Tu amor me parte en dos el occidente
Me clava de repente
Y me convierte en masa que se amolda
A una ilusión ardiente

Dime si mastico el verde menta de tu voz
O le pego un parcho al alma
Átame al pulgar derecho de tu corazón
Y dime como esta mi amor en tu amor

Frío, frío como el agua del río
O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calma
Y se enciende
Si es que acaso le quieres

Tu amor despierta y lava su carita
De rosas me salpica
Y sin saber es una vía láctea
Que gira y me da vida

Tu amor lo guardo dentro de mis ojos
Como una lagrimita
Y no los lloro para que no salgan
Tus besos de mi vista

Dime si mastico el verde menta de tu voz
O le pego un parcho a mi alma
Átame al pulgar derecho de tu corazón
Y dime como esta mi amor en tu amor

Frío, frío como el agua del río
O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calma
Y se enciende
Si es que acaso le quieres

Pudiera ser un farolito y encender tu luz
Hasta que quieras tu
Como me gustas tu

Frío, frío como el agua del río
O caliente como el agua de la fuente

Frío, frío como el agua del río
No existe nadie como tu
Que me llene con su luz
Que se entregue en el amor
Como le pido frio eh

Frío, frío como el agua del río
Frío tibio nunca me dejes te pido
No me abandones sin ti no vivo

Jurándonos que nunca mas nos volveremos a pelear
Sabiendo que eso no podrá acabar jamas

Digo blanco y tu negro pero siempre al final
Lograremos ponernos de acuerdo

Buscaremos un nuevo pretexto
Y tras la guerra haremos todo el amor y la paz

O en mi sigues igual
Yo extraño mas tu voz

A ti yo te escondí
Para solo yo encontrarte si quieres salir

Quizás el tiempo de nosotros ya paso
Hoy me enundan los recuerdos, fueron de dolor
Pensando en todo lo que pudo ser, y nunca fue
Imaginando que vuelves marchándote después

De que tu sientas lo que siento pues nada se a ido
De que tu sueñes lo que yo sueño cuando estoy contigo
Hasta que logres convencerme
Que el tiempo de nosotros ya paso

Para que extrañes lo que extraño si te dejo sola
Para que llores lo que yo llore por tantas horas
Que sientas lo mal que me siento
Pues tu no sientes lo mismo que siento
Pues para mi el tiempo de nosotros no acabo

Quizás el tiempo de nosotros ya paso
Nuestro tiempo que algún día nos unía a los dos
El mismo que me da las horas de vida sin ti
Y un segundo a tu lado, me enseño a vivir

Quizás el tiempo de nosotros ya paso
Quizás es demasiado tarde y se murió el amor
Solo quisiera el tiempo ahora poder detener
Sentirte entre mis brazos, márchate después

El tiempo de nosotros ya paso

Termino y yo no pude evitarlo

Ya se acabo aquel cariño

El tiempo de nosotros ya paso

Y lo que tuvimos, se fue, se esfumo

N'Klabe,"Olvidar, y sentir depender, eso dicen

Dicen que el amor es la razón
Principal para que el corazón
Sienta temor al entregarse al dolor

Dicen que el amor es dejar huellas
Tocar el cielo alcanzar una estrella
Es depender sin entender como olvidar

Olvidar, un sentimiento
Que el tiempo no puede borras
Y sentir, que eres un barco
A la deriva y no quieres salir
Por depender, de un sentimiento
Que me hiere y no puedo entender
Te hace llorar te hace sufrir
Aveces nos hace reír
Eso dicen

Dicen que el amor no cree en el tiempo
Que se convierte en un sentimiento
Y con un beso te hace pensar que puedes volar

Dicen que el amor no tiene reglas
No cree en distancias no siente barreras
Es aprender sin entender como olvidar

Olvidar, un sentimiento
Que el tiempo no puede borras
Y sentir, que eres un barco
A la deriva y no quieres salir
Por depender, de un sentimiento
Que me hiere y no puedo entender
Te hace llorar te hace sufrir
Aveces nos hace reír
Eso dicen
Que  el amor puede mas que la razón
Que la mente nunca enseña al corazón a olvidar

(que la mente nunca enseña al corazón)(eso dicen)
Ay no no, no no, por que la conciencia no esta de acuerdo con la razón
(que la mente nunca enseña al corazón)(eso dicen)
Y escuchalo bien, y si la mente dice una cosa la contradice mi corazón

(que la mente nunca enseña al corazón)(eso dicen)
Te hace sentir, sentir que estas en las nubes y en realidad no tienes control

(salsa approved)
Y esto que te traigo esta n'klabe

(que el amor puede mas que la razón)
Ja, llega sin invitación

(que el amor puede mas que la razón)
Toco la puerta entro y se quedo

(que el amor puede mas que la razón)
Muchas veces te trae alegría

(que el amor puede mas que la razón)
Y otras veces tristeza y desolación

(que el amor puede mas que la razón)
Y como juega con tus controles

(que el amor puede mas que la razón)
Pues, hay que aceptarlo es el amor

Y esto que dice
Y esto que te traigo esta n'klabe

Por ahí hablan, que por ahí dicen
(eso es lo que dicen)

Que hace daño, que te deja cicatrices
(eso es lo que dicen)

Al igual así se fue, sin preguntarte como pudiste

Olvidar, un sentimiento
Que el tiempo no puede borras
Y sentir, que eres un barco
A la deriva y no quieres salir
Por depender, de un sentimiento
Que me hiere y no puedo entender
Te hace llorar te hace sufrir
Aveces nos hace reír

Un botón de tu camisa que se quiere suicidar
Voy bajando por tu ombligo con instinto criminal

2 deseos entrenando para hacernos el amor
2 ideas con una obsesión

Mi alma, mi cuerpo y mi ser

Lluvia tus manos
Frías como la lluvia
Que día a día fueron enfriando

Ahora tengo que olvidar
Ahora tengo que escapar
De tus recuerdos y tratar
De ser feliz con otra

Que no me trate como tú
Y que me ame como tú
Nunca amaras

No me digas nada
Y márchate
No llames amor
Tu hipocresía

Me dañaron rosa
Tus espinas

Lluvia,
Tus besos fríos como la lluvia

Flaquita, mi ambición fue poseerte y quererte si, si
Con mi locura de amarte

Lluvia
Tus besos fríos como la lluvia

Y derramar en tu cuerpo
Y siempre amarte, amarte y amarte

Lluvia
Tus besos fríos como la lluvia

Yo quería tenerte, saciarme de ti y no me dejaste

Lluvia,
Tus besos fríos como la lluvia

Tu, no has podido quererme y simplemente por que no has querido intentarlo.

Lluvia
Tus besos fríos como la lluvia

Trataré de ser feliz con otra
No me digas nada y márchate",Lluvia

Last night was a blur, but all I remember is
Black shirt, bare carats on my wrist
Me and a couple men rollin' up in a whip
Met a pretty young lady, should I say bitch
Will I ever see you again
Always thinkin' for another man's riches
Why do you do this to us men
And that's why we call them bitches
See I don't understand, she wasn't with a man
How could I leave without a number in my hand
I went to go on Facebook, will I get a face back
Trying to find you is like a needle in a haystack

I came so close, you touched my body
You left me standing like a statue, baby I need you

I was missing yesterday
I'm pissed I never took your number
Now you're nowhere to be found
I'm going mad, I need you
I been searchin' all over Facebook,
And I can't seem to find you
I really have to find you, baby I need you

Oh oh, oh, oh oh

Last night I met a fella he made me feel so, oh oh oh
That can mean what you want it to mean
Popped to the ladies for a sec (Uh, I'll be back in five, yeah?)
But when I came back out he left (I felt so alone)
He left me standing in my LBD and my bang bang shoes
I was so confused

I came so close, you touched my body
You left me standing like a statue, baby I need you

I was missing yesterday
I'm pissed I never took your number

'Cos you could be the one to make a change in my world
Maybe one day I'll put a ring around your finger
You should try bein' with a singer
And do you know the meaning of a stark in jail
Until we meet again, my heart's on bail
Wherever you are right now, I just wanna let you know that

N-Dubz,"Na, na, nye
Ooh, na, na, ooh, na, na
Yeah, yeah, yeah
N-Dubz, N-Dubz, N-Dubz

It's like first things first
You'd probably think I'm a chap with good manners
Well, you're wrong I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the worst of the worst an' I ain't boastin' 'bout my verses
I'm speaking' 'bout the way I run around snatching purses

For every meaning there's a purpose
Just because I never went to school it don't mean that I can't be perfect
For screaming' out loud we's addicted to money like two fingers tapping
On wherever there's a vein

And believe me, yeah we proud 'cause life is getting sicker by the day
And therefore we'll always stick around
Tonight you see the size of me, you wouldn't think I'm any harm in it?
Think again, I'll take your *** nicely

Chat up your wife to be, middle class, daddy's girl
I think I need to get me one and your one looks just right for me
Isn't it funny, how money can make a lot of people change?
Freakin', my friend, but I telling you, you wait

You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
'Cause all they ever do is just bring me down

So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

I remember once upon a time when I was just thirteen
So innocent and giving, everyone would act like they love me
Then all the *** and rumors began, seemed like I didn't have any friends
So much hate, lies and deceit caused by all that jealousy

Now do you *** really think that I'm the same girl I used to be?
Do you really think I will back down from you ***
If you try to bring it to me?

I know you're hating 'cause your man keeps watching
But I don't even want him, so tell him stop clocking
The more you hate I get closer to my goal
You'll wake up as nothing at twenty years old

You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
'Cause all they ever do is just bring me down

So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

Yeah, I remember them days when I didn't have no rhymes
Practicing my verse in the class 'til it was home time
I never used to pay attention in school
Was playing penny up the wall or in detention with fools

That's why most the teachers used to doubt me
They used to say I wouldn't make in my music just to see me get rowdy
So I could switch in the classroom for an excuse to kick me out
I wonder why I'm bunking all my lessons in the bathroom

Now I'm starving hungry, working hard for this super stardom life
Been kinda hard for me to try and make it right
And it's hard to decide, whether I should leave behind
All my peeps in this life, to move forward and seek what I find

This life is lethal like a *** baby being born addicted to the ***
So much evil in people, Dappy said it first
So I guess that I'm the sequel
So just because I'm black it don't mean that I can't be equal

You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
'Cause all they ever do is just bring me down

So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
'Cause all they ever do is just bring me down

'Cause you went to the park with your friends
And let a shot off in the sky
I'm a 'G' 'cause if I go to this showroom
I don't have to ask for no discount for what ever I'm gonna buy

Chuck in the door, tell him I'ma see him in the nearby future
When I wanna never ride, got the whole country shoutin' na, na, nai
Just because you got one tune on the screen
Why you goin' round west with shades on your face
Fake chain on your neck posin' to be seen, you should get rush

I did 280 shows last year
I bagged seven bills every show that's rare
Imagine how my bank will look next year
I believe, I believe

I will defeat you, should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there asap

I will eat you, don't wanna *** with me
Don't get on the wrong side of me
I'm giving you to the count of 3, 2, 1

You believe, you believe
You can mention me like I haven't opened doors
I'm the reason, DJ's pay these kids
I'm done supportin' the cause

Hold up pause, how could you mention the best?
You ain't never seen no royalty checks
You will never go to places I went
Dawg, I'm moving up PRS

These kids better done with the indirects
Naw, you don't wanna see, I vex, I'ma lured to the mic
I hear you pray for my end, you can get stuffed

I got a bad boy album ready for the stores
MySpace views that, I will piss on yours
A face that the ladies like of course
I believe, I believe

I will defeat you, should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there asap

I will eat you, don't wanna *** with me
Don't get on the wrong side of me

I remember the days we were poor
When five men would chip in for a £10 draw
That's £2 each when days were so raw
Now we're touring abroad and achieving awards

So if somebody was to take my freedom away I would hate that
Therefore if I got any problem, all I'd have to do is ring my guy
And he'll deal with it asap

When girls see me there like, ain't that the ha ha, girl?
You giving me a screw face and I, I'll show you what ha ha means
I'm not a trouble maker, but if you bring it to me I will break ya
I'm a little chick and not a ***
Young with a dream, I'm tryin' get rich

I will defeat you, should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there asap

And tease me from the back of my neck right up to my ear
She would have me to herself, she didn't want nobody else

I see her kissing some other guy underneath the bridge
I never thought she would have done a thing like this
So I'm sorry make your way towards the door
And never show your face again, bitch

So who do you think I am? Who do you think you are?
What the fuck's this? What's he doing here?
This are my apartment, tell him to duck home
I swear, I get him stripped down to his boxers
He's chilling and see time, end up in your library it looks

Tell me what do you see in a dude like this?
He can't even look me in the eyes
I can see straight through him, he's just a bitch
Do you feel him 'cause he's rich and did you leave me 'cause I'm broke?
You was only with me yesterday, you still bustin' my coke

You know I'm a sicko, sicko like my local pubs owner
What was Stanley Suk and ball screwdriver, straight canvas soldier

'Cause everything you do got me goin' and I just can't lose this

Yeah, I swear, I swear I miss the times when you would tie me to a chair
And tease me from the back of my neck right up to my ear
She would have me to herself, she didn't want nobody else
But I see that was at the time

I see her kissing some other guy underneath the bridge
I never thought she would have done a thing like this
So I'm sorry make your way towards the door
And never show your face again, bitch

I swear I know I lied to you, I should've told the truth
I couldn't hurt your feelings so I lied when I told you
That I was chillin' with my girl when really I was somewhere else
Baby if you gave me all the love I needed
Then this wouldn't have happened

Have you forgotten the days when
Where you did the same thing to me and I forgave you baby?

Now you and I, yeah we share something special
Are you out of your mind?
I'm really sorry give me one more try

Yesterday morning coming home at 5:34
The final show was canceled, I'm back early from tour
Soon as I open the door I see a pair of shoes on the floor
I know they ain't mine, I'm hundred percent sure

Now there's wild thoughts just running through my head
I'm thinkin of war, pacing up the stairs as quick as I can to the top floor
Half way there, pick up a tool that's laying on the floor boards
Saying Lord don't tell me this girl's turned to a whore

Who the hells shoes are these, I thought they were your new Nike's
Don't take me for a fool, I don't wear shoes like these, so don't lie to me
What do you mean? Where's he hiding?
I know you got a man up in here so why the fuck you lyin?

You and I, yeah we share some thing special
Are you out of your mind?

N-Dubz,"I've never had love for the feds
But I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So my people in the slum put your hands up

See it never used to come that easy
And I was just lying my way
I don't no how I did it but
I will carry on 'til I die, I ain't gonna lie now

Mama tried the best to bring me up right
Guess it never worked, she was cries
I was well involved in crime
From the age of nine music got me kind of famous
Now they want a piece of pie

Blud I'm blowin' up the scene but I don't no where my bed is
I smoke so much weed 'cause I don't no where my head is
I might have fame, but I'm still low on credit
Management loved the money, someone tell me where my bread is

I come across a lot of rich kids that die to be thugs
But I don't understand them they very, very loved
They don't wake up in the morning to see man pipin' dubs
You have to worry about them goons with the 38 snubs

You got too much to lose, you're in a great position
How can you be hood
If my whole freakin' flat is smaller than your kitchen
You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from, you'd go missing
So appreciate what you've got 'cause with that I'm still wishing

I've never had love for the feds
But I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So my people in the slum put your hands up, brap

See it never used to come that easy
And I was just lying my way
I don't no how I did it but
But I will carry on 'til I die

I ain't gonna lie, I make broke look good
More time I supply just tryna get by
You should never ask me why I smoke till my lips split
They always send me to try to stop movin' like a criminal is what I try

But you live by the roads, by the roadside you die
In every situation make man humble like pie
I've never had love for the feds 'cause they don't give man alibi
Holdin' man under arrest, takin' time outta my life

Once time's taken, time can't take back
We're from a place where it's [Incomprehensible]
Some real most idiots, mommy's tryin' hard we can see that
Once the road takes you east they won't be back

I get love on the road, I got feedback
I neva had it but I'm takin' the scene back
Then each others branging rubber of weed
Neva had it for, for a long, trust they need that
Push your hand up in the air, recognize that

I've never had love for the feds
But I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So my people in the slum put your hands up

See it never used to come that easy
And I was just lying my way
I don't no how I did it but
I will carry on 'til I die, 'til the day that I die

Na, na, nye, how's your day?
What you want? Sayin' more
I'm in the studez making moves
I'm on the road moving food
Either way we're makin' paper
Makin' paper, DAP's, I'm Mista Baker

You won't get us on your stage unless it's five 5 bills or over
Knockin' doors till I you see us like a witness from Jehovah
So where's the bitch Lola, I should've brought her over
So she can suck the whole, [Incomprehensible]

All my mad men are dark, they're on east like the sharks
They in so much different shit, the pain would never leave my heart
I'll make you piss your pants like gettin' stuck with food in your car
So I suggest you listen close, trust me you could be a star

So what do you think? Do you still wanna live like me and him?
You make me sick, you talk gun talk, you ain't even seen a stick
Don't be upset, why do you have to cry?
Na, na, nye 'til the day that we die

I've never had love for the feds
But I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So my people in the slum put your hands up

See it never used to come that easy
And I was just lying my way
I don't no how I did it but
I will carry on 'til I die

I'm afraid it's all you getting is good night, God bless
And when you wake up in the mornin' try not to be stressed
I wish I had what you had, I ain't got, no my life's a mess
So be thankful for your situation, stop actin' like a pest

I'm afraid it's all you getting is good night, God bless
And when you wake up in the mornin' try not to be stressed

I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like
What we share was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like, ouch

Six thirty in the morning, I've arrived early from tour
Step into the house, I'm walking up the stairs
1 step, 2 step, 3 step, 4

I'm on the second floor, I'm opening the door
I could not brace myself for what I saw
Who's this woman in my bed, name's Shaniqua and what?
Na, get the hell up off my baby

Now she the type of lady that every man needs
She's straight up feisty
She keeps me on my feet
But I don't wanna *** things by sex

There's some other hoe in our bed
What are you take me for?
To hell with you, to hell with me
Yeah, I never wanna see your face again

Where the *** do you think you is going, going?
I loved you so much but you cheated on me
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like, ouch

It used to be the other way around but
The story changed, my heart is breaking
You need to recognize she was just a, ah
I think it's time for me to go

Semi brown skin beauty had to get it back
I understand she's upset, she wants to kick and slap
But you say I'm from the slum I wouldn't never stand for that, think
Underneath the bridge with that fake looking twat

Now remember when we were financially unstable
Channel 1 to 5, no Sky or cable
Had to do some dirty work in order to be able
To take care of you and put food on the table

Actions speak louder then words, I can't blame her for wanting the worse
She might be wishing that I'm dead, but I know she don't mean it
Think when I found those Nike's, I couldn't believe it

Remember when we had the feds knocking at our door
You took care of the stash and hid the money from the draw
You done the right thing 'cause they had me up on the floor
So you saved me from getting five years or more

Now she the type of lady that every man needs
She's straight up feisty
She keeps me on my feet
But I don't wanna *** things by sex

There's some other hoe in our bed
What are you take me for?
To hell with you, to hell with me
Yeah, I never wanna see your face again

It used to be the other way around but
The story changed, my heart is breaking
You need to recognize she was just a, ah
I think it's time for me to go

See how's we supposed to solve the situation?
When we're both as stubborn as each other
We would argue for hours over something dumb
What the ***? Conversation done

Our ego trips never help us get nowhere
You should know this by now
When you shout I smile, when you hit me I laugh
I get all cocky like, go run me a bath

So you wanna play it like that, but baby, I can get back
You don't wanna feel my, ouch, ouch, ouch
I've done it before, I'll do it again
Just leave me alone

Where the *** do you think you is going, going?
I loved you so much but you cheated on me
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like, ouch

Wondering how I'm going to make you mine
When it turns to night, I will make it right
So many things I've been waiting to say
Held in my heart for a day like today
I wanna hold you till the light fades away

N-Dubz,"I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash

Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down
That shit right there is pricey
I ain't got no wifey

I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash

Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down

Are you set?
Back up, let me get that

Do you ever get horny reading a text?
You ever had sex over the Internet?
Webcam and shit wet up your tushy
Cut the story straight play with your pussy

All lovers put the plug in the socket like Bobby and Suzie
Wet up the place like a hot jacuzzi
I might come across sweet, really I'm a rudie

Ever since I started puberty
I was looking in magazines just to see the nudity
Truthfully, guess I don't care who you be, be

I'm fine if you take a chicks virginity
Looking at your phone becomes a misery
'Cause she calls you up more times than infinity

Bitch, let me be, I don't need no stress
I'd rather have a pint and a li'l bit sex
Who you think I am? I ain't buying you a dress
That's candy floss and I ain't here to impress

Sex no text, root it then boot it, shag that back
Fuck all the kissing and cuddling
Why don't you grab my balls and try juggling

Josh slept with Bianca
Little did she know he was wanker
'Cause he was a bi-sexual prick
He love slits as well as dicks

He fucked Bianca as hard as Rick
Never thinking of takin' a trip to the clinic
Now they're all in it, they might have AIDS
I can't have babes

At the end of the day
Josh should've put on his hood before the rain
You know what I'm sayin', anyway washin' in
Remember me, hey you know how I like it darlin'

Sex no text, root it then boot it, shag that back
Fuck all the kissing and cuddling
Why don't you put my knob in your mouth and try swallowing

Sex is a crazy thing
Especially if you do it with someone that you don't know
There's nothing wrong with a one night stand
Just watch your possession if she's a ho though

If you only knew what some females have put me through
Last week, I chased by a beast
Licking her lips like I'm some feast

I was drunk, my eyes were red
I'm kinda known so I wanted some head
Somehow we ended up in a bed
Little did I know she dreds on her legs and a wig on her head

I ain't gonna lie, I was scared
Bit fat mama came all prepared
'Bout which color condom would I like
Get the fuck off me, ooh

I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash

Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down
That shit right there is pricey
I ain't got no wifey

I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash

Be single and mingle around
Seen one to many get tied down, down

One day I had to punch up this one youth for trying to make a fool of me
In my hood there's only so many opportunities
Look I carry a tool for my pride and my jewelry
Now I find myself stuck serving the community

See me I made a change, I didn't expect no fame
We came from practically nothing to thousands screaming our name
A-list, play list, even my mum's famous
I would do anything for some source of stadium status

See the thing about life is that it's, it's just too short
Leave the past behind, and only then you'll find
There's more to life than you first thought

Cause I, I never ever, ever, ever
Thought that it would ever get better
Cause I, I never ever, ever, ever
Thought that it would ever get better

See I, I never ever, ever, ever
Thought that I could face this weather
But life, it will only get better
Trust me, it will only get better

Going back to when I was young
And I, treated life like it would never end
But then I grew up, got a little clued up
Then N-Dubz blew up finally on my way

Cause if you knew where I come from
You would understand why I sing this song
It's all changa, yeah, I put my hand up
In fact it made me man up and finally make a change

Cause I, I never ever, ever, ever

See I, I never ever, ever, ever
Thought that I could face this weather
But life, it will only get better
Trust me, it will only get better

Cause I, I didn't ever wanna sing this song again
Didn't ever wanna sing this song again
Didn't ever wanna sing this
Ever wanna sing this song again

And I, and I don't wanna walk this road again
And I don't have to be alone again
I can hold my head high, I'm strong again
I'm strong again

Money made no change, in fact it was more pain
Be's gone, who's to blame?
Look at all these youths today, rollin' round with 38s
Stickin' brothas for the white gold chains like
Look I didn't mean to hurt you mate

Back in the day I used to roll with like thirty mates
Never had clean money, always had dirty plates
Be it now, we're grindin' an' washin' for like thirty days
Now we make [?]

Cause I, I never ever, ever, ever
Thought that it would ever get better

And do the impression on me when I say na na nai
I ain't gonna lie no more you must have done a lot
For the body and the back and the brain that you've got
It's simple if I start I won't stop
You're so intelligent with such a high IQ
So if I ever have a baby id love it to be with you

The way she smiles at me every time she sees me its crazy
I'm proud to call her my lady
Like daps said, she the type of I girl I wanna see holding my baby
And she don't get excited whenever my job pays me
But if I'm on the phone she don't act right
So I try to keep them well away
So I don't have to stop a cat fight
Can't say I never said I wasn't that type 
Truly you really confuse me
And that's why

I don't quite understand
What you're trying to say (are you mad as)

I'd be still waiting for you

Said it's time for a change
Said you were feeling the same

You were so hard to trust

So suffer for the rest of the night tryin to watch her I'ma free man why do you both? After this club finished were goin to freemore who's gonna be the lucky one to sit on my see-saw.
Paid mums bills I'm just tryin' to take a break I don't wanna go to sleep I just wanna stay awake.

I swear I think I owe this night to my self, me and my friends what more can I ask for. So grab a drink and follow me.

[Chorus]

Watch me shine I'ma star.
Step into the club like they no who we are drink a few,
That's my cue to take over this place.
Spotlights on my face
All the boys want to taste so they can take a look but dont touch (dont touch)
Ladies watch don't hate don't hate.
I come to get smashed: I don't wanna go to sleep I just wanna stay awake. I swear I think I owe this night to my self, me and my friends what more can I ask for. so grab a drink and follow me.

[Chorus]

See me I keep I keep staring at my drink,
Like I wanna down more but that will send me to sleep what I need need is someone to come and be a freak that will play with all parts of my body. so much cash money lick lick (lick me like a lollie) pop as long as you don't want anything else from me (straight)
I swear I owe this night to myself My CD's going nuts these ain't any on the shelf.

I'm feeling good baby I like how I should baby.

Young fresh smells like success raise your glass for a toast see!

Just sold 300.000 records so I'm feeling over the moon.

And I know where I come from therefor I'm grateful bring another round to the table oh.
I don't wanna go to sleep (to sleep)
I just wanna stay awake (stay awake)
Get off my face,
Come we'll have a couple more
All these keep on buyin' and I'm feelin like I'm flyin

One day it's gonna be over
I can see the end of the tunnel it's gettin' closer
I remember I was seven and feeling like I was older
Seeing things I shouldn't have and quickly became a grown up
All we wanted was money but we never seemed to get it
One minute remainin', there was never any credit
Here we are, ten years down the line nothin's changed
My aim is to put my mortgage down but in my mother's name

When you're hopin'
And the only thing you're lookin' forward to is your travel and your claimin'
There's somethin' called recession keeps messin' with your brain
When I left to see the sun come, here it's always fuckin' rainin'
When you're holdin, and you're dreamin' and you can't feel what you're feelin'
When you can't give, 'cause you're hurting and it seems like nothin's working

No one knows your name
No no one knows your name
Can't keep fighting
Something that's to change
Don't need a helping hand
Till no one understands
However this ends
Hand in hand we'll remain

I remain strong always
The only change I see is only death strain and more pain
We can't get no jobs but regardless we're tryin all day
Make sure you carry on going till everyone knows your name
To all the single baby mothers, it's gon' be alright
To all the men there, who be hustlin' every night
When the revolution comes and going, dressed up as a soldier
Put my arm and run and I won't sleep until it's over
Let me show ya

When you're holdin'
And the only thing you're lookin' forward to is for someone to start blamin'
'Cause what they tell us on the news is highly entertainin'
When I left to see the sun 'cause here it's always fuckin' rainin'
When you're holdin, and you're dreamin' and you can't feel what you're feelin'
When you can't give, 'cause you're hurting and it seems like nothin's working

This is more than a dream
Though it's further then we see
I know we'll get there
I slow down, I will get weak
I can't stand and I can't reach
Everything we need is closer than it seems

I slow down, I will get weak

It's really you that I'm fully rating
And the days here no more waiting

Pay it all wise to the smart man raised him
I was so hurt, pain, aching on the wrong path
Then a good girl saved him

One big smile on my face zip it darling it's just you and me (You and me)
Now I'm on some Alfie behaviour, I'll call you back later
Too many fish in the sea for me
But when the lights come on, and what's her name is gone
I realise where I'm supposed to be

I tried to believe every word of your sweet story
But intuition keeps telling me
You're making a fool outta me

'Cause I'm such a good liar
Just admit it (I never did it)
Yes you did it (No I didn't)
Ay
I'm playing with fire
Just admit it (I never did it)
I know you did it (No I didn't)
Yes you did

I can't help myself, I keep playing with fire

I can't help but check his text, while he's passed out next to me
(It's only a matter of time)
I'm on some CSI behaviour, who's gonna save ya
You'll be the fool when the truth comes out
So when those lights come on, and what's her face is gone
We're straight back to the same routine

But guys like me be like two or three
I can't help myself I love girls, I can't kick out playing with fire

I can't kick out playing with fire

I'm doing you a favor
If done of fuckin' girls

Baby I'm not Britney
But I'm dropping of ya' radar

Cos all I'm trying to do is keep it on the low.

This ain't good for your health
And only if you knew
That every time I'm fuckin' you
I think of somebody else.
I knew one of us was gonna get hurt

I hate having to fake the feeling

Why do I feel guilty?
Just plain to see I ain't being myself.
Is it wrong if I want it from somewhere else?
Ive been holding on for so long
Cant, take, no, more, I wont pretend another day,
I think its time for me to say exactly how I feel
Cant, take, no, more,

Cant keep lying to myself

When your girlfriend says she's on her way,
And your staring at the clock in frustration thinking why is she so late
I just can't live without them, they'll break your heart no doubt
I'm the reason why she's never coming back,
Simply can't leave me around them

Girls, I fuck with them,
Tell 'em anything they wanna hear so by the end of the night, I'm fucking them
Girls, I fuck with them,
And I know they all gassed not like Mariah,
You know what I'm in love in with them!

Dappy:
From when I was younger my pain was driven by hunger
No one could tell me nuttin to save me from goin under
Mama cried to me told me you
Should get your grave dug up
The way you act in the winter you wont be here by the summer
When my papa was alive I'd never listen
See now if I could switch places wiv him just to show him I miss him
All the plans were dicussed in the kitchen
Might aswell.
The way we were on a mission
Life is a biatch until u marry one
Have a kid or 2 then u carry on
Whether you work 9-5
Or u carry guns you only live onve
So make sure you get to have some fun
Now when we in the clubs we party like we own em
Whoever thought I couldnt make it
Time has come to show em
Been a struggle all my life
But now the doors are finally open
So right now I'm living for the mother fuckin mother fuckin moment

Tulisa:
Always hated life at home
Money came in slow, getting high, runnin wild
Thought it was all I'll ever know
Me and mum up in the council flat
I had to save us one bedroom between the both of us werent exactly spacious
Never had a lot of dough, I ment no dough
Only little bit off cash I made was if I did a show
Even then I'd get booed off the stage
Collect my doe and go
I would always try my luck, but I was real unlucky though
Never met a man that thinks with his dick
Never give me my own statistic
90% of all men are pricks
So from the day I was born I was stuck in the shit
That's why, your never gonna see me cry
'Cause I'm no longer in the shit
Bitch I am the shit
That's why
I live for the mother fuckin' moment

Life's a bitch and then you die
If u don't care then why should I

You took my life and turned it upside down
If only karma didn't come back around
But I guess it's over now

When I flex it's time to party
So y'all can go ahead hit the surf break out the rum bacardi
Mad skills on the rise again
With the summer time rhyme solos out there's miles again
I'm hittin' on the down low
With something for the beach or ya jeep or ya condo
The summertime's here girls in bikinis with their sun tan glow and I don't care
As far as the eye can see
There's a hundred beach bunnies on the beach and they're jockin me
Now that's the lick and it's a pity
That you and yours ain't loungin in the city

Do ya wanna go down , Do ya wanna go down with me
If ya ready come and take me now
Come and rock me in the city

The sea feels cool and when I'm dried off you know it's over to the barbecue
The party starts at noon but it's a beach thing and I'm holding more ass than a G-string
Just blazing up I'm getting hot from the rays and the force of my paper cut
Just coolin with my peeps beach bunnies showing out from the waist to the back seat
The summer fest year after year I'm in the sun and my body's feelin blessed
Maxin and relaxin a little one on one coz all the ladies love my vaccine

I'm not a man I want to be
People growing, my backyard (I'm growing in your backyard)
In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)
Pink and purple, red and blue (See all the colors?)
On this sunny afternoon (It's a sunny afternoon)

Back before time was time and space was space
The ever-present eye divine so laced with grace
Decided it was time to try to chase, to chase
But what it would design, now life is taking place
Within itself, divided; now it takes some space
And it can't be found alive, the mind creates the state
Of ego, now what's mine is mine
OK, now hate will reign until the blind have eyes and lay awake in wait

How are the seeds in the ground?
How is my garden growing now?
A tender kiss, a little smile
The way a mother holds its child
Tasty little human beings (Tasty little human beings)
I grow them on the people tree (I grow them on the people tree)
I will eat them one by one (Eat them one by one)
If there's enough for everyone (Like you and you)

Born in the ever-flowing life beyond the dirt
Tell me what the purpose is for creating the earth
(Maybe we created the planet as man's habitat
Be fruitful and multiply across the planet's back)
Well, why does hate exist?
The war and AIDS and shit?
If we're to be fruitful, why can't poor people pay they rent?
('Cause love and hate, both sides are conjoined
Physical forms have to deal with both sides of the coin)
Why do we die? (So you can live!)
Why do we strive? (So you can win!
But why did you defy every truthful word I recommend?)
My question back, why do you recommend an ode temptationing
(So I can test your patience and tolerance in the face of sin)
But why attest when you hold all the answers to the state we in?
(For you to bear witness of imperfections of mortal men)
So it's a lesson? (And a blessing
Journey back to where you been
'Cause before the tree can flourish seeds must first be planted in)

People growing, my backyard (I'm growing in my backyard)
In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)
If you like my garden, you might like me (Look at all the colors!)

Shit gone change and it ain't gone change
Wanna play games That's out of Your Range
I got, mad brains I interpret things
Precisely pick em apart, my day start with art
Foul remarks are met with the tart
Attitude, that is rude boy, buddy embark on a Journey
Boy the tumble and dry keep turning
I be burning the midnight oils
Computer screens glaze while my ideas coil
I'm a Leo, I veto my ego, when I greet all my peoples I see through the evil
Can't outfox this, I'm cautious with gob stoppers
Who pop they choppers, uh uh

I'll ignore them, symptom of boredom
Whores come in dozens, plus they a dime a dozen
No time for frontin', better find em something
My motto is don't be sayin' shit you don't be doin and you wont be ruined
I don't be foolin', I hope these useless gooses stop the foolishness
They're excuses merely lead to my
Inclusive clairvoyance about a fear of enjoyment
Of hoes tryna snare em a billionaire boyfriend
Bitch your pussy's not gonna hold me
My mind calisthenics is my whole motif, my flow go deep
Know those streets from the solo creep
Know those beats
So don't sleep, that's how you get taken unaware
Aching for a Share, hatin' on a playa
Never wanna look toward, just sit there and look bored
And got the nerve to be materialistic when knowledge ain't nowhere on their wish list

And then they blow they whole goal
Don't even recognize inside they own soul

I remember when the Cubans was first on Broadway.
With dark and yellow gold,
I was 11 years old.
The inspiration was spread out like a blanket, ask em'.
My discovery was beyond the pick, the Lee suit, and the afro.
Now from the flair jeans on 169th and College.
Watching the dude lean on one-seven-o
With a Kangol 'cross America,
I saw the hippies cross.
By Herc on Technique needles syncopated time was on time,
The same time as the Beatles.
I was up there watching James Brown's pockets, stuffed withJolly
Ranchers.
when the NFL had the Rams in Los Angeles,
Charles Finley in Oakland,
And my kindergarten moment was the beginning.
'Til the Caribbean people came to New York and sheepskin
was bought,
The wind breaker

The building never fall down.
They are the teeth of the town (spacious thoughts)
they crush us up in they grind,
The meat and bone of the mind.
We gather here on the block (spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock.
I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well (spacious thoughts)

The balloon drops down at midnight
Stranglin' the monkey with the hands of a clock
Good can't help but do a little evil
Evil can't help but,
do a little Good.
Who's that singing in the kitchen by the stove?
All aboard for the night train!
They say the moon, it smells just like a cherry bomb.
Come on home,
All is forgiven.
Everything costs.
Deliver us from evil,
And carry your own cross.

[Chorus]
The building never fall down.
They are the teeth of the town (spacious thoughts)

The meat and bone of the mind.

I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well (spacious thoughts)

The time gathered with poppy seeds and grass,
Growing nobody faster than Jesse Owens.
With everything I'm seeing and knowing.

Walking through the airport with green Pro-Keds
Sixty-niners from the designers,
Tom McCann above the hill,
Next to my man, Lou Man,
The cardigan sweaters,
The still sell the New Eras now at Jew Man!
Bridge cont.(Tom Waits)
Ghetto Bhudda in the second set,
Breaking out in a cold sweat.
I'll meet you in the music.
We meet in the music,
those we never met.
Keep dancing like there's nobody watching
Everyone can win the toss.
I may wander, bit I am never lost.

Now I'm trapped in limbo with your golden fist symbol

Hey 
Didn't you know I can help or hurt you 
So there's no reason to lie 
I bet you let those other niggas jerk you 
Convince you that they are fly 
I never said I was an angel 
Said but I ain't like those other guys 
Listen 
You're convinced that our experience rearranged you 
Well maybe you should reexamine 
How you tried 
Or 

Am I high? [3x]

I think I've loved you since our high school 
But you only wanted friends of mine 
So when they replied 
Her she's cool 
Only then you gave our friendship time 
You won't say it but you think I'm changing 
Is it because the whole world calls me drugs 
Didn't I say I can help or hurt you 
You should be paranoid without me 
And with me feel a buzz 
Is that cocky or what 
Or 

Am I high? [3x]

It's the kinda high that got me leaning 
One hundred and twenty speeding in the rain 
Meaning of a hydroplane 
Play both sides of the field 
See I know pain 
Keep 'em high like Kurt Cobain

I'm known for speaking my mind 
Known for fleeing from the scene of a crime 
Eyes redder than the beam of my nine 
Eyes redder than the scene of that crime 
All for the love of the lime 
I'm so high 

Insinuating you're not that way 
I see how you look and use your eyes 
But when I ask you can I jump in 
Then you start again with the lines 
But if I dare you you'd blow a kiss to another 
Though my friends have no idea who you could be 
Don't worry I would never tell another 
But I ate your pussy as you laid there beside her yes she was asleep 

Am I high? [3x]

Why am I sitting here 
Peering the sky 
Is there something inside of me or am I high 
From when we talk on the phone 'til when we fuck 
This sounds like deep lust to me 
But I get high on your love

N.E.R.D.,"Love was the egg

There was something wrong
And you weren't telling me, no, oh
See, see maybe
The laugh's on me
And life was telling me a joke, oh joke

Well they say
If something's yours and you let it go
If it comes back to you it was yours all along
Well I let you go along with those lies from you
I wonder what else lies in you
Or did the lies just eat it gone?

See, I know you thought your life was gon' be easy
When you didn't call
You found that you were wrong

From all that sleeping on the fact
That your lady's
Invested
Into the mind games pointed at
Myself for wealth
Not the reason
It's my boy for you any

Like dots between
Them letters in N*E*R*D
Huh she just wanna be free
Submerge herself completely within

On the floor from alpha to N
Lend me your ears

Rap NY every day all year
I rap in the name of my love
And how you move
And the chance of you backing it up
To make me ?

She ain't property
Parked her place on my monopoly
16 candles, she blew me
In my birthday suit
I wouldn't have thought it
With them bracelets on

She a little athletic
But he's goal tendin'
Swattin' the shots
Playin' her mind games
Watching her watching me
She that old she
Mag and no tag
Spray can sexy
The colors got dang
Niggas calling a truce
Make a married man go chase
The life and vacate his faith
And go browse for proof
But your shops got bakes
In front the bass
And hunt for
Measurements thicker than
Possum meat
You possibly define a
One night stand

Because of your man

Her Jungle brother shirt
Is the sealing of her heart
How much you wanna bet more
That her brow was wet
How far u gonna go
To block the lady flow
She just wanna move
Unless she busts a groove

The tail is Titanic
I didn't wink back when she winked

With her hands in the air

All those magazines and all that estrogen
I bet she like me, but my conscience says to guess again
If she ever did I would be ready then

The best time to watch is like one or two o'clock
In a perfect world, she could come over and rock
I wonder if she would be fumbling a lot
She's taking off her clothes and 'bout to close the win-dow.

She slipped the bill through my gate that was entitled ""Windows""

She said don't go Micro-soft you like it when I bend low

N.O.R.E.,"Wish I could holla an' you physically listen, ma picture me shitting
Came far from chopping crack in the kitchen
Hated when I was a thug, couldn't understand it
Put me through school, swore soon I'd be in a position to rule

Look at me now, your only child breathing through you
For you, by you, the science of FUBU, ill creation
I'm still laying for that day I wake up
Out of this dream, see you kinetically move, a seventies jewel

A star's born, in the form of man, deep like Elijah
Mommy's only prophet speaking the logic
Now momma love said if I ever get rich
And you not alive, watch for the snakes, 'cause they got to survive

don't acknowledge the lies, or the gossip
Stay true to yourself
And don't do what your pop's did
I love you mommy forever

Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here
Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here

To the streets of my house someone not a nine, through hard times
Mom's was so strong you one of my heart's pride
And you told me I would shine in time, never win, but you know
Through you I spit and make the whole globe glow

I zone on all the things you ever did for me, my grief as a kid
Easing my pain, lifting my name, predicting I'll see fame
Change that bond that's never broken
You my heart for life, put ice on the surface of your soul glowing

To my moms straight royal, look at your boy now
Taught me the young, in turn I spoil you now
Don't even worry I'm a hold you down not far from now
When you see me and the way you've been
Just since my born day, and you proud

No matter what, so I'm touched when I spit it this way
I pray you'll be smiling for the rest of your days around
Always at my best, and that's 'cause of you
Always calm and watch you raise me to be top notch

Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here
Love your moms, hate the streets

Yo I'm a keep this gangsta, and still be G
My moms is for my seeds, my moms for me
Always been by my side, when I needed her most
When I was locked in a cell, holding her close

Visit after visit, she will always be there
My father would never cry, wouldn't shed one tear
My mother exact opposite, by all means
And it would hurt, when she see me walking in state greens

I be like ma chill, 'cause it's all good
In just two more year's I'll be back in the hood
My father, he got sick, my mother couldn't take it
She called me the night he died, said he ain't make it

All hysterical, phone dropped off the dresser
Ma you calm down, you got high blood pressure
See I understand that I got to be the man
And take care of my wife, kids, and the fam, specially you ma

Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here
Love your moms, hate the streets

Mama love, old earth for what it's worth
Sorry for all the times that I made you hurt
I know it was hard work, mother of three
Who would of thought your baby be running the street crazily'

You told me to stick to the dean, I lusted the cream
57 Fav queens with cracks in my jeans
I'm going nowhere fast, that's what you said
Didn't want to lose me to jail over some quick bread, or end up dead

Eyes bloodshed, watching your tears shed
Damn a nigga making his bed
About to lie in, I want to change, but I ain't trying
It ain't justifying, my grand pops dying

Moms, I'm sorry for the pain, there's sunshine after the rain
My past shame it's hard to explain
Can I make you happy' I love to see you smile
For your life while, ma it's our turn now

Ayo these chicks love me, and even though I got chubby
Mommy see me in the club want pop bubble
I'm like yo ma stop it, cause I'm a smirnoff rocket
I'm loving my life, and never out of pocket
I fuck dogstyle chick, I'm thugged out and rich
I drink henny that's the same shit that I piss
And I don't care about a ice wrist, I got a ice pick
Plus a ice chick, she suck ice dick
God favorite so the stay attracted
And you could fuck with the guard or get subtracted
I'll have you hideout, like when thugged out slide out
These niggaz listen like when swizz scream rideout
N.O.R, twenties on rims on ill car
You could ask Def Jam they inherited a star
You see I take flicks, and we hit the knick chicks
Bag twenties and sell them in the hood for Nick's

[Chorus]

It's still bang bang, yeah mommy it's still the samething
And you could feel on my jock, and see I'm all cock
And we could chill on your block, why not
Niggaz love me anywhere, a hood I'm there
I told nigga last year, that I ain't care
You acting like the little nigga break yo, still don't care
Whoa so if you with it, I can hit it and go
And call you from the hood later, after hugging some doe
N.O I keep it all good, I smoke more wood
And as far as my chicks, I keep them all hood
One time jake chase me, I started to dip them
And when I ran by shortie, she started to trip'em
Damn shortie ""what"" we've been through a lot together
I even had you on the block slinging rocks together
It's not a stress day, so I'm hit the expressway
Meet you at your crib in a hour, with a dress tray

[Chorus]

I'm from Q.U. double E.N.S
The first nigga selling crack with a black g.s
I like the lex, nigga so I copped the shit
And now it's summer time now, so I dropped the shit
Whatever, you want beef, better get it together
Cause I can have niggaz follow you and blast your leather
You see we thugged out, and got whips with dip dishes
Go head and keep fronting, you could sleep with the fishies
It go...",Wanna Be Like Him

Rip some pieces of niggas, we got 'card with us

Now look who creeping look who crawling still balling in the mix
It's that six six long dick slim nigga sticking your chick
Pulling tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping
Bar sipping car dipping grand wood grain gripping
Still tippin' on four fours wrapped in four fours
Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Blowing on the endo Game Cube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand cause I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm riding Sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent Swisha House (Ha!)

Wood grain I'm gripping
Catch me lane switching with the paint dripping
Turn your neck and your dame missing
Me and Slim we ain't tripping I'm finger flipping and syrup sipping
Like do or die I'm pour pimping Car stop rims keep spinning
I'm flipping drop with invisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shaking the block with four eighteens'
Candy green with eleven screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got do-do the brown with a pint of lean

Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies some friends and some phony

My chain light up like a lamp cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawling similar to a ant cause I'm low to the earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fours poking out at the club I'm showing out
I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same Swisha House or Swisha Blast
Mike Jones he running the game and Magnificent bout his cash
Michael Watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop

Have y'all niggaz in the back say fuck the cops
How it's all the same game kid yo in Queens and Watts
Yo it's gangsta, watch the Gangsta Watch

Verse 2: Noreaga
Stop the press catch me with the heat or a vest
Smoke sometimes when I got shit to finnese
When I smoke weed, creatively then I'm the best
When I get he'd first then I have a good sex
It's a cause and effect when you fuck with my set
Cause you do that, the effect you get wet! 
Fuck around I have ya little team get blessed
Have ya whole little town, mournin off ya death
I make a quick phone call, call Rell and Stef
and them niggaz won't care where ya body is left
22 a just knock you up, and pop you up
67 a glock you up and rock you up
Stupid move now you know you done fucked up
fuckin with the wrong clique, nigga what? 
Thug niggaz, grimey and loud niggaz
Drunk fucked niggaz, want to dump niggaz
Smoke skunk niggas, get krunk niggaz
Night niggaz, police straight and hype niggaz
Hit light niggaz easy to fight niggaz
Don't leave the club til it's daylight niggaz
Black puerto rican and even our white niggaz
Right niggaz flip coke with ice niggaz
Tight niggaz gangsta and trife niggaz
Street smart so I guess we bright niggaz

N.O.R.E.,"This voice and I ain't fake, jury niggas faker than they chain
The audio, the mixed show, I still obtain
Queens legend, it's Nas and it's me
Anyone to disagree, I smack em out they misery
16 years, blood sweat in my tears
I wanna do a last report for everyone that cares
Or maybe I'm just anxious like a dude for a settlement
Maybe people don't think that seeing it is relevant
It's a uphill battle when you're still rich
And your first hit date back to '96
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
I heard Akh, I told em rep left rack y'all
He said wait a year or two, you ain't gotta press me
He gonna fuck hoes for free, and get a little sexy
Yea, he was right about that
And many years later, he's still writin' about that
'Cause I'm the left rack king, I don't care what you say to me
Say I don't make sense, cool, that's okay with me
Same niggas wanna hang all day with me
And DJ's gonna play what I play
And I can break down everything that I say
Sud a whole Muscata that I drink every day
And I be daydreamin in the nighttime
Feeling like a boxer when it's fight time

It's a uphill battle, that nigga's probably hang up
Uphill battle, and my niggas never changed up
Uphill battle, some they pussy and just play tough
My uphill battle, hey you leakin' on that pavement

It's not what I rock, it's murder, get indicted for what I wear
Life is beautiful, I cherish every breath of air
Disregard the past like I was never there
They shot a round with my style like I was Fred Astaire
Yea, Raris and Rovers, bitches love Mikey more than they love Sousa
Salute old boy, OG, soldier
Carrera shades on, Louis Vuitton loafers
Everything healthy, I stay fed
I hold toast, I ain't talkin' bout baked bread
Shake fast, no matter the odds we can make it
We been married to game, that's still newlyweds
Mili taming, 2-5 shit is sacred
I rock shades and my future look too bright
I rep the east, similar to true life
Shit on your crash tables, snake eyes, shoot dice
Supreme like Jennifer Griff, all I'm seeing is green
Dirty Sprite, codeine got me on lean
For my G's with they dreams on a triple beam
Freedom ain't free but the money gave me
Fuck yo swag, we supa fly
And my dogs commit suicide
Never fall of QB, top of New York
Spit flames, cocktail, nigga like a Molotov
Self-made, student of the game
Killing Queens and my bars wrapped out at all cost

Yea, it’s time for that dome
‘Cause we checkin' out 'round noon
She said damn N.O.R.E. so cold
Keep it up, always no doors
Look at that ass, shorty on swol'
We could just go go go go
How bout some back shots?

Whip out my laptop, pulled out my dictionary
And I got head right off the whip

She want to leave in my two door
She was on the D you know Cool Moe
Freaks come out at night
I see she 'bout that life
Feed that bitch that pipe
Skeet skeet like more than twice
I'm getting head like once again and she came up out my lips
That's one part I'm just not with bitch tried

Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
I kicked her out my bed

I had to tell her, I had to tell her, I had to tell her man
I said baby girl, mamita senorita
We could've did what we did, what we're supposed to do
But after you did what you did, eww

Queens nigga but the meetings be up in Manhattan
Move the packs fast, hoops ain't full crick
We up to cook another one, bullshit
We should have the hood Olympics, a cook off
Let's see which coke is terrific and who is gifted
With the coffee pot, biggest hold the cookie jar
Let us separate the hustlers from the rookies y'all
I knew enough Spanish not to get jerked when I want work
Plus plus, plus I let my gun off, beserk
Got my cousins in the pink houses, never had job niggas
They was into murdering, kidnaps and rob niggas
I was to rhyme as a hobby in my closet lobby
Fuckin' up ounces, take it back to quarters then
Ho sales with Sa Kimble, even show I water min
Fast forward, got locked for a shooting
Hits whop it, back when like kings first recruitin'
Locked in the zone, mind separate - guidance counselor,
I went to school with a weapon, not for protection
Just to show it off, but I'm gon really use it
The power of the gun, it gave me strength, I would abuse it
I never ever ever thought I'd make it out in music
Started writing rhymes harder, and to vision the youth
Locked up, readin' Daniel Gorren's books
Expanding my imagination, I got created with the bendo
Started writing rhymes loud the streets, stand a symbol
My persona identified
Hood pride, logical, wrote about the blocks, streets and the obstacles
Man, this shit work when you think about it
I mean I still get money when you think about it

Forget my accolades and other big things I did

Give me tranquility so niggas can't belittle me

Prove shit, do the new shit
And the true school shit, wild with the deuces
Little guns for the little guns gala
Blade back, in a leather couch, harawana

I couldn't make that clearer

Hey yo Dre what's going on man what's going on
Hey what'cha all gonna do for this last record
No tell what'cha all gonna do
Ok you want me to do the intro alright

Parental discretion is advised for the moment
While I'm getting candid now understand it
Ain't too typical in any way though the pro
On the mic is the D.O. to the C., this is an intro
I know the D.O.C. make ya want to takea Valium
So buy a bucket 'cause I'm coming, it's my album
And for the record, meaning my record, check it
Listen to the single and you'll be like, yo, I gotta get it
But in the meantime, listen to the rhyme of the Dr. Dre
Played wit NWA
Yella's on the drum roll, rocking the beat
Hey yo Dre, where are you gonna take this shit man

Hey yo, let's take it to the street (word up)
Let 'em understand perfection
Let knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessing
Cause I don't give a fuck about radio play
Observed the English I display
Lyrics for the adults, children have been barred
Scarred from listening to suckers so muthafuking hard
Dope, pumping that so much shit will never falter
Yo, It's Dre, so fuck the minor ?(minalta)?
Psycho like no other muthafuka, so
Step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O
But be warn, never will I leave like a regular
Cause I'm a little better then the regular competitor
I use to see 'em on stage
Earning money like a thief but without a gauge
Until I got full of clocking the lane, getting pulled
(They said you was gonna get paid) no, that's bullshit
They like it stylistic
And I enchant the crowd like I'm a misfit
(C-see-see-C) see-see-see-cameras on flashing when I'm in action
A photo or fresh wit a flair for fashion
Pure simplicity, see it's elementary
To hear one of the hardest muthafukers this century
Try to comprise a word to the wise
And the guys, parental discretion is advised

Ren is most extremely high performance
The black hat 'cause I worn this 'cause it's like enormous
Some shit, I don't take it, not even in a toilet
And shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe, the muthafukers will learn
I'm not a sub 'cause I speak sensible
Not consider a prince 'cause I'm a principal
I'm engineering the shit that you're hearing
Cause when it comes to power, I'm power steering
Silly you say, I say you silly when you're say it
Rushing to the eject to put my shit in and play it
It's like Apollo but I'm not an amateur
And I'm not giving a fuck while I'm damaging ya
It's for the record so Ren's lyrics, I'm gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved, I'll win it
Possession is mine and I'm the holder
Cause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck 'cause I'm older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it, parental discretion is advised

I be what is known as a bandit
You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
Cause if you fail to see, read it in brail
Would it still be funky, so what's next is the flex
Of a genius, meander stutter stepping, if you seen this
Dope, you hope that I don't really mean this
But it play, making greater high top fade
It's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark
You guess it was a test of a different style
It's just another muthafuker on the pile
Driving your ass with the floor of your tongue
You hung yourself short, be after knowledge was brung
To your attention by the hardest muthafuking artist
That is know for lenching any sucker in a minute
Stagger 'em all
When I start flowing like Niagra Falls
Ice Cube is a quick to rip shit in a battle
Move like a snake when I'm mad and then my tail rattle
I get low on a flow so let your kids know
When I bust, parental discretion is a must

Little did they know that I would be arriving
And then surprising, rocking it from where I been
But it's the E here to take no mistake
To be made in a trade where funky ass records are being played
Fuck the regular, yo, I get better, the
Bitches want to trick and go stupid for the dick
So I get 'em hot thinking they're gonna get it
As they sit, rubbing their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny
But there's no type of some beef without money
So slip the see-note and you can choke
On a wind ding ding-a-ling down your throat
Foreplay to me ain't shit
When you spread them, I'm ready, then you can get the dick
Of the Eaze, if you can deal wit the size
But if you can't, parental discretion's advise

Man, you been doing all this dope producing
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is

So what you want me to do?
(Express yourself!)

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to diss one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, while I'm dropping English
Even if Yella, makes it a-capella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage, nothing

That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend; the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you're on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessing or guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go looking for the ""Dopeman""
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A. and say, ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to (Express yourself!)

(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)
(Express yourself!)
(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)

(Express yourself!)  from the heart
Cause if you want to start to move up the chart

Yes I'ma climb, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella, slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doing damage
Or I'ma be too hyped, and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we're getting hyped tonight

Sittin' in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To skoop up Ren I heard shots,

Hop in the Benz and it was Ren on the motherfucking trigger
He got in the Benz and said
""Dre I was speakin' to de bitch O'shey""
And as we roll on I seen the patrol on crip
So we got ghost because they beat

You're takin' a chance when you think that
Talkin' under your breath won't lead to young death
Fuckin' up shit and shit by the killin'
For a nigga labeled as bein' a motherfucking Villain

Again and again so tell 'em what's up Ren

If i'm not no nothin' I don't feel like
So I grab de 9 n' de clip and go to murder motherfuckers at night
Because I'm startin' to feel
I'm sittin' in a cell with a crimerz too tragic it couldn't make bail

Remember the first nigga that run is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and betray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack and fact
And take that shit back cuz they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If motherfuckers could get it, nobody would've fuck with it

For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit,
Murder in the first degree, a man slaughter
Takin' the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches they look sucked up
And the niggas is killin' it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin' what I'm sayings for greed
Then I ain't even what they're tryin' to feed my appetite for destruction

You guys know who I'm talkin' to

That Appetite is tremendous
So I'm gonna spin this
Try for some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I caught cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm the kamikaze
He took de swing from my hand, thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went bang!
And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a motherfuckin' bomb
I do damage with a 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don't know me don't understand
I'm from the streets so therefore
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas the niggas the niggas yo
And that's the way this shit gotta go, and even so
But any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And that's a million and one
That couldn't hang with the appetite

Check it out y'all, in the house y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin',
I possess the 10 commandments of the Hip Hop Thugster,
Known as a thief and murderer
First one,
Alibi a nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respected, break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one,
Always gotta fuck outta wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snap crackle and pop
Number three,
I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools tryin' to cause some static
Number four,
Here's what's in store
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hard core
Fifth one,
My killings just begun
I pulled out my gun, now they keep me on the run
Step six,
It's kinda tricky,
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E,
By the time you reach Seven you'll be 6 feet deep
Number eight,
Make no mistake,
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch yo' pray
Ninth one,
I gotta be raw, fuck any brain-washing man made law
Last but not least, I must be real,
Number ten, is my appetite to kill",Appetite for Destruction
N.W.A,"What you want is an unexpected approach,
That may delay a suspects awareness of your presence,
Until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted.

Approach to danger, don't move
It's hard to predict what will happen next.
(Oh shit, he has a gun!) drop the gun
You could've prevented a tragedy.

You can approach, but the danger-light is blinking,
A self-destruct button is activated when I'm thinking.
This is a tribulation, the weakened judge,
The prophecy was fulfilled cause I never budge.
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme,
They're seeing doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream.
One vision was of life, the other was death,
Then I didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath.
So you burn in my pit that I call hell,
Where you got send because your shit don't sell.
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke,
Of the niggaz that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke.
I started doing 'em, I kept on doing 'em,
Do 'em for shoot 'em up till that nigga Ren was booing 'em.
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger,
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger.

If you can be seen, you can be hit.
If you can be hit, you can be killed.
(He's on the line! Shoot him!)

Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler,
Outrun, the shot of a gun with a ganger.
Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be,
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody.
With everybody thinking of death I kept working,
To be one of the last niggas left.
So many people looking for hope, they're broke,
Without checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers' throat.
A heart of steal can reveal the real nigga in me,
So figuring to see the D-E-A-D
Bodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetery,
So it's very necessary to carry ammunition for niggas wishing,
But they better take caution, before Dre goes off,
And starts killing motherfuckers,
Just in order to change the anger for the real nigga,
When I approach to danger

Approach the motherfucking danger,
Come back to hell and send me some time (this is it y'all)

Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner,
Another dead body and you want to keep running.
But even the rain turns black,
All you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light.
No prison, nobody makes bail,
Everybody gotta go but see, it ain't no jail.
Think about death, taking your last breath,
Heart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left.
For so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine,
Even though they want to make a crime.
Yo, I'm being real, a better or latter in the beginning,
Because it will release the fucking police.
Fuck 'em, I approach to danger,
Cause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up.
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye,

N.W.A,"What we gonna do right here is go back,
Now this is some shit that's from the Dayz of Wayback,
When niggas in Compton first started to jack.
When the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy if you wasn't sellin' drug,
So many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged.
They always loved that shit. They want a nigga that's sellin' Ks.
But nowadays they workin' at Mickey D's.
But in the Dayz of Wayback
I couldn't be laid back,
Because I needed ends and I made that.
I get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
Start robbin' motherfuckers, just like cowboys and Indians.
Anything it took to get paid.
A nigga like Ren already had the plane made.
And I was in it to win it and not to lose.
And shit, it start blowin' up, once I lit the fuse.
And police couldn't touch me because I was payin' 'em.
But not with no money, yo, I was frayin' 'em.
And never get caught because nobody is snitch,
But one hoe did, so Ren had to shoot the bitch!
Now she's in a coffin and my life is better off and
'Cause everybody knows who's the bossin'

In fact it was one I used to pass through up,
And kickin' ass through up.

Now let me tell you a little something about Compton
When I was a kid and puttin' my bid in.
Yo, Compton was like still water - just strictly calm.
Now it's like motherfucking Vietnam.
Everybody killin', tryin' to make a killin',
Niggas stealin', motherfuckers willin' to dealin'.
With so many ways to come up
The average nigga didn't give a fuck
About another muthafucka in this game and
Claimin' what he claimin',
Livin' like he livin',
Killin' after killin'.
Murder was a dirty job. To rob a dead man
Was the best plan 'cause a dead man never ran.
But now your best friend is your worst friend.
Greed, cash the fee. Make a me more some of what you holdin'.
So now your shit is stolen
And you and your niggas start rollin'.
Yo, to get your shit back ain't a word of.
Muff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder.
They want to make you think that it's a crack thang,
Or a black thing
Or some niggas in a motherfuckin' gang,
But guns and money they go together like the Ku Klux Klan
A nigga brung up and strung up.
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Rememberin' the days that's past me,
Yo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest.
The ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test.
And number one way for you to pass,
Yo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass.
They never in the wrong though,

But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin' her in the river with sea net shoes
I knew my money was comin' up sho'
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get cought
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with the other nigga countin' my cash
I should've known she was like the mother ho's
I told the 2 motherfuckers to take off their clothes
Butt naked nothin' left but the shoes
I had up a 9 so they couldn't refuse
I shot the nigga he was outa there
And tied the bitch to the Muthafuckin' chair
Now there's one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out, that's how it turns out

One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

In reality
A fool is one who believes that all women are ladies
A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches,
And all bitches are created equal.
To me, all bitches are the same,
Money hungry scandlist groopy ho's that's always riding on a nigga's dick.
Always in a nigga's pocket and when the nigga runs out of money
The bitch is gone in the wind.
To me

All bitches ain't shit!
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!",One Less Bitch
N.W.A,"The motherfucking saga continues

All hail to those believin in the real gangsta shit
Cause when it comes to the real niggas
It makes the shit that much harder to deal with

Yeah! Above the Law up in this motherfucker
""Black Mafia"" for life
Down with the real niggas for life! Ha ha
Yo Sweet Talk, tell 'em what the fuck we here for!

Well alright y'all, USC, Compton, Watts
The Woods! All across the motherfuckin USA
Ye though I walk through the the valley of real niggas
I should fear no man or motherfuckin Klan, hear me one
Cause I been to the mountaintops y'all
And I done seen through the eyes of a real nigga
(Yo, what you think about the real niggas 187?)

Yo, they make some of the coldest shit I done never heard!

Yo, for me Km.G I must give it up
To the Ruthless motherfuckin gangsters
Fear no mob!

Because you're scared mon you're scared!
Dem de pussy runnin at y'all scared mon
Bend dem silly bumba claat barber 'til de pussy claat run
BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! Keep Baby-lon on the run, seen!

The real niggas is back, cause there's too many bullshit records out
Niggas fiendin for what we put out
But you don't have to wait no longer
Because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger
So many groups made three albums or more
And that weak-ass shit is still sittin in the record store
They wonder why it never sold
Niggas rappin since the 70's and still never went gold
Our first record sold two million copies
That's because you other motherfuckers are sloppy
You came out street and crossed over
And after that your career is fuckin over
Because of that you're not around
So shut the fuck up and witness the sound of some real niggas

Yeah motherfuckers!
Keepin all you busters on the run in '91
Kick that shit Ren

Most niggas can't understand
And never will if they ain't part of the Ruthless mafia clan
Niggas is dedicated to the streets
With hype fuckin lyrics and the dope-ass beats
The songs will never come soft, because I come off
So don't get in my way cause motherfucker you'll get cut off
And it's somethin you can move your lips to
To wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you
And let me now if you wanna ride
The D-I-C-K, all day that's with no play
Cause ain't no rap group out that I know
That make me wanna listen to the radio
All I hear is motherfuckers tryin to make a comeback
With lovesongs, and that shit is whack
And that's why your ass ain't around
Cause you don't have the motherfuckin sound
Of a real nigga (Yeah motherfuckers!)",Prelude
N.W.A,"Yo, what's up niggas and niggettes?
N.W.A is back in this motherfucker
And this is only the single
Wait until the motherfuckin' album comes out
We gon' have some more of that good shit
The shit you just can't fuck with
But yo, we ain't finished. Tell 'em what's up man

Yo man, there's a gang of motherfuckers out there on the dick
Man, in every motherfuckin' state
Wanna be like, wanna look like, wanna act like
Wanna dress like, wanna sound like muthafuckin' style stealin'
Clone ass N.W.A bitin' ass motherfuckin' everywhere man
Non-reality seein' non-reality feeling
Non-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man
Hey, I don't know. Reality, it's important to me, man
So fellas man, tell these niggas what it's like in the minds of real niggas'

Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker
And your ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Don't try to hang, you're best abroad
'Cause my foot will be so far up you ass, you're get hemorrhoids
Before you try to fuck wit Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10

First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
But how the fuck you think a rapper last
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy

Falling deep in the drums so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and out beating the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
'Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs
And not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us

Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you
You can't harm me, alarm me
Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know
We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
Try us and take it
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in

It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas

You can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find ya
'Cause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind ya
Don't look back, because you're shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on
Don't step on my muthafucking stage without Nikes on
Don't say it's psycho, and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow

All these niggas wit the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it's the shit we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But I'm a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, 'cause if you're mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead

Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little streetwise nigga, you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit
(Now how much harder can another nigga get?)
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
(Ashes to ashes and dust to dust)
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real

Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the King's and Raider's hats

They played out, that's what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we ain't happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record come, I'll come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
Because if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up
Don't come in my face again, because I'm a floor ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitude's a little bigga
'Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas

Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest
Sucker muthafuckas like you, making whack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortise
'Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga wit hard, a nigga that's smart
A nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, NWA, criticize for what we say
But I'm a do the shit anyway
'Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in

It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas
Yeah motherfuckers, real things
You are now real niggas

So me and my ace, we got a taste
Of a motherfucker's billy club, he took his gun and
Put it to my head and said, ""Nigga start runnin'""
So tell me what's the next episode?
Is he crazy, does he want to chase me or waste me?
I thought ""Run nigga run"" but I caught myself
Because my secondary thought was death
I've got head and heart real, but still a motherfucker said
I want another black motherfucker dead
Niggas ain't good for shit to me
'Cause it's a race for second class, so get your ass
Up against the wall bitch! And then he tried
To jump me but the punk became a victim of a walk by

Real niggas don't die cause they eventually multiply
The niggas I'm with, they take an eye for an eye
Because the times are so wrong, gotta stay so strong
Niggas gotta keep it goin' on and on
And don't let no paleface throw your ass in a snail race
Have your residence occupyin' a jail space
That's what they want to do cause the system is fucked around
I try to let you know with the record that's underground
They don't give a fuck about a nigga, they would rather pull the trigger
And have you runnin' from barrels smilin' sayin' ""Cheese!"" (""You out there?"")
So nigga get smart and rebel back
I'm not with that black shit so I'm not gonna yell that
All I see is niggas getting harassed
And can't do nothin' about it but get a foot in they ass, yo
But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin' motherfuckers it would put 'em in line
And that's how it's supposed to be
When a pussy-ass nigga try to fuck with me

To kill a nigga 'cause nigga a motherfuckin' real nigga don't die!

Puttin' ass kickings on the niggas that never had
So I guess that makes me tough shit
Straight up gangsta, wrong nigga to fuck with
So how can a nigga die, when he's causin' the bloodshed
I shoot motherfuckers in the head
Tryin' to make a nigga extinct because they fear me
But never wanna hear me

You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?
We haven't spotted them yet
But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity

A 100 miles and runnin
Mc Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a muther f**ker and it's done in.
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a f**k.
Chances are usually not good
Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood.
And getting' jacked by the you-know-who.
When in a black and white the capacity is two.
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers. Now wearin' 
my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, muther f**kers. They're out to take our heads 
for what we said in the past. Point blank - they can kizz my black azz. I 
didn't stutter when I said ""f**k tha police"". Cause it's hard for a nigga to 
get peace. Now it's broken and can't be fixed. Cause police and little black 
niggas don't mix so 
Now I'm creepin'
Through the fall. Runnin' Like a team. Well, see, I might have slayed y'all. So 
for now pack the gun and Hold it in the air. ?cause mc ren has a 100 miles of 
runnin

""Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run.""
""FBI sources tell us that the four are headed""
""100 miles to their home base, Compton.""

Lend me a muther f**kin' ear.
So I can tell you why...

Runnin' With my brothers, headed for the home base.
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced.
The road ahead goes on and on.
The shit is getting' longer than the muther f**kin' marathon. Runnin' on but 
never runnin' out. Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out. 
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do. But nobody's pickin' up a nigga witta 
attitude. 
Confused. Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose. One of the few who's been 
accused and abused Of the crime of poisonin' young minds. But you don't know 
shit til you been in my shoes. And Dre is back from the c-p-t. Droppin' some 
shit that's d-o-p-e. So f**k the p-o-l-i-c-e! And any muther f**ker that 
disagrees. Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass. 'cause I'm a nigga known for 
havin' a notorious past. My mind was slick - my temper was too quick. Now the 
FBI's all over my dick.

Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock. That's 
when the e jumped off the startin' block. A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a 
long stretch. A little sprintin' muther f**ker that they won't catch. Yeah, 
back to Compton again. Yo, it's either that or the federal pen. 'cause niggas 
been runnin' since beginning of time. Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my 
muther f**kin' mind. Runnin' like I just don't care. Compton's 50 miles but, 
yo, I'm ma get there. Archin my back and on a straight rough. Just like Carl 
Lewis I'm bailin' the f**k out. from city to city I'm a menace as I pass by. 
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm A straight up nigga that's done 
in, gunnin' and comin' Straight at yo ass. A 100 miles and runnin' 
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton.
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you: ""nowhere to run 
to, baby. Nowhere to hide."" Good luck brothers.

Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused.
I know it was a set-up.
So now I'm gonna get up.
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up.
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong.
They got everybody singin' my ""f**k tha police"" song.
And while they treat my group like dirt,
Their whole f**kin' family is wearin' our t-shirts.
So I'mma run til I can't run no more.
'cause it's time for mc ren to settle the score.
I got a urge to kick down doors.
At my grave like a slave even if the ren calls.

Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherf**ker's are ridin'
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.
The number's even - now I'm leavin'.
We're never getting' took by a bitch with a weave in.
Her and the troops are right behind me.
But they're so f**kin' stupid, they'll never find me.

One more mile to go through the dark streets.
Runnin' like a mutherf**ker on my own two feet.
But you know I never stumble or lag last.
I'm almost home so I better haul ass.
Tearin' up everything in sight.
It's a little crazy mutherf**ker dodging the searchlight.
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherf**kers goin' crazy with
A 100 miles of runnin'

N.W.A,"Yo man there's a lot of brothers out there
Flaking and perpetrating but scared to kick reality

Man, you been doing all this dope producing
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is

So what you want me to do?
(Express yourself!)

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to diss one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, while I'm dropping English
Even if Yella, makes it a-capella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage, nothing
But making a sucker and you equal
Don't be another sequel (Express yourself!)

(Express yourself!)

Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend; the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you're on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessing or guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go looking for the ""Dopeman""
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A. and say, ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to (Express yourself!)

(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)
(Express yourself!)
(Express yourself!)
(Go on and do it)

(Express yourself!)  from the heart
Cause if you want to start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Movin like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wessun for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doin' the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob!
Yes I'ma climb, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella, slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doing damage
Or I'ma be too hyped, and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we're getting hyped tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just (Express yourself!)

When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punk-ass niggas start breakin out
Cause you know, they know whassup
So we started lookin for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin
""I got a boyfriend"" Bitch stop lyin
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nuttin but a dyke
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to em, and said, ""Whassup?""
The first nigga that I saw, hit em in the jaw
Ren started stompin em, and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said, ""Let's start some shit!""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot
Takin niggas out with a flurry of buckshots
Boom boom boom, yeah I was gunnin
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin
And fallin and yellin and pushin and screamin
And cussin, I stepped back, and I kept bustin
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A. is wanted for a homicide
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck wit me, I'll put my foot in your ass

Some dope-dealin’, some gang-bangin’
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared, and hit the gas
Right then, I knew I has to smoke his ass
He kept rollin’, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin’ all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play, from the ladies
With six niggas in a car are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin’
We all said ""Fuck you bitch!"" and kept goin’
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin’ else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin’ at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailin’
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin’?

Here's a lil gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy E cold runnin shit

Well I'm Eazy E the one they're talkin about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
Wit the ""Diamond in the back, sun-roof top""
Diggin the scene with the gangsta lean
Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin to you
""We want to fuck you Eazy!"" I want to fuck you too
Cause you see, I don't really take no shit

N.W.A,"[Dr. Dre]
Check this out, we've come to the last and final record
This is Dr. Dre in full effect and we gonna kick it off a little some this like this
We got my mella yella boy on the drums, We got Stan ""the Guitar Man""
Dropping the rhythm. We got LA Dre on the keyboard and I want the whole
Posse in this motherfucker to rock on this funky ass beat we're gonna drop
Alright, So Ice Cube, you the early bird on this motherfucker , run it

[Ice Cube]
Picture a nigga that's raw
Amplify his ass and what you see is what's on
Motherfuckers I slaughter, blow em out the water
Word to me, fuck the father
My melody is deadly as a pin in a hand grenade
5 seconds before you get played
You can't throw me, I guess you'll blow up
Ever see a sucker scatter, it'll make ya throw up
Then I take advantage, you can't manage
To get up, all you can do is sit up, I get lit up
Hit up, Ice Cube tearing shit up
Like a dude you can bet on
Collide like a head on
Collision, stutter stepping is an incision
Of a nigga saying exactly what I vision
Because I'm gone, you think I left you all
But I stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
When I blast some solid ass Alcatraz
And if you escape, you better swim fast
'Cause I'll catch ya, physically and mentally
And the capital punishment's the penalty
Sitting in the electric chair, grab a hold
Pull the switch, yo' body twitch, your eye's explode
Out your skull 'cause being dull on a flow
Is an N-O, niggas didn't know that I can go
Off and show off to throw off the law
Turn, take 10 paces then draw
What's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley
Ice Cube is the shit on the grand finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, yea that was funky but we need the motherfucking villian to speak
So kick it

[MC Ren]
The grand finale, yo, it's my turn to bust
So let weak motherfuckers turn to dust
If you're weak it ain't my fault
Just take a kick in the ass and get turn into a pillar of salt
And niggas that's biting just to taste me
I make the punk motherfuckers buckle up for safety
And on the dope they caught from the flash
And swing like a bit when he's caught in a whiplash
Giving him pain 'cause I'm urgent
Rearrange the motherfucking face like a surgeon
It ain't no excuse for the torture delivering
Don't say that I scare you, I can tell 'cause your shivering
Lyrics label wit an X and not a G
I say fuck the police, yo, so now they after me
I'm wanted by the law so I stay low
Representing the pimp, bitches making my dough
In a different stage, I must of went on a rampage
Me and the D.O.C. are always hitting the front page
For what, for stealing and stepping up to the sheriff
And when I enter the party, niggas shit in a (cell pimp)
For what, maybe 'cause I'm Ren
And when they clean up shit, yo, they do it again
So fuck it, sit back cool and relax
While Eazy busts the facts kicking the grande finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, y'all know what time it is. Easy motherfucking E is in the house doing
Damage

[Eazy E]
The name is Eazy for me to come off like the inforcer'
Mass murder motherfuckers in a course of
An everyday situation where I would stalk by
Fuck the car, I do a motherfucking walk-by
Eazy-E and the D.O. to the C. and
Run house and there won't be no disagreeing
'Cause if there is some, you feeling staticy
Then I'm arrested (For what) assault and battery
Never outdone, only outdoing
Loving the bitches and the hoes boo hooing
Why 'cause they're addicted to my dick
The pleasure of pain, the wing-ding and flipped it
(Yea) and never forget when done in bed by
Eazy, the name of a Compton hard head
Cool but local like loc never broke
'Cause they're paid to be Ruthless, this is why I do this
I don't give a fuck about fame
I rather deal wit a number than a motherfucking name (word)
Get me paid and then rap
'Cause all the other bullshit money ain't jack
Eazy but not that Eazy to deal wit
Especially if you're popping bullshit
Put the E-A-Z-Y and to the E
Expression of thought on the motherfucking grand finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, that shit was funky, last but not least is the motherfucking D.O.C.
This is your album, so that means you definitely got to get funky, so run it

[The D.O.C.]
Swinging, singing a brand new rap
On a rhythm concocted by my homie in the back and
If it makes you giggle, it must be kinda funny
But to me it's kinda cool (Tell 'em why), I'm making money
Tripping up the man wit the (swig tan) movement
Proving if you're grooving then it cool when he be doing it
Taking a second for me to blow your mind
'Cause I'm the diggy diggy D.O.C. and I would've been down wit rock
But I was smart, the D.O. to the C. now on the formula
It's rough, I mean it's funky enough for me
And you can have a listen after that and this and
D-O-N-'T M-O-V-E wit out permission
From the D.O. to the C., I'm just better than
The normal man and I'll be dumb if a sucker can
Ever compete wit the elite
Much less beat, it's like dancing wit 2 left feet
Never smile when the D.O.C. is in the room
Or I'm a send ya ass to the temple of doom
I got raw when I came to Cali
Now wit NWA on the motherfucking grand finale

Shout outs",The Grand Finale
N.W.A,"Cruising down the street in my six four
Jockin' the freaks clocking the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Till I caught him in my car trying to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulled out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded twelve gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
Went to the spot where my homebys chill
The fellows out there, making that dollar
I pulled up in my six four Impala
They greet me with a forty and I started drinking
And from the eight-ball my breath start stinking
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross cold knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped my six four round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin' home I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin' Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beaten for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

Dick in hand, you shoulda had your toke down
A little city, chillin' in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boyz don't play fool

In the back, sippin' purple chongos
Don't look for trouble but it always seems to find us, forty
Grippin' panties, sippin', and the seats are right behind us
Quick left, one blow, K.O.
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh what the hell, I guess i better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kick on
A fifth of Henny, for me to get bent on
Hit the country club then picked up ML
Eighty west, back to the hotel

At the telly, Bones is doing butt work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The Latina in the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me baby doll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, brother striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 to the triple gold Z's
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what i mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin' in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the telly, I gotta get some new cock
New cock (echoes)

Ah naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad want to do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her so i called TL
Soothe me up, Sally want to meet Dick
And Monty licked, so try an' make it real quick

(tick-tock)
(tick-tock)
(tick-tock)
(tick...Honk Honk)

Aw yeah, I jumped in the F-train
But wait a minute, we gotta hit the store man
I got to get some gum and some Tic-Tac's
Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjack's
We got the goods, now we're headin' for the ho down
There goes the telly, so fella won't you slow down
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case, we gotta bust a quick one
Lock the load, let's go look for like 118
But lay low cause I really don't want to be seen
Is this the room? Aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one
So hit the lights man, I just might man
Try an' throw this thing all night an'
Get her so sprung, that she'll drop some ale
So I can catch turn and hit another hotel",Back to the Hotel

I guess yo dick gotta stay on wood
But me (What's up?) I get mine (Ah-ha)
Check into the telly 'bout half past nine
And when I check out it's ten to two
My knees is week cause I got blew
So let me put you on my list
Of the dookie broads that I can't kiss
And next time that you see me
Bitch, don't even talk to me

Is hit the dirt and do my crew

Do the crew, do the crew

Do them too
That's right, hoe

Now let me put it like this
Baby, I ain't tryin to diss
But now I know who you are, so I don't think we can kiss
You look good, and maybe I might be wrong
But now I know where you been and the list is long
You been in motel, hotel, holiday inns
You been with most of my cousins and all my friends
And in a Benz way out in the Crest
Doin the wop, the crew thing and the strictly sess
Hard knob, baby, you're gettin raw, baby
And for a couple of bucks you give jaw, baby
So here's a ten spot, now hit your knees
Do me first and then do Tee
We'll bust that nut and we'll shake it off
Pull up our draws and we're takin off
Hit the gas and we're gone
But you ain't through
You gotta do my crew

Now even though you got switch, bitch, you ain't all that

So if you want to get with Jay Tee
Bitch, you gon' have to pay me
So kick me down just a few

And I'm the one on drank - that's why he's always drunk
So if you want to  then you'll have to talk to Tee
But if you want to then you'll have to talk to me
We both like bangin' broads, or should we say a chick

And the rest of the world was sleepin
I got a beep from a little freak I met
At the mall, yes y'all, she was gettin the call
So I called, said: What's up, what's the deal?
You booty looked real good today
You know I'm ready to lay

She said: Cool, bring someone from the crew
I said okay, picked up [Name] on my way
I woulda got [Name] but he was with some hoe
So it's just me and the dog and we're ready to gee
We picked the girl up and it was plain to see
That she was down to spin around and all that
Parked the ride and we jumped in the back

Oh, it ain't no use in trying, so come on out, come on out, 
I know you're in there, I need you now 
'Cause I'm about to lose it all and you're the only one I can call on
Know if you hear me, I need you, 
Know if you're listening, I'm in trouble
Know if you're there, I'm falling and I can't get up,
So hurry up and just say no... No, no, no, say no. 

Now I'm in the hotel elevator on my way up to her room 
Where she's waitin' on me to lay it down 
And do whatever as long as I make her feel good, good, good. 

[Chorus]

Please get me back to my girlfriend who's waitin' at home, 
Get me back tonight without doing a wrong
And I promise, promise, promise, promise, promise, promise, promise 
I'll never ever do it again.

So come on out, come on out,
I know you're in there, I need you now, 
'Cause I'm about to lose it all and you're the only one I can call on.
Know if you hear me, I need you, 
Know if you're listening, I'm in trouble.
Know if you're there, I'm falling and I can't get up 
So hurry up and just say no, no... Say no.

'Cause you got me in a room and I'm feelin' kinda weak, (no, no, no)
Leadin' me to the bed (no... Say no)
But I don't want to cheat (no, no, no)
She just turned out the lights (no... Say no)
And put my hands on her thighs, (no, no, no)
And it feels so good, but I know this ain't right (no... Say no)
And I want to go home, no, take me home, 
No, I'm in trouble, no get me my phone.",No...Say No

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves

I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.
Dwight Yoakim's in the corner, try'n' to catch my eye.
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey, the stars might lie, but the numbers never do.
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight.

But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.

I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

I crack eggos, break gats down like Legos
Bring 'em home for toys

If you can't roll through the hood
Play like Snoop Dogg and lay low
Go peep Rambo, on five-eight
and them two door eight-five-o like its nine tray

hit stages, rock mics pull dykes
Every state--wait, can't forget where I'm from
Dump narcotics, grip nines rock Nikes
Everyday me and Sonny Black roll with the K
Flip ya Cadillac, bloody you lay (what the beat say?)

Don't make Freeway fuck you up!
Shoot up your way!

Rima vicio,

Sólida como edificios,
Profunda, precipicios,
Es mi oficio,
Contar historias espectaculares como fuegos de artificio,
Eludiendo lo ficticio,
Separando lo real de lo falso,

El MC que siempre resuelve problemas,
Él que se envuelve en tus penas
Y en tus venas se introduce como la penicilina,
Y conduce velozmente en el circuito de la rima,
El que caza versos como niños cazan lagartijas,
Y guarda más misterio que una puta tabla ouija,

Rechaza rimas flacas,
Saca gordas como... el que tiene tropa que le arropa,
El que tiene en vez de boca bazoca,
Y vive la vida loca,

El invencible,
Vivo libre como el viento,
Imparable como el tiempo,
Quieres tú seguir mi ejemplo?

O eres un Judas que esta dispuesto a besarme,
O un francotirador que ahora quiere dispararme,

Entra,
Bienvenido a mi palacio,
Donde el verso va deprisa y el tiempo corre despacio,
Los fachas son los únicos que no entran en mi casa,
Pero no se les pega,
Se les da un libro,
A ver si se les pasa.

Sigo atrayendo masas,
Con mis ases,
Altas,
Medias,
Bajas clases son testigos de mis frases,
Pesada artillería,
Bombas de relojería,
Hechizos de brujería,
Quedan todas las calles frías,
Qué creías?

NS tras su aliento fabulosos productores del talento,
Cero por ciento y lo siento por aquellos que en mi nunca creyeron,
Cayeron en mi mierda y después se la comieron
Y ahora reconocen que soy incombustible,
Derribarme no es posible,

Il s'enfuit, comme le vent au-delà

J'entends se briser mon cœur de pierre
Dans la voie lactée, un autre amour se perd
Et je pense à toi, j'en perds la raison
J'écoute ta voix, rechante la chanson

Tu es parti, tu es partout
Même la nuit me donne des coups
Sous les larmes, mon sourire, se noie
Et la femme de cire, se débat

J'entends se briser mon cœur de pierre
Dans la voie lactée, un autre amour se perd
Et je pense à toi, j'en perds la raison
J'écoute ta voix, rechante la chanson

Si loin déjà des jolies heures
Et je pense à toi, j'en perds la raison
J'écoute ta voix, rechante la chanson

Oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Rechante la chanson
Et je pense à toi, oh
J'écoute ta voix",CĹur de pierre
Nacha Guevara,"Lastima bandoneón, mi corazón
Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lágrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo
Donde el barro se subleva

Ya sé, no me digas tenes razón
La vida es una herida absurda
Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más
Mi confesión

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón

Nacha Guevara,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",Mi Hombre
Nacha Pop,"Un día cualquiera no sabes que hora es
te acuestas a mi lado sin saber porque
Las calles mojadas te han visto crecer
y tú en tu corazon estas llorando otra vez

Me asomo a la ventana eres la chica de ayer
Jugando con las flores, en mi jardín
Demasiado tarde para comprender,
chica vete a tu casa no podremos jugar

La luz de la mañana entra en la habitación
tus cabellos dorados parecen el sol
Duermo por la noche me pongo a escuchar
Canciones que consiguen que te vuelva a amar

Me asomo a la ventana eres la chica de ayer
Demasiado tarde para comprender,
mi cabeza da vueltas persiguiéndote

Letra para una canción
Qué más da si fue pasado o no

Solo me encuentro en mis papeles
Locos que piensan
Salen de un circo inmortal
Y me enseñan lo que ignoro de ti 

No cambiaría jamás, no
De este universo informal
Donde crecen las semillas de lo absurdo y lo genial
Donde el hierro se retuerce y se transforma en lo esencial

Cuando se va la emoción
Y me acerco lentamente a ti

Y cobran forma la locura y la paz, no

A fuerza de recordar lo que no llegó a pasar

He aprendido a ser una pieza más
Un eslabón en la oscuridad

Hay una forma de parar el tiempo
Desordenando la evolución
Y en la prehistoria encontrar
Esos ojos que no puedo olvidar

Te pruebas lo que te compré, pórtate bien

Ponte en pie que aquí no se puede hacer
Cúbrete, te vas a congelar

Son sus manos en mi pelo 
De nieve, huracán y abismos 
El sitio de mi recreo 

Viento que en su murmullo parece hablar 
Mueve el mundo y con gracia le ves bailar 
Y con él el escenario de mi hogar

Mar bandeja de plata, mar infernal 
Es un temperamento natural 
Poco o nada cuesta ser uno más

Voy a revelar una historia que es
a veces mentira why otras no es verdad.
Me quede sentado esperando la llegada
de la suerte no podia tardar. 
why paso tanto tiempo que llegue 
a ver sombras en color.
why paso tanta gente por delante
que nadie me vio.

Esperaria de pie que el anochecer
se fundiera con la tarde why el amanecer.
Como un vendaval a mi paso se revuelven 
los trozos de un quemado papel.
why crecio a mi lado como un arbol
toda una ilusion.
why crecio a su lado monstruosa
toda una obsesion.

[Estribillo]
En plena noche, a eso de las tres
algo se acerca why no se deja ver.
Abre mi puerta quiero entrar why salir
why refrescarme antes de repetir.
Vivo en la calle, estudio de aprendiz
con libros que en la escuela nunca vi.
Abre mi puerta quiero entrar why salir
why refrescarme antes de repetir.

Me perderia de pie esa sensacion 
de encontrarme con las cosas por segunda vez.
La oportunidad de buscar en los
cajones un recuerdo que amar.
why paso tanto tiempo que llegue 
a ver sombras en color.
why crecio a mi lado como un arbol
toda una ilusion.

Nacho,"Hoy me dio por escribirle una canción de esos momentos 
En los que estamos desnudos 
Tu y yo haciéndonos uno 
baby dándote duro 

Lo de nosotros es pasión, es deseo y sentimiento 
Son muchas ganas lo juro 
Baby ven aquí, di que sí 

Quiero darte como aquella vez te di (ooh ooh ooh) 
Quiero darte como aquella vez te di (ooh ooh ooh) 
Quiero darte como aquella vez te di 

Me quieres adentro de ti, así 
Como en la última vez que te di 
No sé ni cuantas horas te di 
En esa habitación me metí 

Te di, te di, te di
En 3 dias de tu cuarto no salí 
Mala letra en tu piel escribí
suspirabas y gritabas Kevin Roldan 
El que conduce un Huracán 
El favorito de tu novia, de tu mujer, de tus fans
Mami tú eres la baby 
Tu andar conmigo, el dinero llueve como confeti 

Ay esa mujer a mí me vuelve loco 
Son muchas las poses que le quiero hacer 
Por una sola noche yo me desenfoco 
Y me pongo pa ella pa' darle placer 

Ay esa mujer a mi me vuelve loco 
Ay me encanta como me hace el amor, 
no me olvido de ti 

Quiero darte como aquella vez te di (ooh ooh ooh) 
Quiero darte como aquella vez te di (ooh ooh ooh) 
Quiero darte como aquella vez te di 

Me quieres adentro de ti, así 
Como en la última vez que te di 
No sé ni cuantas horas te di 
En esa habitación me metí 

Y te di, te di, te di
Toditas tus fantasías te concedí 
Baby girl modelando para mí 
Y terminaba yo encima de ti 

Tú me dañas la mente, el susubconsciente 
En mis recuerdos yo te tengo presente 
Envía la pócima que venga el recipiente, se siente 
Que tú me atrapaste para siempre siempre 

Baby ven aquí di que sí 
Quiero darte como aquella vez te di (ooh ooh ooh) 
Quiero darte como aquella vez te di (ooh ooh ooh) 
Quiero darte como aquella vez te di 

Me quieres adentro de ti, así, así 
Me quieres adentro de ti, así, así",Teddy
Nacho,"Viva Venezuela, mi patria bella

Ya casi rompo las cadenas 
Ya casi grito que llegó la libertad (Que llegó la libertad) 
Siento que mi alma estará llena 
Y mi corazón también en paz 

Volveré a poner mis pies sobre la carretera 
Caminaré a un mejor futuro 
Ya la espera desespera 
Desespera perder tanto en el daño de una era 
Yendo hacia atrás con tantas ganas de llevar la delantera 

Cómo quisiera ver que se regrese el tiempo 
Volver a los momentos de magia y de ensueño 
La suerte que yo tuve cuando pequeño 

Tengo que ser valiente, valiente 
La fe nunca la debo perder 
Tengo que ser más fuerte, más fuerte 
Subir mi voluntad a otro nivel 

De espíritu rebelde, valiente
Para mejorar este presente y saber lo que se siente 

Librarse de la tiranía 
De un movimiento en agonía 
De la dura situación de cada día 

Que vuelva la alegría 
No pares que ya vamos en la vía 
Seguir luchando es la garantía 

Si es que mis horas se fueran parando en tierra y guerreando 
Prefiero eso que estar con la crisis modelándote 
Un carro, mil joyas 
Y otro anhela tener comida en la olla 

Valiente, valiente 
La fe nunca la debo perder 
Tengo que ser más fuerte, más fuerte 
Subir mi voluntad a otro nivel 

De espíritu rebelde, valiente 
Para mejorar este presente y saber lo que se siente

Ellos son los fantásticos 
Todos de Venezuela, al igual que yo
¡Y yo también! 
El señor Franco de Vita 

Caminar en libertad 
Ir por las calles así normal (así nomas) 
Como ayer, sin temer, cuando llegue la paz 
Caminar en libertad 
Ir por las calles así normal 
Tiempos que añoro 
A veces lloro pero casi siempre río 

Caminar en libertad (valiente)
Ir por las calles así normal (valiente)
Así nomás, valiente 
Caminar en libertad (por la vida que me queda)
Ir por las calles así normal 
Venezuela no se olvida 
Todo lo que nos ha dado 

A los que estamos aquí 
Y a los que están del otro lado 
Que puede ser tu hermano 
Que puede ser tu amigo 
Que puede ser todo lo que yo he querido 

Tengo que ser valiente, valiente 
Salir a caminar contigo 
Y rescatar nuevamente 
La sonrisa de mi gente 

Víctor Muñoz
Gente que desde temprano labra con sus manos (la Voz)
El despertar de un futuro que pronto verá (Los Fantásticos)
Vamos a sembrar semillas de amor y de cambio

Tengo que ser valiente, valiente 
La fe nunca la debo perder 
Tengo que ser más fuerte, más fuerte 
Subir mi voluntad a otro nivel

Me di cuenta que al final 
No era más que falsedad

Slowly rises and kisses you awake

As you let it play upon your face

I might be like the morning sun to you

Like a lover, the river wind
Sighs and ripples its fingers through your hair
Upon your cheek it lingers
Never having known a sweeter place

I might be like the river wind to you

How I envy a cup that knows your lips
Let it be me, my love
And a table that feels your fingertips
Let it be me, let me be your love
Bring an end to the endless days and nights
Without you

Like a lover, the velvet moon
Shares your pillow and watches while you sleep
Its light arrives on tiptoe
Gently taking you in its embrace

That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love

This isn't maybe, this is always.
This is love,
The real beginning of forever,
This isn't just mid summer madness,
A passing glow, a moment's gladness,
Yes it's love.
I knew it on the night we met,
You tied a string around my heart,
So how can I forget you.
With every kiss I know that
This is always.",This Is Always

Space...Mon amour est space....Mais si tu peux...
Entrer dans ma dimension see'est ok pour un vol à deux

Parce que comme une tigresse elle aime laisser ses marques

J'veux partir avec toi le temps d'un trip céleste
T'es parée pour le test, bébé tombe la veste
Abandonne-toi au best, et je m'occupe do reste, ho!

Sinon pour sa conquête bye bye!

Guidée par mon étoile quand je laisse m'emporter le hasard
Si avide de contrées que bien d'autres ne peuvent s'apercevoir
Je veux briser la glace, juste le temps de tester
Partir pour l'hyperespace et me perdre au fin fond de la voix lactée

J'suis le mec qu'il faut, accroche ta ceinture lady
Hey, macho, prouve-moi que t'assure baby
Laisse-moi fare, ""yo!"", j'ai la manière
Et tu vas très bientôt quitter la terre
Trop de gars au départ font le fiers
Mais au final fais-tu l'affaire?

Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Nahko and Medicine for the People,"I'm cutting the bad fruit off of my tree to
Lighten my load and grow me tall
Just like my dogma, this fire pit mantra
Covered in ashes, now take me home
Shedding my antlers and making up answers
To the mystery of nature, so reach for the sun
Spruce tips and cedars now free up them rivers
The salmon will run, no dam can hold
Uniting the nations, it's gonna take some patience
So unzip your sheepskin, the wolves have returned
(Ah-ooooo)
The wolves have returned
(Ah-ooooo)

I call to the spirit, brother I hear it
Union of all things, like words on the sky
I read the totems, my ancestors wrote 'em
Now I sit patient, as I wait on the tribe
This runs through all things, like thunder and lightning
Song everlasting, well always I learn
Pull off the old skin, now we are kindred
Open and listen, the wolves have returned
(Ah-ooooo)
The wolves have returned
(Ah-ooooo)

So channel the old ones, with each waking new sun
Walk with your totem, conditions unsaid
Walk from the mystery, a love where you feeling
Myrrh for protection, a spear in your hand
In light of our dreaming, never meant to be easy
Sometimes there'll be water, sometimes you'll be dry
Footprints in tandem, in this ancient sandstone
Grandmothers reside, and I'll be by your side
Oh, I will be by your side
Grandmother, I will be your side, oh

Part of creation is making a statement
You can't escape it, she's coming for you
If it was up to me, I'd teach that the lonely
This is just part of the courage it takes
Maybe it's the music, it's moving right through us
All of the songs that will outlive me
I'm running the song lines, I'm wrapping my prayer ties Preserving the old way, my wolf has returned
(Ah-ooooo)
My wolf has returned, oh
(Ah-ooooo)

We're swept apart too soon.

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain

Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double

You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell

Najee,"Music is a world within itself 
With a language we all understand 
With an equal opportunity 
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands 
But just because a record has a groove 
Don't make it in the groove

When the people start to move 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people 
They can feel it all over

Music knows it is and always will 
Be one of the things that life just won't quit 
But here are some of music's pioneers 
That time will not allow us to forget 
For there's Basie, Miller, Sachmo 
And the king of all Sir Duke 
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out 
There's no way the band can lose

And why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely

My constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow

Najiyah,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
Like home",Home
Najma,"Faithless love like a river flows
Raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
And the night blows in like the cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows

Faithless love where did I go wrong
Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong
Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you
Faithless love where did I go wrong

Well I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feeling comes and goes

Faithless love like a river flows
Like raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
Faithless love has found me
Thrown its chilly arms around me

Naked Eyes,"So this is where he came to hide
When he ran from you
In a private detective overcoat
And dirty dead man's shoes

The pretty things of Knightsbridge
Lying for a minister of state
Heard a far cry from the nod and wink
Here at Traitor's Gate

Oh, the high heel he used to be
Has been ground down
And he listens for the footsteps
As they follow him around

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time?

There's a tuppeny hapenny millionaire
Looking for a fourpenny one
With a tight grip on the short hairs
Of the public imagination

For his private wife and his kids somewhere
Real life becomes a rumor
Say his up Dutch courage, just three French letters
And a German sense of humor

He's got a mind like a sewer
And a heart like a fridge
He stands to be insulted
And he pays for the privilege

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time?
A man out of time

The biggest wheels of industry
Retire short and sharp
And the after dinner overtures
Are nothing but an after thought

Somebody's creeping in the kitchen
There's a reputation to be made
Whose nerves are always on a knife's edge
Who's up late polishing the blade

Love is always scarpering
Or cowering or fawning
You drink yourself insensitive
And hate yourself in the morning

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time?

Katzen stürzen nicht, sie landen immer auf den Pfoten

Denn sie isst die Reste nur in allerbesten Restaurants
Grüßt jeden Hund und jede Maus
Du wirst lachen, doch ihr kann man nichts vormachen, sie kennt sich eben aus

Weil sie das schon ganze neun Leben lang macht
Sie hat alles gesehen
Und vielleicht ist sie deshalb 'n kleines bisschen schizophren

Sie kann sogar tauchen, sie geht den Dingen auf den Grund

Sie hält die Welt doch eh nur für 'n riesen Katzenklo

Mein offenes Ohr versteht jedes Wort
Auch wenn ich hier nicht geboren bin
Denn die Wurzeln meines Stammbaums liegen tief hinter dieser Erde verborgen

Auf der Suche nach mir selbst
In den Straßen von Nador, Nador
Fühl mich wie zu Hause, fühle mich verloren, verloren

Laternen gehen an, spaziere am Strand, sehe mein' Schatten im Sand
Barfuß im Wasser, ein seidiger Wind begleitet die Wellen an Land
Schau in die Ferne, flatternde Flaggen, beleuchtete Berge
Vulkane die schlafen, am Dach der Welt hängen goldene Sterne
Ein älterer Mann befestigt sein Boot, das Seil in den faltigen Händen
Ich grüß mit Salam, er lächelt mich an, sein müdes Gesicht spricht Bände
In solchen Momenten frag ich mich, wie's wohl wär, hier geboren zu sein
Andere Freunde, andere Werte aber das Herz schlägt gleich

Auf der Suche nach mir selbst
In den Straßen von Nador, Nador
Fühl mich wie zu Hause, fühle mich verloren, verloren

Zwischen meinen Welten liegen zweitausend Meilen
Fühl mich oft zerrissen, würd' Sie gerne vereinen
Ich würd' so gerne wissen wo ich hin gehör'
In meinen Träumen fließt der Main in das Mittelmeer

Auf der Suche nach mir selbst
In den Straßen von Nador, Nador
Fühl mich wie zu Hause, fühle mich verloren, verloren

verloren, 'loren",Nador

Er springt von 'nem Viehwagon
Unsichtbar für die, die entgegen kommen
Ein Griff in den Mandarinenkarton und schnell weg von hier
Den Touri am Eck fixiert
Ungefragt den Dreck von seinen Schuhen poliert
Nur für vier Dirham
In der Urlaubssaison boomen die Geschäfte hier
Hat die glänzende Rolex fest im Visier
Wenn er 'nen Blick durch das offene Fenster wirft
Sich geschickt an das offene Fenster pirscht
Noch bevor irgendwer irgendetwas hört

Kurz atmet er durch, über den Dächern der Stadt
In diesem Moment kann er Kind sein

Kommen, kommen, kommen, kommen, kommen, kommen

Und sie jagen ihm hinterher, flink wie er ist
Zwingt er sich durch einen Schlitz und tritt in Scherben
Unterdrückt den Schmerz, um nicht zu schreien
Er hinkt weiter, um nicht gekriegt zu werden, und er duckt sich
Die Polizei kommt, er nimmt ältere Leute als Schutzschild
Bis er umkippt: Schlag eins, Schlag zwei
Die Touristen geschockt, aber tun nix
Denn er schadet dem Stadtbild
Er ist nur ein Straßenkind, das zu jung für den Knast ist
Erst stellt er sich tot
Und wenn der eine Moment kommt, reißt er sich los

Kurz atmet er durch, versteckt im Schatten der Nacht

Rennt in den Laden für Markenuhren
Die Schafe im schwarzen Gurt
Die harte Tour, sie zahlen für Ware nur den Straßenkurs
Traurige Szenen im staubigen Licht
An die jüngeren Touris verkaufen sie Haze
Die Älteren sieht er in Audi TT's
Oder sitzen im Ritz für die Straußen-Filets
Und es wird ihm bewusst
Sein Traum war verweht in der flirrenden Luft
Die Eltern sind krank, keine helfende Hand
Er wurd' selber zum Mann hier, denn irgendwer muss

The answers to this story
I feel left behind
No power and no glory

The sadness within 
Has got to have a reason

I feel the understanding
For what I go through
The wish to be demanding

You don't need to speak
Just try to be forgiving
If I turn away and leave

You feel that I know you
(I wish that you would be mine)
The feelings you go through
(Why would you leave me behind)
I'll always believe you
(There is so much you should know)
I'll always believe you
(But there is no time to show)

Tell me why 
Why I have to be here
Can you show 
Or tell me where I went wrong
Show me where I belong

The comfort you give 
Is far beyond explaining
As long as I live
I hope you'll be remaining

The look in your eyes
Is more than I can ask for 
As if you were send by god

Whenever I'm lost

The truth that I seek
I didn't hope to find it

I am fading
I am ending

Why can this never end

I always wanted to see
I always wanted to see
That you were looking my way
When you were looking my way

But why would you find
Just why would you find

What happened to the future that we planned and would adore
Though deep inside I knew that you would not have stayed

I still remember all the words that you once said to me
Which I was far to shy to tell and let you know 

I realize that certain things just are not meant to be
That feelings are the only thing that are worth to show

Is it because he treats you badly that you love him
Or just because you have no form of self respect 

Do you expect that I'd be standing here and watch him
Your eyes are telling stories that I can't neglect

He might be telling every time how much he loves you
And you are blind enough to trust in what he says 

When is the latest time that he has asked how you do
Although you know exactly that your life's a mess

He doesn't love you
He doesn't understand
How much he hurts you
You live at his command
And he will never be able to give you the love that you need

I am trying to see why you would be a friend 

That all things that you touch would break apart and shatter
That's the reason why our friendship had to end

I was giving all the things I had to offer
In return you took whatever you could get 

I still hope that one day in your live you will discover
There is more to live than things you could regret

Why would you be acting so bizarre and selfish
Why are you so scared to show me what you feel 

Why you measure all things by what you could accomplish
Where you could be holding on to something real

I had covered you for all your missbehaviour
Looking back you never cared for what I feel 

Through the years I had never asked you for a favour
Now the only thing I ask is you to leave 

This must end
All of the lies you're telling me
All the deceptions you're giving me
All of the times you made me wait

And even now as I am talking
I wished that you would soon arrive

But how long must I keep on hoping
That you'd be coming down to me

The time I spent just waiting

I knew that you where lonely

I'm gonna take you home

I feel the desperation's burning

The war has lasted for so long
We've all forgotten how it started
I don't remember right or wrong
I only know that we were parted

All the time we spent together

I'll avenge for what I've missed

And if there's no one to assist
I'll still fight for memories of thee

I don't believe that god can feel our mere existence
Technology is who we serve as we kill by remote control
We can not see and do not feel disaster is coming

It is time to know that it's now or never
There will never be another chance
What is wrong in doing things together?
If you try to take another glance

Now that you've been trying so hard to get there
It would be a shame to just let go
Nothing's gonna happen if you just stare
Wouldn't it be hard to never know?

Is there no way to intervene; to change belief of those who rule?
Or do we really have to face our self-extinction?
If He has ever been above, then he must truly be asleep
Or we must pray for our souls that he is forgiving",Now or Never [Distant Remix]

Before we descend

We hunger for some loving 
We do all that we can
We give all our belonging
Before we understand

We celebrate the present
Afraid of our past
We are completely absent
Not sure if we will last

The speed in which we're growing
Can never be sustained
The sum of all we're knowing
Can never be contained

We fight for our living
But there's no one to fight
We drain all that are giving
The goal is out of sight

Like dogs are running circles
We're chasing our own tail
We're actors in a circus
And we are bound to fail

We want to give it reason
But we all do the same",Pause

But still had no one to assure
That things were better than before

Believed this was true

I am home
From my past
Leave my throne
How would I go on

I have found
My own way
To survive
This devastating game

Time will guide
Days will come
How could I
Be doing nothing wrong
 
And I'll be trying every day
Be looking for the words to say
I only want to know for sure
If I am able to adore
The reason going through all this
That there'd be still a world to miss
And I the final moment
To see this is true

Time to leave
Memories pass
I won't need
No one to say goodbye

I used to care for things that didn't matter
And I wouldn't mind what I do
I would still believe that things got better 

But there came a day when all this changed
Where all of my life was rearranged
Without a warning or a sign
Taken away what once was mine 

I don't really know why I'm here
Maybe there is someone who can tell me
There are days when I see so clear
When I know what people think around me 

Even if I do not know their names
I can sense all their pains
All of the dreams they have inside
All of the fears they try to hide 

Don't try, don't waste your time
Long before you feel it

You try to bring out what is trapped inside
The things you desire
Are fading away like a dream that died

What you believe in
Is your little world of right and wrong
It's all so deceiving
To be withstanding you must be strong

You know you can get there
As long as you play by the rules they make
It's not that you don't care
There'll always be someone who's there to take

Who cares if you're cheating
As long as there's no one there to see

There's no time to look behind
It could be so easy


Take a step aside to see the difference
If you really dare to
The problem that you have's a different kind


Knowing where to go is not so easy
But you have to focus


Taking time to look is sometimes hard
You just have to want to


Looking for the reason why you stay here
It's a change of perspective
Seems like playing with a deck of cards


Misunderstanding - starts shouting
Love and devotion - for sad things
Fear and confusion - is religion

In my dreams I am down on my knees
In my dreams I am begging you please
Let my soul rest in peace

Dreams sometimes I ask the Lord why
Mama back again in my dreams you are alive
I don't know reality or fiction
I guess you and the Lord guiding on my mission
Who am I an actor or musician
Dreaming all these years
Finally the right decision
I can't breathe my mind is wide open
Nightmares in the night bedsheet like an ocean
Sleeping deep I can hear god speak
Your life in my hands
Check the Bible read and preach
My eyes open begin to realize
I am still in my dreams
Who's the man in disguise
I start trippin' think a sec about the kitchen
Have to face the fact
About my future reputation
In addition minimize my ambition
Lord wake me up change my situation

Life is too short to live in anger
Can't stand these negative vibes
Life is too short too short to live with danger
Please help me God to survive

Dreams I can't just explain
They bug me out make me trip in so many ways
I want the truth nothing but the truth
Entire 411 I am going back to my roots
Woop woop that's the sound of the police
Young gifted black I am down on my knees
Irritated lost nowhere to go
Help me please rescue me I am losing control
The show must go on
I wanna have my piece of cake
Seperate good from the bad and fake
Snakes always wanna ride your jock and place
Their behinds in your face dispossess your space
In my dreams I see a picture of your face
Life is too short take a break
I wish good luck for you and yours
Dreams see me walking through that door

In my dreams God is talking to me
In my dreams I am down on my knees
In my dreams I am begging you please
Let my soul rest in peace

Could you ease my pain
And show me good things in my life
Could it be that I am just too blind

Please help me God to survive",Dream

The snow is softly fallin'
The air is still within the silence of my room
I hear your voice softly callin'

If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead
My glass is almost empty
I read again between the lines upon the page
The words of love you sent me

If I could know within my heart
That you were lonely too
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim
The shades of night are liftin'
The mornin' light steals across my windowpane
Where whims of snow are driftin'

If I could only have you near to breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
And to be once again with, with you
To be once again with, with you

Nana Mouskouri,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when he flies
Turning on the world the way he smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of his eyes

Waking in the morning to the feeling of his fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
Loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Coming close together with a feeling that I've never know before in my time
He ain't ashamed to be a man or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way he opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
And loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again

I'm dropping pebbles in my tracks
I will not get lost when I come back

On my way to town
Got my lunch tucked in another pocket
On my way to town
And I will only stop to wash it down
Cool water is good enough
Can't waste my gold on finer stuff

Got to keep your mind on the maps
Feet on the ground and eyes on the traps
Jewels that shine and the pleasures that blind
And ties that bind and you're left behind
I know this road
I was on it a long time ago
I know this road
And I know every mind that could explode
You got to keep walking on through the rain
Trees that shelter fall and bring you pain

And when I get to town
I will go straight to the market
When I get to town
I will do my best until the sun goes down

Among dying birds trembling with death

Some went to war, some never came home

By and by we'll all learn the taste of tears.

There is hard work to be done
Follow your father to his toil
His bend your back and break the soil
Who can say what you sow beneath the sand

Take your leave and take your gun
Follow your father through the hills to the hills
Heaven gives and heaven kills
Go with God and the youg men in their prime
Here I'll wait where I waited all through time

When the sun stands yet at noon ?

Come and see the flowers have begun to grow

All her lovely companions are faded and gone. 
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh 
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh. 
I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! to pine on the stem 
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them 
'Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed 
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead. 
So soon may I follow, when friendships decay 
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away 
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown 
Oh! who would inhabit this bleak world alone!",The Last Rose of Summer

That goes on and on inside my ear

It's a melody just for you and me
And it's got the sweetest harmony
And as long as you want me to, I'm singing with you

La la la la la la
I'm singing my loving song
La la la la la la
I'm singing it all day long

Not a song that's going strong
On any music chart
Just a la la la la la la
Playing in my heart

It goes round and round with a special sound
That you hear wherever love is found
And loving you like I do, I'm singing with you

Nothing can go wrong when you've got a song
And there's someone else to sing along
And I hope I will live life through, singing with you

I wish that boats were little glasses filled with wine
So I could drink to love with all your friends and mine
Some day we'll pull your boat ashore
The day you sail away no more

My friend the sea says you'll be mine
The day I fill your boat with wine
And so I dream of what w'll be
And I believe my friend the sea

I wish the mountain was smaller than a star
So I could see your boat and know just where you are
I wish my arms were nuts of gold
For you are all I want to hold

My friend the sea says you'll be mine
The day I fill your boat with wine
And so I dream of what w'll be
And I believe my friend the sea
Some day I'll fill your boat with wine
My friend the sea will know you're mine

I never tought I'd know heaven so soon
I couldn't hope to say how I feel
The joy in my heart no words can reveal

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again
I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Now just a memory the tears that I cried
Now just a memory the sighs that I sighed
Dreams that I cherished all have come true
All my tomorrows I give to you

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again
I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Life's summer leaves may turn into gold
The love that we share will never grow old
Here in your arms no words far away
Her in your arms forever I'll stay

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again
I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again

M'en allant promener
J'ai trouvÃ© l'eau si belle
Que je m'why suis baignÃ©

Il why a longtemps que je t'aime
Jamais je ne t'oublierai


Sous les feuilles de chÃªne
Je me suis fait sÃ©cher
Sur la plus haute branche
Le rossignol chantait

Il why a longtemps que je t'aime
Jamais je ne t'oublierai


Chante, rossignol, chante
Toi qui as le coeur gai
Tu as le coeur Ã  rire
Moi je l'ai Ã  pleurer

Il why a longtemps que je t'aime
Jamais je ne t'oublierai


See'est pour mon ami Pierre
Qui ne veut plus m'aimer
Pour un bouton de rose
Que je lui refusai

Il why a longtemps que je t'aime
Jamais je ne t'oublierai

J'ai perdu mon ami
Sans l'avoir mÃ©ritÃ©
Pour un bouquet de roses
Que je lui refusai

We forget the caring

When will I see you again

Nana Mouskouri,"I used to stand on the corner when I was a child

And singing for nickels and dimes

I knew that some day, in my own special way
I'd repay all their nickels and dimes

As I play my guitar and sing for the people who pay

Nana Mouskouri,"There's a time, there's a time
Time for summer and for snow
Time for love to grow
And to end in lonely tears
There's a place I adore
That I fear I'll see no more
I will see no more
Though I live for a hundred years

There's a time for losing all you want
And a time for travelling on
But the hurt in my heart
It goes on from day to day
Will not go away
Keeps on longing for what's gone

There's a time, there's a time
When a love is young and new
Heaven's painted blue
When we lay in the summer grass
For a time, for a time
You were so in love with me
So how was I to see
That the summer would pass

Now you ride the ocean, change the star
Underneath some far away sky
And the hurt in my heart
Knows you're never coming home
Never coming home
Till the day the sea runs dry

In my dreams, in my dreams
You have left yourself behind
You caress my mind
When the nights grow dark and chill
Vagabond, vagabond
Always travelling beyong
Where's the magic wand
That will bring you nearer still

And a time for starting a new

If tonight was not a crooked tale
If tomorrow was not such a long time

Can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my foot-steps
Can't remember the sound of my own name

Yes and only if my true love was waiting
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding
Only if he was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed...once again

There's beauty in the summer singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the skies
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

And by himself, it's easy to pretend

While life goes on around him everywhere

Nana Mouskouri,"Hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your mama was born to die
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

Too late, my brothers
Too late, but never mind
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

If religion were a thing that money could buy
The rich would live and the poor would die
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

I've got a little book that was given to me
And every page spells liberty
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

There is a tree in Paradise
And the pilgrims call it the Tree of Life
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

Nana Mouskouri,"Alone between the sky and sea
An island
Reaching out to me
Neglected
A world apart rejected
It's wild shore
Deserted and unsought for
An island
An island
A vision calling me

An island in the setting sun
Alone
At peace when the day is done
Protected
It's secrets undetected
Illusion
Untouched and in seclusion
An island
An island
At peace when day is done

I must go there
Without the crowds around me
There with silence to astound me
Alone to face my destiny
To understand what life might be

I must go there
To take my future chances
To turn away the backward glances
Then in that moment I will know
Why we are apart
When still I love you so

Alone between the sky and sea
An island
Reaching out to me
Neglected
A world apart rejected
It's wild shore
Deserted and unsought for
An island
This island
My island is you

I will be there
Without the past to hound me
There without the tears that bound me
Alone without my memories
As empty as the endless seas

I will be there
Without the pride that taunts me
Without the love and hate that haunts me
And in that moment I will know
The way to show
That still I love you so

Alone between the sky and sea
An island
Reaching out to me
Neglected
A world apart rejected
It's wild shore
Deserted and unsought for
An island

One ocean lapping all our shores
One earth so green and brown

I'll give it one more try
To show my rainbow race
It's too soon
Too soon to die
It's too soon to die

Some want to be like an ostrich
And bury their heads in the sand
Some hope for plastic dreams
To un-clutch those greedy hands

Some want to take the easy way
Poisons,bombs they think we need them
Don't they know
You can kill all the unbelievers
There's no short cut to freedom

I'll give it one more try

Of long ago
The colours fade
The wrinkles show
I loved you then
I love you still
I guess I always will

Aging hearts
And shaking knees
Aching parts
Still bend with ease
I loved you young
And age improves
The love I feel for you

You grow more beautiful
Each passing day
The lines that time withstood
You grow more beautiful
I hate to say
Well I told you so
But I knew you would

Still the flames

Nana Mouskouri,"I got your letter yesterday
From some small town I never knew
It told me you were on your way
But not where you were going to

You said you're following the sun
But do you really know for sure
For after all is said and done
Just what it is you' re looking for

There's a place in my heart
I wish that your eyes could see
And there' s no one on earth
Who loves you as much as me

If you just travel on and on
Till I don't know where
There's a place in my heart
You may never find again

And so you travel with the wind
You'll find some road to fly along
And though your letter says the word
Your heart may soon forget the song

Then you may someday write the poem
That tells your life in words of fire
But you will never have a home
Or find the love that you desire

There's a place in my heart
I wish that your eyes could see
And there' s no one on earth
Who loves you as much as me

If you just travel on and on
Till I don't know where
There's a place in my heart
You may never find again

And so heading for the sea
Now that the flowers are in bloom
Just when the wild mimosa tree
Is like the color of our room

If you just travel on and on
Till I don't know where
There's a place in my heart
You may never find again",A Place in My Heart
Nana Mouskouri,"To the Queen of hearts
Is the Ace of sorrow
He's here today

Young men are plenty
But sweethearts few
If my love leaves me
What shall I do

And I have a story
In yonder mountain
Where gold and silver
Is there for the counting

I could not count
For thought of thee
My eyes so full
I could not see

I love my father
I love my mother
I love my sister
I love my brother

I love my friends
And relatives too
I'll forsake them all

Nana Mouskouri,"Yesterday started
No different than
A hundred days before
He reached out and touched me
Before my feet could touch
The cold wood floor

As I lay beside him
And the thoughts of the moment
Filled my mind
Little did I know
That I was loving him
For my last time

But seeing is believing
And believing is the feeling
That you feel
When the loving feeling's gone
Everything we've ever been
Or anything will be again
Packed up his bags
And moved along

[Chorus:]
He had everything I need
He knew exactly how to feed
The hunger that lives inside of me
He controlled the way I feel
Each day he touched me where I live
It's hard to believe his memory

[Chorus x3]",Seeing Is Believing
Nana Mouskouri,"In the time of my confession
In the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet
Flood every newborn seed
There's a dyin' voice within me
Reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger
And in the morals of despair

Don't have the inclination
To look back on any mistake
Like Cain, I now behold this chain
Of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment
I see the Master's hand
In every leaf that trembles
In every grain of sand

Oh, the flowers of indulgence
And the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath
Of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps
Of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness
And the memory of decay

I gaze into the doorway
Of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way
I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey
I come to understand
That every hair is numbered
Like every grain of sand

I have gone from rags to riches
In the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream
In the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness
Fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence
On each forgotten face

I hear the ancient footsteps
Like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn there's someone there
Other times it's only me
I am hanging in the balance
Of a perfect finished plan
Like every sparrow falling
Like every grain of sand",Every Grain of Sand

Another lies beside you

That you did not exist
But I know you really left me
I and how you are missed
You're missing
The lover who was once around you
Has no news
You're missing
And even if by change I found you
I'd still lose
For I know you're loosing interest
Instead of your heart

When love was all, 
All you were living for, 
And how you gave that love to me. 
 
Only then I felt my heart was free, 
I was part of you and you were all of me. 
Warm were the days and the nights of those years, 
Painted in colors to outshine the sun.

Nana Mouskouri,"Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
Its the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose",The Rose

Dans un village, on vit naître un jour
Un enfant à la peau de cuivre
Une gazelle le même jour,
Près de là commençait de vivre
D'un même lait et d'un même miel
On nourrit leurs amours naissantes
Les mêmes sourc's et le même ciel
Leur ouvrirent des fleurs géantes

Elle courait plus rapide que tous les vent
Que l'oiseau dans le ciel
Et s'arrêtait pour pouvoir entraîner
L'enfant dans sa course au soleil
Parce qu'un jour, il n'obéit pas
On garda le gamin loin d'elle
Des hommes blancs qui ne savaient pas
Ce jour-là ont tiré sur elle
Il a cherché tout un jour et toute une nuit
Son chemin dans le ciel
Il l'a trouvé toute froide et le dos rougi
Au deuxième soleil

On dit qu'il part au matin levant
Et ne rentre qu'à la nuit pleine
On dit aussi qu'il pleure en dormant

Nana Mouskouri,"Depuis quelques jours je vis dans le silence 
Des quatre murs de mon amour 
Depuis ton départ l'ombre de ton absence 
Me poursuit chaque nuit et me fuit chaque jour 
Je ne vois plus personne j'ai fait le vide autour de moi 
Je ne comprends plus rien parce que je ne suis rien sans toi 
J'ai renoncé à tout parce que je n'ai plus d'illusions 
De notre amour écoute la chanson 

Non, je ne pourrai jamais vivre sans toi 
Je ne pourrai pas ne pars pas j'en mourrai 
Un instant sans toi et je n'existe pas 
Oh! mon amour ne me quitte pas 

Mon amour, je t'attendrai toute ma vie 
Reste près de moi reviens je t'en supplie 
J'ai besoin de toi je veux vivre pour toi 
Oh! mon amour ne me quitte pas

Ils se sont éloignés dans un dernier regard 
Oh! je t'aime ne me quitte pas",Les Parapluies de Cherbourg
Nana Mouskouri,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found.
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to feel
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Though many dangers toils and snares
We have already come
'Twas grace that brought us save that far
And grace will lead us home

That saved a wretch like me.

Nana Mouskouri,"And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I live till now
I tell them I don't know

I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand

And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do

The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but love is dead
That is my belief

And yes I know how lovely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening bring me down
Now that you're around me",And I Love You So

When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all.

And friends just can't be found.

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water

When you're down and out, when you're on the street
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you.
I'll take your part, when darkness comes
And pain is all around

Remember first time we met day one
Kids in the garden' playin' games heaven' fun
Excitin' and amazin' havin' a real friend of mine
Feel my heartbeat and for real friend of mine

Face to face and eye to eye
Usin' our hands to buy and supply
Chillin' is cool from January to June
And we still sticked together like the glue

And know the rules
Forever you and I and believe it was clear
If I ever should fall
I could count on you with no fear

Alone without protection from all them snakes
All for one one for all i was told
Black white yellow no matter

If your young or old
Nana's in the house to let you know
What I see is how I fell and damn
I'm alone

I am lonely lonely in my life
I am lonely lonely lonely

Everybody's tripppin' on me
Oh Lord, come help me please
I did some bad things in my life
Why can't you rescue me

'Cause you've got all I need
I know I got to pay the price
Cheppin' through the streets at night
After a fuss and fight

Tears in my eyes I'm a man lookin' for the light
Dark is the path I know he will rescue me
The Lord is my Shepard I'm cool despite emergency
Whom shall I fear except the God

Thank you for the blessin' and the skills on the mic
Five years we know there's no diggity
Free at last see the light in me
What goes up must come down

I'll be around while you heading towards death town
Always look forward hardly never look back
So many tears and the snakes on my jock
Now I'm riding in my big fat ride

Your ass is late so look for the line

What I see is how
I feel so leave me alone

I am lonely lonely lonely
I am lonely lonely in my life
I am lonely lonely lonely
God help me, help me to survive

Knock on my door whom you lookin' for
A dream or reality enemies at my door
Eyes, I realize it's fantasize I must be high
So let me live before I die

Once again grab the bottle twist the cap
To survive your life is yours my life is mine
No emotions in this world full of lies
Step by step and be versatile

Love peace and cash that's what it's all about
Alone by yourself than you lack there's no doubt about
I'm always into something making moves to improve
What would you do if you were in my shoes

so mellow.

When no-one wept except the willow.

A llamar a tu puerta no la despidas

Y dejaré una pena, oculta entre las rocas
Para seguir tu rumbo, al nacer el dia

And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old time singing gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere
As I travel on life's pathway
Knowing not what the years may hold
As I ponder hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold",Precious Memories
Nana Mouskouri,"It's a slow train
But it's moving on
I've got my ticket 
Don't don't pass me by
If I don't get on ooh
I'll break right down and cry
Only got a one a life
To live on this earth
Oh get me there
Won't you please
Conductor sir
It's a slow train
But it's moving on
Now everybody got a ticket
You you and me
It's up to you to catch the ride
That's how its got to be
Everyone oh yeah
Has to prove he's a man
Oh make it easy
On yourself
'Cause there's no helping hand
It's a slow train
But it's moving on",Slow Train

Trad. - Arrgt T. Brito


De colores,
De colores se visten los campos
En la primavera,

De colores,
De colores son los pajaritos
Que vienen de afuera,

De colores,
De colores es el arcoiris
Que vemos lucir,

why por eso los grandes amores
De muchos colores me gustan a mi,

why por eso los grandes amores
De muchos colores me gustan a mi,

why por eso los grandes amores
De muchos colores me gustan a mi.

Canta el gallo,
Canta el gallo con el
Quiri, quiri, quiri, quiri, qui

La gallina,
La gallina con el
Cara, cara, cara, cara cara

Los polluelos,
Los polluelos con el
Pio, pio, pio, pio, pi

why por eso los grandes amores
De muchos colores me gustan a mi,

why por eso los grandes amores
De muchos colores me gustan a mi,

why por eso los grandes amores
De muchos colores me gustan a mi.
