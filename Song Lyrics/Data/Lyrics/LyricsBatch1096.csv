Porno for Pyros,"Here I lay waiting
for the bubbles to settle
I'm going down low
where your sleep meets your mental
Two tries at killing me
they couldn't do it
I ran down the road
with no shoes and no jacket
Here I go dive away
Watch me dive away
Hey porpoise head
oh porpoise head
I know young boys
they all want to be bad
Don't think it's madder
to be a genius
Give me a lover
who won't give me troubles
Some sexy dreams
to chew on these bubbles
Here I go dive away
Watch me dive away
Hey porpoise head
oh porpoise head
I set sail with a tickle in my tail
I smell the bleach on the thin white sheets...
Here I lay waiting
for the bubbles to settle
I'm going down low where
your sleep meets your mental
two bags in Lilly's hands
just for the morning
into the bathroom
with cottons for swabbing
Here I go dive away
Watch me dive away
Hey porpoise head
oh porpoise head
Hey porpoise head
oh porpoise head

Porno for Pyros,"my boat's capsyzed it's gonna sink to the bottom
i can see the lights on the shore getting farther away
i dont if ill make home tonight
but i know i can swim under the tahitian moon

i came out here tonight to look for my friend
i dont know if ill ever get to see him again
i dont know if ill make home tonight
but i know i can swim under the tahitian moon
one last time under the tahitian moon

the sea is a very easy place to disappear
to drift away, to fall in love or make your peace

i came out here tonight to look for my friend
i dont know if ill ever get to see him again
i dont know if ill make home tonight
but i know i can swim under the tahitian moon

Porno for Pyros,"How you figure in the scheme of things to be?
You thought you were Jesus,  
but you find out 
you're the anti-christ
You were born so you get another chance
A chance to die and to get off this planet

You're in the thick of it all
You're in the thick of it all

You struggle- Hope you laugh!
You thought you'd never know
You feel and that's the only thing
you can depend on
I'll try praying If it'll move my friends
The dead are living in your blood with a little poison

You're in the thick of it all
You're in the thick of it all
You're in the thick of it all
You're in the thick of it all

I fell again, still I'm so excited
Anyway, don't you love surprises?
You get to keep your heart and i know
I give mine time and it comes back to me
We're in the thick of it all
We're in the thick of it all
We're in the thick of it all
We're in the thick of it all",Thick of It All
Porno for Pyros,"I can tell when I'm dead inside
I stop thinking of God
I'm living in hell
I stop wishing
Wishing
I stop wishing
Wishing you well

I had a friend
I knew him well
His voice was so blue
His eyes were so calm
He stopped wishing
Wishing
Now I'm wishing
He stopped wishing
I'm wishing him well

I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!

I had a dream last night
I can't heal people
I heal myself
Just by wishing
Wishing
Just by wishing

I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!
I'm wishing you well!

It take sirens sometimes
To make me glad
Hear sirens sometimes
I'm just glad
I'm not inside

Porretas,"No se porque hay gente que siempre nos seÃ±ala

why que yo sepa no se murio ninguno

no la fuman los celtas tampoco los romanos
por eso estan todo el dia liaos dandose palos

Porta,"Yeah 
Perdonen, Kamehameha 
Después del tema del Tetris viene el Dragon Ball Rap 
Quien no haya seguido esta serie es porque no tiene infancia 
Big Bang Attack ataca desde el Planeta Namek 
Vegeta, Son Goku, rivalidades Saiyan 
Allargat bastó (y es que en castellano raya)

Mola más en catalán, prefiero Nubol Kinton 
El canvi de lloc instantani, al verlo me flipó 
Son Goku, Goten, Krillin, Pan, Trunks, Yamcha, Chaos y Tenshinhan 
Son Gohan de niño me flipaba en segundo nivel 
Satán no venció a Célula, tampoco Videl 

Nadie podía con Broly el Super Saiyan legendario 
Pedir la energía a todo el planeta fue necesario pa' vencer 
La bola Genki carbonizó a Majin Boo 
Y Freezer remodelado se vió frente la espada de Trunks 
Los Ozaru perdían el juicio
Se destrozaban ciudades, atraviesan edificios 

Uno, dos, tres, fusión
La ocarina contenía a Hildegan dentro de Tapion 
Las bolas de Dragón esparcidas por el mundo 
Teniendo radar y cápsulas habrá que poner rumbo 
Raditz murió junto a Gokú, Vegeta se cargó a Nappa 
Gohan lo tuvo crudo con los guerreros de Plata 

La fuerza aumentaba a no sé cuántos Kilis 
Vegeta dejó controlarse por Bavidi 
Cor Petit y Krillin se convirtieron en piedra 
Por Dabra y el gran Saiyan-Man se rebela 
Pelea contra los terroristas que hay en la ciudad 
Dragon Ball Rap, Boojack, Per mi Bola de Drac 

Bienvenidos sean siempre a la sala del tiempo 
Donde un día real allí es una año de entrenamiento 
Los Androides surgieron del Dr. Gero 
En los torneos casi siempre Goku puedaba primero 
En los cielos se apalanca siempre Yajirobai 
Me hacía gracia ver llegar sobre un tronco a Tao Pai Pai 

Turles y la fruta del poder 
Garlic, Junior, se hizo grande en un momento, joder 
¿Alubias mágicas? Nah, monjetas mágicas
Kaio Shin, Vegetto, el resultado de Pothara 
Con la ayuda de Paikun fusión de Goku y Vegeta 
Janemba no pudo compararse al poder de Gojeta 

Gotrunks en Tercera, era un vacilón 
Cuando alguien perdía la vida lo resucitaba Shenron
Oolong, Bulma, Pooar, Dende, todo en un papel 
El máximo poder se quedó en el cuarto nivel 

¿Fuerzas especiales? Ginyu cambia de cuerpo 
Dodoria, Zarbon, Recoom, todos acabaron muertos 
Cooler, Baby, Dragones de cada estrella 
Bardok hizo lo posible por defender su planeta

Porta,"Estoy en boca de tantos tontos y de muchos otros 
sudo por los poros, me la suda lo que hablen los foros. 
Estoy a años luz de tu crew de idiotas que me envidian, 
que me tienen rabia porque sus pibas me follarían. 

Sé que es duro, acepta el futuro y ya está, 
nadie me conoce pero tú hablas mucho y gastas saliva. 
Aquí no hay quien escriba, tranquilos, 
vivo entre palabras de verdad, 
el que se cree todo es más tonto que el que habla. 

Comentan mientras fuman petas-zetas, 
me quieren pegar porque no pueden con mis letras... pringaos. 
Soy mi fan, y hago rap porque lo siento, es cierto, 
es que soy experto en sacar fuera lo que llevo dentro. 

Y me divierte ver cómo está el panorama, 
los que acaban de empezar van de saber todo 
cuando no saben nada. 

Yo tengo algo que pocos tienen (¿eh?) 
fardar es hacer alarde únicamente de lo que se puede. 
Y cómo no, me envidia todo dios, 
intentan imitar mi voz, mi flow y copiar mi respiración. 

A ver, que no se me ha subido, repito 
tengo muchos clones pero todos salieron fallidos. 
Yo digo lo que pienso y por eso soy especial. 
No tengo ningún miedo aunque algunos me quieran apalizar, 
mis letras hablan de una realidad, 
vergüenza tiene que dar, amenazarme 
por no poder con mi rap. 

Asumo mi gran responsabilidad, 
influyo en tu mentalidad, 
haciendo rap 
tú no igualas mi handycap, 

Y es normal que rimar sea mi máxima pasión, 
porque vuestra envidia es la mayor manifestación de 
admiración. 

En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
cualquier mentira afronto. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
te crees todo lo que cuentan. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
no hay comentarios tontos. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
solo tontos que comentan. 

Y es que no puedes entender cómo es que aún sigo, 
si tantísimos me adoran y otros tantos se meten conmigo. 
Porta no se corta un pelo (¡qué va!) 
no saben por qué, pero yo sé que 
unos me tienen rabia y otros celos. 

Soy un producto de internet, 
es rap que va de boca en boca, 
mi nombre es Christian, 
pero tú mejor sólo llámame Porta. 

No juzgues si no quieres ser juzgado, 
¿decís que no soy MC por no llevar el pelo rapado? 
Pero llevo más de 6 años rapeando por lo menos, 
he aprendido a acelerar, pero jamás a echar el freno. 

Empecé grabando con un micro de mierda como todos, 
sólo que con 12 años no quise sacar mi promo. 
¿Crees que salí de la nada? (nah) 
yo escribía rap en el patio, mientras los demás niños jugaban. 

No me conoces, te equivocas del todo conmigo, 
yo no paso de los fans, más bien los considero amigos. 
La ignorancia es el mayor de tus defectos, (creo) 
si esto para ti no es rap, no sé cuál será tu concepto. 

Yo no elijo quién me escucha, así que 
que me escuche quien quiera. 
Que tú seas un raper cerrado de mente me la pela. 

Chapo bocas por norma y tengo el cromosoma rap, 
me graba Soma, pero eso sólo influye en la calidad. 

La fama no es como os pensáis, si os fijáis aquí hay 2 
extremos: 
uno es el de los que te aman y otro el de los memos. 

En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
cualquier mentira afronto. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
te crees todo lo que cuentan. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
no hay comentarios tontos. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
solo tontos que comentan. 

He aprendido mucho en estos años, más de lo que crees 
el respeto ya no existe en la cultura, así que olvídate, 
suicídate, ¿por qué? tú no vas a poder conmigo. 
Intentar ser el mejor no significa ir de subido. 

Ni me hacen las letras ni hago rap para ligar, 
pues tengo novia, la fama me agobia, y no es por fardar. 
Contradicciones no, ironías. 
Me gusta el sarcasmo, ingeniar, como muchos se rabiarían. 

Sé que tú la chuparías por contratos que he rechazado, 
hablaste de papá, y ahora tu pico está chapado. 
Dicen que en esto soy un monstruo y 
que por eso asusto. 
Mientras me guste mi rap 
seguiré haciéndolo con gusto. 

Hago rap porque lo siento, no para gustar, 
escuchen, no me culpen, escribo por mí y punto. 
Van de saber lo que no saben. 
Me escuchan niñas, pijos, emos, bakalas, heavys, metaleros 
y rapers. 
Góticos, skaters, y gente no identificada. 
Estoy aquí porque mi maqueta fue la más destacada. 

Seré sincero, odio la máquina y el reggaetón, 
esto es rap pasión, o hobbie, jodí a MCs con mi maquetón. 

¿Estás elevado al cuadrado? 
y yo estoy elevado al cubo. 
Tú llévame a tu ciudad, 
verás como el nivel lo subo. 

Perdónenme por hablar tanto de mí, 
pero es que me molo. 
Se me hace raro estar siempre 
en boca de todos. 

Mcs necesitan nombrarme pa' crear polémica 
y buscar la fama que no pueden ganarse con su maqueta. 
Aunque yo ya paso de tus gilipolleces payaso, 
lo mío es éxito, y a lo tuyo lo llamo fracaso. 

Gracias a los que me apoyáis y a los que no, 
pues hoy sé que sin vosotros no estaría donde estoy. 
La excusa que usáis contra mí es etiquetarme de lo que no soy.
Un consejo: infórmate mejor, B-boy. 

En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
cualquier mentira afronto. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
te crees todo lo que cuentan. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!) 
no hay comentarios tontos. 
En boca de tantos (¡de tantos!)

Porta,"Es sólo una historia más
La bella y la bestia

Ella era bella
Frágil como una rosa
Él era una bestia
Esclavo de sus impulsos

Único día que les ataron esposas
Ya no eran niños
Crecieron,se hicieron adultos juntos

Todo marchaba bien
Eso parecía en su primera luna de miel
Juró serle de por vida fiel
Y ella a él
Una historia como otra cualquiera(sí)
Quién les ve y quién les viera

Pero el tiempo pasa
Y las relaciones se agotan
Se cansan
Ella ni lo nota
Porque esta ciega
Ciega de amor

Pero no aguanta la monotonía
Ya no quería ser dueño de una sola tía
O eso le decía a sus colegas de copas

Yo salgo con otras,pero ella ni lo nota

Bella estaba ciega
Pero no era tonta
Ya dudaba

Tantas noches sola
Cuantas horas de la madrugada

La primera vez fue la mas dolorosa
Te regaló una infidelidad por cada rosa
Y es que el perdón será tu debilidad
Pero lo que pasa una vez
Siempre sufre de una vez más

Este cuento no es eterno
Debo salir ponerle un fin
Ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Debo salir
Quiero vivir
Quiero vivir

Tantas cicatrices ya no puedo más
Me duelen las entrañas
De tanto sangrar

No existe un maquillaje que pueda tapar
Este moretón que es mi corazón
Ya no se cuánto más tiempo podré aguantar
Ya no me quedan lágrimas para llorar
El peso de estos años me doblan la edad
En cada rincón tengo un moretón

Dime que esto no ha pasado
Tu dime que el barrio ha olvidado
Mañana todo habrá cambiado
Y esto será sólo un horrible recuerdo

Sé que me quieres mi vida
Yo sé que no habrá más heridas
Mañana sera un nuevo día
Y otra vez seremos felices de nuevo

Empiezan las discusiones
Parece que a él no le gustan
Se vuelve insensible y agresivo
Y a bella le asusta

Lágrimas caían,tras un empujón
Y el primer puñetazo,
Te conformas con un perdón
Y un simple abrazo

No quieres darle importancia
Porque no quieres perderlo
Pero sientes impotencia
Y a la vez pánico y miedo

No puedes creerlo todavía
Después de tantos años
Te preguntas por qué te has caído en el puente

El silencio no te ayuda
Sé que no sabes que hacer
Sabes que fue la primera
Y no será la última vez

Créeme sé que no quieres más problemas
Pero no te quedes en silencio
Si tu marido te pega

Porque no le perteneces
Te mereces mucho más
Ese cretino tienen autoridad
Se la das y él se crece

No puedes detenerle
No puedes defenderte
No puedes hacer más que rezar por tener suerte

Cada día más normal
Pasar del amor al odio,
Se convirtió en algo habitual
Otro mal episodio

Bestia no te quiere
Pero quiere que seas suya
Para siempre

¡Si no eres mía,no serás de nadie entiendes!

Bella no podía más
El cada día era más bestia

Cuando ella quiso hablar
Ya era demasiado tarde
Se dio cuenta que vivía junto al mal
'La bella y la bestia'
Prefiero no contaros el final

Este cuento no es eterno
Debo salir ponerle un fin
Ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Debo salir
Quiero vivir
Quiero vivir

Tu final atravesó mi alma en sólo un compás
Callaste mis lamentos con brutalidad
Me has convertido en un triste numero más
Tu triste corazón fue tu perdición

Es demasiado tarde para ir hacia atrás
No volveré a tener otra oportunidad
Seré sólo un mal día en la prensa local
Pero mi dolor será tu prisión

Y si yo ahora puediera cambiar en algo tus miserias
Daría todo porque entendieras
Sólo un segundo de mi sufrimiento

Espero que al menos mi historia
No quede sólo en la memoria
Y traiciona nuestra trayectoria
Que no se repita jamás este cuento

Este cuento no es eterno
Debo ponerle un fin
Ser más fuerte que esa bestia
Quiero salir
Quiero vivir (trastorno bipolar)

Sé más fuerte que esa bestia
Debes salir
Vuelve a vivir

(la bella y la bestia)

Sé más fuerte
Camina hacia adelante
No te rindas
No te quedes en silencio",La  Bella Y la Bestia (Con Norykko)
Porta,"Joder estoy super gorda 
Tia pero que te ha dao' con tu físico si tu nunca te habías rallao por eso 
Coño mirame, bueno mira da igual tu no lo entiendes. 
¿Pero que estas haciendo? 

Mírate al espejo y dime si el ojo te engaña 
Es un espejismo tan solo el que te hara daño 
Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas 
Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año. 
Mírate al espejo y dime si el ojo te engaña 
Es un espejismo tan solo el que te hara daño 
Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas 
Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año. 

Gorda, se que te hace daño 
Pero es que la solución no es encerrarse en el baño 
Yo se lo que piensas cuando observas tu reflejo 
Pero tu enemigo son las personas no el espejo 
Ese complejo es el objeto de burla 
Meterse los dedos en la garganta no sirve de ayuda 
Si te hacen daño los demás porque tu también te lo haces 
Es darle la razón a los mas tontos de la clase 
Son espejismos fuera del realismo, 
Lucha por quererte a ti mismo o caerás en el abismo 
Eres el hazme-reír cuando sales de fiesta 
La gente te observa por la calle y eso te molesta 
Sientes vergüenza y al probarte vestidos te rallas, 
¡Harta! de tener que pedir otra talla 
En la playa no expones tu cuerpo por que te deprimes 
Tiras la toalla al ver esos cuerpos de cine 
Quieres perder peso a cualquier precio 
Se oyen las arcadas por el hueco de la puerta si están en silencio 
Tu madre se preocupa y a ti te da igual 
Sientes que va en decadencia tu paciencia para adelgazar 
No puedes parar de vomitar te sientes guapa 
Ves en la revistas los cuerpos que quieres y te atrapan 
Pero no eres tu, es solo lo que quieres ser 
Para que los demás muestren un poco mas de interés 
En ti, 
Pero es que la sociedad es así es triste 
No confíes en tu reflejo ni en lo que viste 
Acomplejada, lo veo en tu mirada 
Quererlo todo, todo sin tener que hacer nada 
Buscas una forma fácil 
Dentro de ese cuerpo se esconde un corazon frágil 
Se que es fácil de decir para el que no lo sufre y el que no lo siente 
Pero el ojo crea un espejismo que te miente. 

Mírate al espejo y dime si el ojo te engaña 
Es un espejismo tan solo el que te hará daño 
Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas 
Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año. 
Mírate al espejo y dime si el ojo te engaña

Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año. 

No se, pienso que no deberías, hay otras maneras 
Cállate de una puta vez vale tu no estas en mi piel) 
Rozarte la campanilla es mas atractivo para ti 
Mucho mas sencillo y rápido que decidir 
Si hacer régimen o hacer deporte porque eso es duro 
Y ademas no te atreves a apostar si no es sobre seguro 
Solo quieres un cuerpo bonito 
Que te vean con otros ojos y reconozcan tu tipo 
Pero la belleza esta en el interior 

Aunque no te satisface que te digan que como persona eres mejor 
Te valoras poco y tu autoestima roza el suelo 
La moda es el señuelo y yo el pez que muerdo el anzuelo 
La imagen no lo es todo para todos 
Existen otros métodos pa' adelgazar existen otros modos 
Tienes un apodo que no nombran cuando estas presente 
Haces como que no te importa lo que comenten 
Pero quieres demostrar algo que no deberías 
Pero entiendo tu impotencia al ser solo una cría
 
Los chicos te rechazan por que no eres guapa 
Los días de llanto tu diario lo relatan 
Una forma mas cercana de la que pueda entender 
Cualquiera de nosotros al ver lagrimas caer 
Quieres saciarte y comer y devolver las calorías 
Te obsesionas con tu físico y te pesas cada día 
Cada hora notas sientes poca evolución 
Tu amiga llora por que no se puede creer tu situación 
No piensas detenerte hasta estar por fin contenta 
Y eso que tu peso debe rondar los cincuenta 
Autoestima baja y la confianza no la sientes 
Cero de personalidad y eso es deprimente 
No es necesario destacar estéticamente 
Siempre has sido totalmente dependiente 
Del pensamiento que tienen los demás hacia ella 
Su mente es débil tan solo quiere ser bella

Mírate al espejo y dime si el ojo te engaña 
Es un espejismo tan solo el que te hará daño 
Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas 
Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año. 
Mírate al espejo y dime si el ojo te engaña 
Es un espejismo tan solo el que te hará daño 
Mira tu reflejo en el agua cuando te bañas 
Mira tu peso en la bascula al cabo de un año. 

Cada de día que pasa se te ve mas delgada 
Sigues viéndote igual aunque estas mas desmejorada 
Tu amiga te aconsejaba y no la quisiste escuchar 
Pides poca comida y dejas mas de la mitad(ahora) 
Pesas cuarenta kilos y te sigues viendo gorda 
Pero no es el espejo es tu mente que deforma 
La que le da forma a esa falsa imagen que ves 
Espejismos es lo que tu mente se quiere creer. 
Quien decide y quien le da significado a lo perfecto 
Si ser superficial para mi es solo otro defecto 
El imperfecto ser humano 
La maquina que destruirá este mundo con sus propias manos.",Espejismos
Porta,"Despierto sin ganas de otro día, y será el último 
Pocos me creen, hoy llega mi edén 
Lo asumo y ni dudo, lo juro 
De corazón, advierte mi alma muerta 
No es una amenaza, es una mentira 
Que acabo siendo cierta 
Dejé la puerta abierta y una nota 
A medio escrita, se leía con dificultad 
Adiós mamá y papá, decía en ella 
Salí descalzo, sin fuerzas, sin ganas 
Me imaginé en el suelo, muerto, y nadie lloraba 
Paseo por una calle solitaria 
Todo está oscuro y llueve 
Las farolas me observan 
Y el paso en el tiempo me duele 
El filo de mi cuchilla me apreta, es ella 
Llegaré al final de la forma más fácil 
La vida no es bella 
Tan sólo busco estar solo ahora 
En un laberinto sin salida 
Dejé de pedirla ayuda a Dios 
Hablo con mi conciencia, a solas 
Ella me pide que apriete el gatillo 
Y tengo miedo de decir adiós 
Lo siento si he fallado una vez más 
He notado la vergüenza al mirarme en el espejo mamá 
Perdóname, te lo suplico! 
No se si me explico 
Estoy sentado en la varandilla de un séptimo piso 
Pero, ya estoy muerto, por dentro y estoy cansado 
Estoy harto de vivir huyendo siempre del pasado 
Fui cobarde, me rendí más de una vez estuve a punto 
Punto en mi libreta esta historia incompleta, ya ni lucho 
Páginas en blanco, tintadas del rojo de mi sangre 
No merezco ni una lágrima 
Mi nota de suicidio llegó tarde 
Firmé un documento con Satanás 
Para liberarme sólo tengo que saltar sin más

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para 
Para no verme mas la cara, dispárame bah! 
Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para 
Para no verme mas la cara, dispárame bah! 
Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Y siento como si ya estuviera muerto 
En un mundo de ciegos, rey tuerto 
Me paso por el forro el LP a puerto 
Es cierto, no tengo nada que dar ni recibir 
Sorrazos alerto, vivo boquiabierto 
Y apenas escribo, algo está jodido mi mente 
Me siento hijo adoptivo 
Demasiado impulsivo, me dicen 
Cautivo de lo negativo si volar es el fin 
Que alas se deslicen 
Calo mejor las mentiras, tras este intervalo 
Regalo rimas, con mi boca de escualo 
En forma de íntimas palabras sin pantomima 
Si no tienes el disco del Z, róbalo 
Pero yo ya no quiero vivir más 
Es demasiad duro 
Cuando muera, escupid en mi tumba 
Si apuro, he hecho el conjuro 
De la eterna estupidez 
Siento la rigidez en mis músculos 
Es liberador vivir sin futuro 
Sentir la traición hace que muera prematuro 
Es puro veneno lo que siento lo juro 
Con rabia la sangre sólo supe pedir perdón 
Cuando fui inmaduro 
Dile a mi madre que siempre la quise y que lo siento 
A mi bro que busque mis palabras en el viento, cuando sople 
A los que desearon mi mal, yo les deseo el doble 
Por haber hecho pedazos un corazón noble 

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para 
Para no verme mas la cara, dispárame bah! 
Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para 
Para no verme mas la cara, dispárame bah! 
Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Estoy solo en un silencio que molesta y grito 
Escucha mi última palabra, léete mi último escrito 
Préstame atención, sólo pido eso, lo necesito 
Caen gotas de sudor y de mis ojos en mi nota de suicidio 
Siento no poder no decir mas, 
Pocos llorarán, pero cuantos se alegrarán 
Vi mi nombre en una lápida y ni se me hizo extraño 
Cuántas cargas he llevado para tan pocos años 
No hay nada que me frene 
Llevo tanto tiempo muerto dentro de mi ya no hay nada 
Tan sólo soy otro cuerpo, arrastrado por el viento 
Tan violento que sopla el destino 
No hay testigo, no hay amigos, no queda ningún motivo 
Solo recorro el camino, se que en las puertas del cielo 
No hay sitio para este peregrino 
Dios? parece ser mentira, hoy sabré si es cierto 
Lo de que tras la muerte, existe otra vida

Hoy es lunes, martes, miércoles quizás puede que jueves 
No se el por qué pero en mis ojos ya no llueve 
Puede que tu recuerdo me mantenga vivo 
Si el exilio no quiere mandarme directo al olvido

Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para

Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya",Nota de Suicidio (Con Soma)
Porta,"Vale

Son almas gemelas, separadas sin duda
Están pidiendo a gritos unirse y volver a ser una
Sienten algo y no saben porque, aunque las dos saben
Que es mucho mas fuerte que una amistad lo que les une
Y se puede ver a quilometros si te fijas
La vida nos lleva por el sendero que ella elija
Y yo llegue asta a ti sin ni siquiera buscarte
Solo con conocerme a mi podía retratarte
A ti, como un dulce sabor salado
Soy un amargado exacto cuando estoy a tu lado
Miraba tu melena dorada con cara de idiota
Te di mi corazon y sus instrucciones en una nota
De papel, quiero ser aquel que te tuviera
Si supieras algún día lo que siento
Si pudieras verte con los ojos que te veo
En vez de en el espejo no conocerías jamas el complejo

El calor de tus abrazos hace que cierre los ojos lentamente
Esto es para ti, escucha atentamente
Se cuando estas triste, y se cuando me mientes
Se que lo haces para que no me preocupe como siempre
Son imanes con igual polaridad por eso chocan al juntarse
Debe ser necesidad la debilidad del uno por el otro
El amor y el odio de los dos pudo arreglar sus corazones rotos
Una piel tan blanca no se olvida
Cruzaré los dedos de los pues po si se oxidan
Son almas más que cercanas, tu llámalo como quieras
Creo que algunos los conocen como almas gemelas

Querida alma gemela espero que me leas
Allí donde quieras que estés lucharé contra el viento y la marea
Yo se que es así, no espero que me creas
Busco mi otra mitad y no hay duda de que tu lo seas

Soy feliz así, con estas pequeñas cosas que me unen a ti
Como cada pétalo a su rosa
Tu perfume me despierta, pone alerta a mis sentidos
Conocerte fue casualidad? O causa del destino? 
Gracias cada detalle, por pequeño que parezca
Las almas separadas por el cuerpo necesitan estar cerca
Tu aura me da vida, te agarraré la mano si duermes y la dejas caída
Mi mirada sigue la perfecta forma de tus labios
No imaginas que sentí el primer momento tras rozarlos
El orgullo puede a la razón de ambos
Mataría por ti, moriría por ti, puedo demostrarlo

Se que no todo sera siempre bonito
Pero siendo solo tu, tu conseguiste ser mi tipo
No eres otra, lo repito, sabes que eres la única
Te necesito mas que al rap, para decir verdad, mas que a la música
Juré nunca decirte para siempre
La confianza que me haces sentir es suficiente
Yo un dia te soñé y hace tiempo
Sin buscarte te encontré porque siempre te llevé dentro
Eres de aspecto fuerte, aunque te dejas derrumbar
Te protegeré, no dejaré que la vida te vuelva a golpear
Ven conmigo, lo nuestro es correspondido
Si te vas ya no podré conformarme con ser tu amigo
Digo lo que tu pensabas, son dos almas conectadas
Tenemos lo que al otro le falta o necesitaba
Creo que eres la única persona capaz de entenderme 
Tu si puedes conocerme, la única persona que si puede tenerme

Querida alma gemela espero que me leas
Allí donde quieras que estés lucharé contra el viento y la marea

Lagrimas caen de tu rostro sobre nuestras fotos 
Seré tu relato corto, el retrato que cubre tu corazón

That you and I might have always known one another
And that we could not only evoke, but conjure a place of our own

It will all die out
And now, I cry for all that is beautiful

John Henry was a little bitty boy sittin' on his mommy's knee
When he picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel
This hammer'd be a death of me Lord Lord this hammer'd be a death of me
John Henry was a little bitty boy no bigger than a palm of your hand
When his mommy looked at him proudly and said
My Johnny'll be a steal drivin' man Lord lord hey Johnny'll be a steal drivin' man
John Henry was a steel drivin' man drove steel all through the land
Before he would let that steam drill beat him down
He'd die with the hammer in his hand Lord lord he'd die with the hammer in his hand
John Henry went to the tunnel drive steam drill was by his side
Before he would let that steam drill beat him down
He laid down his hammer and he cried Lord Lord he laid down his hammer and he cried
John Henry went up on the mountain and he looked down on the other side
And the last words I heard poor old John Henry said
A cool drink of water before I die Lord Lord cool drink of water before I die
John Henry had a little woman and her name was Polly Ann
And the last words I heard poor old John Henry said
Polly drive that steel like a man Lord Lord Polly drive that steel like a man

Right from the lips of someone that saw
Well I was there on that cold and fateful morning
Watched General Custer and the bloody masacre
There were muskets arrows cannonballs a flyin'
Yellin' screamin' a lot of men were dyin' there at the Little Big Horn

There were one thousand Indians standing on the river bank
Two hundred calvary waited there with pride
And I saw chief Crazy Horse leader of the Indians
Old Gneral Custer with his musket by his side
Then Crazy Horse started things with a yell
That shattered the quiet of the early morn
General Custer gave out a mighty mighty roar and they met at the Little Big Horn
There were muskets arrows

Of the one thousand Indians there on the river bank

I found an old fashioned log cabin so beautiful there to behold
A stranger was standing in silence his eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him for these were the words that it bore
And the sign read An Old Log Cabin For Sale an oaken bucket and well
Easy terms just keep a log on the fire and a light burning bright in the dell
Many years an old couple so patiently looked for their boy who's last promise did fail
Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more there's an old log cabin for sale

A welcome I read on the floormat an old braided rug by the door
The hands of an angel had made it with many a prayer prayed before
In an old rocking chair on she waited for one glimpse of him how she yearned
But now he was standing in silence too late yes too late he'd returned

If you want to see somebody cry their heart out
For a love they lost and must live without
If you're not afraid my misery might revolve on you
Just hang around my tears are overdue
If you want to hear confessions of a broken man
Who once held a world of love right in his hands
If you wanna see a heartbreak right into the front of you
Just hang around my tears are overdue
Now there's not a way that I can say how much it really hurts
When a broken heart and guilty conscience starts to worse
I hope you won't forget the sight you've seen today
Just remember love I had then threw away
If you're not afraid my misery might revolve on you
Just hang around my tears are overdue
If you're not afraid my misery...

Not a penny in my pocket all alone without a friend
Met a lad while on my travel tryin' hard to play the game
Though his legs were very very crippled and he couldn't even speak his name
But he smiled in understanding though life to him had been so unkind
As I watched I bowed in sorrow oh Lord Thy burdens are greater than mine
I can speak my name aloud make my way among the crowd
Yes Thy burdens are greater than mine

In a little country village I met a lad and he was blind
As I helped him across the highway
I cried oh Lord Thy burdens are much greater than mine
I can see the light of day and I need not feel my way
Yes Thy burdens are greater than mine
Just by chance I passed a graveyard saw a young man kneeling there
In his hands he held some roses on his lips I saw a prayer
On the thomb these words were written' her soul is God's her mem'ry mine

Someone to tell your troubles to be glad that you ain't me
Be glad your heart has never known the pain that I've been through
The pain of loving someone who never will love you
If the devil never haunts your sleep till you beg to be set free
Just put yourself in my place friend be glad that you ain't me
If you think that you've got troubles and you're wantin' sympathy
Just listen my story friend and be glad that you ain't me
If you've never laid awake at night and prayed to be set free
From the chains that bind a broken heart be glad that you ain't me
If you never saw a love go wrong because of jealousy
Just put yourself in my place friend be glad that you ain't me
Be glad your eyes have never cried until they couldn't see
Be glad that your heart has never wanted a love that couldn't be
If you never saw a love go wrong because of jealousy
Just put yourself in my place friend be glad that you ain't me

And there to meet me is my mama and papa

And down the road I look
And there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they've all come to meet me, arms a-reached smiling sweetly

And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

And down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary

At these four gray walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming

Porter Wagoner,"Long ago when just a boy at old camp meetin' time
How my heart would beat with joy to hear the old bells chime
Calling all the saints of God onto the house of prayer
Oh, such prayin', singin', shoutin' for the Lord was there

How I like the old time preachin' prayin', shoutin', singin'
How I like the old time reading of God's words
How I like to hear those glory hallelujahs ringin'
How I like the old time worship of the Lord

Preaching in the good ole days were filled with holy fame
Preaching for the souls of men and not for world acclaim
Under such old fashion preaching sinners knelt to pray
And the Lord would save them in that good ole fashion way

How I like the old time

Skid Row Joe last night that's who I found in the dirty part of town
Lost forgotten with no place to go
Tormented with a bitter taste outcast by the human race
A mask of torture was the face of Skid Row Joe
He walked up to where I stood on the street
Said pardon me Mister now don't get me wrong I don't want your money
Though heaven knows I could use it
But you see this is my home and you see the other bar down the street
Well that's my home too
I noticed you starin' at me a while ago you recognized me didn't you
I said yeah Joe I know who you are
You was one time a real famous singing star one of my favorites
He said well I guess you heard they took my babies away from me
I said yeah Joe I read about it in the papers
Then he turned his head away and I saw the tears fall in the place
And he turned to me and he said you know Mister
This is the only place in the world that I'm not ashamed to show my face
But I'm gonna quit yes sir I'm gonna quit
And I'm gonna cut my hair and shave and get me a clean white shirt
Then I'm gonna walk up to her door
When she answers I'm gonna stand up real proud and tall
Then I'm gonna get on my knees
Then I'll say sweetheart if you'll take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life makin' up to you for what I've done
I'm so ashamed of myself and this I want you to know
Then I'm gonna take my two little babies and I'm gonna hold 'em so close to me
I ain't gonna never let 'em go
I guess I should've told him then that she'd already remarried again
But after hearin' what he'd said to me
Why there wasn't no way I could add to his misery
So I said good luck my best to you Skid Row Joe

Porter Wagoner,"So here's to you my ramblin' boy may all your ramblin' bring you joy
He was a man and a friend always he stuck by me in the hard old days
He never cared if I had no dough we rambled round in the rain and snow
So here's to you my ramblin' boy may all your ramblin' bring you joy
And here's to you my ramblin' boy may all your ramblin' bring you joy

In Tulsa town we chanced to straight we thought we'd try to work one day
The boss said he had a room for one said my old pal we'd rather bum
So here's to you my ramblin' boy...

Then late one night in a jungle camp the weather it was cold and damp
And he got the chills and he got 'em bad I lost the only pal I had

Porter Wagoner,"In the world's mighty gallery of pictures hang scenes that're painted from life
There's pictures of love and of passion and there's pictures of piece and of strife
There hung pictures of youth and of beauty and of old age and a blushing young bride
But the saddest of all they don't hung on the wall
The first scene is that of a gambler who had lost all his money at play
And he draws his dead mother's ring from his finger
That she wore long ago on her wedding day
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then he bows his head that in shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead
That's just a picture from life's other side
Now the last scene is that by the river of a heartbroken mother and babe
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver on an outcast whom no one will save
Now yet she was once a true woman she was somebody's darling and pride
But God help her she leaps and there's no one to weep
That's a picture from life's other side
Just a picture from life's other side someone has fell by the way
A life has gone out with the tide that might have been happy some day
There's a poor old mother at home watching and waiting alone
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear just a picture from life's other side",Picture from Life's Other Side
Porter Wagoner,"I was barely past the stage of baby bottles
At an age when little legs first start to toddle
When my pa saw I could stand, he thought I would be a man
Once I got the feel of blisters on my hands
Shuckin' corn, shuckin' corn, shuckin' corn, shuckin' corn

From early morning until dusk we stripped away the blades of husk
Shuckin' corn shuckin' corn
I stood right along beside my two big brothers
And it got so we depended on each other

There was little time for fun underneath the summer sun
And it seemed to me like work was never done shuckin' corn, shuckin' corn

Porter Wagoner,"I've crossed many valleys that I'd always find another mountain much higher to climb
I've wasted so much time where the sun never shines
On my way through this world of mine
I've oded a lot of hinges on a lot of swingin' gates

And I've cored many seeds from some mighty juicy grapes
But I've turned a lot of corners just a little bit too late
On my way through this world of mine
On my way through this world I had to pass your house

So part of my life was wasted there
And I've lived a lot of times on the thin side of a dime
On my way through this world of mine
But if I can crawl back in my cradle and walk this rocky world again

I'd smile at every detour that's waitin' round the bend

It takes combination to make life complete

And I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest

Let my guitar playing friend do my request
Let him sing me back home with the song I used to hear

Make my old memories come alive
Then take me away and turn back the years sing me back home before I die
I recall last Sunday morning when a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs

I guess you thought I'd never find somebody new
I lived on dreams and promises as long as I could
I couldn't wait forever the way you thought I would

The lonely nights grew longer as I prayed for time to fly
I lived on hopes that you'd return that's how I got by
The agony of loneliness just got too much for me
I couldn't wait forever needing love so desperately

So I found new lips to kiss me new arms to hold me tight
I found new love and happiness to fill my empty nights

Porter Wagoner,"You'll meet many just like me upon life's busy streets
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed down and eyes that stare in defeat
Or souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts
Where a living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts

Now you have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for the grace of God it'd be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passin' by

For it's written that the greatest men they never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts

Now you've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Some were propers and some were kings and some were masters of the arts
But in their shame they're all the same these men with broken hearts
You know life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death

God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
So help your neighbor along the road no matter where you start

Porter Wagoner,"There's a legend about a church in our town the steeple so high seen for miles around
Look on the hill and you'll realize the steeple's too big for the churches size
It seems it was a long time ago when this church had no steeple
Just four walls and the roof overhead sheltered the humble people
But the money was short cause the times were bad
They had to get along on what they had
Just good simple people praying for a steeple
About this time when spring was near a man of weath and his sweetheart dear
Made their plans for the bells to ring they would wed on the first of spring
So this man of wealth and his true love dear named the wedding hours
They would wed in the little church the one that had no towers
But he was the kind and generous man he told his true love of his plan
How to build a steeple for these good people
Yes they'll have their steeple the bells there will ring
They'll ring for our wedding on the first day of spring
But they say death comes like a thief and soon his heart was filled with grief
One week before the wedding day he learned his love has passed away
in spite of his grief and broken heart he kept the promise given
I'll build the steeple so my love can hear the bells in heaven
And then he built the steeple there the tallest one in all the land
That's how the people got their steeple
Well that is the reason the steeple lives so high
And how the bells ring louder when springtime is nigh",Legend of the Big Steeple
Porter Wagoner,"I'm living in the past a life I once knew you left me behind what else can I do
I'm crying in my sleep my dreams won't come true

You tell me to forget you that's something I can't do
I'm living in the past I guess I can't learn
I'm hoping that someday my love you'll return

I smiled and said, I'll sure surprise my wife
I don't think I'll phone, I'll just head on home
For I didn't know the cold hard facts of life

I passed a little wine store on the corner
I pictured big champagne by candle light
I stopped the car right then got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life

A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said, ""I'll take two bottles of your best""
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winkled as if to say you know the rest

I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't till he turned into my drive that I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life

I drove around the block till I was dizzy
Each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in

Lord, you should've seen their frantic faces
They screamed and cried, please put away that knife

For at times the path is so dim I can hardly find my way

Porter Wagoner,"It was a stylish congregation you could see they'd been around
And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
But over in the Amen Corner of that church sat Brother Ira
And he insisted every Sunday on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he'd get behind and miss the words
Well at last the storm cloud burst and the church was told in vine
That Brother Ira must stop his singing or the choir was gonna resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
And they got their big fine car and drove up to Ira's door
They found the choir's great trouble sittin' in an old arm chair
And the summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his snow white hair
Said York we're here dear Brother with the best res approbation
To discuss a little matter that affects the congregation
Now it was our understanding when we bargained for the chair
That they were to relieve us that is they'd do the singin' for us
Now we don't want no singin' except what we've bought
The newest tunes are all the rage the old ones stand for nought
And so we have decided are you listenin' Brother Ira
You'll have to stop your singin' it's messin' up our choir
The old man raised his head a sign that he did hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
I've sung the songs of David nearly eighty years said he
They've been my staff and comfort all along life's dreary way
I'm sorry if I disturbed the choir I guess I'm doin' wrong
But when my heart is filled with praise I can't hold back a song
I wonder if beyond the tide that's breaking at my feet
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master I shall meet
Yes I wonder if when I try to sing the songs of God up higher
I wonder if they'll kick me out up there for singin' in Heaven's choir
A silence filled the little room the old man bowed his head
The committee went on back to town but Brother Ira was dead
Oh the choir missed him for a while but he was soon forgot
And a few church goers watched the door but the old man entered not
Far away his voice is sweet and he sings his heart's desire

Stuck by me through thick and thin
Till it just got too thin I guess

She walked in one day and said she had believed me
I could've sworn I saw big tear in her eye
I heard the other day that she got married again
I hope he treats her better than I

Well if you get me idea that I'm some kind of a bum
You're catchin' on pretty fast
And if you wonder if I've turned into a wino
For these are all my fingerprints on this glass

I've been sittin' here in this bar since they opened up this mornin'
And it's almost time to close tonight
I guess it's about time to go find me a gutter
Tuck myself in tonight

Where does a man go when he's already on the bottom
It's really not much choice he's got
He either picks himself up and tries again
Or just lays back down to rot

No life starts out to be like mine
Pain is never planned
And yet here I sit with nothing in the world
But these confessions of a broken man

I'm just askin' you to listen not to understand
These confessions of a broken man",Confessions of a Broken Man
Porter Wagoner,"Her real first name was Betty but I'd rather just forget it
So I'll call her the First Mrs Jones
We were married in September and it lasted till November
Then one day she just took out on her own
I followed her to Savannah New Orleans and then Atlanta
Every day I begged her to come home
Pretty soon I started drinking tryin' hard to keep from thinking
Just how much I loved the First Mrs Jones
It was cold and dark one morning just before the day was dawning
When I staggered from a tavern to a phone
When she picked up her receiver I said you're gonna come back or either
They're gonna be calling you the Late Mrs Jones
I put a pistol in my jacket stumbled out and hailed a taxi
I told taxi driver to take me to her home
I remember walkin' proudly everybody said I yelled out loudly
Come on out or I'm gonna come in Mrs Jones
Then next thing I recall was walking to the forest
Lookin' for a place to hide her bones
I dug and dug for hours and then I planted flowers
Right on the top of the First Mrs Jones
Did my little story scare you oh I can see cause I'm so near you
Little beads of perspiration dot your clothes
Aren't you sorry now that you left me
Really now doesn't you want to come go with me
After all you are the Second Mrs Jones",The First Mrs. Jones
Porter Wagoner,"(What would you do what would you do if Jesus came to spend some time with you)
If Jesus came to your house to spend a day or two
If he came unexpectedly I wonder what you'd do
When you saw him comin' would you meet him at the door
With arms outstretched and welcome to your heavenly visitor

Or would you need to change some things before you let him in
Like burn some magazines and put the Bible where they'd been
Oh I know that you'd give your nicest room to such an honored guest
And all the food you would serve to him would be the very best
And you'd keep assuring him that you were glad to have him there
That serving him in your home was a joy beyond compare

But what about your family conversation would it keep up its normal pace
And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on
Or would you sigh of great relief when finally he had gone

You know it might be interesting to know the things you'd do
If Jesus came in person to spend some time with you
(What would you do what would you do if Jesus came to spend some time with you)",What Would You Do
Porter Wagoner,"Traditional
Life is like a mountain railroad with an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful from the cradle to the grave
Watch the curves that fills the tunnels never falter never quail
Keep your hand upon the throttle and your eye upon the rail
Blessed Savior Thou wilt guide us till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us in God's praise forevermore
As you roll across the trestle spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You behold the Union Depot into which your train will glide
There'll you meet the superintendent God the father God the son
With the hearty joyous plaudit weary pilgrim welcome home
Blessed Savior Thou wilt guide us...",Life's Railway to Heaven
Porter Wagoner,"I said goodbye to you this morning with only these words to explain
I said I've found someone I love better but I still hear your voice call my name
I thought I heard you calling my name funny I still feel this way
Your voice seemed so close but I knew that by now you were many miles away

I walk through the streets of the city people passing by think it's so strange
I'm talking but there's no one beside me I thought I heard you calling my name

Porter Wagoner,"How many times have you heard someone say
""If I had his money, I could do things my way?""
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was wading in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

When life has ended, my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones, I'll leave, there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind",A Satisfied Mind [DVD]
Porter Wagoner,"Don't let me cross over love's cheating line

I'm tempted, my darling, to steal you away
Don't let me cross over, stay out of my way
You know that I love you but I'm not the stealing kind
And I'm faced with heartaches that love's cheating line

Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
You belong to another and could never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line

I've tried to forget you but what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying that you love me too?
I know if I lose you, not a dream would I have left
I don't want to cheat, dear, but I can't help myself

Don't let me cross over

For they're only fleeting things My elusive dreams I had your child in Memphis 
You heard of work in Nashville We didn't find it there, so we moved on 
To a small farm in Nebraska To a gold mine in Alaska 
We didn't find it there, so we moved on And now we've left Alaska

WITH PAMELA ROSE GADD
Writer Shel Silvertstein
Copyright 1972

She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters, they flock around her, and they fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
She arrives in all her splendor every night at nine o'clock
And her chariot is a cross-town bus that stops right down the block
The ol' piano minstrel plays a song as she walks in
And the queen of the Silver Dollar, she's home again
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Her royal gown is a satin dress, that's stained and slightly torn
And her sparkling jewels are rhinestones, and her shoes are scuffed and worn
From the many roads she's travelled and the wonderous sights she's seen
And I watch her and I pray God save the queen
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
The queen of the Silver Dollar is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But I found her and I won her, and I brought her to this world
Yes I'm the man who made a queen of a simple country girl
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom.......

And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

We shall meet on that beautiful shore;

The melodious songs of the blessed,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Porter Wagoner,"When I married Julie she was just seventeen pretty as the answer to any man's dream
From the start I gave Julie all the love that I had
But everyone told me that Julie was bad
For Julie liked parties and clothes that fit tight
Drinking and dancing and out late at night
She was everything evil with the face of a child
And I sat home and waited while my Julie went wild
I built an empire with my own two hands power and money to break any man
But with all my possessions power and gold Julie was one thing I couldn't control
Though I gave Julie all my money could buy
And begged her to love me but she wouldn't try
For she'd only laugh as she'd walk out the door
And each time she'd hurt me made me love her more
I couldn't sleep until Julie got home last night she came in but wasn't alone
The things that I heard I could hardly believe
As her and the stranger made plans to leave
Without my Julie why I just couldn't live
And this is one thing I know I could never forgive
So I wait with a pistol the bullets just three one for the stranger Julie and me
One for the stranger Julie and me",Julie

The jukebox will be playing your favorite song tonight
You're the loneliest fool that's living in your make believe world
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
Though you chose the life that lead you to sorrow and shame
Each shoulder that you cry on, you swear that I'm to blame
You gave up the one that loved you to live in your sorted world
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
You can't say I didn't love you as you're crying in your beer
You drink to every heartache and wish that I was near
With each drink you passion surges and start your head to whirl

Porter Wagoner,"When I was young and went to school 
 They taught me how to write 
 To take the chalk and make a mark 
 And hope it turns out right 
 Well that's the way it is with love 
 And what you did to me 
 I wrote it so you'd know 
 That I was yours eternally 
 
(Chorus) 
 But my tears have washed I love you 
 From the blackboard of my heart 
 It's too late to clean the slate 
 And make another start 
 I'm satisfied the way things are 
 Although we're far apart 
 My tears have washed I love you from 
 The blackboard of my heart 
 If you'd been true the way you should 
 And not have gone astray 
 These tears would not have fallen down 
 And washed the words away 
 No need to talk, 'cause if the chalk 
 Should write those words again It will be for someone else 
 Not things that might have been

By a smile or a golden curl

Or arms that hold you tight
There will be another
In her arms tomorrow night

Hearts to her are toy tops
She likes to watch 'em whirl
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

You can never change her ways
Though you give her all the world
She's got more than one or two
And each day there's someone new
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

Breaking hearts to her
Is just a way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool
And you're another one

She knows all the arts of love
She'll give your heart a twirl

I've got a Humpty Dumpty heart
You dropped it and broke it apart

Could never put it together again

But when I gave to you my heart
You said that we must part
That was my doom, my heart went boom

When dropped it won't bounce or ring
It ain't no joke 'cause when it's broke

In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Many a page of life has turned
Many a lesson I have learned
Yet I feel like in those hills, I still belong

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I born

But as I sit here today
Many miles I am away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the Oak and Blackjack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born

To those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Where the black oil rolls and flows

Then you'll pause and see your cause

But I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand

So you say you're happy now, you've found a new love
Tell him, I said, he's a lucky, lucky man
No, I don't think I'll have time to see his picture
I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand

There's so much more between us than this table
All those years, all those dreams, all those plans
Guess you know without me sayin', I still love you
But I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand

There's so much more between us than this table

Porter Wagoner,"You know, I been a guest in a lot of great places in my lifetime
New York City, Carnegie Hall
Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennesse
West Plains, Missouri, Hometown
And I was committed to Parkview
Hope I never have to go there again

There's a man across the hall
Who sits starin' at the floor
And he thinks he's Hank Williams
Hear him singin' through the door
There's a girl in 202
Who stops by to visit me
And she talks about her songs
And the star that she should be
There's a lot of real fine talent
Stayin' in or passin' through
And for one thing or another
They're committed to Parkview

There's a girl in 207
Comin' down on thorazine
And a superstar's ex-drummer
Tryin' to kick benzedrine
There's a real fine country singer
Who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning
An attempted suicide
There are those who never made it
Those who did and now are through
Some came of their own good choosin'
Some committed to Parkview

There's a girl who cries above me
Loud enough to wake the dead
They don't know what she has taken
That has scrambled up her head
There's a boy just down below me
Who's the son of some well-known
He was brought in by his mother
'Cause his daddy's always gone
There's a bum from down on broadway
And a few quite well-to-dos
Who have withdrawn from the rat race
And committed to Parkview

They wake me about six-thirty
Just before the morning meal
While they're takin' my blood pressure
They ask me how I feel
And I always say ""fantastic!""
Why, there ain't nothing wrong with me
Then they give me my injection
And I go right back to sleep
And my days're kinda foggy
And my nights're dreamy too
For they're taking good care of me
While committed to Parkview",Committed to Parkview

I went to bed so sad and blue

Underneath the harvest moon 
I was thinkin' about you 
And then you met me in the moonlight 
The stars were shining in your eyes 
But another was there too 
I don't believe you've met my baby 
You looked at her, you looked at me 
I wondered who you were talkin' to 

I shook the hand of your stranger 
But I was shaking more inside 
Cause I was still wonderin' who 
Your arm was restin' on her shoulder 
You smiled at her, she smiled at you 
Her eyes were filled with victory 
She said my brother wants to marry 
And then my heart was filled with ease 
I knew that you would marry me

Porter Wagoner,"There was a time we'd sit in the backyard cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar we'd fight mosquitoes and enjoyed
You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life as man and wife and hard ships then
Could scaresly scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine we often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love
The Christmas brought us saddest days
When your pride gave a way you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief was so hard to see it didn't hurt me
Like the love I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
For it seemed ike nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay they came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love
Now there's an easy chair for my back a satin pillow for your head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry
If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in your prayers we've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of rearin' kids and payin' bills

Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you

Got in trouble had to roam left my gal and left my home
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
Just a kid acting smart I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off to Georgia Main locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
All alone I bear the shame I'm a number not a name
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow

I got a Brooklyn honey and she don't want me for my money
Laughs at all my jokes, especially when it's not funny
And I confess that I'm her all true man
She got a fly hairdo, little trinkets on her hands
Her ears is pierced, and in them diamond trunks
My rhymes is fierce, so won't you back up off her punks
Junk in her trunk, so I know the brothers sweat her
But that's OK, cause I know she know better
More cakes than Drake's and more things than ring-dings
It ain't no need to try to gas her to swing
She's not impressed, by your fancy car
She got a body so she's snotty and she don't care who you are
So don't get mad and diss her reputation
Callin her a floozy, any conversation
Mad grammar backstabber, girls they want to be her
But like Stevie Wonder, none of y'all can see her!
So when your fellas turn, just learn to keep lookin
Cause I got me a flower, that grows in Brooklyn

That grows in Brooklyn

Walkin down the street, fellas go by watchin her sayin
	""Hey baby.."" -> Sadat X
	""Hey baby.."" -> Sadat X
	""Boom, the bip, the boom bip.."" -> Q-Tip
Here's a little quote, from Anita Baker
Give the best to God, so won't you move with the shaker
I come back like a boomerang-ah
Make women wind, like a zoom to zang-ah
You fellas want to know if I can hang?  Yeah, yeah
All you ladies want to know if I can hang?  Owwwwwww
I rips the show I gets the dough I licks you low I let you know
that times have passed that fast -- dere it go!
I see your girl, I know she right
I run that Johnny Gill line and say, ""You sho' look good tonight""
But alas, that's the past, I'm not hookin
I got me a flower, that grows in Brooklyn

That grows in Brooklyn

Walkin down the street, fellas go by watchin her sayin

	""Hey baby.."" -> Sadat X
	""ya, why'know, ya ya why'know.."" -> ?
Brothers in the neighborhood don't like my style
They don't likes the way I walk, they don't like my smile
But when I go see her they don't try to play me though
They give me a pound and say, ""We know you from the video""
And by the way, do you live on Canarsie?
Nah, but much respect to the Brooklyn posse
I step to the rear, cause I don't want no beef baloney
They might know my name, but now look, they don't know me
Nots to worry, cause the kid is thorough
Prepared for riffin any town street or borough
Cause you know, there's a Brooklyn wherever you go
And every girl, there's a flower that's dyin to grow
So when I'm town, you know I'm at her hut
Loungin like a Band-Aid, in the cut
And when I get dat feelin, uhh!
Legs hit the air, footprints get left on the ceiling
She came a tight end, and she left a wide receiver
I make white girls a believer ever since the Jungle Fever
I came a long way to say she's taken tooken
And that's why she's my flower, that grows in Brooklyn

That grows in Brooklyn

Now it's your friends you gotta worry about, to say the least
Cause man, they're stickin to ya kid without the grease
Runnin game in the name of fame
Or talkin about every nice little thing for ya that they've done
And they've done nuttin now too late you learn
Cause all they wanted was uhh, somethin in return
That's a flam and a scam, you can tell I ain't gas it
Bite a check on my rep, and then later, try to cash it
But I got more bounce to the ounce, what I'm sayin
Seven and a half ounces, braincells, on the way in
Cause momma ain't raised none, I ain't changed none
I got work in my work and it stays done
A man twenty-three years yes I've grown
And I've learned that I can do bad on my own
I don't need a friend cause, I've got a brand new car
All cause I'm a, hot new rap star
Maybe cause my bank account is so profound
And since you're my friend, I gotta put you down
Anyway I know clout, only respects clout
And it's your friends kid, you got to worry about

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
It's your friends, oh yea your friends, YOU GOTTA WORRY ABOUT

[Positive K]
A let me tell you let me tell you who your friends are
Your friends ride around, in your new car
They ask for dough when they know you just got dough
They call your house every minute on the hour yo
Talkin bout - let's hang - you don't want to hang
You want to go wild maybe do your own thang
But they get mad, and they sweat that
Cause what ya got man they know they can't get that
And they don't take no for an answer either
They want to see you drivin round like you're Alex Rega
But you can't see, you're not a +Taxi+
that bring girls around when they know you got a main G
Cause that's the person that you spend time with
and spend the time with, it does not combine with
what they want to do, and what they want to do
is hang and if you can't somethin gotta be wrong with you
So tell me why a woman takes a man hand
and tells him things, that makes him feel grand
Large and (?) you're my knight in shining armor
Known this woman, from a soap opera drama
Weak in wickedness I know how you kick it miss
I know you're gonna say who's gonna pay before he's stickin this
Now you're caught without a thought, no need to pretend
Who hooked you up with this girl huh, a friend
No one wants to be around when you're down and out
Cause it's your friends kid, you gotta worry about

[Chorus]

[Positive K]
A nevertheless I, don't like to stress abouts I
Likes to take it easy, do my job, dat's why
My so-called friends, I grew up with
Either fell off, smoked out, or just ain't shit
And the rest I just don't like
And if I see him again, I swear we're gonna fight
But I'm a cool brother, thanks to my mother
And a friend, I really don't need another
But I got peeps, peeps that's true
And on my record - I'm singin all praises due
Just for givin 'em each day, I'm livin on that
To the babies I got to put the Positive in 'em
Cause I'm a loner and known to entrepreneur
And I'm sure you see more..
Whoever made up, the word friendship?
They need to get beat, up with a slave whip
Because they never knew, of what a friend would do
Cause when you're down and out, they never helpin you
They always lead you on, and they sing a song
And when you need 'em somethin's always goin wrong
They said I'm broke yo, I'm on welfare
I didn't have dough, I couldn't get there
My mom is sick, my sis is pregnant
My father's drunk, my house is hectic
And then they flip the script and say I need a quick G
Or couldn't you spare a beat?  c'mon, this is me
You know you'll get it back, aiyyo yea that's a fact
I've already lost a job, and plus be smokin that
Off with you give the dough, cause youse a true friend
But what ya know now if you only knew then
He wouldn'ta got jacked, for the big smack
And it's only right, because it's like that

Minnie used to be a fly girl (fly girl)
By the way, she used to be my girl (my girl)
But now she's a floozie and got a, kid with an uzi
And the question I asked her was why girl (why girl)
Now you can call this freak a good looker (yeah)
Or you can call the (ho) a good hooker
But a guy came by with a (dick) that was bigger than mine
and guess what he took her - come down!

For this girl I was lost in the sauce and had to pay the cost
in order to be the boss
I was on it but knew how she was livin
And every time I seen her it seems that I was driven
possess will possess you like +The Exorcist+
She was, so bad the devil's son-in-law he couldn't even resist
It was said in the bed she was wicked
Married men - they couldn't help but stop and kick it
Fellas passin her was harassin her
""You got a man,"" they was frequently askin her
And she loved that, stone to the bone
And wouldn't give it up, not even for a happy home
Not for a man and a family
But every Friday night, they was bettin that she was sure to be
at your local discotech
Dancin dirty, uhh, and workin up a sweat
The neighborhood heart breaker
And once you made her yours, the next man would come and take her
away to the Casbah
Because you didn't have it goin on, up to par
I'm a million dollar man but I'm not Steve Austin
You can take the cake but what's the cake without frostin
Success ain't nothin without someone to share it with
Except a girl with a Robin Givens starter kit
She did it hit it and quit it and now she's gone
See ya! But ya know I know

She loved him a lot, because he used to buy her coke see {*sniff*}

But Minnie looked much better
To top it off, she had a ninety-two Jetta
Now that's a girl who love to ball
She didn't want a lot of things cause hey, she wanted it all
Him, him and him
Yeah the guy with the Benz and the five-star rims
She had a million dollars in nickels and dimes
And sat around and counted 'em all a million times
She was tall, fly, and skinny
And if you don't know I'm talkin bout Minnie the Moocher

Take these broken wings and learn to fly all your life 
You were only waiting for this moment 
For your moment to arise blackbird 
Singing in the dead of night 
Take these sunken eyes and learn 
To see all your life you were only 
Waiting for this moment for the moment 
To be free blackbird singing in the dead 
Of night take these empty lungs that cry 
To sing eventually all your lies the ones 
You wasted for were only waiting for this 
Moment now your moment passed you by

Poster Children,"Underneath the broken mask
Expose the skin in a flash
The skin reflects a silent trust
In between two who are touched

The perfect are marked for life
The slow decay they try to hide
We are told not to watch
An image says so much

Surrounded by these photographs
Each one has a negative
In the spring two more jumped
On this day she'll become one of us

Poster Children,"I'm wide awake and you're fast asleep
Here in the dark, watching you dream
My mind is tied up in the sheets
Lost in a thought I'll never leave

Locked up inside, it's raining again
Starting to stall caught in the gray
Can't tell if I'm too early or too late

Postmen,"There's girls I've been in love with I smoked pot with
I've met enough things in life
I need this woman to get stuck with
Scuff with I need it for my rude character

And my cold temperature
It's the main topic might marry her
In mind she's with me shy smile made her pretty
We took boat trips around the city

I told her how this world became evil and disputed polluted
Buildings and monuments just sooped
It we talked about a livin' I'm still missing but I pray for
Want to buy her stuff that she adored but I was raised poor

Covered my sorrow praise them for a better day tomorrow
'Cause all I have I borrowed bought myself lotto's
Live on a hustle exploiting talents is my motto
Produce half my world for money and more to follow

My sins will be committed on a female body and
If I die it's between legs police claiming pussy got me
 
Fly cocktail about a fly female
Explain what I feel without further details
We had future plans but she wasn't keepin' it real
She broke my damn heart that's the deal, that's why
 
Love left me with a hangover
Fly cocktail I will get over you yes
You don't treat me right
Still Jah is my guide on this road to life
 
I gave her lots of lovin' but she returned me nothing
She couldn't give me no respect she's flexin' with a lot of men
I finally left her in the cold took back my heart she stole
'Cause when l called her on the phone she often put me on a hold
No baby no this is not my steelo

I see so many eyes spy when I mingle with my people
Dwell single that's the sequel
When we was real you gave support
Now you act like you are bored gave your girls your home rapport

From my next to my ex from my ex back to the next
Maybe I did it for the sex maybe I did it to relax
You will never know that's right I keep it to myself
I know you dying inside holding my pillow tight

You was my new flavor couldn't give I never gave ya
Never played ya
Can't understand this strange behavior no longer date ya
We've grown up we splitted up I reminisce about you
While refilling my cup
 
Fly cocktail about a fly female
Explain what I feel without further details
We had future plans but she wasn't keepin' it real
She broke my damn heart that's the deal, that's why
 
You used me abused me
Mentally confused me
Lord no longer will you fool me
Oh no
I thought you was my guided light
Fly cocktail you don't treat me right
 
[Chorus]

I heard from him and him say me that she said she was pregnant
It's been a long time since I stinged her like a cactus
Put on the spot for what I did not
Messed my thoughts claimed support it's not my fault
To make a long story short
She had a miscarriage a broken street marriage
Her daddy kicked her in the belly
Caused a lot of damage
So now she's worried about them one night stands
She didn't plan
She never had a man until she had a Postman.

Postmen,"They come and ask you for your life
Men it's a fever
Let love abide and joy will rise (2x)

The only thing next to meet is the grim reaper
While your life is terrorized by the late fever
They paralyze ya by legalizing the reefer
I know 'cause my nose got the sense of a golden retriever
But trial is on the disbeliever
The highest bidder
We got the cure blowing out ya transmitter
Politics, music it `s all the same but the
Post not to blame for all sorrow and pain
Campaign, 'cause we reign let`s get the
The kabinet changed
Keep ya to ear
To it music and we do it again
Don't let a fever ruin your plan.
The future is at hand
Don't feel accused, but you been used in many attempts

[Chorus]
Everybody likes more freedom and more welfare
More shares of the pot that feeds'em
We talk sense if it ain't teaching
We got demands from a nation that´s starving and dying to get a chance
Where's you heart at take part of a dream starting
Increased violence in the luxury life supported
Already thought it would lead the way the finger points to
'cause they're the ones that really you.

Men the air you breath only temporary
No money can?t compete
Against the value of life we all know we need
Squeeze the fever out of breathers to lust for greed
Life's a breeze can't seem to live comfortably
Global politickin judging us scarfully
Plus the streets never really took care of we
Packin heat as means to live carefully
Reality fever

[Chorus]
Young life insecure not sure about wrong or right
What is it that makes you fight
And why live it we know it ain't not permitted
But it does in the streets
Where there's rules and they not to keep
Opposite things a state of mind poverty brings.
We tell you about jobs and the value of market it in
Put a target on print for the bombardment
Generals marched in roll out the red carpet
There's control by the fever at the bank, it runs where the money goes
Everybody love it that's how grows
Pullin plugs on a mind that is easily bugged
They get you drugged, get you what?

Shots are verbal, virtual ?? to nurse you
We celebrated because the value now has elevated
A permanent fact the underground buzz vaporeded
The luggage has changed the travel remains
The more original we came the more power we gained
Now we shower on your cowards that will never maintain
Just a new formula arranged we never switched lanes
A little action on the snaredrum pattern, the drums attacking
A draggin' bassline, howling guitars and piano stabbin'
Expend from my Dutch network to Hamburg
Analyze this revolution kid it is handsworth
And of course the lord protect us from falling
Ain't we all and same
It's first falling and it seems we are walking again
From rockbottom now we got something
We never give it up we live it up and still?

A lot a labba labba talk them already start fi run there mouth
Don't know how things a gwan but still them every where about
Where I see some try to use me like a dummy handing out
Me dun seen a couple of them so me just steady check them out
A lot of friends them no friends try to ride like a trend
Fishing for a dollar lend just to come back again
Me no greedy man but me no like no cheeky man 
Hypocritical like them a work for Babylon so

[Chorus]
We never claimed rasta we're just reggae lovers
And from the first stone laid we were hiphoppers
And now the game changed a bit
You're hearing our name in your crib
Fronting on your moms because she is singing our hits
Hate to see your sister screaming when she is grabbing my wrist
Hate to hear your daddy tell you what real music is
So how your still in denial while we're climbing the list
The problem is we just don't quit
Live it up
See them try always these pacified fools
But them can't overrule what we do

Show 'em we are what we are (hey yo!)

A mouth full of cheddar make a greedy setter
Got a mean vendetta, my team is too clever
Never ever gonna stop, 'cause I rock forever (forever)
You ain't never gonna see me when I be me
When it comes to the rhymes, can't beat me
All the girls say, you complete me
Even some 'em weekly wanna meet me (haha)
Bust on the scene like Jeezy (yeeeah)
And everybody want a Potluck CD
After the show, collect the dough

Because I'm invincible, you can't sink the boat

And a lock in the do' like a fo-fo at a show

Motherfuckers starin' but pity for 'em baring
But when they lyric go and if you wanna bet 'em they gonna die

Gotta stand in the street with my hand on my dick
Cause I wanna be sayin', I'm rich bitch (bitch!)

Old school way back is all I'm comin with
And play the dominos like a nympho

And potnas are reserved for the dunk funk
You get em juiced and find your ass with gorilla dumps
And dying for each other's just way real
So get it tight when you're comin for the rough skill

I hook it up for the late night holiday
I got the killer crossover plus they can't stop the trey
It's all major when the pager starts to chirp
I got hoes or maybe I got dirt
A product of the city, slick in the oven
Lovin to hear the funk when the head starts pervin

So sick with this, don't forget the melody
Now I know how I feel to be a celebrity
I snap my fingers when I want some punani
You think I'm bluffin ?????
I ain't gotta lie to kick it or lounge
I'm in a circle of funk and never out of bounds
And then my potnas say what to do now
Cognac to the head, boo-yaw
I heard the competition flowin local
That's when Young Rube said he'd go vocal
Behind a funked out, bumped out earthquake
All songs stuck on strong upon the first take
So come inside on a ride, pony, giddy-up
Break em off a chunk that'll funk the whole city up

I'm in and out of traffic with an evil grin
Ridin with the funk ain't but an old trend
And I push up on the gas and let the tail spin
And maintain with the whole Bay
I give it to em rough and try to fly straight
I'm sideways I just smell the tires burn
Funk ride heated when the spokes turn
Let it coast as the rump shakes
Short stop, they caught me with my running mates
I gotta watch for the lead shot

I need yokes on a bitch I want to get with
I need a old school mob with a shift kit
Left, right, head bobbin, mob type of chaos
All you punks talkin jeal', tear the shit way off
Cause I ain't with the funny style charades
I rather hit 'em doggy while I'm tuggin dookie braids
I'm talkin bad muthafucker with the sick rappin
I'm talkin slang from the turf and not the pig latin
My pops told me when I was at the AJ
Never become a suspect of a date rape
If she don't want ya you don't need her
You don't buy her clothes, you don't feed her
Never would I cross over for applause
Never would I save a hoe for the drawers
""Can't we all get along"" was the question
That they shot to the blacks and the Mexicans
Answer came back like this, potna, ""Eat a dick""

I couldn't stand the rock, I stay hip to the black groove
Playa pimpin shittin for the swingers, man
House parties bunk, gettin out of hand
Young buck strivin for the cockola
15 and couldn't wait till I was older
At that point didn't think about carryin
A fat gat, all my potnas, they be buried in
And now I'm my twenties and I'm like fuck
I got the rabbit's foot searchin for the right luck
And house parties shut down before they get started
A young fool had to go and try to get retarted
That's how it goes in the nine-o, I can't deny it
I'm out to get mine, pockets never on a diet
Black on black and brown on brown

Before the crack, before the AIDS, before the ( ? )

But still he's gotta push in the cold wind
Take a look up at his life till it soaks in
And promise to myself when I'm holdin fat
I'ma break him off a chunk and give some love back
Get it 'fore they do is how the game's played
I try to follow rules and mama cool-Aid
Then again I'm lookin up for the steep hill
My people first, and need a nother refill
And brothers on the search for the good job
Tired of bein labelled as an old slob
But never does he find what he look fo'
A lotta jobs for the rich and none for the po'
That's why I'm dippin low with a loose screw
And when it comes to this it ain't shit new
Real to the say and tell it all straight
Never trippin off the fools that want to raise hate",Let U Tell It

I'm from Vallejo, California where the players dwell
Where the game and the city run parallel
And don't trip, tie your shoes when you about yo scratch
And don't let a bitch be the reason to funk, that's
A move used by them aliens, man
You better stick to your plot and to your game plan
And eh, cut me with the fiasco
And bring that ass, hoe, and all that cash flow
And touch down when your game is tight
And trust not a motherfucker, ain't that right?
And don't play the role of a lollypop
And don't trip, hit a hoe if the bitch say stop

Cause she don't got me stressin
Girl, I don't love you
It's these player caps I'm bustin
Girl, I don't love you

Chez quick, Chez stop, never ever me
Another player with the long-ass-gevity
And to the hoes out huntin for up my wallet
You gets poundings daily up with my solid
It be them ones that's foldin cash
Not the PH punks swollen ass
So Tallyhoe and tell a hoe
About the young playas mobbin' in Valley-Joe
( ? ) as I change I switch, I watch
I trust Mr. Heckler and Mr. Crotch
Not a stank to set me straight
Have my baby want bank and lit the lley
I goes about not like a trick
But a player recognizes she's tossed quick
Feed 'em game, feed em, mang, feed 'em dick
Playa down, play her cool like Pimpin Slick

I don't love ya, I don't want ya
Couldn't stand ya when I boned ya
Strikin through mean to be seen on the triple ( ? )
Ain't got time for the diggers with the zipper schemes
Can't let my mail land in my big hand
I'm in the game sinkin like quick sand
Play her good, never would go out sloppy
Some fools fall off short, but not me
So come on y'all and watch me do this one
I'm the Rascal of the crew, the foolish one
So all you silly zaps, here's for yo safety
I goes ( ? ) when I'm off the old gravy

It's Baby Beesh, now you can call me Poppa Poppa
I got a brand new freak, and man, I'd say she proper
And it's all tremendously good and great, glorious
Smooth sailing and victorious
And about the old one, I had to fly the coop
Cause when you hunger for the loot, bitch, you get the boot
Size 10 to the chinny-chin-chin-a
And like that I had to do-koo-kin ya
So get ghost, adios, hit the roses
You been waved, my peace of mind has been saved
By the new freak and she's lovin this Latino
Showin off, lettin me know
Sexin is spectacular
I starts on the bottom, but ends up in the back of her
Hittin them, gettin them nice and juice
Young Beesh in the house from Potna Deuce
Yeah, and no stress in the love nest
Cool - cause baby doll keeps revenue level-headed
That's so thick as I speak
And poppa got a brand new freak

You see, all my young potnas want to sneak a peek
Cause she got the cool grill with the cool trunk
That be hittin like Pippen on the alley hoop dunk
Last freak wasn't meant for poppa
She was fickle and predictable like a soap opera
Had to stop her in the tracks from makin me go savage
Let the hoe go, now Rube is blowin so lavish
I thought you knew, freak 2 is so righteous
Put her on the top of my list of my pipe bust
I might just open a bottle of ??why-Zippendale??
Show my new thang how poppa is livin swell
Put her in a spell, take her to the motel
It's all good, but I kicks down no mail
Cause I got no loose change and no time for games
Ain't nothin here ever strange, mang
Cause poppa's on top of thangs

And I been tappin that ass every since last weak
Like an animal, love that I'm villainous

Is out there mobbin for the folks squabbin
y'all don't understand about the Hillside hound hoggin
I creeps up on the proper for they want some of
The gut-runnin killer, call me beaver hunter
And smash up on the guts from the back porch
Give em that tropical vibe from the hot torch
And play the game dirty with my knuckles in it
Freaky little somethin, here I come for the late visit
(Wait a minute, man, you know I can't flex)
Unless I'm throwin on somethin cool that protects
And swing like a swinger really oughts to

I never expected for it to feel like this

Cause first dates, they usually don't

But I felt connected from the moment you walked in

It's like you're someone I've always known

And I could sit here and talk to you all night long


Cause you're so easy going, conversations flowin'

Somethings growing here in this heart of mine

And I'm feelin' dizzy, little weak kneed

When you're with me

And I don't know if I can explain it

It's kinda cool ain't it ?


Now I'm not tryin' to move too fast

I've always heard it's best when you take it slow

But girl I'm dying just to take you by the hand

And dance with you all night right here on the patio

I guess I need to feel to hold you close

But well I know how you feel cause I've been feelin' it all night

Boot leather on a barroom floor, fightin' over a dance hall girl

He pulled a knife, I pulled a gun, and I sent him home to glory

The sheriff said son, better go with me

Give me your gun and come peacefully

I can drop you right here, or you can tell the court your story


Chorus:

Hang me high, hang me low

They're gonna hang me in the morning

Stay away from Jericho, all you rounders,

I give you fair warning


Entered my plea, called it self defense,

a sober judge sittin' on the bench

And I stared into 24 eyes of a hard-nosed Jericho jury

They called it murder in the first degree,

The judge said, son, stand and look at me

Hang him - and may the lord have mercy


Chorus


Thirteen steps to the scaffold high,

the whole town's out just to watch me die

And not one to shed a tear of mourning

Please would you honor my last request,

when they lay me down to rest

Let the epitaph on my tombstone read this warning

Twisted who assume the words trickering from those lips
Are truly worthy of the audience
They burn the ears of lovers too
Who once put all their trust in you
Making villians of their own

Some hoods don't suffer
Oh I wish they would
Some hoods don't suffer

Oh teasing glimpse of honesty
Almost hides the treachery caving below
Still I wish good things for you
Almost as a way to show you
You don't matter

From hoods don't suffer
(Hearts don't suffer)
Oh I wish they would
From hoods don't suffer

Powderfinger,"Release me from this struggle to be free
Won't you take my hand
Lead me to the promised land of your love
Step outside of this superficial life
Put your pretty lips on mine
Kiss me one more time and I'm gone

Who really cares?
Who really knows?
About these agents of despair
And their thrown together prose

Release me from this struggle to be free
I'll break my plans
To be in the gentle hands of your love
When you're by my side in these superficial times
Put your little hand in mine
Kiss me one more time and I'm gone

About these agents of despair
And their thrown together prose

Watch him let you down
And leave you hanging on a rope
Hanging on a rope... hanging on a rope

I won't be fooled by your devious ways
Your ingenuine fears and your ingenuine pain
I look a wreck but somehow you look fine
You come to me
And ask me to ease our troubled mind
I won't be fooled again.....

When you first let me in
Got underneath my skin

It's an echoing empty room
Until your love pours in
And fills it to the brim
I never felt the hook go in
Until you came around
And broke me right back down.

There's just thing that I failed to tell you
I'm wishing on the same moon and stars above you
We're wishing on the same moon

Hear me now I'm calling out for you
Pleading for your love
You're falling from my view and and there's nothing I can do

I'm waiting in the afternoon
For the sun to sink
And let the night back in
It's when I feel close to you
When the stars they swoon
And bring their night time bloom

There's just one thing that I failed to tell you
I'm wishing on the same moon and stars above you
We're wishing on the same moon

Don't you know that the blood in your vein is as lifeless as yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not by choice but by chance
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last

I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

I can feel you breathe
Washing over me

Pram,"In the hum of time you stand
Frozen like a stopped clock's hands
Wrapped in the things you wear for comfort
Only your eyes show your terror
Your chalky skin is thick but frail
Like Egyptian paper
And pent blood deafens your brain
Till you think you've let the outside world in

And you're like a star in the heaven
That's cold bright and beautiful
And just like a star in heaven
You're so unreachable

You imagine yourself a statue
To be looked at with a price
Around your neck to show how much you're worth
And how you shouldn't be touched
But you're made of flesh and yearnings
Like all the rest of us around you
No statue ever cried like you
When your mother weaned you",Blue

Go swooping through the air
And at night we'll safely land
And fold our wings with care

And wrap ourselves in the silver sky
And there'll be no more to doubt
No more to cry about

One of these days I'll be up in the heavens
Live my life in the clouds
And you'll put aside all your fears of flying
Dance with me on a star",Dancing on a Star
Pram,"Once I thought I was in love
But that was a mistake
For it was a warm feeling
Wrapped around me like a shawl
Learn to love the corners
And the angles of the world
To not love them you'll never live
The only peace is death.

Love isn't a glow or a song in the heart
It's bony fingers tugging through your hair
It's sharp hipbones bruising blue your thigh
It's saying something softly that goes unheard.

Love snarls up the patterns
Of everything you know
It doesn't send you off to space
But buries you instead
Love holds on to gravity
And gravity is love
To love another human is
A puzzle for the head.",Gravity
Pram,"Where are you going?
Come back here I'm helpless without you
I wave my tiny limbs in useless gestures
I need you I am dependent
And when you leave me terror darkens
My mind like crows wings
I can't even form words to tell you
How I need you and how I resent
It that I need you so

I run towards light
Maybe the glow of people
Something warm and enticing
My heaven is other people

Sometimes I would like it if
Everyone did the same thing
I could get a grasp gain control over events
I would bite you but
What would hurt you once would hurt my twice
I have a dark force in my head
Could be used to smooth things over
But wood is full of splinters
And people are nevr doing quite what
You want them to","Little Angel, Little Monkey"

Into the costume in which you learn to fly
Always chained to somewhere
In case I might hurt myself
Sitting in the sawdust
That's stained by the animals

Twisted leg in iron and plaster
Dragging 'round and 'round
While I dance with my father the clown

While she's in lace and feathers
I'm the one in clumsy shoes
Always being told I damage what I touch

Can I ever be unfettered
Free as she is front of them all
Or must I stay and eat my own skin

My heartbeat like a clock's ticking
Filling the room
And the gentle dark hands of the shadows
Clasped in corners in the gloom

If I could I'd merge with you
Forever live as one as whole complete inside
But I'm afraid that you don't want that

Over the rooftops
Blocking the sky from sight
If you're never left in the darkness

Means that you're never ever alone

I could sing a lullaby to them all
Nighttime over the tannoys
Wish them safely home

Outside my bedroom window
The night will never fall
It stays outside the city
Like a glove waiting to be worn

Means you're never ever alone",Things Left on the Pavement

The sun is sleeping
Don't wake the moon

Wobbles round the sun
Like a drunk around a lamp post
And I shut my mouth sore from cursing
And my eyes that are tired of seeing

If I could shake off this feeling
Of being guilty for living
Of never doing what others wanted
Of simply being inconvenient

Some old bitter song that makes me want to shiver

All the hours are hanging as if caught on celluloid
Reeling ever closer, coiling ever tighter

Pras,"Intro:
Heh, yeah.  Aaight.  Just count me up in here, aaight?
Yeah.  Uhh.  Uhh.  Uhh.

Verse 1
First and foremost let's distinguish the boys from the men
The start to a end, a foe from a friend
Who next of kin when I bust this iron across yo' chin, nigga?
Let me extend payments due on your arrangements
Turn on the news, nigga, listen to the latest development
Extra extra, read all about it
Master Pras always Bout-It-Bout-It
Bring tears to your fears when I shout it, shout it
??? believe, though he doubt it, doubt it
Yeah, what's all the fussin' and bickerin' for
Yeah, few shots up your ass, hear from you no more
For sure you belong with an M-16
Stand in front of the door, that you just can't ignore
Go figure.  Hit the floor, nigga
Random shots - run for your life, nigga
This goes for my niggas who gets no bigger
Sweat on your forehead, let's see who pull quicker

Chorus:
Yeah, murder dem.  Murder dem.  In a, competition me go, murder dem.
Wha' what, follow dem.  Hm.  Follow dem.  
In this, situation me no, follow dem when me gone.
All pussi haffi run when me gun.  All cowards haffi run when me gun.  
No man haffi come 'cause we, murder dem.  Hm.  Murder dem.

Verse 2
I'm livin' on danger's ground, where the danger's mine
Hold firm, stand strong, 'bout to blow like land mine
Never mind, draw, reach for yours, I'ma go for mine
Leave you paralyzed with a broken spine
They seize and they shrine in the line of fire
Retreat, recline, from all firearm
Ring the alarm, bring the bomb squad, word to God
Got your number, nigga, watch I'll pull your cord
Pardon me, sincerely yours
Down by law, out to settle the scores
Haters shoutin', ""No, he can't be no more!""
Parasite, leachin' down, rottin' to the core
Cash rule, jewels cool, drown in my whirlpool
'Scuse my rudeness, rudeboy from Providence
These fists of fear remain to be fearless
Move like flyin' ??, full automation
Pumpin' carbon monoxide through your blood circulation
Separate these facts like segregation
Trial and tribulation, high expectation
The brigade shut off, backs seen me run off
Cagein' with Nicholas, it's a face-off
What?  Yeah!  Hah, mmm!

Chorus

Verse 3
In case you didn't know, it's the P-are-A-S
Got strategies like playing chess
Penetrate through your flesh, yes, hit me with your best
Got issues to address, nonetheless
Checkmate, only makin' moves with my playmate
Prakazrel is Pras when it's abbreviate
My puncture is accurate, nigga you dead weight
Dislocate every bone in your body
Then sit back and evaluate
Every mental ?? process is isolate
Preception is clear with my steel, I should demonstrate
You were last seen gettin' head from a drag queen
Come clean, nigga what, with an 18
The supreme dream team, cash rule and CREAM
While your body lies up in the ???
What, yeah, wha'what, wha'what, hahh!

Chorus

Hmm.  Uh huh uh huh.  Refugee Camp All-Stars.  Uh huh.  Uh huh uh huh.
Yeah, yeah.

Chorus",Murder Dem
Pras,"[Pras]
Uh, yeah, huh, yeah
Yo, yo, yo, I'll do a double dish cleaner 
The funny ass cats remind me of a skinner
Now you listen up, now what, heat on spitter

A renegade with my blade watch you get cut up
Sucker ass punk, you used to get beat up 
Type of dude that'll smoke your weed up and eat up
Hold up, surrender your squad, it's a stick up

Fifty-two pickup, you high school drop-out, gives you enough float 
To succeed or get tighter, what up, your block, get up 
Shut up, or put up I'ma bout to let up 
Licky, licky here, two shots you gone lick up 

Take her to the news under: You should've eased up
Wha' What Wha' you got me fed up, get up or shut the f up 
You done f'ed up, 8 or 9 enough even if she has seven runner up
Like the fans, like your thumbs up, what up?

I make them bowl like Shopper Ranks 
I'm the Captain of the Ship, make them cats walk the plank 
What the f you think I'm point, point blank
Turn off my sound niggas, let... crank 

[Chorus]
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up

See, blaze me above the game with no limit
Niggas nowadays can slick and pull gimmicks 
Cowber use roly well iced that been in it 
Mines is loose rocks and the Beverly spin in it 

Only place tin linid they cost a lot 
When no money on the game you sure talk a lot 
Never like a nigga car, you walk a lot 
See I make cream a lot, while you niggas dream a lot 

Can't you see it's all real, bras want to do me 
Get it attached to me like I'm starrin in movies 
Nigga Nor want to do me, thing is I got none 
want to be my main chick, chill I got one 

If it's hot in a lady then I can cop some
Most players all fall, tightly tint
See me fly through the window cause it's lightly tint 
But its strongly minute got a fall so cats frequent

Hate weed peepin, best cats seekin
want to kill me in the daytime, look it won't happen 
You ain't a thug nigga this is some girls is rap, what
(Yeah you don't won't no problem)

[Chorus]
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up

Yo my M-O is S-O-L-O... hello
Shake like Jello bionics and nice fellow 
Long hair, pussy's and pussy head too
In a room with the doctor, how the hell I stop ya?

The Rolex topper long as ya coppin them yo 
It means it's copper, don't need to stop ya 
When I'm speakin opera, which why'all don't understand 
That it's my channel Boo-Bionic mister man

Why y'all play Tennis we sway inventists
So our house can finish, wait a minute 
Change the color of my whips, despite you bastards 
Spit it green-cold on it, like you won the masters 

Flow... faster, speed it up, heat it up why don't why'all just heat it up 
Spit it on some feeder bust, slow it up, make the beat that we blow it up 
Ya niggaz ain't mine, better pray you throw it up 

[Chorus]
East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up
North Side where you at, where you at?
South Side throw it up, throw it up
Now...

[Pras]
Yo I keep my mind on my riches snitches get snitches 
Cats on the low they all act like bitches 
So what up, where you at with the nine-sin?
Feel my triples please circle the violence 

Let me abolish this sh... like Nat Turner 
Drop by Tom Warner, peace to my crooked cop killers 
with the six shooter while fake niggaz getting drunk off of wine coolers
Yo, uh...

Yo she big on the game it's broke I want to fix it 
Make hot... and get that down, we remix it 
He speakin, here we go your beef is nice
I'm from the gutter mother... best you think twice

Yo, hahaha that's right well let me run it, check it

We do things and hood bangers, g's as we are 
Well even Mack can do a bar with a Refugee All-star
Pras dance round the border like he Cassius Clay
While I press round the hood with a big AK
Stay fresh and unpredictable, they thought they knew me 
They say; how can a thug from Cali bust with a Fugee?
Cause I write and make... ignite, easy on the treble
Now turn the bass up and check my Mic level
As I get down, let mama peekin, but ain't speakin
I guess a gang-bang thug... got baby tweakin 
Said your outfit is tight, it's my favorite color Red
And plus your little black... is cute with your dreads
Bet you ain't never had a nigga that roll a six-fo
Hit a switch and then hop into a six double-o
You know, street niggas make the game twice as nice 
So add a little spice and put a thug in your life

Thus far, no one can spar with my little troth
from the flat bush I'll rip why'all and bust your show to Crenshaw
Flowin with Pras and some splash down to Jamaica
Meet you at the shock bar, Alas se enica
Place your bet yo pay your debt 
You cats with the fake crepes, I'll bust you with my Twin-Tack

Pras,"When I grow up, I'ma be a superstar
Ah, ha, alright, baby

They don't know how it feels
(When you're out on your own, yeah)
(And you're lookin' for that home)
They don't know what it feels
(When the world's on your shoulder)
(And your baby, gotta be a soldier)

Yo, I was born in the projects, with roaches and rats
And our credentials were our, nines and gats
Stay the hell out the hood read the welcomin' mats
I remember them days, it was hard bein' black

Welfare checks and government cheese
Take your family in portrait, everybody smile say cheese
And it's a wonder how I kept my head from goin' under
Sun don't shine where there's, lightning and thunder

Some got ways, some got means
But still, we all just got hopes and dreams
The two blend together like dope and fiends
Cope with teens, has that new gangster lean

Everybody just wanna be a ghetto star
Fly cribs and drivin' them big cars
That's all Mr.President, hear the voice of the youth
I don't lie, I speak the truth

They don't know how it feels
(When you a single mother)
(And don't have that significant other)
They don't know what it feels
(To be in the ghetto)
(And your life be in slow a mo')

Been around the world a couple times with the refugees
From the boot of Italy to the land of Pawnee
Fell in love a couple times on the London Bridge
Fast cars, fast life, that's how I wanted to live

What a crusade, one of my great escapades
Cut many hearts, like the game of spades
But nuttin' was as fatal when they blew the World Trade
Now we at war momma, tradin' lives for grenades

Send in the troops, here comes the brigades
American resolve and our hearts'll never fade
I know you somewhere out there chillin' in the shades
But I hate to be the one to rain on your parade

See, God is merciful and God bless his children
That's how we gonna reconstruct them buildings
So stop the killings, we runnin' out of graves
In the land of the free and the home of the brave

They don't know how it feels
(To hear our babies cry)
(And watch our mothers die)
They don't know, what it feels
(To see our brothers in prison)
(While they losin' their religion)

These, eyes of mines are like, camera lens
Loved by many but stabbed by my friends
Is this the end? Some may cry out loud
But I won't worry, we gonna make it now

The ghetto fed up but they won't break us down
It's an eye for an eye, what goes around comes around
Do dis for my peeps who couldn't speak
Survival of the fittest, what happens to the weak?

They either in between, above or beneath
Tryin' to play me like a scrub in a passenger seat
Racial profile to say the least
There won't be no peace in the belly of the beast, c'mon

But we gonna make it through baby
Even though the world is so crazy
And if they ask you, tell 'em it's pain times three
'Cause it's a million of them kids stressin' just like me, baby

They don't know how it feels
(To see us go to war)
(And see the people free for no more)
They don't know what it feels
(To be a black man in America)
(And feel like they're comin' to get'cha)

They don't know how it feels
(To work for minimum wage)
(As your life starts to fade)
They don't know, what it feels
(To be down to your last buck)
(And no one really gives a mother, ha)

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

You were the love child of two gods

You left Mount Olympus
To find your soul mate

""Dear Pa, this here harvest can wait""

You took a match to my dry August days
Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze
Flames licked the sky
That was some summer haze

Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze
How do I love you?
Let me count the ways
Cornfield ablaze

Pa don't be angry
The fields that were host
To the corn and the wheat
The fact is they're toast

In self defense
I'm obliged to point out
There'll always a risk of combustion
When there's been a drought

You took a match to my dry August days
Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze
Flames licked the sky
That was some summer haze

How do I love you?
Let me count the ways

Imagine if the firemen worked
And worked for days
And still the cornfield stayed ablaze

Her hair it was golden
Her hair it was yarn
We were playing with fire
In the number one barn

Carried away like two sparks
On a breeze
Then we fused into one
At a thousand degrees

You overwhelmed agricultural man
Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze
You wild pyromaniac daughter of Pan
Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze

You took a scarecrow
And made him a man

I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

Fool fool

Consider this

Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come fading around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you cry

That was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

That was just a dream

That was just a dream

Harry, ce soir, écume la ville, pour oublier sa mère

Attirée par son joujou, tombera dans le piège

why you shovin' me from behind

without a product
there ain't no sales

then I'm the holy grail
so don't be forgettin' to listen to the rhyme
when the guitar wails
if all else fails
just remember that I'm the stitch
that holds together all this shit
which makes everyone of y'all my bitch

I am your Judas
and I stand with wounded wrist
I'll never make it through this
I twist your cross ninety degrees
I breathe hellfire and boil the seas

they planted a seed
and made you believe
in a religion based on money and greed
send money please
the church needs all your cheese
so follow my lead
and get on your knees

you make me laugh
and you smell real bad

I just wish I had a second chance to say
That I love you

I hope you know how many lives you touched
Your memory lives in all of us
I miss you so much

Between you and I one final test
When I looked into your eyes
This is what you left
All I am inside

You gave me life

Just the other night
You visited me in a dream
You looked as healthy as ever
The best I've ever seen
You stood there in the light
Surrounded by a sea of green
It was a beautiful place
Where only love could breathe
Then you took me by the hand
And told me silently that objects in the mirror may be closer than they seem
And I thanked you with a smile
For reminding me
You didn't have to speak
'cause I heard every word
Your message was clear and you can be rest assured
That I'll teach all the rest the best of all that I've learned
Your death gave life to me
And I've turned into the best person that I can be
Court's adjourned


Now I live my life for you

To the greatest teacher I've ever known
From beyond you showed me that I'll never be alone 
And I've grown beyond my years
These tears are here to show you that I've conquered the fear
Let us not grieve over your death
But celebrate your life
And let you rest
A life with no regrets/just love and happiness
You taught us this and now bliss manifests",One Final Breath

Pronto llegará la alegría
Pronto sonará su mensaje
Y me dejará ver el día sin temor, sin miedo
Un nuevo paisaje

Pronto llegará, hoy la espero
Aparecerá tan radiante
Y me dejará ver el cielo, todos los luceros
Todo en un instante

Y la haré pasajera de mi vida
Yo seré prisionera de su suerte
Acabarán por ella mis desdichas y la tristeza
Querrá desvanecerse

Y será puro y simple su lenguaje
Será sencillamente contagioso
Me quitaré cuando llegue el equipaje

Esos momentos de ayer hace tiempo
Que te digo lo que pienso casi
Sin querer es que hace calor

Agua de los mares hielo
En un iceberg cascadas y ríos
Que a saltos escapan
Huyen y nadie los puede beber

Pero a tu lado el calor se pasará
Y es que sospecho
Que no es calor que es soledad
Hace calor

Sube la temperatura se deshace
La piel hace tiempo
Se me antoja que te quiero más
De lo que vas a merecer

Y es que hace calor
Rebosa en la cocina
Brota en un manantial
Glaciares y fuentes

Se escurren y hierven vapor
En el aire así debe ser
Es el fuego en la lumbre de mis entrañas
Es la fiebre que va a crecer

Pero hasta el diablo se las apaña
Para calmar su sed, pero a tu lado
El calor pasará y es que sospecho

Que esto no es calor
Que es soledad hace calor, tengo calor
Es el fuego en la lumbre de mis entrañas
Es la fiebre de que va a crecer

Pero hasta el diablo se las apaña
Para calmar su sed dime algo suave
Algo que no me haga enrojecer
Dime algo fresco

Y que sea diferente
Esta vez hace calor
Y se derriten las palabras
Como el humo al arder hace calor

Nieve que se funde
El agua empieza a correr
Glaciares y fuentes
Se escurren y hierven vapor

Pretenders,"Anger and lust my senses running amok 
Bewildered and deluded, have I been hit by a truck? 
When my tongue lay inside his lip 
Felt like the time in the womb 
But I woke up with a headache that split my skull 
Alone in the room

I got down on the floor with my head pressed between my knees 
Under the bed with my teeth sunk into my own flesh 
I said ""baby, oh sweetheart""

Lust turns to anger, a kiss to a slug 
Something was sticky on your shag rug, look at the tile 
I remember the way he groaned and moved with an animal skill 
I rubbed my face in the sweat that ran down his chest 
It was all very run of the mill 
But I noticed his scent started to change somehow 
His face went berserk and the veins bulged on his brow 
I said ""baby, oh sweetheart""

Bondage to lust, abuse of facility 
Blackmailed emotions confuse the demon and devotee 
I was sure his intentions were sweet 
And that mine was as well 
But a wish is a shot in the dark 
When your coin's down the well

I got out in the hall with my teeth in my head 
Up to my neck and I said, said, said dead 
I said ""baby, oh sweetheart""",Up the Neck
