Gregor Meyle,"In jeder Sekunde atmest du ein.
Du musst nicht dran denken, es läuft von allein und du lebst
Du lebst, bist du stirbst
Zeit heilt die Wunden und Wasser wäscht rein.
Dein Herz wird dich lenken und gut zu dir sein und du stehst
Du stehst, bist du fällst

Du brauchst niemand der dir zeigt, wie leicht man lebt
Du brauchst niemand der dir sagt, worum es geht
Du bist niemand der verliert und untergeht
Es gibt niemand der dein Leben für dich lebt

Du wandelst im dunkeln, nur du siehst das Licht
Du glaubst an die Liebe und fürchtest dich nicht, du bist frei
Frei bist du stirbst.
Gebor’n in der Zukunft fliegst du mit der Zeit
Nichts kann dich halten, du bist längst bereit, für den Tag
Der Tag der dich liebt.

Du brauchst niemand der dir zeigt, wie leicht man lebt
Du brauchst niemand der dir sagt, worum es geht
Du bist niemand der verliert und untergeht
Es gibt niemand der dein Leben für dich lebt
Für dich lebt, oh

Oh, oh

Du brauchst niemand der dir zeigt, wie leicht man lebt
Du brauchst niemand der dir sagt, worum es geht
Du bist niemand der verliert und untergeht
Es gibt niemand der dein Leben für dich lebt
Für dich lebt, oh",Niemand
Gregor Meyle,"Immer wenn der Regen kommt, 
Denk ich übers Leben nach 
Ich kann durch die Wolken sehen, 
Doch meine Welt bleibt unsichtbar 
Du träumst von der Ewigkeit, 
Doch ewig hält es nie zu zweit 
Suchst du noch den Weg zu mir? 
Wenn du ihn findest, zeig ihn mir

Ich weiß, dass du mich leiden kannst 
Und dein Herz jetzt auf den Tischen tanzt 
Doch du musst mich jetzt verstehen, 
Denn ich bin nicht der Richtige für dich

Es tut mir Leid für dich 
Doch nur so bin ich 
Es tut mir Leid für dich 
Doch nur so bin ich

Ich kann unsere Sterne sehen, 
Und bis an meine Grenzen gehen, 
Doch weiter als die Wirklichkeit 
Schaffen wir’s „nie mehr“ ? zu zweit 
Ich wünschte, ich könnt anders sein 
Doch lieber bleibe ich allein, 
Als uns nur noch am Boden zu sehen 
Als uns nur auf die Nerven zu gehen.

Ich weiß, dass du mich leiden kannst 
Und dein Herz jetzt auf den Tischen tanzt 
Doch du musst mich jetzt verstehen, 
Denn ich bin nicht der Richtige für dich

Es tut mir Leid für dich 
Doch nur so bin ich 
Es tut mir Leid für dich 
Doch nur so bin ich

Immer wenn der Regen kommt 
Denk ich übers Leben nach",So Bin Ich
Gregor Meyle,"Ich hab' mir mein Leben ganz anders vorgestellt,
Viel größer und viel weiter, als es ist.
Hab' gelernt zu leben in dieser seltsamen Welt,
In der der große Fisch den kleinen einfach frisst.
Hab' versucht nicht so zu sein, nichts zu achten und nichts zu bereuhen.
Doch ich hab' es auch schon getan, wenn ich ehrlich bin.

Denn es ist so leicht,
Einfach wegzusehen, sich wegzudrehen.
Denn es ist so verdammt leicht,
Ganz einfach weiterzugehen, sich nicht umzudrehen.

Denn es ist so leicht,
Einfach wegzusehen, sich wegzudrehen.
Denn es ist so verdammt leicht,
Ganz einfach weiterzugehen, sich nicht umzudrehen.

Mein Weg war nicht einfach, tausend mal hab' ich ihn verloren.
Hab' gekämpft, bin gescheitert, war am Boden zerstört, bin neu geboren.
Hab versucht nicht so zu sein, nichts zu achten und nicht zu bereuhen.
Doch ich hab es auch schon getan, wenn ich ehrlich bin.

Denn es ist so leicht,
Einfach wegzusehen, sich wegzudrehen.
Denn es ist so verdammt leicht,
Ganz einfach weiterzugehen, sich nicht umzudrehen.

Denn es ist so leicht,
Einfach wegzusehen, sich wegzudrehen.
Denn es ist so verdammt leicht,
Ganz einfach weiterzugehen, sich nicht umzudrehen.

Es ist so leicht, es ist so leicht,
Es ist so leicht, so verdammt leicht.

Es ist so leicht, es ist so leicht,
Es ist so leicht, so verdammt leicht.

Es ist so leicht, es ist so leicht,
Es ist so leicht, so verdammt leicht.

Es ist so leicht, es ist so leicht,
Es ist so leicht, so verdammt leicht.",So Leicht
Gregor Meyle,"Es gibt Tage, da bist du
Unerreichbar von mir fort
Es gibt Nächte, ab und zu
Da sind wir am selben Ort
Du wohnst in meiner Zukunft
Du lebst in meinem Jetzt, so soll es sein

Ich weiß, dass es dir gut geht,
Viel besser ohne mich
Ich weiß, dass mir der Mut fehlt
Zu kämpfen um dich
Doch ich schenk dir diesen Leichtsinn
Mein Herz und dieses Lied, so soll es sein

Ich will zurück zu dir
Doch ich weiß es ist zu spät
Ich muss zurück zu dir
Doch ich weiß, dass das nicht geht
Denn ich steh mir selbst im Weg

Wenn du atmest, hör ich zu
Wenn du schläfst bin ich bei dir
Wenn ich wach bin, ab und zu
Dann fliegt mein Herz zu dir
Ich kann froh sein, dass ich lebe
Nur doch was soll das ohne dich
Wieso muss das sein?

Ich will zurück zu dir
Doch ich weiß es ist zu spät
Ich muss zurück zu dir oh
Doch ich weiß, dass das nicht geht
Ich will zurück zu dir
Doch ich weiß es ist zu spät
Ich muss zurück zu dir oh
Doch ich weiß, dass das nicht geht
Denn ich steh mir selbst im Weg
Nein, ich weiß, dass das nicht geht
Denn ich steh mir selbst im Weg

Gregor Meyle,"Wo willst du hin? 
Versuchst du zu fliehen? 
Es macht keinen Sinn, 
sich zu bemühen.

Die Zeit holt dich ein, 
wohin du auch gehst. 
Du bist zu klein, 
um drüberzustehen.

Du hast den Glauben an Liebe verloren 
und du träumst nicht mehr. 
Dein Herz ist im letzten Winter erfroren 
und du spürst nichts mehr.

Willst du so sein? 
Willst du so bleiben? 
Willst du das sein? 
Oder soll ich dich befreien?

Riechst du das Meer? 
Spürst du den Wind? 
Du atmest zu schwer, 
und dein Leben verrinnt.

Du hast den Glauben an Liebe verloren 
und du träumst nicht mehr 
Dein Herz ist im letzten Winter erfroren 
und du spürst nichts mehr

Willst du so sein? 
Willst du so bleiben? 
Willst du das sein? 
Oder soll ich dich befreien?


Ich kämpf` für dich weiter, 
ich lass dich nicht fallen. 
Von sonnig bis heiter 
werd` ich für dich sein.

Ich glaub`an die Liebe, 
das reicht für uns zwei 
Ich weiß , was du durchmachst. 
Ich kann dich befreien.

Willst du so sein? 
Willst du so bleiben? 
Willst du das sein? 
Oder soll ich dich befreien? Befreien, Befreien?",Soll Ich Dich Befreien

Gregor Meyle,"Ist alles so groß
Ist alles zu laut
Ist alles zu weit
Nichts mehr vertraut
Ist das, was du suchst
Verloren gegangen 
Ich find's für dich

Was immer du tust
Was immer du willst
Was immer du fühlst

Und die Welt da draußen,
Brauch uns nicht
Sie hält auch nie, 
Was sie verspricht
Doch ich brauch dich
Jetzt hier bei mir

Erst, wenn du lachst
Hör ich auf zu reden
Erst, wenn du liebst
Werd ich mich ergeben

Kann ich dich auffangen

Gregor Meyle,"Vor mir liegt das blaue Meer
Ich schau den Wolken hinterher 
Und ich weiß nicht was ich will

Ich bin zufrieden mit mir selbst
Ich bin gern auf dieser Welt 
Und ich weiß, ich brauch nicht viel

Alles andere kommt mit der Zeit
Für alles andere bin ich bereit

Das beste kommt noch 
Das weiss ich genau 
Solang du warten kannst 
Aus jedem Fehler wird man schlau 
Das beste kommt noch 
Das weiß ich genau

Ich hab schon ziemlich viel erreicht 
Bin schon ganz schön weit gereist 
Hab schon einiges gesehn 
Es gibt wenig zu verzeihen

Ich hass es undankbar zu sein 
Doch ich bleib nur ungern stehn

Alles andere kommt mit der Zeit 
Für alles andre bin ich bereit

Das Beste kommt noch 
Das weiss ich genau 
Solang du warten kannst 
Aus jedem Fehler wird man schlau 
Das beste kommt noch

Gregor Meyle,"Die Chance 
Mitten in der Nacht verließ er sein zu haus 
Er gab seiner Frau den letzten Kuss 
Er wusste, dass er stark sein muss
Die Kinder schliefen fest
Er nahm sich ein Stück Brot
Sie sahen seine Tränen nicht
Er schloss die Tür fest hinter sich
Zum Treffpunkt war‘s noch weit
Jeder Schritt war hart für ihn
Es tat ihm so leid
Die Zweifel fraßen ihn fast auf
Er wünscht sich die Zeit
Als es für ihn noch Arbeit gab
Sorglosigkeit

Alles was er brauchte war ne Chance
Alles was er wollte war ne Chance
Alles was er brauchte war ne Chance
Alles was er wollte war ne Chance

Im LKW versteckt
Gab‘s kein Weg mehr zurück
3 Tage durch das ganze Land
Hungri, durstig, angespannt
Sah das Meer zum ersten Mal
Es hat ihn seltsam fasziniert
Wasser bis zum Horizont
Seine Angst hatte ihn bis jetzt verschont
Es war nass kalt und eng
Er gehörte nicht an diesen Ort
Was wäre wenn
Er niemals mehr nach Hause käm
Die Männer waren streng
Keiner sprach ein einziges Wort
Er dachte nur

Alles was ich brauche is ne Chance
Alles was ich will ist eine Chance
Alles was ich brauche is ne Chance
Alles was ich will ist eine Chance

Jeder Mensch ist ebenbürtig
Jeder ist der Liebe würdig
Glück ist das wonach wir streben
Jeder Mensch ist ebenbürtig
Jeder ist der Liebe würdig
Glück ist das wonach wir streben

Gregor Meyle,"Komm schon 
Es ist nicht alles ungerecht 
Und es scheint so 
Als wärst du noch zutiefst verletzt

Wenn mans genau nimmt geht's dir gut 
Und du liebst doch was du tust 
Du erwartest viel zu viel 
Denn der Weg ist das Ziel

Und alles bekommt man nie 
Und jeder fragt sich 
Wie man reich, berühmt und schön wird

Ich bin dein Herz 
Ich schlag tief in dir 
Hör nie auf zu träumen, denn so 
Sprichst du mit mir

Ich bin ganz bestimmt immer ehrlich zu dir 
Und das wichtigste ist 
Behalt dein Lächeln im Gesicht

Hier spricht dein Herz 
Hier spricht dein Herz 
(Hm Hm Hm Hm Yeah)

Komm schon 
Der rote Teppich stand dir nie so gut 
Und es scheint so 
Als fließt in dir noch böses Blut

Hüte dich vor dem Entschluss 
Zu dem du dich zwingen musst 
Sonst spürst du den kalten Kuss 
Denn ohne Liebe kommt der Frust 
Und dir vergeht die Lust 
Und eigentlich liegt dir die ganze Welt zu Füßen

Ich bin dein Herz 
Ich schlag tief in dir 
Hör nie auf zu träumen, denn so 
Sprichst du mit mir

im Stich wenn du haderst, weil du nichts mehr erwartest

Gregor Meyle,"Liebe gibt's an jedem Ort, 
für manche bleibst ein fremdes Wort.
Liebe kann geduldig sein
wer keine kriegt wird schnell gemein.
Und ohne Sie wär's ziemlich langweilig!

Liebe macht nicht klar im Kopf. 
Zu jedem Deckel gibt's nen Topf.
Liebe kann ein Drama sein,
doch Liebe ist es zu verzeih'n.
Und ohne sie passiert nichts mehr.

Doch sag es mir, Baby bitte sprich mit mir
sei doch wieder lieb zu mir 
und schau mich nicht so an.
Sag es mir, Baby bitte sprich mit mir,
sei doch wieder lieb zu mir 
und schau mich nicht so an.

Liebe kommt zur falschen Zeit.
Wer keine kriegt geht oft zu weit.
Liebe bleibt ein Risiko.
Wer niemals liebt verpasst die Show.
Und ohne sie wärs's ziemlich langweilig.

Liebe raubt uns den Verstand.
Nicht selten bleibt sie unerkannt.
Liebe strahlt aus deim Gesicht.
Wer nicht drum kämpft verdient sie nicht.
Und ohne sie passiert nix mehr.

Doch sag es mir, Baby bitte sprich
mit mir, sei doch wieder lieb zu mir
und schau mich nicht so an.
Oh sag es mir, Baby bitte sprich mit mir,
sei doch wieder lieb zu mir

Gregor Meyle,"Immer wenn wir glauben, dass wir angekommen sind 
Immer wenn wir funkeln, wie die Augen eines Kindes 
Immer wenn wir stolz sind auf uns selbst 
Uns ein schwerer Stein vom Herzen fällt 
Immer wenn wir Liebe in uns spüren, sehen wir das Licht.

Immer wenn wir glauben, dass es keinen Weg mehr gibt 
Immer wenn die Wahrheit unsere Hoffnung fast besiegt 
Immer wenn der Schmerz die Herzen trifft 
Unsere ganze Welt zusammenbricht 
Immer wenn die Wut das Licht erstickt, sehen wir es nicht

Wenn all das was vor dir liegt auf einmal 'nen Sinn ergibt 
Dann scheint durch die Dunkelheit am Ende das Licht 
Denn du bist das Licht

Manchmal brauchen wir 'n bisschen Zeit um zu verstehen 
Oder sind wir nur noch nicht bereit den Weg zu gehen. 
Es genügt ein Funke für den Brand 
Zu oft wird zuviel von dir verlangt 
Warum hast du es noch nicht erkannt? Du bist das Licht!

Wenn all das was vor dir liegt auf einmal 'nen Sinn ergibt 
Dann scheint durch die Dunkelheit am Ende das Licht 
(Oh-Ho!) 
Denn du bist das Licht

Es brennt in uns ein Leben lang 
Macht sichtbar, wer wir wirklich sind 
Und glaubst du nichts mehr irgendwann,

Geh wohin dein Herz dich bringt!

Wenn all das was vor dir liegt auf einmal 'nen Sinn ergibt 
Dann scheint durch die Dunkelheit am Ende das Licht

Du siehst so schön aus, wenn du lachst 
Oder wenn du vor Glück weinst

Deine Augen 
Leuchten 
So funkelnd 
(Oh!) 
Dann sehen wir das Licht! 
(Mh!) 
Am Ende das Licht!",Du bist das Licht

I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose...

Don't give up - you're not beaten yet
Don't give up - I know you can make it good
	
Though I saw it all around
Never thought I could be affected
Thought that we'd be the last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
	
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

Don't give up - you still have us
Don't give up - we don't need much of anything
Don't give up -'cause somewhere 
There's a place
Where we belong...

Rest your head
You worry too much
It's gonna be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up...

Got to walk out of here
I can't take it anymore
Gonna stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
And whatever may go
That river's flow

Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no-one needs

Don't give up - no reason to be ashamed
Don't give up - you still have us

I thought that I heard you laughing 
I thought that I heard you sing 
I think I thought I saw you try 

Every whisper 
Of every waking hour I'm 
Choosing my confessions 
Trying to keep an eye on you 
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool 
Oh no, I said too much 
I set it up

Come flailing around

I thought that I heard you sing 
I think I thought I saw you try

Gregorian,"Are you going to Scarborough Fair 
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme 
Remember me to one who lives there 
She once was a true love of mine. 

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt 
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme 
Without no seams nor needle work 
Then she'll be a true love of mine. 

Tell her to find me an acre of land 
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme 
Between the salt water and the sea strands 
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

You, oh so gay, with Parisian demands, you can run-around
And your view of society screws up my mind like you'll never know
Lead me away, come inside, see my mind in kaleidoscope

Somebody called me Sebastian
Love me sublime, mangle my mind, do it in style,
So we all know, oh yeah!

Gregorian,"Hello darkness, my old friend, 
I've come to talk with you again, 
Because a vision softly creeping, 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping, 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 
Still remains 
Within the sound of silence. 
In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone, 
'Neath the halo of a street lamp, 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light 
That split the night 
And touched the sound of silence. 

And in the naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people, maybe more. 
People talking without speaking, 
People hearing without listening, 
People writing songs that voices never share 
And no one dare 
Disturb the sound of silence. 

'Fools' said I, 'You do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows. 
Hear my words that I might teach you, 
Take my arms that I might reach you.' 
But my words like silent raindrops fell, 
And echoed 
In the wells of silence 

And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made. 
And the sign flashed out its warning, 
In the words that it was forming. 
And the sign said, 'The words of the prophets 

are written on the subway walls 
And tenement halls.' 
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Alone in the night as the daylight brings, 
A cold, empty silence. 
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky, 
It fades to the distance.

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

For some reason I can't explain

Somehow I have to find.

Where is my friend when I need you most?

I wait for you and you come around.
And the world's alive with the sound
Of kids on the street outside.

When you walk into the room,
You pull me close and we start to move.
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love.

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth.
They say in heaven love comes first.
We'll make heaven a place on earth.
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth.

When I feel alone, I reach for you
And you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea I hear your voice
And it carries me

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living.
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore.

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth.
They say in heaven love comes first.
We'll make heaven a place on earth.
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth.

In this world we're just beginning

Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore.

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?

Gregorian,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine

Supressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time can not erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

Gregorian,"Hush now don't cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over, or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run to in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize it and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly, you hear and see
This magic new dimension

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you, in silent lucidity

Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Hug me

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you, in silent lucidity",Silent Lucidity

Don't try to fly, dear God, you might not come down. 
Jesus came down from Heaven to earth

And said he was the saviour of us all 
He told great stories of the Lord 
And said he was the saviour of us all 
For this they we killed him, 
Nailed him up high 
He rose again as if to ask us why 
Then he ascended in top the sky 
As if to say in God alone you soar 
As if to say in God alone we fly.

Gregorian,"The clock struck midnight,
Then through my sleeping,
I heard a tapping at my door.
I looked but nothing
Lay in the darkness
And so I turned inside once more.
To my amazement,
There stood the raven.
Whose shadow hung above my door.
Then through the silence,
It spoke the one word
That I shall hear forever more:
Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven:
Nevermore!
And still the raven
Remains in my room
No matter how much I implore.
No words can soothe him;
No prayer remove him.
And I must hear forever more:
Quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Nevermore! Nevermore! Nevermore! Never!

You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide the tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun

And bookcases up to the sky
The promises I made myself, I wouldn't land it
'Cause it's a bad habit, they don't help

The nights are crazy but when I try to sleep
All I see is grinding teeth and soft skin
You're biting into my mess
And I bask in the pain that comes to pass

The heart wants us to fall in love
Everyone I know wants to fall in love
Love once got me in the gut
There was no real fight, it tore me up

And the heart once says
To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love
There was no real fight, it tore me up

You were perfect, the perfect surprise
Till your hands crept up my chest
And gained a stronghold on my neck
You said baby it's true, I'm leaving you

It's been a strong year
With a bright, bright sun
And from here the past looks cold
And the future seems a promising one

But I won't mind no time spent to save me
Just trying to be good to the people who raised me
And glide through life without a meaning

On trails torn up between clouds and turf

And I want to visit on the wind
And I want to visit on the wind

Now time like an ocean knows tide like a notion
To toss about the house and lose inside the couch
And piles of our thoughts run miles in the dark
Just tryin' to get home

Age by age we rhyme with our seasons
Rehearsed routines still turning and returning

Now time like an ocean knows tide like a notion
To toss about the house and lose inside the couch
And piles of our thoughts run miles in the dark

Those demons had their faces bright as gold
They came and shook my hand, fingers crossed behind their back
Those demons had their faces bright as gold

So i’m sittin' by my lonesome in the light
I’m sittin' by my lonesome in the light
I don’t know what I see, that light plays tricks on me
I’m sittin' by my lonesome in the light

And I don't know what's ahead up comin' next
The wind shakes me feet, rattles my head
There’s no tellin' home, just a sign up all alone
Sayin' oh, oh elizabeth

And that season came in quiet with the rain
And loving you was just like raising cain
It was strong and bound for glory, and cursed with a thousand stories
Oh that season came in quiet with the rain

So i’m pickin' up the pieces where I went wrong
Oh i’m pickin' up the pieces where I went wrong
And there’s somethin' so familiar, like an old bedtime song
I’m pickin' up the pieces where I went wrong",Raising Cain

The past, she is haunted, the future is laced

For too long now

This could be all that we know
Of love and all

Well you were a dancer and I was a rag
The song in my head, well was all that I had
Hope was a letter I never could send
Well love was a country we couldn’t defend

And through the carnival we watch them go round and round
All we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns

And everything just found their place it seemed

There's an old folk song on the radio
Sounding thin and dark and haunted
There's a bag of weed in the back beneath the books

And she can’t stand the sight of this cul de sac
Like an old crow, king of the lamp-post
And this window hasn’t been this clean since it last rained

Well she pictures up a different day
Driving west to east l.a
And there ain't no sign of a dime, but hey
Anyone can dream…anyone can dream

And all the college girls come in when the bars let out and they’re hungry
Making such a mess, evelyn just talks trash, as she’s sweeping up

We were running through the autumn leaves
A couple kids just wearing out our jeans, running
Mary she's our autumn queen

Gregory Alan Isakov,"I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me
The room filled up with mosquitoes
They heard that my body was free

And I took the dust of a long sleepless night
And I put it in your little shoe
And I must confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through

And I showed my heart to the doctor
He said, 'you just have to quit'
Then he wrote himself a prescription
And your name was mentioned in it

Then he locked himself in a library shelf
With the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse
And his practice is all in a ruin

I once knew a saint who had loved you
I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers
Was to tarnish the golden rule

And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone, but out here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool

An Eskimo showed me a movie
He'd recently taken of you

Yeah she pulls on this heart like she pulls on the sea

And you came on strong like some running wave
And your beauty left me broke and hungry
Left me begging to the birds for a bone or an offering
Left me saying nothin', nothin', like I always say

While you were sleeping I was the turning the dials
And I walled up your kingdom with radio wires
And the bells of the choir came in low and rumbling

Just trading crimes
While the tune-smith packed a lunch
He’s headed down the coastline

Together we always seemed to be
We were just good friends
Then something deep within
My heart kept a-tellin' me

Be closer together
For you might love one another
You'll be closer together
For you might love one another

You must take [?] to your heart
And never let her get too far apart
She's the girl that you love
She's the girl that you love

Closer together, closer together
For the first time I
Looked in to her eyes
Was a-long before I realized
Sincere and true
They said 'I love you'
And at last her heart was saying too

Be closer together
For you might love one another
You'll be closer together
For you might love one another

You've got to take [?] to your heart
And never let her get too far apart
She's the girl that you love

I have been waiting for
all you give to me
you've opened my eyes
and showed me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
but in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart

Qu’on peut avoir dans notre enfance

Sweeping dust and memories beneath the carpet that we purchased
Somewhere on some cool retreat
Somewhere in Africa somewhere

I've been trying to catch my breath 
From the illusion that I lost it
When you left me

I've been checking for the weather and the time
I'm like a bag that's dropped 
And drifting in the wind that blows from hurricanes 
That comes just after grey clouds fill my eyes

I've been trying to find my footing 
On the slopes of the illusion that I lost it
When you left me

Like bare feet on hot concrete, we have come to some division
Based on pain from bad decisions
Just like clothespins snapped by wild winds
Sometimes you can't hold on to love that never dies

I've been planting all the flowers that you like
With the hope that will take root and smell the blossoms
When the wind blows as we sit deep in the garden sipping tea
As I watch you looking at me 

I've been trying to find reality
A grip on the illusion that I lost you
When you left me",Illusion

Have you anything to say to me?
Can you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Is there any valley green with spring
Where my heart can go a-journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane?

And
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard
The music in the night?
Wonderful music
Faint as the will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy
Serenading the moon

Love was the rule of the day.
Nothing more nothing less
Than to give your friend your best.
There's much more story that I could tell
To make the hardest hearts swell.

This is the story when love was king.

When love was king, do you remember?
When love was king, when love was king
I remember when love was king

He ruled the land, with his fist unfurled
With open arms for the world
Of hungry children, first he'd think
To pull their lives from the brink
When love was king
He rescued souls lost in the sea
In drifting vessel he would hear their plea
When love was king
He threw a line before they'd sink
And gave the thirsty ones a drink

He told the meek that they should try
To use the sword to smite the lie
That being king is for the weak
When love was king
I pray the lord these words we seek

When love was king
He showed respect for every man
Regardless of their skin or clan
Beside him stood his mighty queen
and equal force wise and keen
He lifted up the underneath
And all his wealth he did bequeath
To those who toiled with out a gain
SO they would remember his reign

So seek someplace to call your own
Right next to this mighty shinning throne

The paparazzi know our names
They know like fashion

You need that flare and so you wear
Big blue fur and feathered hair
To fit your skin

Think I better let it go
Think I better let it go
'Cause I'm thinking I'm last year's runway passion
No longer in fashion

With how you dress

Greta Keller,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?

That never did come true?

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Stranger to a smile
Trying to fight the tears
Missing by a mile

On that yesterday
When you warned me not to throw your love away

If you could only see me now
Goodbye is not so easy now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains

If you could hear me now
Your heart would come undone

Hey little sister shot gun!

It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

(I let you go for so long)
I've been away for so long

Gretchen,"You were the one to walk away
Said you didn't love me
Left me alone to feel the pain of a broken family

Confusion, Delusion, no it didn't need to be that way
I won't be pretending that I haven't got a lot to say

I don't want to see another photograph
And I don't want to talk about the way it used to be
'cause I barely can stand the sound... to hear you laugh

I just have to know the reason why you breathe

How can you even stand to see?
Your reflection knowing
All of the lies you told to me
You kept the story going

Then one day when you played
You threw me away like a broken toy
You left me to answer
The questions of a little boy

I don't want to see another photograph
And I don't want to talk about the way it used to be
'cause I barely can stand the sound... to hear you laugh

I just have to know the reason why you breath



",Breathe
Gretchen,"So many times I've waited, for you to recognize my face
But you don't seem to notice I'm alive

I want to know you --- why do you run?
I'd never hurt you --- but still you run

Your voice is music to me; I hang on every word you say
My worlds complete the moment you speak my name

I want to know you --- why do you run?
I'd never hurt you --- but still you run

Let me, love you
Please don't turn and walk away
I want to, be near you
But you're wasting time

I want to know you --- why do you run?
I'd never hurt you --- but still you run



",Know You
Gretchen Gould,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

And I will comfort you like a mother while you rest

I am peace that shatters all your secret fears
I am holy, I am wise

Oh weary, tired, and worn
Let out your sighs 
And drop that heavy load you hold, 'cause mine is light

When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

I can feel you breathe
Washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove

Never learned to read or write so well, she was just a farmer's kid

She heard the clanging of the mission bell
And she vowed that she'd be good

But the world goes round and it's hard enough to stand your ground
There's always someone tryin' to keep you down in a border town

Mamacita said you can't go down, stay away from the white man's world
She drew the line at the edge of town for her little, dark-haired girl
But Carmelita she had other plans and her life had just begun
She ran away with a black-eyed man and he left her with a black-eyed son

But the world goes round and it's hard enough to stand your ground
There's always someone tryin' to keep you down in a border town

Carmelita, now she's settlin' down, she's not so free and wild
She rides a bus, all the way across town to love somebody else's child
Shows up each morning, right on time and at six o'clock, she's gone
She keeps her distance and she toes the line

Nobody breathin' down my neck, I just drive around all day

I got a room with a view

Don't have much education but I know how people are
You'd be surprised what you can learn from the front seat of a car

Gretchen Peters,"Eddie's first wife was a vision
The bride on the wedding cake
Thought he was the luckiest man alive
That was his first mistake

He'd found him the perfect woman
That's what he thought he had
Found him a girl just like the girl
Who married dear old dad

Where have you gone, Betty Crocker?
Come back, Brigitte Bardot, Eddie was in for a shocker
How was he supposed to know
About the secret life of Eddie's first wife?

Eddie came home one evening
She met him at the door with a drink
Said I got something to tell you, baby
But you better sit down I think

She said I found me somebody
Someone who rocks my world
I'm in love and I don't care who knows it
And she's a good old fashioned girl

Where have you gone, Betty Crocker?
Come back, Brigitte Bardot, Eddie was in for a shocker
How was he supposed to know
About the secret life of Eddie's first wife?

She might be the marryin' kind

Pawned the pearls around my neck and kissed it all goodbye
Gassed my car and fixed my flat
Told that boy just where it's at and had a real good cry

I don't know if I'm fallin' or flyin'
I don't know if I'm laughin' or cryin'
I don't know if I'm hurtin' or healin'
I don't know how I'm feelin' but it sure feels good

These are things that set me free and keep me movin' on

I wanna look into your eyes
I wanna watch these broken dreams turn into memories

Don't wanna think about tomorrow

Sometimes you've been unkind

All the way to the county line
Heard a sidewalk sermon and a blind man preach
And written on a cardboard sign

Revival, revival, this lamb has gone astray
Revival, revival, gonna wash your sins away

Now I have done everything that I know to do
But you left a hole that I just can't fill
And if God can forgive me, baby, why can't you?
But I guess you never will

Revival, revival, this lamb has gone astray

And I would give anything just to see your face
Just to see your face again

Carryin' a dream and a road map deep in my American heart
But where's them mountain majesties? Where's those waves of grain?
Billboards from sea to shining sea, man, it ain't the same

I've been searching for the promised land
But it's just another neon, come on, roadside stand
Little tin toys that fall apart, that's all they got here
I come all this way to find my heart all I get is souvenirs

They got Mount Rushmore on a cup, everybody needs one of those
For a dollar more they'll fill it up, you can drink out of Lincoln's nose
They got the hard rock T-shirts, they got Elvis too
Sooner or later mark my words, they're gonna get you

But it's just another neon come-on roadside stand
Little tin toys that fall apart, that's all they got here

I thought we had a love that's true, not a close facsimile
Now I don't want your dime store ring turns my finger green
I don't want your dimestore love I want the real thing

These long, long nights play tricks upon the mind

What I thought was freedom was just aimlessness

Waiting for Amelia and the light is fadin' fast
C'mon Amelia, you have got this battle won
You know that only angels fly into the sun

I have never learned to wait
I yearn for skies my heart can't navigate
It's been so long since I held someone
And all my dreams of freedom they don't keep me warm

Waiting for Amelia and the light is fadin' fast
C'mon Amelia, you have got this battle won

Maybe the night was dark
And the sky was a starry dome
Maybe she lost her way
Or maybe she just didn't wanna come home

Is it over? Are you sorry?
Could it be a blessing in disguise?

And the cars on the freeway are whistling by
Like a cool goodbye

I've learned my lesson, I've been to school
You were the teacher, I was the fool

And I ain't got no anchor to hold on to
To keep from drowning in you

While I'm trying to stay afloat
You bring the rain and thunder
I bring the boat

Mary's glowin' by the dashboard light
Giving benediction to the lost
Something's stirring in the black, black night
I guess, every blessing has its cost

Do you remember graduation day?
I burned like fire beneath your kiss
Said, you could see us somewhere far away
Oh, but baby, not like this

I heard a siren and a shot ring out
But my mind would not believe
My plates expired and my taillight's out
And you've got something up your sleeve

I'm doin' ninety toward the county line
And the rain is comin' down
Said, you were onto something big this time

Nobody stops here anymore, they're only passin' through
Nothin' much to look at and there's nothing here to do
Just an old newspaper blowin' at my feet
Down on Main Street

Old Mr. Arnold finally sold the store
He started out on main street back before the war
He says business wasn't booming anyway
He says he and that old neighborhood have seen their better day

But he remembers how it was in 1945
When they marched out all the boys who made it home alive
And the girls were throwing roses at their feet
Down on Main Street

Down on Main Street, they're sellin' memories real low
Goin' out of business, everything must go

Like old forgotten faces without names
The storefronts and the sidewalks and the boarded window frames
And there's the corner record store
Where I discovered rock n' roll so many years before

But now I walk these empty streets and I listen for that sound
I listen for the rhythm in the heart of this old town
I listen for the slow and steady beat

I'll rearrange the shadows and the light

And I'll paint the starry nights

Like a ghost beyond the grave

Not living breathing flesh and blood
But dust upon a shelf

The friends and neighbors offering their regrets

A white lace dress for when I turn thirteen
And a bright red stain that wouldn't quite come clean
Walking by the football field, trying out my sex appeal
While all around the leaves are turning brown

He tore at my new raincoat in the dark
And all that I could think about
Was getting through and getting out
And how the night could fall without a sound

And my air conditioner don't work in this late August heat

Can't shake it loose can't get myself out of bed
And I'm tired of the TV news think I'll read a book instead

I been waitin' tables all summer at this place on the strip
Bustin' all kinds of business for two bucks and tips
I got a long list of reasons and a very short fuse
A half pack of cigarettes and a room full of blues
And I'm tired of these summer people with their summer tattoos

'Cause i think somebody's got to come clean
About this whole thing somehow

Don't mean nothin' as far as i can see

Of people leaving their messes for me to clean up

Swaying to the beat of a rusty radio
All that I can hear another late night symphony
The sound of traffic moving like an undertow

This town can't get no rest
Everybody thinks that they know best
They're either building it up or they're tearing it down
They can't seem to love it like it is, this town

All I wanna do tonight is kiss you in the street
Swaying to the beat of a rusty radio
All I wanna do is feel your arms around me too
Pullin' on my body like an undertow

This town is a lot like me
A little coat of paint and some TLC
And she'll light right up if you come around
You know that you never wanna leave this town

Gretchen Peters,"Children playin’, night is fallin’
Stars are winkin’ in the sky
Supper’s cookin’, mama’s callin’
But they’re not ready to say goodbye

While you’ve been sleepin’, I’ve been walkin’
I’ve been restless but I swear I don’t know why
I’m not cryin’, it’s just rainin’
I’m not ready to say goodbye

We are dreamers, slowly wakin’
We are shootin’ stars across a midnight sky
We are strangers in the makin’
We’re not ready to say goodbye

I’m no angel, I’m no demon
I'm no Christian but I ain’t afraid to die
I’m not leavin', I’m just goin'
'Cause you’re not ready to say goodbye

Ghosts and angels on my street now
Yes and there but for the grace of God, go I
So draw the curtain, light the lamp now
'Cause I’m not ready to say goodbye
You’re not ready to say goodbye
We’re not ready

",To Say Goodbye
Gretchen Peters,"What babe is this who cries no tears?
Who brought you forth, who laid you here?
A little child, a tiny thing
How can it be they call you king?

A baby in a manger born
So early on a Christmas morn
The angels sang, the heavens smiled
And here you are, December child

December child, so full of grace
So humbly born, so highly praised
They bring you gifts, they follow stars
They say they know who you really are

But you are still your mother's son
They say you are the Chosen One
The kings and queens, the rank and file
All know your name, December child

While the shepherds watch they're keeping
We lie sleeping

December child, the world awaits
And soon enough you'll meet your fate
Your mother's arms will soon grow cold
And yearn for her sweet babe to hold

And all the world, in all its need
Will soon be pulling at your sleeve
So give her time, a little while
And go to sleep, December child

",December Child
Gretchen Peters,"Deep in December, the year has grown old
The days have grown dark and the nights have turned cold
And the hurts that we harbor, the debts that we owe
Are sleeping down under a blanket of snow

It covers the grasses, the bench in the park
The scars in the earth where man's made his mark
And high in the sky there's an unearthly glow
Like a miracle sent to delight us below

And all our cares seem immaterial
Beneath a light so ethereal
As if all our wrongs could be made right
Oh darling, under the northern lights

We wound and we're wounded by the tiniest acts
We run from our ghosts and we cover our tracks
And we try to make up for mistakes that we've made
With presents and parties and Christmas parades

But I'm tired of the running, I'm taking my leave
And the fire's burning low on this cold Christmas Eve
All that I have is this evening to spend
All that I want is to hold you again

To linger awhile in the mystery
To know the gift that's been given me
Just to lie beside you this Christmas night
Oh darling, under the northern lights

",Northern Lights
Gretchen Peters,"Joseph walked to Bethlehem
Found no room there at the inn
And knowing not what was to be
He lay beside her patiently
Waitin' on Mary

The shepherds watched, the stars grew bright
The angels said, ""It's gonna be alright
Just have some faith, just wait and see
A miracle will come to be""
Waitin' on Mary

And after all these centuries
The world still has its refugees
The losers in the human race
But with the most amazing grace
They're waitin' on Mary

Faraway on some dark hill
There are faithful waiting still
Who have no hope but still believe
Maybe tonight is Christmas eve
And they're waitin' on Mary

",Waitin' on Mary
Gretchen Peters,"There are ghosts out in the rain tonight
High up in those ancient trees
Lord, I've given up without a fight
Another blind fool on his knees
And all the Gods that I've abandoned

Begin to speak in simple tongues
Lord, suddenly I've come to know
There are no roads left to run
Now it's the hour of dogs a-barking

That's what the old ones used to say
It's first light or it's sundown
Before the children cease their play
When the mountains glow like mission wine

And turn gray like a Spanish roan
Ten thousand eyes will stop to worship
And turn away and head on home
She is reaching out her arms tonight

Lord, my poverty is real
I pray roses shall rain down on me
From Guadalupe on her hill
But who am I to doubt these mysteries
Cured in centuries of blood and candle smoke
I am the least of all your pilgrims here

I am most in need of hope
She appeared to Juan Diego
She left her image on his cape
Five hundred years of sorrow

Have not destroyed their deepest faith
But here I am your ragged disbeliever
Old doubting Thomas drowns in tears
As I watched your church sink through the earth

Like a heart worn down through fear
She is reaching out her arms tonight
Lord, my poverty is real
I pray roses shall rain down on me
From Guadalupe on her hill

But who am I to doubt these mysteries
Cured in centuries of blood and candle smoke
I am the least of all your pilgrims here
But I am most in need of hope
I am the least of all your pilgrims here

Gretchen Phillips,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again
",Together Again
Gretchen Phillips,"Why must I meet you in a secret rendezvous?
Why must we steal away to steal a kiss or two?
Why must we wait to do the things we want to do?
Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh why?

Wish we didn't have to meet secretly
Wish we didn't have to kiss secretly
Wish we didn't have to be afraid
To show the world that we're in love

Till we have the right to meet openly
Till we have the right to kiss openly
We'll just have to be content to be in love secretly

Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh why?

Wish we didn't have to meet secretly
Wish we didn't have to kiss secretly
Wish we didn't have to be afraid
To show the world that we're in love

Till we have the right to meet openly
Till we have the right to kiss openly
We'll just have to be content to be in love secretly

Why must we wait until we're dancing cheek to cheek?
To whisper all the words of love we long to speak?
Why must our love be like a game of hide-and-seek?

Gretchen Richie,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Lying with his lady

And everything's just fine
On his side of the bed

Those big brown eyes are cryin
From the things he never says

Gretchen Wilson,"When it's all over but the shoutin'
When God the Father's done his final accounting 
And I find out that I made the cut
Boys I'm gonna get me a chariot
Yeah a big gold eagle on the hood
Trans Am chariot

Gonna find my great granddaddy
That peace pipe smokin' Cherokee
Gonna get him all schooled 
In them mags and struts
Then we gonna drag us a chariot
Yeah a big gold eagle painted on the hood chariot

Sure hope Samson ain't no law dog
Redneck you better out run him
Damn sure don't want to get caught

We was all hopped up on new wine
And mama's gonna kill me if I get 
Kicked out of the choir
But you just gotta run them chariots

Now here's a little story happened long ago
One day Ezekiel went out for a stroll
Walkin' by the river low and behold
Down came 4 angels in a Cadillac gold 
He said ""swing down sweet chariot come on and give me a ride""
So they scooped em up, the rig was souped up, man it had TV's inside
Ol' Zeke was surprised cause his eyes had seen beyond
His wildest dreams, He'd go on to see a thousand things

We'll paint that number eight on the driver's side 
That's how old I was when I gave Jesus my life
I stepped right up and got washed in the blood
Just a little kid singin' 'bout a chariot

Everybody thought of me as one of the boys
Because I'd run with the crowd that was tough
At 15 I was tendin' Big O's Bar
Singing till two a.m. for a half full tip jar
Spent my youth singing truth payin' dues

I'm the biggest thing that ever came from my hometown,
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let 'em down
If it's the last thing I do before they lay me in the ground
You know I'm gonna make Pocahontas proud

I knocked on every door on music row
They looked down at me and said girl go back home you ain't got what we need in this town
They couldn't whup the fightin' side of me
You know where I come from we don't give up easily
Over night it took all my life to be found

Gretchen Wilson,"When it's all over but the shoutin'
When God the Father's done his final accounting 
And I find out that I made the cut
Boys I'm gonna get me a chariot
Yeah a big gold eagle on the hood
Trans Am chariot

Gonna find my great granddaddy
That peace pipe smokin' Cherokee
Gonna get him all schooled 
In them mags and struts
Then we gonna drag us a chariot

Sure hope Samson ain't no law dog
Redneck you better out run him
Damn sure don't want to get caught
Crime what crime
We was all hopped up on new wine
And mama's gonna kill me if I get 
Kicked out of the choir
But you just gotta run them chariots

Now here's a little story happened long ago
One day Ezekiel went out for a stroll
Walkin' by the river low and behold
Down came 4 angels in a Cadillac gold 
He said ""swing down sweet chariot come on and give me a ride""
So they scooped em up, the rig was souped up, man it had TV's inside
Ol' Zeke was surprised cause his eyes had seen beyond
His wildest dreams, He'd go on to see a thousand things

We'll paint that number eight on the driver's side 
That's how old I was when I gave Jesus my life
I stepped right up and got washed in the blood
Just a little kid singin' 'bout a chariot

Gretchen Wilson,"Hey

Well, five of the PM rolls around
There's a little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers
And a jukebox song ringing in my ears
The next you know the bartender's pouring
Shots are flowing, got me stoning
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment

I'm all jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies when you're all jacked up

It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock
What the hell I'll have one more shot
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I might of must of gone a little too far
'Cause a big ol' girl walked outta the blue
Ten foot two with a bad attitude
Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth
I guess I had it coming I deserved the due

'Cause I was all jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up

Don't have to go home but you can't stay here
That's what they said when I got my last beer
Oh my God, it's two o'clock,
I can't find my keys and my truck's locked

So I grabbed a tire tool and I broke my window
Hurt my elbow, got me in though
Two foot later backed into the light pole
All the town folk got a good show

All jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your truck when you're all jacked up

Jacked up
(All jacked up, all jacked up)

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up

And I don't know when
And I don't know where to begin

Shots are flowing, got me stoned man
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment

I'm all jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies when you're all jacked up

It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock
?What the hell, I'll have one more shot?
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far

'Cause a big old girl walked outta the blue
10 foot 2 with a bad attitude
Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth
I guess I had it coming, I deserved the due

'Cause I was all jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up

?Don't have to go home, but you can't stay here?

Oh my God, it's 2 o'clock
I can't find my keys and my truck's locked

Grey,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Mama caught us smilin' as she took me by the hand.
She said ""What your young heart sees in him, I'll never understand. But it's a sorry life to live lovin' a sharecroppin' man.""

His back is nearly broken by the time his day is through
And his dirty hands are empty when he brings them home to you.
So don't come runnin' back here when his soil turns to sand.
It's a sorry life to live lovin' a sharecroppin' man.

On a cold November eve'nin 'cross the bitter plains we ran
Far from that old shotgun and our copper weddin' bands.
And you whispered ""Life without you girl, it's more than I can stand, but it's a sorry life to live lovin' a sharecroppin' man.""

My back nearly broken by the time my day is through
And my dirty hands are empty when I bring them home to you.
So remember that I warned you when our soil turns to sand.
It's a sorry life to live lovin' a sharecroppin' man.

On our youngest daughter's finger sets a simple copper band.
Boy we worked last Summer's gone and asked her for her hand.
She said ""Watchin' you and Daddy through the years, I understand
That I wanna live my life lovin' a sharecroppin' man.""

He'd sooner break his back than break the promise made to you.
And his empty hands are dirty, but his heart is pure and true.
And the Good Lord guides His steady plow through soil or through sand.
The sweetest life to live's lovin' a sharecroppin' man.

Perched on a bridge 
That stretches farther than most 
Something reminds me 
How I think of you now 
When I'm alone

Within all the craziness 
I need to survive 
Despite the retracing 
Of a past I can't find 
In words I write 
 
And now as I recall them 
The parts I wish I had forgotten 
If only I could draw them 
Be sure it wouldn't be 
The way it is now

Have you noticed there's a presence in the air 
How's it feel to be there?

Been some time but still it feels like yesterday last thing 
I remember you were on your way off to find what we had forgotten 
Crazy 
Can't recall a moment when you left my mind never looking forward or too far behind 
Never gave a thought to stopping 
 
And the words you said they carried my days and now here you are and still I'm amazed 
 
That there's a kind of love 
That makes you want to stay 
There's a kind of love 
That makes you want to stay awake all night 
 
Hey you 
Feeling like a stranger in the circumstance feeling like you need to close your eyes and dance giving up your heart to the voices 
Some said 
We had all been blinded by the run-around lost amid the chaos in a way we found 
There were patterns deep in our choices 
 
And I never saw how once I was here 
I could ever see myself in that fear 
 
But there's a kind of love 
That makes your vision clear, so clear 
And there's a kind of love 
That makes you want to stay awake all night 
 
In the middle of the night 
In a place we call our own, 
When there's time to settle back 
When we're alone 
 
So stop me when 
More or less I find it always feels the same chasing off illusions in my circle game 
At the times when I lose my balance 
 
And I go real deep to find what I can 
And I go real deep to find where I am 
 
But there's a kind of love 
That makes you understand this life 
And there's a kind of love 
That makes your vision clear, so clear 
And there's a kind of love 
That makes you want to stay awake all night",Kind of Love

It’s only fate some things are meant to be
Who needs to know
Looking for reasons when life casts a stone
Leaving me screaming inside

So much for love
Lost you in over again
Covered in blood
You had the sense to stay calm and contained
There's no sense in crying my blues for my brain
Leaving me standing outside

Show me a sign
Something that’s shining, like
Tears in your eyes
You can surprise me
Because I want to be
The one you return to
You just believe you’re not alone in the world

It’s only fate
It’s everything you bargained for
It’s only fate
It’s everything you bargained for
It’s only fate
It’s everything you bargained for

Greyhound,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the kids would call me patches
Papa used to kid me about it
Of course deep down inside
He was thinkin' he had done all he could do
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
But he did wonders when the time got bad
A little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the plow
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later papa passed away
I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was dad's strictest rule
So every morning 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave this but I wanted a home
But I always remembered what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best, It's up to you to do the rest
:
But then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through, Cause
Everyday I had to work the fields
Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of a family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to face another day
Though years have passed and all the kids are gone
I aimed to take my mama to a brand new home
God knows people that I shed a tear
My daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin', ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you
I could still hear papa when he'd say
Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest"".",Patches

And I step outside
It's close to midnight
And the fog is in
And the street lights

With the sound of Big Ben
It reminded me
It was only yesterday
When we first met in that cafe
And our worlds entwined.

Oh don't you know?
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops now, baby
I'm ready to go.
Oh don't you know?
It doesn't matter if the sun is going down on me
You light my world
My little London girl.

Sunglasses on
You take me to Camden Town
As you share your headphones
With the Kinks and the Rolling Stones.

As you walk around
In your leather boots
All the boys are staring
But you're not caring
'Cause you're so rock and roll (so rock and roll)
Whoa

Greyson Chance,"Sat there on the dock
With both my feet grazing the water
I could taste the island beaches on my tongue
Splashes on the rocks

Got me imagining the palm trees
And the shorelines spotted up with coconuts
Tidal waves and hurricanes
Broken anchors, crashing planes

Keep washing me up on your sand
Take my hand
I wanna be stranded on this island with you
I wanna be stranded on this island for two

And I hope it's somewhere far
Where only we are
Stranded on your heart
Spend my free time thinking

How your tears aren't made for drinking
But I'm thirsty for what you're keeping inside
Losing track of time what seems like weeks
Is only hours

I can't wait until that moment when you're mine
Even though we're not the same
Different in every way
I can't help but smile when you say

Take my hand
I wanna be stranded on this island with you
I wanna be stranded on this island for two
And I hope it's somewhere far

Where only we are
Stranded on your heart
I won't call S.O.S
No message in a bottle

No signaling with smoke
I'm trying to get home
If I can't be with you
I'd rather be alone

I wanna be stranded on this island with you
I wanna be stranded on this island for two
And I hope it's somewhere far
Where only we are

Stranded on your heart
And I hope it's somewhere far
Where only we are
Stranded on your heart

Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky

Close your sad, sad eyes we will be safe and sound

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on a summer train

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Seems we are a thousand miles away from last night
As you sigh in my ear, kiss the rain goodbye

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see

And the windows are crying, but this train is flying us all through the rain, I fear
And the sky is getting brighter with every mile
And it all seems clear

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky

It's freedoms beautiful sound

Not sure where I want to go tonight

Chase the demons out tonight

I see it in your face that you don't care about the broken heart I taste.

Griffin,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.

He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be

And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony

Making love by candlelight,

So write another lover's song, 
And drink some more wine,

I keep comin' at you
Lyrical raptures capture you
Only if your soul is ready
I comin' after you
Bodysnatchin' you and dismantlin' your crew
It's Tennesseeans wit nouns and verbs agreein'
Wit higher being
Sendin' messages
Spreadin' through your chest it's just
Blessings from conception rearrangin' your perception
This planetary lyricist
At least that's what the Source quotes
Resurrectin' hip-hop on a higher plateau
We crept low
Movin' slow with intention to blow
Carry loads of flows for those who doubt and didn't know
And circumstances deep in crime intense seat back in the
Center of my body structure
Ready to rupture
At times I sat back to think again and again
How I broke the golden rule by doing business with friends
My mind traveled paths on a search to be free
Suspicion felt corruption had a piece of Gotee
Success had me stressed like the G-Mo-be	
Cee-Lo's verse on ""Thought Process"" was the description of me
But them again I caught the vision that was given within
As a child rockin' mirrors wishin' I was Rakim
On stage
Engagin' state to state
Rampages, airplay, videos, and stretch black limos
The dream that seemed impossible
But now I'm doin' show for thousands
Savin' souls through least
Lacin' spirits concrete
And the belief that I inject on beats
Deplete
God's word that is instilled in me
To the masses 'til I feel my mission here is complete
And it's essential
That this is my life after mental

(Chorus) 2X
Mental's over
It's the dawn of a new day
Out with the old
Different messages to relay
Mental's gone
It's time to do it up again
The past is behind
Life after will begin

[Coffee]
Now let's talk
Gather to see who can talk the most noise on an album
You the listeners decide the outcome
How come
It's our second record without Mental... gettin' the recognition it deserved
This Christian industry is gettin' on my nerve
Serves us right for thinkin' they would believe our vision
Give us proper support
But when it got hectic
Mission abort
Poor sports is what they called us
Now that's crazy
All cause we wanted to be pushed
Not ambushed and pulled
Off the shelves for being ourselves
Unlike no one else
But still they made comparisons
How Un-American
Strivin' in the midst of warzones and red tape
They try to hold us back
But it's the black in me that makes me create
Colorful collages hang on the walls of garages
No mirages
What you see is what you get
Ah, that's that hit
Ah shoots you know I'm in cohoots
With the higher power
Sprinkle me with spirital showers
Drinks anyone
Pourin' glasses of Tang
If you're drinkin' from me, the flavor's lemon meringue
I'ma be me despite the shackles of the industry
Bump they last chances
God engineers my circumstances
And hey
I think I like that
He's the one I confine in
Never dealin' shady and lettin' the enemy slide in
This rap game is all I got to maintain
It keeps me sane in my life

Excursion 'cause diversion
Splurging nouns and verbs converted
Phrases phrases from my pages
Ballers call us verbal players

Crumbs to bricks we flip to layers
Stack to cake and serve in prayer
Hopes and dreams we must believe
Dope emcees from birth are these

No need for paper chasing cheese
Blessed with riches heavenly
Daily hate is breedin' jealousy
Using my lifestyle as an album concept

But soon enough the truth reveals
The lies you claim in your rep
'Cause we the realest not in the sense
Of claiming hardest on wax
What you see is what you get

We only hard on them facts
Best believe we the illest
'Cause you bouncing to beat created an illustrated
By some c Christian emcee

My style is universal
School of rhyme university instituting my profession
With lessons through diversity
Could never be pinpointed by beats

'Cause beats could never define one
Who's anointed in speech and likewise spiritually
Through intervention words capture me and rapture me
Minds of blinded individuals close minded
Residuals don't make you and emcee

Just because your budgets big
And your video looks Hollywood
Don't make you better than me
Time is ticking, people changing
Taste the real from fake appeal

I'm from the 'ville
I thought you knew we was titans
Don't clash with Nash
Not on a mission to prove but was commissioned to move
Not for flashy style or Image but because God said it was finished

Grits,"The more I meditate, I hesitate to even show face
The more I hesitate, I contemplate my life is a waste
My spirit levitates to take a glance at truth of its grace
As my flesh emulates every act of disgrace

So deceptive in perception of its hunger and greed
Maliciously relentless to fulfill whatever it needs
Undisciplined, rebellious, no regard for righteousness
Ever since it tasted death, he desires nothing less

Too many nights I spent in tears, drowning in fear
I'm never making it, through all the time I spend faking it
My soul is proving capability and prone that when alone
Without the father?s consecration flesh manipulates

Constantly, continual battles might end up being goes through
Why do I do the things I know I'm not supposed to
Why don't I do the things that I know I should do
Who's to blame except me and me alone, I found my enemies home

What could it inhibit a habit the dark corners lurking
Demonic principalities when other evils working
You can't escape fate, allow what's in your heart to tailgate
You're your only cell mate to unlock what locked the jail gate

What could it inhibit a habit the dark corners lurking
Demonic principalities when other evils working
You can't escape fate, allow what's in your heart to tailgate
You're your only cell mate to unlock what locked the jail gate

Somewhere inside the crevice, I long to face the limits
The premise is death for execution of flesh
Past no authority and so control the tree of life
I chose, taking shape of its mold

Indulge in fruit too, whatever you do, I do, we crew
Give it unto a city, evil, not for me, you, you
Doom can't loom if I no longer give it room zoom a zoom
You're free to explode for miles with a loud boom

Perfect tightly I hold with no attention
To foe toe to toe and low to low, flow to flow I stand firm
Learn to discern, circumstances are changed
Do a dance with death, till my soul?s last breath

When I'm at my hardest can salvage my image tarnish
What can make me whole again the blood of Jesus
Freed a deed down the slanted hill I ski high speed
Manage to get bandaged when I got tree

What could it inhibit a habit the dark corners lurking
Demonic principalities when other evils working
You can't escape fate, allow what's in your heart to tailgate
You're your only cell mate to unlock what locked the jail gate

What lies in a man?s soul

I found that evil doesn't have a face, so let alone a place
It just lingers in the void over an open space searching out a victim
To nuzzle up against, take under its wing and habit, then reign supreme
Think it control, it slowly conquers a man?s soul

Behold real TV, even real is when it takes its toll
Unfold, with those punches, you don't have to roll
Toss yourself at the cross, and escape the devil
More vibrant than the radiant redhead

With flashlights, the fingers, the illuminated words of Christ
Put that on ice for a spell, pray tell, how in the world
Do you excel in the glory of God, and then rebel
Letting death valley give you a fear falling down

It will only breed your fears when you allow it to hang around
So get down, hit knees where prayers don't cease
What's lurking probably shouldn't even be working

Plots for spots to roll rovers
Controlling blocks and lots on top
Where I was charted to be
But failing to see truth
Behind the lies of eyes
Handling G's
They squeeze until my soul was unloaded
Holding to nothing
But folded bills
Concealed like weapons looking to kill
My mind filled
With thrills and pleasures
Life could offer
Walked amongst the dead
Laid to rest in a coffin
Nocturnal destiny
Leading to my eternity
Hourly concerning me
Yet I wasn't yearned
To be all of what
His calling said to be
And bred to be
Actually I thought it was all about me
Took for granted what was handed by the unseen
Invested all my time and effort
Building see
Appealing to my desires
And lustful feelings
Thinking I could make it by the grace of God
Straight disgrace the face of God

My chronological line
Was designed by the divine
At times my minds vision
Was found to be blind
Sometimes I felt like
I lived life with eyes sown up
Nothing but sounds and voices
Surrounding me within the blackness
Walking cautiously
Only God guiding me
Abiding in me
Independently I fail myself
Images of my history
Is haunting at times
Taunting at times
Confronted most times
How is spent mines
Tempted frequently
To feed the need
Of past relations
Found struggling attaining more scars
Through inner battling
Wondering will I make it
Plundered through ways to shake it
Remembering what was written
My only method
To break it
Being locked in this life
Connected to Christ
His will and my destiny
My reason and purpose for birth in life
For a minute was contended
With whatever was presented
If it's sin
I was in it
In the flesh represented
Suppressing truth in which was hid
In my spirit ignoring guidance
Rebelling against His voice
With choices in pure defiance
Then I asked myself
Was it designed to be mine
If so
I found I wasted the blessing
Of precious time

[Chorus]

Perpetrated me
A serious fraud
So don't applaud
Feeling sawed in two
Part of me scattered all about
With the other half
Appearing and domineering
My steering
Mentality of bangbanger
To topple my dopple ganger
With excessive force
No doubting
While re-routing course bouting
What might endorse
Waters of hell, just to prevail
""Don't fail""
The voice saying magically
What tragedy entail
The terror won't take my will
To conquer error
When the time has passed and gone
The ending will be
""Me at home""
I brought it to you plainly
(Just like that)
Don't let it pass you by
(Just like that)
Time is ticking away

Uh-huh uh-huh

Whoâ€™d have thought my babe was on an island of her own
Had me smiling on the phone same page different time zones
Godâ€™s a real character painting caricatures of christ
And his love for the church enduring the pain 'cause it hurts
When I saw you I went bezerk insane goin looney and cartooney
So sue me you was a vision of beauty truly
Thinking of all the charm to inflect upon my behalf
Forgive me donâ€™t mean to stare but your hair is down to your calf
Tell me about yourself your culture is polynesian
I love when the breeds be mixin our blueprint is in ephesians
Instantaneously cultures collided decided weâ€™d ride it
Spent time in prayer separately so we wouldnâ€™t have to hide it
Fictitious image brought to life reflection of love
Carefully inspected with gloves so fragile my darling was
And I ain't need miss cleo to re-assure me that I got her
Scored big like the opening week of harry potter

In the beginning I hesitated debated within my soul
Wrestling with my feelings of knowing if you was sent
Enduring the distance alone being content
Longing your presence believing that we was meant
Submitted my intent I was truly convinced
You're the women in my life I couldnâ€™t breathe without
And I wrote this so you wouldnâ€™t have any doubt
Or misunderstanding of what my love is really about
Cause from here on out baby its all about us
And from here on out I want to build on trust
Cause the union we got ain't no comparing any other

But that ain't what its built for

In the heart of a man
And many angels of light
In disguise destroying man

So most chose to refuse

Replace it with lies
Use ignorance as an excuse

It's hard to conceive
What the mind can't comprehend
And harder to believe
What the eyes can't understand

For a sure foundation

I'm an animal covered with hair insides mechanical
Guardin' my heart like I'm botanical
I'm snatchin' satans mandible

I damned him at best with random access
Forever banished when he left his lies vanished
Standing in the midst of chaos
Hours of praying and fasting began to pay off
At times like these can't take a day off

What I compete with I get street with
My strange language bone crushing anguish
Pain can't be quenched or vanquished
My anger rise up its ludicrous the way I throw dem bows
And swell his eyes up, ain't that cute

The honey pot that money got his hand in
It's funny how he think he got it on lock, he just a stand in

Moved to the heat
Got used to the flame

Rhymes so meaty like jambalaya
Got truth for hire
Can you stand the fire
To see you come alive that's my desire now

Boy looka here
Have you ever heard a dead man talk before
You ever seen a dead man walk before
You ever heard dead man lock the flow
Like these before

Persist to twist brains with rhymes, only God can explain
Attain divine intervention if your attentions arrested
Imprisoned and in position to listen to lessons given

Gotta make moves steadily, heavily bruising these dudes
We got the gift, but abuse tools misleading these youths see
My birthright is light in the darkness of night
To lead the lost paying the price of sacrificing my life

I've been sittin' and contemplating waiting anxiously peeking
Perception of these releases embracing the deeper reasons
Of timing and perfect season believing this thing is bigger
Than faces and sound scan reaching for the completion

Of purpose in promised land watchin' behind the curtain
For certain the game is hurtin' looking for some solution

Refusing to look at life a livin' for forward movement

Oh Lordy, you don' said too much
My slightest touch is a cobra clutch

Let it be known, we are the epitomy of strange and bizarre
Switchin' up and change our repertoire
Come discover who we are, wreaking havoc on Satan's mavericks
Through a labyrinth filled with nooks and crannies

An elite group called the factors
We like the X-Men so uncanny, imagine looking
Up seeing the plastered ceiling cracking, it ain't because
We broke, we lost our minds for God provoked and crazy actin'

Rollin' down hills 'cause life's a hastle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle

The joy of new birth and the pain of growing up
The bliss between giving my all and giving up
The highs and lows, paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze trying to ease my woes

In this world of sin, clothes to thin to fend

Through rhyme concentrated
Word use administration
And abrasive education

Sixth sense illumination
On reconciliation
Put the cross placement
With the cross over placement

So cautiously
I approach the mic without apostasy
It's costing me
Every proper due from fellow emcees

But these be
More than just rhymes and punch lines to me
Seriously we have no time for playing lyrically
At least we don't and that's a money back guarantee

'Cause people need 
More than entertainment from the industry
So many lives
Depending on lies

So too many die
'Cause too many high
And not many try
To live a life beyond self

Chasing status and wealth
Using excuses how you came up
For records to sell
The stories you tell

Done been told in so many ways
The only difference
Is your platinum shackles and iced out chains
So ignorantly

You keep them loving mentel slavery
They want to be free
But you ignore responsibility
Ignorantly

You keep them loving mental slavery
They want to be free

I thought I'd take a minute I hope I didn't catch you by surprise
I got a lesson learner fact or fiction swoop through your demise
Open eyes and givin' clear vision the windows broken from
The pain of livin' here wishin'

You could survive with those who gave lives
Avoid the cracks and moats of new age turncoats
And modern day cut throats
What makes it shroom blossom and boom a murmer in a gossipin' room

Offerin' a diminishin' gas face rememberin' who in last place

And keep you twisted and locked like dreads do
Who said you wasn't gonna feel the heat of the rays

But anyways man it's funny how the sight of such a beautiful day
Can deliver you joy and bring pain in the same way
Like blessin' with the same mouth
While cursin' in the same breathe

Or livin' life dyin' death, so deceived to the eye
How red blood is blue and rainbows are see through
Its all to teach you that you can't depend on me
It's Like drivin' a Benz 20 inch rims drop top six with the tank on E

While putting Nashville all on the brain
With a twist of the mid south twang

And take control and break the mold
Kick the doors and spit the flows

With gold grills and twenty wheels
On Jefferson at Mary ribs

Been round the world done seen a lot
To all the boys out on the block
Got love for y'all for real dog

And show the way from where I stay

The only one in existence is you
No one's resistant to you
You and only you and you
Seem like a dream on the screen
Tantalize and titillate
Video girl of the world

She was slightly dressed
Out to impress, ready to party
Gettin casted for tha club scenes dyin to shake her body
To get on tha set
She compromised for tha dollas
Dancin freaky with tha rappers obsessed with poppin collers
Bought some hair and nails
Found some dudes that rap
While she's rockin tha tiny shorts and tha shirt from baby gap
Misinformed adolescent
She was teenage old
Never told of her inner goal
When she was wrongfully clothed
Just a jewel that got appraised by unqualified guys
They lied, shotload, don't kno her worth in God's eyes
Fellas after tha flesh, they ain't goin' see wat I'm gettin
'Cause they measure every girl by these video women

I'm sick of all they constant bouncin then they say
We disrespectful 'cause we crave em with our instant
Pouncin the money drive em to mishaps and under
They thongs lie decay and collapse no morals perhaps
The scenery's pretty the suns shining it's nice out
A pretty girl freakin on a pimp who'd knock her lights out

Gangsta with gold fronts and the girl he's advancin on
Would rather run him over with the truck she's dancing on
And he'd be hurt up pretty badly I must say word up
It ain't over bone is third up
Don't debate it I know they hate being affiliated
To this world they created with facades that leave you devastated

The glamorous life price for your souls rest
Simple mentality in a world complex
Star studded reality 5 minutes or less
Broken dreams and ambitions lost with respect
She was an innocent queen with rubber bands and berets
Young diva runnin things commanding every step
Then the pace picked up and she learned to be fast
Short skirt tight clothes good spirit turned bad
Hollywood caught a glimpse of your beauty untamed
At the cost you played whatever price you paid
Through away your identity even changed your name
In your world of fame child you need to be shamed
In tha world of fame

body-body Anybody
I need to rationalize
Anybody see the passion in my eyes?

is often times triflin, throwin me a curve
Seem a little life been getting a little blurred
Lately my wife's been praying for me, word.

but who wants to give up what they want for what they need
A lotta things are promises, a lot are true indead
Some of ya'll ain't hearin me, let me bring you up to speed

Maybe the album will flop

Untapped potential
Unstable mental

So you puffin puffin til you see the stars
Cuttin cuttin and you hide the scares
Poppin poppin til the pills are gone
You drink the last drop til you in the zone

used and abused
bruised and confused
I'm gonna tell the truth
Ain't no substitute
That's ever gonna fufill the need inside you

He left and came back
Flowed the powers sin and death alike
You can have life and get more abudant
No more questions, cap the wonderin

When I start, I master the art of getting down to the heart
And set apart to spark emotion at the slightest sound
It's probably one of the realest topics ever spoke upon
Speech that God will impeach
Swallow the chunks which you choke upon
I'm gifted, I know it, still was I wandering in the path
They tell me, ""Boy, you're a star, sign me your autograph'

This can't be it, though mind gone staring into space
Sorry, where was I' Thoughts gone without a trace
Was the love of my life, hip-hop guided my wife
A combination of the three that would probably me nice
After doing suffice, I break the ice with device
And take advice that comes with the price of rolling the dice

Releasin' pressure like these woofers in the back of my seats
And speakin' clearer than these tweeters when I'm over these beats

In purpose of breakin' curses
With persecutional surface keep tryin' to
Put us in hearses it seems

It's part of the plans of God reachin' man

Understand so many searchin', understand so many hurtin'
Flirtin' with death, and slowly closin' the curtain on hope
To find a better way, a brighter light and darker days
Strike the spark to start, and burn a bluer blaze
Maybe we missed it but um, what if we didn't these drums
Maybe the difference is needed for when it sums

So I dedicated my body to be the sacrifice
Livin' and the beat it copy write written to raise dead
And the course read led by be sweat

Grits,"When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me

Let me conversate to you for a minute
Yo, see I never was one too fond of mirrors
The fear of self was oh so clearer then when I was a knee high
Coming up to breathe life, taking these deep breaths

Climbing up these steep steps to get me to the next stage
Next page, find me, me and you become one from two
Many levels passed, many devils wrestled
Many victories through stressful tasks

Much growing up from a too eventful past
(Slow down)
Had to learn how to save my gas
Owned some Keith Sweat, making it blast
Like game on, making the cash

Got to keep the wisdom and the history of the family's past
So we're robbing old folks and making a dash
I really love making you laugh when you smile
I see the best of me in your eyes

When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me

Seems I fell down again
Now I just await the moment for my world to end
You know I got to get up a lot to live for
Folks waiting in the wings, pulsating to redeem

See how much I really bring the tables will clad us
Disable the fool, the fat, and the fables that got us to the plate
Pitching and batting, working my gums like mad
Hitchhiking the path and biking and striking the apt with math

It'll be like I be opposition to those who rustle leaves
Look at my demeanor, sneeze, you up for the tussle? Please
There's a greater power guiding my step
And ain't ashamed to admit I was preserved and kept

These are moments in time documented and recorded in rhyme
That will sit in the archives as the lives intertwine
So, mirrored images I hope you find, I hope your focus is
As close as you ever get to the end, keep an open mind, player

When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me

I ain't through yet, listen
If I'm the greatest hit then y'all the best of
The perfect illustration of my God's express love
I never been ashamed to ever say that I messed up

Like Usher, my confessions get raw to check love
To gain the respect of my kids indeed
From a boy to a man on bended knees
And that's the reason why I bruise them seeds

To ensure a better life than was given to me
'Cause y'all deserve that, need that
Proceed that which I leave back when I'm gone
And, when I'm gone, y'all take the throne

Lead the family on and keep righting the wrongs
Keep the word of God close 'cause this life ain't long
Stay true to his direction, man, despite these clones
So when they look in your eyes, they see me
And beyond that they see Christ and live that life

When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me",In Your Eyes

Quick to flip if one trip, first we break bread, then break heads
Look at all the people runnin' in fear, scared
Unwilling to hear what's said, hide under the shed
We lyin' in the filth, grown men layin' in our own beds
Pull ourselves up by the bootstraps
Hit them curves, dodge the trap
Don't move at a slow pace
Hand us a mic, we move the whole place
This for each and every hood,
Eighteenth Ave, Wedgewood, South side, clean cutz
Tell me who on it, tell me what you know that's good
Baller blockin' ain't an option, that ain't the purpose of my concoction

And changing lanes cause they
Brought us enough contradiction
So now we change our position yeah, yeah

Bonafide's verse
I'm in LaVergne letting the Chevy burn rubber every turn
Changing lanes while the body swang heavy to the right
Like my life hit them curves swerve as I discern to turn
Back down the one way truth and the life
I learn lessons every block counting blessings like rocks
As I bubble in the struggle in the Classic Caprice
Releasing pressure like these woofers in the back of my seats
And speaking clearer than these tweeters when I'm over these beats
I check the navigation to see what direction to take
To lead a generation headed for collision with fate
On the darker side in the ride looking through rear views
In full speed searching for a you turn to save you hittin' curves

Swerving hittin' curves and serving
Pushing the verses for the curses
Must be broken so we focused
Stop sign and the place can't hold us
Taking them Tennessee corners

Enough contradiction so now
We change our position yeah, yeah",Hittin Curves

You wanna know why we do this

We keep speakin' these verses
In purpose of breakin' curses
With persecutional surface keep tryin' to

Even the churches been blinded for recognizin' our talent
It's part of the plans of God reachin' man

Understand so many searchin', understand so many hurtin'
Flirtin' with death, and slowly closin' the curtain on hope
To find a better way, a brighter light and darker days
Strike the spark to start, and burn a bluer blaze
Maybe we missed it but um, what if we didn't these drums
Maybe the difference is needed for when it sums

So I dedicated my body to be the sacrifice
Livin' and the beat it copy write written to raise dead

Shuttering since expression stole the key to my soul
Struggling since victory presumed control
Battling since the truth infiltrated my mold
Seeking to kind a life in invisible hold
Traveling down a path of a difficult road
Running without a clue of being left astray
Swearing I'm getting closer but really further away

Strong enougfh to wait for the when to weaken the now

How do you account for the platinum rappers with millions of record sales 
Then tell me I ain't good 'cause my record fails

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take score, even playing fields this game
I know when all's said we're the same
If I could I would leave it all be
No chance to move backwards and see

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide

Grizzly Bear,"Those saints in lockstep
All crossed the wasteland
Forever gone
They'll hum and walk along

Plod ever onward
Across some tundra
The light is long
But it's not long before it's gone
Well fine

And it calls you back to mind
At once
At last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please not so long this time

Too young and thoughtless
To calm your memories
I know it's wrong
Just give until it's gone

Some tired mantra
Calls ever onward
Shout it loud
Just make it up somehow
Well alright

And it'll call you back to mind
At once
At last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please not so long
This time

Move on let's face
That all you trust is a cynical phrase
No time no place
When all you hope is that everything breaks
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like

Grizzly Bear,"Under your hard lens
Making too few ends
Meet a middle ground I know, it's defense

Oily hands, slippery slope
Pointed fangs without scope

Understand me
I know
No mistaken time goes
Undeserved without, everything, everyone you know

Even if Will calls
Doesn't mean fall out
We once had a thing I know, vanished

All of my rights lingering
It isn't a place that I've been

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Shouldn't ever be what it was alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if in the end I'm blind
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Couldn't ever be what it was, alright?

Even if we send
Everything from both ends
So little left to, say, do, it depends

If we are past what we keep
All that was promised that was sheathed

No mention of our,
Unchecked accord
I leave this, without regret, or hearsay

Even though I'll move on
Doesn't mean this goes strong
Can't believe it to be undone, finished

Say what you want me to believe
Please show me something I can see

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Wouldn't ever be what it was alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if if in the end I'm blind
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Couldn't ever be what it was, alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if in the end I'm blind",Will Calls [Marfa Demo] [Demo Version]

Looking through my eyes

You've got a lot of girls on your lovers hit parade
But if I could be your number one, well, I don't know what I'll do
I wanna be pulled up to the top I'm so in love with you

On your hit parade of love I know I'll never stop
I've got a long long way to climb before I reach the top
But if I will get there soon I'll really have it made
Then I'll know I'm number one on your lover's hit parade

We can make a go of it everything will turn out good
We can have so much fun we'll really have it made

Gromko.,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love

I am free, flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin'
Freedom flight

A present from you

Groove Armada,"Yo are you a pimp a hustler?
No I'm not.
Are you a man and can you stand alone like a man has to sometimes?
Yes I can.
Are you willing to go out there and save the lives of our children
Even if it means losing your own life?
Yes I am.
I believe you Jeru you're ready.
You've no no nothing to worry about

Now I don't push a Lex
Others had their turn to flex, Jeru is up next
All, these so called players up in the rap game
Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine
It used to be LaToya and, jim hats
But now it's uzis macs and, g-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of goodfellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp free flow
I never knew hustlers, confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned State's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South
Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth
You're a player but only because you be playin' yourself

With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Now these ladies is lookin' pretty from city to city
I refined a few I met, around the country
The nitty gritty, it's all reality, no question
Actual fact like tight jeans cause yeast infections
And sisters with good minds, get no respect when
Their ass is all hangin' out, playin the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted
Black women, make sure you're respected
When niggas is kickin' that old off the wall shit, let em know
From jump, ""Dead it"", you're not ignorant
Knowledge wisdom understanding is the key to wealth
Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself

With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Now, I don't bust a tec, bubble drugs
In the projects, or use mics to sell sex
Niggas, nowadays is all about this
So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always fakin' moves, never, makin' moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breakin' down
You fools, you work all week and give the devil back his loot
For jewels, and the steak on your plate is filled
With chemicals, still, brothers leave brothers
All battered and bruised, on the streets
Won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission
I hope that you listen
Knowledge wisdom and understanding brings, long life
And health, think anything else and ya playin' yaself

So all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
And all those skin tight jeans hon you're playin' yaself
And all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

And all those hooker type wears baby you're playin' yaself

Do it now, do it now,
Day starts with a blast of feedback,
Still spinning from the night that we had,
In the mirror where I brush my teeth at,
There's three more heads, and they watching me back,
Read the bread while I toast my pay check,
One the girls said grins a safe bet,
Phone ringing an I refuse to take it,
want to play dead but I'm on the dayshift,
Stepping out on to the weekly rota,
On the cheap share a seat with Olga,
Train driver said it ain't a joka,
Were gonna be stuck till I fix the motta,
Half hour in-between the stations,
Start jogging when I hit the pavement,
Ran straight into a situation,
Cops say stop cause I ain't Caucasian,
Whole hour on explanation,
Missed the bus an the cab was ancient,
I'm really now in a situation,
When I return to my destination,
I get told to collect my payment,
Clear the desk quick make it vacant,
Now if I ever needed inspiration,
Right about now where I lose my patience,
If I ever needed inspiration,
Right about here's where i lose my patience,

Always said I want a new agenda,
Do it now while I still remember,
Small fish in a mixin' blenda,
All the bets set on the next offenda,
I had enough being nice and anxious,
I keep sweet all the trendy bankers,
I'm looking more than the war the pension,
Under attack of the apprehension,
I'm too transformed to lose the motion,
I might shout now out and open,
All the hanging on the years of hopin',
The same things now feel provoking,
So hot that the tears are smoking,

Watch now my might just crunch the whole thing,
Watch now my might just crunch the whole thing,

Maybe one day you'll be a star

But until then, baby, I'm the one who's crazy

I don't want no romance
I just want the chance to show you that I'm for real

I never said that I would be your everything
But you know that I love you, baby
And it's gonna be such a shame
When you can start living with it

It's not very nice
Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice

Don't go to my baby's head
You know I love you, baby
But you choose this life instead

So just remember what cha momma told you
Before she sent you on your way
She told never ever be too clever
To not see your own mistakes

I'll be here waiting for you
When you come off your trip
And I guess I will always be the one
To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby

I´m with you when sleep cames, I find you in dreams,
Image that you call my name,
Where are you where have you been so long ago,
That my heart remember it all?
Why this life must be so hard with you in my mind?
Please leave my head leave me alone!

I want you to come back and carry me home,
Through thunderstorm lightning and fears.
So I walk through the world and see your face again,
I wish that one day you'll be there.

You'll be there, I wish that one day you'll be there
How I wish that one day you'll be there
You'll be there.",Home

She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky
Shining from high above you shouldn't ask why

Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl

She comes in the morning and the evening she's gone
Every little hour every second you live
Trust in eternity that's what she gives

She talks like Monica and Marianne
She wins in everything that she might do
And she will respect you forever just you

From days dawning deeper in the night. 
I won't kiss you when it means goodbye,

As I walk away and try 
To go back and turn the hands of time. 
Slowly memories hit my mind 
Only part of them revise 
See the reason through this rainy winter night.

All your words, they made me strong.
As I told you, you are wrong.

You told me I could never be a woman living all her dreams.
I guess it's hard for you to see that I'm no longer on my knees.
Thanks for making me that strong and that you made me write this song.
Live your life and keep it on, when you reach me I'll be gone.

Groove Theory,"She
She doesn't need it but she won't try
Try to release it
Cause she thinks she'll die
Depending on it for it she'll lie
It's only a 10 minute high
Eyes
That witnessed a father beat on a mother
Witnessed a system take away her only brother
No one ever said that they loved her
She used to shut her eyes and make the pain subside
But now she's got her 

10 minute high
Just for a little while
She's queen of all the skies
If a hid is bad another one she can buy
Everybody tells her to stop
She would try
But nobody gave her a good reason why

Time has taken it's toll
She looks too old for seventeen
The girl is much too bold
Her heart is cold
When it used to be of gold
Her future has no chance to unfold
She's used her body to get her ways
Is she ashamed of the games she's played
But her best defense is to block out all the pain
But first she buys her

10 minute high
Just for a little while she's floating through the sky
What's she gonna do when she no longer can fly
Is she gonna land on her feet or come down to die
Or is she gonna just break down and cry

When she comes down it all becomes too clear
She knows that someday she should face her fears
But with a touch of reality and over the years
She's forgotten how it feels to be real
It's early morning quiet is the street
She lays in silence the cold cement beneath her feet
She passed away and today's her eighteenth birthday
And all she's left me to say is

She just had her last 10 minute high
Did she contemplate that it would take away her life
She probably knew but she had no reason to fight
There is not a breath on her lips not even a sigh
If only she had known wrong from right
If only she had known
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, girl
Goodbye, bye

Papa said son isn't she fine
Knew he wud be out all night
Though son is only 9 years ond
This is how he's forced 2 spend his time

Watching mother, father, child at play
Wish he cud be a part but it's

On the breath of daddy
Rather smeill it on the breath of
Brothers he don't know or love

Young and untouched
Happy with his window view
But look it's not enough
His dreams are in the gutter
And now he's just a number
All because he wanted 2 belong
All because he wanted 2 belong

So he learned to play the role
Of hustler with no geelings
Thinking ""They'll accept me if I prove that I'm real hard""

But I bet you never guessed that I'd be someone else's wife

Are said to me so sweetly almost every single day

Group 1 Crew,"Everybody's gotta song to sing
So won't you come now and sing with me
It doesn't really matter where you're from or what you've done
Everybody's gotta story to tell
Times we've tried and times we failed
So when you feel like hope is gone keep holding on
This is your song

I've seen days when my life seemed hard and absurd
All of my words died cause they never were heard, like they
Left my mouth then fell to the curb
Got trampled by life and every lesson I've learned
Why do good people leave this earth before their time
It hurts to see death get the best of us first
Yet I know a times comin' when I
Will feel the breeze in my eyes
Dry my tears and fade away in the sky
I see the day my family believes God
And puts away the facade
Of being ok when I know they're not
But I know You're gonna take what I write
Bring this story to life for Your people tonight

Yo everybody has a story
And it needs to be heard
So let it play and resonate
From the hood to the burbs
Whether your sky is grey
And you, been through it all
There's somebody on this earth
That is singing the same song.
Some one across the Pacific
Is stressed from hard labor,
Searching desperately
Cause he's in need of Savior,
Barely ever home
Ignores his kids for the paper
And you'll never know
This same tune's being sung by your neighbor
See age doesn't matter
When life wants to fail you
When your color don't determine
Whether you're destined for failure
We all run to the sun
And hide from the rainy weather
But we make beautiful music
When we all unite together and

I know it's been hard
To make it this far
But God knows your heart
And every need",(Everybody's Gotta) Song to Sing
Group 1 Crew,"Clap, clap ya hands
Clap, clap ya hands

We found a new way to rock it while we doin' our thing
And bringing acapella fellas and my ladies that sing
We clap hands like, what
What we doing is a new form of music
That got you getting out of your seats

A new chapter to life with every show that we rock

All of you with hands up
Everybody we're doing this in the name of
The One who took us from nothing but now we came up.

Now hold on, we rockin' with ya'll move to the song
It's been a while since we gave y'all something to rock on
Two emcees, a vocalist we've been sent on a mission
To reach a people who been tired of the new religion

He's so divine that our rhymes shine solely for Him
And so we kindly remind every person within
You'll get your time in the lime if you find it in Him
And every line that you sign - never sell out to win.

You put the rhythm in my feet so I could dance
Now all I want to do is clap my hands
You put a song in my heart now I can sing
Let this music lead you on
To that place where you belong
Where we could be free to lift him up
And keep it going on and on.

Everybody if you are free come follow me
Everybody if you are free come follow me
Everybody if you are free come follow me
Everybody if you are free come follow me

So underrated
Clap hands for those who made it
And we clap for every single person that's hated
Because we clap for the purpose that is
Greater than us

Group 1 Crew,"Lord I've got a problem
And I can't find the solution- no
I'm seeing all these people
Always searching for improvement
We're always looking for that next thing to satisfy
But all I see is broken hearts, so many sleepless nights
Help me Lord to help them
Heal that empty feeling inside and we say

So if you really want to know who you are
No more wondering and looking so far
The truth is right in front of you- don't let it go
You need to- come back home
Cause everything you need you can find in Him
Faith in yourself to believe again
Don't let all this time just pass you by
You need to- come back home

No I don't wanna be alone no
I can't do it on my own no

I'm lookin' all around the world and trying to find who I am
And realizing more and more that it's the plight of all man
I wanna know what am I here for and where do I stand
Within the scope of all eternity and destiny's plan
I keep replaying all the things they told me when I was young
That I could be whatever I wanted to be
But I'm far from the dreams I had
Cause all I ever seem to feel is bad
I'm trying not to be like dad
Or trying to follow every fad, no

From young to oldest we've all
Asked ourselves the same question
Questioning if there's something more
Then where we all have been
Many have spent their lifetime
In research to find solutions
For the purpose of man-kind
And what's the real reason
Why we're here and why do
We operate the way we do
And why do continue to
Wonder with out any clues
We won't put up no more with
Those who try to make us clones
We find ourselves in the blood
Of He who sits on the throne

So, so lost I just can't find my way
Lord I really need you to help me
So, so lost I just can't find my place",Come Back Home
Group 1 Crew,"Father, I'm going through some heavy things
It seems like this world ain't getting any better
The more we try to get closer to You
The farther we run from Your throne

I've spent so many nights wonderin' when will it end
When will the day come when happiness begins
I'm running the race but it seems too hard to win
I'm sick of mourning my stomach is throwing up in the morning

I'm calling for help and watching it melt away
My heart's been put on display and put away
In many ways, many times I told myself it was ok
And anger was the price that was paid
While these faded dreams just screamed to bring them home

The burden was too heavy I kept running from the throne
I can't take it any longer
I can taste my spirit hunger
God please help me get home

Lord though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I'm not scared cause You're holding my breath
I only fear that I don't have enough time left
To tell the world that there's no time left, Lord please
Lord though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I'm not scared cause You're holding my breath
I only fear that I don't have enough time left
To tell the world that there's no time left

I've come to terms that I'm burning both sides of the rope
And I'm hoping that self-control would kick in before I'm choking off
The sin that be destroying every fiber I got
I need the Lord in every way I'll never make it I'm not
Going back to the way I was before Christ in my life
I couldn't do it I would lose it there's no point to the fight
And I'm writing this song, for the people who don't belong
I pray away the pain you feel from all the things that went wrong
Inside a life that's filled with anger and disappointment
'Cause daddy treated you weaker than all of the other kids
It's annoying and I feel for all of you who wanna give up
You feel stuck I feel the same way Lord help us stay up
You couldn't pay me to abandon the idea of true hope
That I could make it through this life into a place where there's no crying
I'm dying to find You with open arms when I go
Knowing You love me and You waiting to give rest to my soul

Lord I don't know what I'm struggling for
There's go to be more
Than this life I know
But still I'm here fighting to never give up
I find strength in Your love
And You will see me through",Forgive Me
Group 1 Crew,"Yeah...it's been a long time coming y'all...
We dreamin' big...(it's the anthem)... it's Group 1

Yo since the first time this little boy picked up a mic
I've been dreaming for the day that you would hear it and like
Every word that I spit hoping you could relate
To every pain that I've been feeling since I came out the gate
Used to dream about making it a six-figure deal
To show this world that this life that I've been living is real
When I make it I'm gonna do everything that I've promised
By remaining honest and praise to my God I'll pay homage
Take my parents out the stress that they've known all they life
And pay all of their bills never gotta work till they die
No more asking for extensions to avoid late fees
And no more late nights crying by their bed on their knees
No buying food on credit cause we're lacking the funds
No more wondering where all of this money will come from
God will see me to the day when these words breathe life
And manifest the very faith that I continue to write

[Chorus:]
A young kid growing up it was hard to adapt
The world didn't love me so I started to rap it's cause...
I...I have a dream, I...I have a dream
Late nights all alone steady feeling confused
I took a look at my life ain't got nothing to lose it's cause...
I...I have a dream, I...I have a dream

A young girl growing up it was hard to adapt
I felt like every other girl was given life with a map
They seemed to know where they were going
I didn't know jack, I had to play it cool never let them see where I'm at
But baby girl got tired, and I would never see my daddy
All the boys were liars, and they were always getting at me
You see I tried hard to remove all the scars
But I could never see my dreams they were always too far
Dreams of being free dreams of being able to sing
I dreamt a man loved me cause I wasn't scared to be me
I saw a life where every woman had respect for herself
And every little girl would run and ask her mommy for help
I'm not afraid to write a song that exposes my pain
I lived my life backwards so when it poured it rained
But I got through the weather now I'm changing the game
And dreaming remains the source of everything we proclaim

A young buck only knee high
With thoughts of reaching the sky
Rocked ball caps but knew
My crown was a king size
A product of my father's labor
And my mother's reprise
To keep my eyes past the
Blue collar and live wise
I can't lie, I thought of what it would be like
If I compromise
Walk a lie
Spit death instead of life
Choose to cross the line
Keep a foot on both sides
But the dream is too large
For it to be hid inside
My kid's seeds will inherit daddies dreams
Daddies dreams of never having to hustle for the green
Or being a slave to mans work
Just to meet their needs
And mami and papi
Will reap the harvest of my deeds
I paint a path for a generation to come
No longer a peasant or slave
Your own kingdom
I scream freedom
And let it echo through the slums
Rise up pump your fist
And march to the pace of the drum

Group 1 Crew,"I never knew love could be like this
Powerful to protect me through the hard times that always exist
Make the hardest heart break down
Make a person who hates
Love himself so he can love those around
It takes love to forgive everyone
For all the things they've done
It's not easy but the freedom will come
We gotta learn why it is that we here
It's more than loving your life
It's making sure your life is loving your peers
Now if you could just catch my heart
Then we can part from the past
Let the days of the new love start because

Love is a beautiful thing
That brings together people of every generation
Love can heal the pain of a broken world
It's got to start with us
And all it takes is love

Well I've got to make it clear
Love's the reason we are here
We're the object of affection from a God who holds us dear
And every where we go and everything that we do
Every time that we love
It's a reflection of You
Cause You are true love
So make it real in us

Stop holdin' on to the past
So we can bask in the rays
Let the days of the new love last

I didn't see it come
I didn't see it go

I didn't see it go
I never knew a love this before
I'm so glad You found me

And all you need is one to ignite the flame
And if it's so, group one would be the first to say
That we lightin' up this torch and running in loves name
We've searched around the globe and even looked to the stars
Tried to fill this void with money and nice cars
Took advice from songs in the top 10 charts
And never realized that it starts in our hearts

I rock to better define the meaning of hot it's not
Hard to find how these lines take life
Into the form of ya boy that be melting this mic

Without the truth being spoken that the broken can find
I've been down one too many times but I
Wanna blow up like Kanye and touch the sky
So I can teach all my people what it means to fly
And see they life at a height that's parallel to God's eyes
I wanna leave a legacy that's beyond any song

Busy to even want
To know about themselves
Even less the ones they love

Calling your bluff
If you ain't spitting truth
Better check the lines you bust
I can hear the fuss

How about educating minds
With the lines that you rap
Let's consider that we raising the bar
Healing the scars
Injecting an antidote
In those who are called
To bring forth a future
That our seeds can evolve
Into a mindset where they
Can reach for the stars

Yeah we make hits but
We adding our own touch

And we just about to begin
To leave a mark every time
That the record spins

I've been close so many times yet something would lack
From wack songs I moved on and now it's a fact
I'm like a chain see I'm a neckless I can't look back

We can both kick back and have a conversation

Had a head on collision
With fate and I don't know know how
You changed my world made me your home
And no one else allowed
To enter cause you alone inside
Makes it a full full house
No need for a deck of cards
Everything I need you are
You're my bright and shining star
Lets spend forever together
Remember when you were far
Loved me with a broken heart
But since we've made contact
Our eyes have never been apart

I didn't stop to think of what's going on
Outside my window, the world is changing
I can't remember where it all went wrong

A mama's praying that her baby comes home
I see the future of a better place

So I wanna make, make this a place
Where we can forget all the problems of yesterday
Let's make a change for a better today
Let it begin with me, make it reality, I wanna change

I never believed that, that, that things will never change
Cause whenever I look back, back, nothing has stayed the same
Except that all I see are shadows of me, times where
I just fail to believe that faith is not whatever you see
But hoping what it really could be

So we can make a difference if we turn it around
The world is upside down
The revolution starts inside, yeah

Change, make this a place

Where unity can be the brush to paint a better picture

Into something we only dream of

Group 1 Crew,"I see you when I'm staring in my coffee cup
Or when I'm downtown as I wait for the bus
I see you, oh, how I see you
Oh, on the lonely nights when I stare at the stars
And how the trees blow as I walk through the park
And I see you, oh, how I see you

I see you in my mind and every time I wake up
Reminds me of the time when I was trying to find love
And I would, try so hard to show you how good I was
But all I did was prove that it was never enough

'Cause you loved me like I was your sweet buttercup
And I'm addicted to the way that you would never give up
I see us on the cover of our own magazine
We call it ""Life in the arms of a king"" and we would talk about

Everything and anything
And every time that you would sing my heart would ring
So I had to pick up, I'm glad that it was you on the line
'Cause you, got me, got me out of my mind, c'mon

I've seen the highs, I've seen the lows
But where I'm going is a question that I'll never know
But what I know is that you'll always be there for me
That's why I see you in everything

Good friends they come, good friends they go
It's just a product of this crazy world and how it goes
What doesn't change is that you'll always be there for me
That's why I see you in everything

Your energy molded to take its natural form
Tangibly known through a song makes a heart feel at home
A quiet whisper through the breeze in the trees
Is how you let it be shown so I can cherish every moment that is born

My life has been better since I've read your love letters
Stress has gotten light like feathers and your genuine like leather
You made this man walk on a different level
My past is settled, I'm attached like Pinocchio and Gapetto

A masterpiece composed the greatest story ever told
There hasn't been a better headline published in the post
I won't go any where your love won't go
I've been told if it ain't broke leave it alone

I've seen the highs, I've seen the lows
But where I'm going is a question that I'll never know
But what I know is that you'll always be there for me
That's why I see you in everything

Good friends they come, good friends they go
It's just a product of this crazy world and how it goes
What doesn't change is that you'll always be there for me
That's why I see you in everything

You got me falling, got me falling for your love
And now I'm wondering if I'll ever get enough
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
When you're not on my mind
It's so amazing how you're making me feel
When I see you I know that it's real

I've seen the highs, I've seen the lows
But where I'm going is a question that I'll never know
But what I know is that you'll always be there for me
That's why I see you in everything

Good friends they come, good friends they go

To give up his palace 
Now the earth waits for its rightful owner two thousand years ago the 2nd Adam
Told us the kingdom is at hand, died for the sins of man just 
So he can where we rule over the
Land meet every demand while nature waits for kings 
To take a stand so we need to understand we
Can change our circumstances 
The kingdom is therefore we choose when to advance it

Lift up your head is only begun, keep holding on and

You would die for me gladly give your life for me, 
Cry for me, all so I could call you 
When I'm so in need of promises you've spoken, 
My heart was always broken cause
You gave the keys to life 
But in my pride I had them stolen, 
You say that you redeem us 
And bring us to a place 
Where we can see the keys can never be stolen 
They just misplaced and so we
Rise from the ashes, 
Stand before the masses proclaim the victory is ours 
And so we never give up, 
Even though times get hard to understand, 
Its never enough for us to sit back and hope he
Has a plan we gotta stand up 
And face the cold with a boldness 
That is focused on the fact we
Have the keys so just believe there's nothing closed

So many promises you gave, 
And we just turned and walked away

Group 1 Crew,"I've been thinking bout the way I see,
Myself and I just can't understand why I say
All those hurtful things about myself,
My insecurities, they don't seem to just go away
And it's hard for me to understand,
You loving me, through every mistake that I make
I'm so glad that you will never leave,
Keep reminding me, how you see me every day that I wake

I'm so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful uh oh uh oh
I'm so beautiful, so natural, not typical
I'm so beautiful, there's nobody else made like me
I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me

Yes you are
Yes you are
Yes you are
Yes you are
Yes you are
Yes you are

I love the way you made me smile,
Cause it fits my face, it's so wonderful, unbelievable
And every color in my eye is just the perfect shade,
Its so incredible, indescribable
Now you may think I'm not a perfect size or overweight,
But I'm huggable, oh so lovable
Let's put away our silly thoughts,
And fall in love with life,
Cause there's so many reasons for you to smile

I'm so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful uh oh uh oh

(I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me)

That's me, I like a girl who got some confidence, uncommon, but with common sense
Quick to help her mama with the groceries and condiments
Doesn't live fast, but loves life and gives compliments
Someone who I can ask about life and knows what time it is
Never late to meet me even though I always am
Give her some sorry excuse but she always understands
She can take me in some sports basketball was her thang
But at night she throws some heels on but her love is still the same
Don't need a cover girl or Maybelline cause maybe I lean a lil' closer
To the side of viewing her as a queen
And overthrows my life with the sense of humor she brings
I'd give my life away to hear her sing

I'm so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful uh oh uh oh
I'm so beautiful, so natural, not typical
I'm so beautiful, there's nobody else made like me
I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me
V. 2 and 3
(I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me)

You're beautiful
So don't be afraid to be you

You're beautiful.

If I move, You can move me back, it's like that.

Got me hypnotized by the way You love.
And the truth is I, really want You for the rest of my life.
And it's true what they say about love,
A lil' bit goes a long way in trust.
I ain't ever gonna give You up,
As long as I'm still alive, I'm gonna love.

Can't think straight cuz I'm thinkin' 'bout You daily.
Been through a lot and You saved me,
Your loves ne, ne-ver failed me.
I stayed focused cuz it's hard to cope with what this world offers when You're closest,
To the top, but I can't flop, cuz I need your love to keep me on lock.

Don't need to look around,

Group 1 Crew,"Please don't let me go
Please don't let me go

I've seen days where the nights don't end
It seems strange as I used to call friend
How can I begin to trust in the fact that you never let me go?
Been left so many times
Felt like nobody could know the sound that my heart makes when it starts to break
And the pain that I hate waits for me every day
And yet I lie awake alive and still breathing
Hoping that this time in my life is just a season
Believe in the words you spoke to your people
How you never leave even though we couldn't see you
How you make us prosper even though we couldn't pay you back
Now there's nothing that I lack

Please don't let me go
If I can't have your love my heart's got nowhere to go
Only you can rescue me
Please don't let me go
I'll be lost inside a dying world just trying to find my home
It's with you
I belong
Please don't let me go

I remember the moments life was a blur
An adolescent spirit far from mature
I couldn't tell between a friend and a foe
So alone I remained
Looked to the sky for hope
It's hard to feel alive when you're cold
It's hard to reach the sky when you know
So light is hard to find in the storm
How can I give love if my soul's been torn?
A broken vessel
You call it a masterpiece
Now I can see how deep you are in love with me
Quite honestly I can't love me how you love me
But obviously there's something that you want from me
Cause you don't want to let me go
Owner of the world but you want my soul
My heart is crying out
Lord, please take control
I need you
I don't wanna let go

Please don't let me go
If I can't have your love my heart's got nowhere to go
Only you can rescue me
Please don't let me go
I'll be lost inside a dying world just trying to find my home
It's with you
I belong
Please don't let me go

And I'm seeing who I could be without you close to me
I can't recognize that person staring back at me
And you see how my heart breaks from the choices I have made
I know your love can take it all away

Please don't let me go
If I can't have your love my heart's got nowhere to go

I have a feeling that somebody needs to hear this song
That's right, so turn it up, turn it up
Yea just turn it up up up up up turn it up up up

I remember them days when my mama will tell me
Saying you're to busy running round
You need to calm down always looking for love

(Go slow)

Hm
She told me Love ain't easy baby believe me
It can break your heart make you fall apart
So you got to be careful, there's no need to rush it

But now I'm getting older
And each winter is getting colder now
Oh to find you some how

For now I patiently wait for you to come my way
And I wont hesitate when you make your way right to my heart
So now I patiently wait

There been so many mistakes that I known I made in the past
Love so deep that I thought it would last
But you went away and you ain't looking back
So I'm left with the pain of a heart made of glass
Why ? God I can ask all day
Nah, to my self that I'm so OK
Try, to get passed the regret and change
Cause my heart still beats to the beats of a faith that
Believes that the best of my life is still
On the horizon so blinding and real
If I hope close to his beautiful will
Then I'll find what I'm looking for, chill
With the girl that was made for me
So dang glad I gotta hide her wings
I'll just wait till the day we meet but for now I'll sing
That

I'll patiently wait for you to come my way
And I wont hesitate when you make your way right to my heart
For now I patienly wait for that one sweet day
When you take me away with you and
A fairy tale will start
So now I patiently wait

1234 the clock ticks and I'm still waiting for ya
(waiting for ya)
4321 I'm counting down the days until I know ya
(until I know ya)

Yea huh
Let me hear the song that sync
I wonder what song she'll sing
Would it be your Frank Sinatra hit or maybe a tune by Night King
Called my stories are tad difficult
I'll be the one who would bolt after running king
Like the colts I would hurt the most
But its been a long time coming switch the play
Cause my soundtrack is humming
A new theme song featuring this truly
This is what we call a sing along

So I patiently wait for you to come my way
And I wont hesitate when you make your way right to my heart
For now I patiently wait for that one sweet day
When you take me away with you and
A fairytale will start
Till then ill patiently wait

My heart became like stone and turned to ice
Tell me what have I become
But you came just in time like a shooting star
Across my universe out of the dark
Tell me what have I become

Take me away
You save me from myself and all I do
Cause life just ain't the same when I'm with you
I can climb the sky (you got me) walking on the stars

I see life through new set of eyes
Set on someone different that I never realized
Outside my mind is a lost world that lies
But step into my thoughts you'll believe you can fly
Your words like wings gravity they defy
My heart like a leaf on the wind catchin' rides
They say we can't make it at least we gotta try
We make too much sense to foolishly pass it by
So I'm taking a rainbow up to the 5th floor
Steppin' out to see that you're really worth more
And I see our love in 3D
No more 2 dimensional worries
Climb until the sky don't exist no more
That's when I'll knock knock on your front door
Open to the possibilities I ignored
But I know now exactly what our love was meant for

Lord, take me away
You save me from myself and all I do
Cause life just ain't the same when I'm with you
I can climb the sky (you got me) walking on the stars
(Now) I can see my life from way up high
And all my troubles I once knew I left behind
I can climb the sky (you got me) walking on the stars

And I can see much more clear
When I'm lost in your atmosphere
You pull me close to the place
Where you're always waiting
So I won't stop, the walls are down
Make my way at the speed of sound
Hold me now
Hold me now

Lord, take me away
You save me from myself and all I do

Reaching down just to rescue me from my insecurity

Forgive my sins because my whole life broke

Dead bodies on their crib dead bodies on the floor

You I will mutilate, when I penetrate
Go for the one when I say raid

More money is made and that's the family trade
See I make moves and tell what's the truth

Lettin lose everyday, but still, keepin it fat

Scared to come to the ghetto talk about bustin shots

"Grover Washington, Jr.","Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

And all my bright tomorrows belong to you",All My Tomorrows
"Grover Washington, Jr.","Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason

That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming

Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

That they do

Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I

You, over you",Overjoyed

Won't you chase my clouds away?

Am I all alone?
Don't you ever wake up
And reach for me
Where I used to be?
Is there any chance?
I just can't believe
You're not lonely, too
Just for me and you

Tus defectos, tus caricias

Y ahora 

Otro ocupa mi lugar 
Otro duerme junto a ti 
Es difícil olvidar
Comprender 
Que mi camino se acababa 
Que sin ti no valgo nada

Fui tu gran amor 
Tu eco y tu voz, tu amanecer
El compañero de tu ayer

Te di mi alma y mi hogar 
Mi juventud, mi soledad 
Ame tu cuerpo, tu sonrisa 
Tus defectos tus caricias

Y ahora 
Otro ocupa mi lugar 
Otro duerme junto a ti

El se lleva lo que ame 
Sin pensar 
Que ayer te tuve entre mis manos 
Y ahora eres de mi hermano

Y quiero ir, quiero llorar 
Quedarme aquí, echar a andar 
Romperlo todo y empezar

Adiós te digo adiós 
Y sin volver la vista atrás 
Me iré despacio en la mañana 
Con la vida destrozada

Mientras 
Otro ocupa mi lugar 
Otro duerme junto a ti

Es difícil olvidar 
Comprender 
Que mi camino se acababa 
Que sin ti no valgo nada

Y ahora 
Otro ocupa mi lugar 
Otro duerme junto a ti

Que triste es vivir sin tí

No puedo calmar el dolor
Que siento aqui en mi corazón

A buscar otro amor
A entregar mi pasión
En una aventura

Teniéndote a ti

De tener dos amores

La felicidad nunca conocí
A decir verdad nunca fui feliz

Por estar pensando en ti
Olvide el amor que sufría por mi
Derramo sus lagrimas hasta el fin
Y a mis tres amores los deje partir

Y ese hombre que vez
Con el pelo casi blanco

Mira nomas lo que has dejado
Un corazon viejo y acabado

Grupo Bryndis,"Creímos que nuestro amor
Duraría eternamente
Y tuvo la rapidez del pensamiento
Creímos que nuestro amor
Seria como el infinito
Y sin embargo fue como estrella fugaz
Que se pierde en el firmamento

Comparamos nuestro amor
Con las cosas eternas de la vida
Y fue como las olas
Que se deshacen
Con el choque de las rocas
Convirtiéndose en gotas
Al ser transportadas por el viento

Nuestro amor fue como el polen
Que cae en tierra estéril
Para nunca fecundar
Esa fue la razón de nuestro amor
Así nació y así murió
Y ya jamás podrá resucitar
Por eso hoy te digo esta verdad
Si tienes que alejarte vete ya",Vete Ya

Porque somos de distintas sociedades
Amor prohibido nos dice todo el mundo
El dinero no importa en ti y en mí, ni en el corazón

Vale más que el dinero porque sí es amor
Y cuando al fin estemos juntos, los dos
Qué importa qué dirán, también la sociedad
Aquí sólo importa nuestro amor, te quiero

Aunque en las noches

Me enferme de llorar
Y ya no vuelva jamás a suspirar

Mi único querer

Me he prometido
Que me tengo que imponer
El sacrificio
De no volverte a ver

Hoy el sol me dijo
Que tu amor
Era mi error

Que no me has dado
Ni caricias, ni calor
Que solo has hecho
Mas grande mi dolor

Hoy por ser tan tuyo
No me he vuelto
A preocupar

Ni con tus besos
Yo me he vuelto
A equivocar
Por Dios te juro
Que te tengo que olvidar

Que más puedo ofrecerte para retenerte

Que más te da
Regálame tu amor una vez más
Que más te da
Regálame una noche que no olvide jamás

Que más te da regálame un beso al despertar
Que más te da, que más te da, que más te da

En el amor siempre hay aciertos y hay errores
En la pareja siempre hay uno que se queja
En vez de salvar el problema nos empeñamos
En hacernos daño y tratarnos como extraños

Estoy perdiendo la cabeza pensando
En que me equivoque cómo y cuando
Y cada tres palabras oigo tu nombre
Y es que te amo tanto no imaginas cuanto
Que más te da
