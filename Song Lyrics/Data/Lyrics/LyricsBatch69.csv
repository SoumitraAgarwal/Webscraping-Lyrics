Don Byas,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Don Byas,"Some say that love is sweet as a rose,
Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
""Candy""
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine
Mine",Candy
Don Byas,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon
Don Byas,"I don't know I'm born, I'm only young
I don't have a choice, you know I'm only young
I'm getting older, I'm getting smaller
Everybody tells you, ""you've got to walk taller""
You did a war, and now you're poor
And like your friends, you're gonna get it in the end 

You've heard it all before
You can't go on much more
It's not like I think
The old folks are losers
They can't work computers
They die in December time 

Can't put it off, you put it on
Don't ever stop, it doesn't last long
The younger folk, they
Don't understand, they
Back in the day, they
You're gonna get it in the end 

You heard it all before
You can't go on much more
Its not like I think
The old folks are losers
They can't work computers
They die in December time 

Fall down for no reason
The churches are heaving
The old folks, they live the life 

I'm down on the floor, I'll settle down, do what I tell ya.
You're gonna get it in the end,
You're gonna get it in the end 

The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers 

The old folks are losers
They can't work computers
They die in December time 

Fall down for no reason
The churches are heaving
The old folks remember why 

The old folks are losers
They can't work computers
They die in December time",Old Folks
Don Byas,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Don Byas,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you",Moonglow
Don Byas,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Don Byas,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess,

When I marry sweet Lorraine",Sweet Lorraine
Don Byas,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Don Byas,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Don Byas,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
 
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Don Byas,"Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
Should I recite beneath the pale moonlight?
And swear by the stars above you?

Could I repeat the sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?

Could I repeat that sweetest story told?

Don Byas,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You
Don Byas,"The moon was all aglow
But heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

The stars all seemed to know
You didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears
I sigh but there's no regretting
In spite of my tears

Who wouldn't believe those lips
Who wouldn't believe those eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears
I sigh but there's no regretting

Don Byas,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby,

Don Byas,"I was just minding my business
Life was a beautiful song
Didn't have a care nor worry
Then you had to come along
I fell in love with you first time

You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'

I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'

Don Byas,"It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
 
There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon
 
It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
 I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
",Three O'Clock in the Morning
Don Byas,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while",Once in a While
Don Byas,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You don't realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
""When a lovely flame dies,
Smoke gets in your eyes.""",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet

Don Byas,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Don Byas,"Sunday is gloomy; my hours are slumber-less
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Gloomy Sunday",Gloomy Sunday
Don Byas,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head

Settled revolutions in Spain

Don Byas,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.

Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

Don Byas,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Don Byas,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Don Carlos,"I know you wanna leave me,
But I refuse to let you go,
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy,
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me.

Please don't leave me girl,

Don Cherry,"There goes the girl I dreamed all through school about, 
There goes the girl I'll now be a fool about 
Ring down the curtain, I'm certain at present 
My future just passed. 

Don't even know if she has been spoken for. 
If she is tied, the ties must be broken, for 
Life can't be that way,to wake me then break me

We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again

Don Cherry,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner
Don Cherry,"When I walk up Main Street
It isn't the same street
To me it's a haunted avenue
The crowded ballroom seems empty and blue
This town's a ghost town without you
What memories I find
In the café we dined in
The sound of our laughter lingers on

This was a gay town
From dusk until dawn
Now it's a ghost town  since you're gone
Sweetheart your face is in all those places
And my heart embraces each vision of you
If only we'd make up
These shadows would break up
And I'd see that sun come shining through
So, darling, come back, I need you, I do",Ghost Town
Don Cherry,"My world is like a river as dark as it is deep
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories
Sweet memories
Sweet memories, hmm

She slipped into the silence of my dreams last night
Wondering from room to room turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
And I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories

I would rather be with you an hour
For the things that one can buy

In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me

Don Cherry,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday

And held me closely then stole my heart

A jury may find him guilty but I'd forgive him if I could see
A signed confession that he'd repented and really wanted no one but me.

I tell you I mean it

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Fait voler plus de billets que les faux monnayeurs,
On débarque comme un verre qui éclate dans ton écran

Or looks my way, or calls my name
That seems to leave this troubled world behind
If I'm feeling down and blue
Or troubled by some foolish game
She always seems to make me change my mind

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
Yes and silently remind me
The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
What she says them mostly just to calm me down

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now

We were rough and ready guys
But Oh! How we could harmonize

Must have been part of the game,

Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.

pretending that I'm someone else?

this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

Don Costa,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without

Don Edwards,"Little Joe the wrangler he'll wrangle never more
His days with the remuda they're all done
It was long about last April he rode into our camp
Just a little Texas stray and all alone
It was long late in the evening when he rode into our camp
On a little old brown pony he called Shaw
In his brogan shoes and coveralls a harder lookin' kid
You never in you life have seen before

His saddle was a Sother kack built many years ago
An OK spur on one foot idly hung
With his bed roll in a cotton sack was loosely tied behind
And a canteen from the saddle horn he'd slung
Said he had to leave his home because his paw had married twice
His new maw beat him every day or two
So he saddled up old Shaw one night and lit a shuck this way
Thought he'd try and paddle now his own canoe

Said he'd try to do the best he could if we'd only give him work
Though he didn't know straight up about a cow
So the boss he cut him out a mount and kinda put him on
And we knew he liked our little stray somehow
Well he taught him how to heard the horses and learned to know 'em all
And to get 'em in by daylight if he could
And to follow the chuck wagon and to always hitch the team
And to help the carsonaro rustle wood

We had driven to Red River and the weather it was fine
We were camped down on the south side of the bend
When a Norther started blowin' we called the extra guard
Cause it took all hands to hold the cattle in
Now little Joe the wrangler was called out like the rest
Barely had the kid got to the heard
When the cattle they stampeded like a hailstorm on they flew
With all of us a ridin' for the lead

Between the streaks of lightnin' we could see a horse ahead
It was little Joe the wrangler in the lead
He was riding old Blue Rocket with a slicker o'er his head
And he's trying to check the leaders in their speed.
We finally got'em millin' and they sort of quieted down
The extra guard back to the camp did go
But one of them was missing and we all knew at a glance
Twas our little Texas strayboy wrangler Joe

We found him there at sun up where old Blue Rocket fell
In some washout twenty feet below
Beneath his horse smashed to a pulphis spur had rung the knell
For our little Texas stray bos wrangler Joe
Little Joe the wrangler he'll wrangle never more
His days with the remuda they're all done
It was long about last April he rode into our camp
Just a little Texas stray and all alone

Don Edwards,"When I was but a young man, wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
It grieved them so to think their only boy was bad

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful livin' will lead only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my master call

One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started them out on the trail that leads to Mexico
When a norther' started blowin' and lightnin' flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, thought I heard a shout

At that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
This time I knew a heard a voice, a voice so sweet and plain
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name

So frightened, I was thinking of the sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle, they stampeded and were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and threw me to the ground

I felt the end was nearing, that death would be the price
When a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
Then I cried, ""oh Lord, forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for You alone, God these words I vow""

My wicked life unfolded and I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me, and I was left to live
The Master had a reason, life was His to take or give

A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high
And right behind it, there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried and begged for mercy, kneeling there upon the ground

A pardon I was granted and my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy sea
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I gave my life and soul the night the Savior called my name
I gave my life and soul the night the Savior called my name",The Master's Call
Don Edwards,"Was a cowboy I knew in south Texas,
His face was burnt deep by the sun,
Part history, part sage, part mesquit,
He was there when Poncho Villa was young. 

And he'd tell you a tale of the old days, 
When the country was wild all around, 
Sit out under the stars of the Milky Way, 
And listen while the coyotes howl. 

And they go... hoo yip hoo yip hoo
hoodi hoo di yip hoo di yip hoo

Now the long horns are gone, 
And the drovers are gone, 
The Comanches are gone, 
And the outlaws are gone, 
Geronimo is gone, 
And Sam Bass is gone,
And the lion is gone, 
And the red wolf is gone. 

Well he cursed all the roads and the oil men,
And he cursed the automobile, 
Said this is no place for an hombre like I am, 
In this new world of asphalt and steel. 

Then he'd look off some place in the distance, 
At something only he could see, 
He'd say all that's left now of the old days, 
Those damned old coyotes and me. 

And they go hoo yip hoo yip hoo

And the drovers are gone
The Comanches are gone
And the outlaws are gone,
Now Quantro is gone, 
Stan Watie is gone
And lion is gone,
And the red wolf is gone. 

One morning they searched his adobe,
He disappeared without even a word,
But that night as the moon crossed the mountain, 
One more coyote was heard.

Don Edwards,"When shadows creep across the hills,
and purple streaks the sky,
when cattle bunch up closer for the night...



That's when you hear the whipoorwill
start singing sweet and high,
That's when you hear the prairie lullaby.



The breezes play, the branches sway
somewhere a coyote cries,
Ah ee oh loh di, it's a prairie lullaby.



When later on the sun is gone
The campfire fights the dark,
Snd a million stars are twinkling in the sky



That's when you see a cowboy reach
for his old mouth harp
That's when you'll hear the prairie lullaby

The breezes play the branches sway
and somewhere a coyote cries
Ah ee oh lodi, it's a prairie lullaby
Ah ee oh loh di, it's a prairie lullaby.

And hang your spurs for good

That I'm back where I belong
I'm just a cow hen from Rio Grande
Back where I was born

Now the city lights and the city ways
They're drivin' me insane
I wanna be alone I wanna be back home
Back on the Texas plains

I wanna drink my java from an old tin can
While the moon comes shinin' high
I wanna hear the call of a whippoorwill
I wanna hear a coyote cry

I wanna feel my saddle horse between my legs
Riding him out on the range
Just to kick him in the sides make him show his step and pride
Back on the Texas plains

I wanna hear the thunder as it booms and rolls
I wanna feel the rain in my face
Just a thousand miles from the city lights
Drawin' a cowboy ways

I wanna sleep at night beneath the stars above
While the moon goes climbin' high
I wanna cook my coffee over cactus coves
Fifty miles from town

People saying that you're no good for me,
""Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you""

If you loved me baby you'd deny it,
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand

But you know that I'll forgive you,
Just this once, twice, forever,
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,
Just as long as we're together.

I don't want to play around,
I don't want nobody baby,

Really worth while, after all
I've been wishing today I could just run away
Out where the west winds call

With someone like you, a pal good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by

While the real world waits outside
Away out on the breast of the wonderful west
Across the great divide

Don Edwards,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Don Edwards,"Old Red was one of the orniest yet
I've seen at the big rodeo
He'll bite you and kick you and stomp out your life
Old Red had never been rode

Meaner than sin, wild as the wind
That blew on the Montana plains
Old Red was one of the last of his breed
And wasn't about to be tamed

From Idaho, a young cowboy came
To ride in the big rodeo
The young cowboy's name was Billy McLean
And Billy had never been thrown

The greatest desire filled the young Billy's heart
To ride this old outlaw called Red
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say
""I'll ride him or drop over dead""

Old Red was wicked way down in the shoot
He was kicking, stomping about
Billy climbed into the saddle with ease
Then he yelled turn him loose let us out

Old Red came out with his head on the ground
His back hooves were touching his nose
Trying to get rid of the man on his back
But the man went wherever he goes

Billy was racking Old Red with his spurs
From his tail to the tip of his chin
He was doing right well but Billy could tell
This outlaw would never give in

Old Red was runnin' straight for the fence
Suddenly stopping and then
He reared on his hind legs then fell on his back
Taking poor Billy with him

There was a hush in the crowd and they knew
This would be Billies last ride
The saddle horn crushed Billies chest when they fell
And under Old Red Billy died

Old Red lay still, no more would he move
The cowboys that seen it could tell
In trying to throw Billy of off his back
Old Red broke his neck when he fell

Out in the west, there's they place where they rest
This cowboy that never was thrown
And one foot away resting there 'neath the clay
Is the outlaw that never was rode

When you are all alone
Maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue
Then what will you do
Maybe you'll sit and sigh
Wishing that I were near, then
Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe I'll say maybe

I press you, caress you, and bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember the rambling rose you wear in your hair
Ramona, when day is done you'll hear my call
Ramona, we'll meet beside the water fall
I dread the dawn when I awake to find you gone
Ramona I need you my own
 
Let's wander out yonder o'er the hills
By a babbling brook
Where we'll find a nook
To build our own love nest, o'er the hills

Don Estelle,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird

And we know we've found at last sight

Love at love sight
We've no voice, no choice in the matter

They just told me it was there

A brand new car for a brand new millionaire
But fame can be a feather that’s caught up in the wind
And I can turn the memories loose again
Dreams that disappeared can come alive today

The love you thought was gone, still lingers in a song
I’ve seen the world through windows from buses, cars and planes
Success can be a freedom or a chain
I don’t regret one moment, all I did was sing

And I can turn the memories loose again

Tonight sweetheart we’re back were we began
Yesterday just passed my way again

But tonight I’m holdin’ the hands that once were mine
And you’re lovin’ me as if the world might end

Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,

Don Ewell,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?
Don Ewell,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Don Ewell,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Don Francisco,"The crowds were in the streets that day when Jesus came
To town
All the synagogue was there and more from miles around
So I asked him home to dinner just to see what I could
See
Of this famous local prophet from here in Galilee

And I don't know just how that woman got into the room
But you couldn't miss her gaudy clothes and her strong
And sweet perfume.
She went straight to Jesus' feet and stopped and stood
Right there
Then cried and wet His feet with tears and dried them
With her hair.

Now of all the women in my town none was more well
Known
For the flagrant sin she'd lived in and the wickedness
She'd sown.
But He didn't move to stop her -- seemed this phophet
Couldn't tell
That the woman who was touching Him was the kind they
Buy and sell.

And I had no idea just what this Jesus planned to do
When he said ""Simon, there's something I need to say to
You.""
So I said ""Teacher, if it's on your mind then tell me
What you will.""
But as He began to speak to me the room grew quickly
Still

He said ""Take a good look at this woman now, in spite
Of all her fears
She's kissed me and anointed me and washed my feet with
Tears.
She's honored me and you've been only rude to me
Instead.
You gave no kiss of greeting, no anointing for my
Head.""

And her sins were red as scarlet and now they're washed
Away.
The love and faith she's shown is all the price she has
To pay
For the depth of God's forgiveness, it's more than you
Can see
And in spite of what you think of her, she's beautiful
To me

Now my anger flamed to hatred, I wanted nothing more
Than to take this prophet by the throat and throw Him
Out the door
To act like God, forgiving sins, and then speak so to
Me.
This itinerant from Nazareth in backwards Galilee.

But instead I sat and trembled, shaken to the core
The woman still was weeping as she knelt there on the
Floor
Jesus turned to her and said, ""Your chains have been
Released
Your faith has saved you from your sins, rise -- walk
In peace.""

Your sins were red as scarlet but now they're washed
Away.
The love and faith you've shown is all the price you
Have to pay
For the depth of God's forgiveness, it's deeper than
The sea
And no matter what the world may think, you're
Beautiful to me.",Beautiful to Me
Don Francisco,"She kept on getting weaker as day dragged into day
The doctors gave no hope for her; she seemed to fade away
My hours were filled with constant dread; time became a knife
That slowly and relentlessly cut the cord of life

There was a teacher in the region then some of us had heard
That He'd healed the paralytic by the power of just His Word
So with hope again rekindled I went at once to see
If I could find a man named Jesus from a town in Galilee

I began to search the city and soon I saw the crowd
They were pressing in to touch Him and they called His Name out loud
But with the strength of desperation I pushed them all aside
I through myself before Him and from my knees I cried

""Lord, come and heal my daughter, even now she's close to death
Her fever's uncontrollable, she fights for every breath
But God's given You the power; life is Yours to give
If you'll just lay Your hands on her I know that she will live""
(She will live, she will live)

Well, He'd just begun to go with me when a face I saw with fear
Came towards me with the news I knew I didn't want to hear
And although I tried to steel myself I trembled when he said
""Why bother the Teacher anymore, your little girl is dead.""

Then Jesus touched my shoulder and He told me not to grieve
The trembling stopped when He looked at me and said, ""Only believe""
Then He sent the crowds away except His closest men
And they followed right behind us as we started off again

But we were still a long ways down the road when I heard the sounds and cries
Of the mourners and musicians as they strove to dramatize
My grief they had no business with beneath their loud disguise
My wife just sat there silently and stared through empty eyes

Then Jesus asked the mourners, ""Why is it that you weep?
She isn't dead as you suppose, the child is just asleep.""
It only took a moment for their wails to turn to jeers
""Who does this man think he is? Get him out of here!""

With authority I've never heard in the lips of any man
He spoke and every sound rolled out with the thunder of command
And in the sudden silence they all hurried for the door
Wondering what the reasons were they'd ever come there for

Then He called his three disciples that were with Him on the way
He led them and my wife and me to where our daughter lay
He took her by the hand; He told her ""Child, arise""
And the words were barely spoken when she opened up her eyes

She rose and walked across the room and stood there at our sides
My wife knelt down and held her close and at last she really cried
And then Jesus told us both to see that our daughter had some food
But as to how her life was saved, not to speak a word
Not to speak a word

I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody

Don Francisco,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.

Don Francks,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Don Friedman,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Don Friedman,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Don Friedman,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody

Don Friedman,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

I want to take you away, away from the crowd

Seeing images in the firelight

Don Friedman,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Because I know our love can never be

Each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darling, how I love you
So much in love and yet so far apart

It's a sin to hide behind this heartache
To make believe that I've found someone new
It's a sin to say that I don't miss you
When people know I'm still in love with you

Now here am I alone and blue

Whoa, you'll wish you had some day
Take the time to touch the morning
Before it slips away

Peepin' through a window glass
Have you ever noticed Jack Frost

Have you ever tasted apples
With the dew still on the skin
Have you ever loved somebody
You'll never see again

Felt the cool upon my face

As I lay searching for sleep.
Her soft hand reached out, she whispered my name
As she brushed a tear from my cheek.

But a true love would not have gone wrong.

For without them I could not go on,

Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart 
Is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart

I'm sorry for your victim now cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again
You have no heart you have no shame you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won again",You Win Again
Don Gibson,"It's as dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

I never will forget one time when I was on a little visit down home in Ebenezer, Kentucky. 
I was a-talkin' to an old man that had known me ever since the day I was born, and an old friend 
of the family. He says, ""Son, you don't know how lucky you are to have a nice job like you've got 
and don't have to dig out a livin' from under these old hills and hollers like me and your pappy 
used to."" When I asked him why he never had left and tried some other kind of work, he says, 
""Nawsir, you just won't do that. If ever you get this old coal dust in your blood, you're just 
gonna be a plain old coal miner as long as you live."" He went on to say, ""It's a habit (CHUCKLE) 
sorta like chewin' tobaccer."" 

Come and listen you fellows, so young and so fine,
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines. 
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul, 
'Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal. 

It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
It's a-many a man I have seen in my day, 
Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines. 

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll, 
My body will blacken and turn into coal. 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, 
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.

The midnight, the morning, or the middle of day, 
Is the same to the miner who labors away. 
Where the demons of death often come by surprise, 
One fall of the slate and you're buried alive.",Dark as a Dungeon
Don Gibson,"I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold,
I'd rather be His than have riches untold;
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land,
I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand

Than to be the king of a vast domain
Or be held in sin's dread sway
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today

I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause,
I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause;
I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame,
I'd rather be true to His holy name

He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom,
He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;
He's all that my hungering spirit needs;
I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead",I'd Rather Have Jesus
Don Gibson,"I'm looking for that Lonely Street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street?

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street?

Perhaps upon this Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

If I could find that Lonely Street

And knows just what false love can do

He lost the one he loved, then slowly lost her mind
He sat around and cried his life away

(Don Bowman - Ray Corbin)

All I gotta do is forget about you
And find someone who will be true that'll never leave me
Think about something all the time get you far and out off my mind I'll be free
Oh free to do what I wanna do not sit at home and think about you
Oh I can find me someone new then I'll be free
Get your long black shiny hair cause the fun we used to share then I'll be free
All I gotta do is forget your face and never go back to any place I'll be free

Don Gibson,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Don Henley,"Like every young man, I had some things that I 
Wanted to say 
Ere I could begin, you know the world got 
In my way 

Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby 
To open the window and reel the fair wind 
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby again 
We spend so much time weeping and wailing and 

Shaking our fists 
Creating enemies that really don't exist 
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby- 
To open the window and feel the fair wind 

Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby again 
All these comings and goings that cut like a knife 
These small, simple pleasures that make up a life 
A man needs a home, and a child, and a wife 

To always be there-always 
After I'm gone, there are some things that I know 
I will miss: 
The taste of your mouth, the smell of the perfume 

On your wrist Oh, Lilah, the fields lie fallow 
What are ye sow, so shall ye reap 
Oh Lilah, this ground we hallow 
Is ours to tend, but not to keep

Too-rah, loo-rah, loo-rah lay

Just searching for someplace to be 
Wasn't looking for trouble 
I guess it was looking for me 
And I knew I was wasting my time 
But it was nobody's business 
Nobody's business but mine 
I was taking some comfort 
I needed a break from the rain 
I guess I was mistaken 
And someone remembered my name 
But I knew I was doin' just fine 
And it was nobody's business 
Nobody's business but mine

Don Henley,"When the hot September sun down in Texas 
Has sucked the streams bone dry 
And turned to roads to dust
In the sleepy little towns down in Texas, 
The shades are all pulled down; 
The streets are all rolled up. 
The only thing that breaks the silence 
Are the trucks a-passin' by 
And late at night on the front porch swing 
You can hear a mournful sigh 
The lonesome whippoorwill cries to the stars above 
He was callin' out for his lady love 
She's been gone so long 
I was just talkin' to the moon 
Hopin' someday soon that I'd be over 
The memory of you-too hard to hold 
And the wind across the plains 
Is all that now remains 
The night shakes loose the names 
But they never quite go back the way they came 
So, good-bye rodeo 
It's a long, funny way for a man to go 
And never change- 
And never change at all 
I was just talkin' to the moon 
Hopin' someday soon that I'd be over 
The memory of you, too hard to hold on 
I was just talkin' to the moon 
Hopin' someday soon that I'd be over the 
Memory of you",Talking to the Moon

Don Henley,"I met a Frenchman in a field last night
He was out there with an easel, painting carnival light
He said, I used to paint the princess; I used to paint the frogs
Now I paint moustaches on dangerous dogs
He said, Sometimes it's a country; sometimes it's a girl

Some guys breath Baudelaire
Some guys just got to go and put their rockets everywhere

How many arrows must I shoot into the blue?
Ah, you little maniac, I'm crazy over you
Before The Death of Lovers and The Punishment of Pride
Let's go scrape across the terrazzo

Don Henley,"I used to work for Harvester
I used to use my hands
I used to make the tractors and the combines that plowed and harvested
This great land
Now I see my handiwork on the block everywhere I turn
And I see the clouds 'cross the weathered faces and I watch the harvest burn

I quit the plant in '57
Had some time for farmin' then
Banks back then was lendin' money
The banker was the farmer's friend
And I've seen dog days and dusty days;
Late spring snow and early fall sleet;
I've held the leather reins in my hands and felt the soft ground under my feet
Between the hot dry weather and the taxes, and the Cold War it's been hard
To make ends meet
But I always kept the clothes on our backs;
I always put the shoes on our feet

My grandson, he comes home from college
He says, ""We get the government we deserve.""
My son-in-law just shakes his head and says, ""That little punk, he never
Had to serve.""
And I sit here in the shadow of the suburbs and look out across these
Empty fields
I sit here in earshot of the bypass and all night I listen to the rushin'
Of the wheels

The big boys, they all got computers; got incorporated, too
Me, I just know how to raise things
That was all I ever knew
Now, it all comes down to numbers
Now I'm glad that I have quit
Folks these days just don't do nothin' simply for the love of it

I went into town on the Fourth of July
Watched 'em parade past the Union Jack
Watched 'em break out the brass and beat on the drum
One step forward and two steps back
And I saw a sign on Easy Street, said, ""Be Prepared to Stop.""
Pray for the independent, little man
I don't see next year's crop
And I sit here on the back porch in the twilight
And I hear the crickets hum
I sit and watch the lightning in the distance but the showers never come
I sit here and listen to the wind blow
I sit here and rub my hands
I sit here and listen to the clock strike, and I wonder when I'll see my

I saw Jesus on the plane...or maybe it was Elvis

But her virtue was as swollen as her pride
She should've had the Oscar
She must have been miscast
Her fifteen minutes went by so fast
I said, ""Now, baby, have you got no shame?""
She just looked at me, uncomprehendingly
Like cows at a passing trainIf dirt were dollars
If dirt were dollars
If dirt were dollars

And the poisoned pen
We got a press no better
Than the public men

Gone bad again
God's finest little creatures
Looking brave and strong
Whistling past the graveyard
Nothing can go wrong
Quoting from the scriptures
With patriotic tears
We got the same old men
With the same old fears
Standing at attention
Wrapped in stars and stripes
They hear the phantom drummers
And the nonexistent pipes

But they loved it when he told them
They were better than the rest

But you never have to get down on your knees
You don't have to holler, please, please
No, you never have to get down on your knees

Throw down a rope from heaven
And lead the flock to water
The man in the middle would have you think
That you have no other choice
But to wander in the wilderness
Of all the upturned faces
If you stop and listen long enough
You will hear your own small voice

But you don't have to pray to a little tin god
Step out of the way for a little tin god
You might fear the reaper, fear the rod

Give us dirty laundry

Can we film the operation?
Is the head dead yet?
You know, the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set!
We need dirty laundry

You don't really need to find out what's going on
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone
Just leave well enough alone
Eat your dirty laundry

Dirty little secrets
Dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
We love to cut you down to size
We love dirty laundry

We can do ""The Innuendo""
We can dance and sing
When it's said and done we haven't told you a thing
We all know that Kraft is king
Give us dirty laundry!

Don Henley,"Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standing by

When happily ever after fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

But I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by man
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end

This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords

For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details

Since daddy had to lie
But I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by

And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense

But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast

But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss

And let me take a long last look
Before we say good bye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me

Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence",The End of the Innocence
Don Henley,"It was a pretty big year for fashion
A lousy year for rock and roll
The people gave their blessings to crimes of passion
It was a dark, dark night of the collective soul
Now was somewhere out on riverside
By the El Royale Hotel
When a stranger appeared in a cloud of smoke
I thought I knew him all too well

He said now that I have your attention
I got somethin' I want to say
You may not want to hear it
I'm gonna tell it to you anyway
You know, I've always liked you, boy
Cause you were not afraid of me
But things are gonna get mighty rough
Here in Gomorrah-By-The-Sea

He said it's just like home
It's so damned hot, I can't stand it
My fine seersucker suit is all soakin' wet

And the hills are burning
The wind is raging
And the clock strikes midnight
In the Garden of Allah
(In the Garden of Allah)

Nice car
I love those Bavarians, so meticulous
You know, I remember a time when things were a lot more
Fun around here
When good was good, and evil was evil
Before things got so, fuzzy
Yeah, I was once a golden boy like you
And I was summoned to the halls of power in the heavenly court
And I dined with the deities who looked upon me with favor
For my talents my creativity
And we sat beneath the palms in the warm afternoons
And drank the wine with Fitzgerald and Huxley

And they pawned a biting phrase
From tongues hot with blood
And drained their pens of bitter ink
Vainly reaching for the bottle full of empty Edens
Branded special for the ones
Who had come with great expectations
To the perfumed halls of Allah
For their time in the sun

We were stokin' the fires
And oilin' up the machinery
Until the gods found out we had ideas of our own

And the war was coming
The earth was shaking
And there was no more room
In the Garden of Allah
(In the Garden of Allah)

Today I made an appearance downtown
I am an expert witness, because I say I am
And I said, gentleman, and I use that word loosely
I will testify for you
I'm a gun for hire, I'm a saint, I'm a liar
Because there are no facts, there is no truth
Just a data to be manipulated
I can get any result you like
What's it worth to ya?
Because there is no wrong, there is no right
And I sleep very well at night
No shame, no solution
No remorse, no retribution
Just people selling T-shirts
Just opportunity to participate in the pathetic little circus
And winning, winning, winning

It was a pretty big year for predators
The marketplace was on a roll
And the land of opportunity
Spawned a whole new breed of men without souls
This year, notoriety got all confused with fame
And the devil is downhearted, baby
'Cause there's nothing left for him to claim

He said it's just like home
It's so low-down, I can't stand it
I guess my work around here has all been done

And the fruit is rotten
The serpent's eyes shine
As he wraps around the vine

Don Henley,"I got the call today, I didn't want to hear
But I knew that it would come
An old, true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are those voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand,
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
Ah, the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Oh, pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us, you know it doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live with out you now
But I miss you, baby
And the more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I'd figured out
I have to learn again
I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

There are people in your life
Who've come and gone
They let you down
You know they've hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you baby
'Cause life goes on
You keep carryin' that anger
It'll eat you  up inside baby

I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So, I'm thinkin' about forgiveness

And I thought about leavin' town
I could have died if I wanted to
Slipped over the edge and drowned
But, oh no baby, I won't give up that easy, no

Too many tire tracks in the sands of time
Too many love affairs that stop on a dime
Oh well, oh baby
I think it's time to make some changes 'round here

Yeah, I'm gonna tear it up
Gonna trash it up
I'm gonna round it up
Gonna shake it up
Oh, no, baby, I will not lie down

I'm brave enough to be crazy
I'm strong enough to be weak
I see all these heroes with feet of clay
Whose mighty ships have sprung a leak
And I want you to tell me darlin'
Just what do you believe in now?

Well, c'mon over here baby
You 'bout to gimme a heart attack
I want to wrap my lovin' arms

Don Henley,"I know you broke up with him
And your heart's still on the shelf
It's been over two years for me
And I'm still not quite myself

You can't be with someone new
And you can't go back to him
You're beginning to realize
That it's sink or swim

I see you around sometimes
And my heart just melts
You're lookin' like if you had your wish
You'd be somewhere else

And it just breaks my heart
To see you here this way
Someday I'll get the nerve
To walk up to you and say

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
'Cause I'll be there
When your broken heart is on the mend

Every night it's the same old crowd
Smoky rooms
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes
But it never blooms

I've been around this block a time or two
And I've made some big mistakes
But girl I promise you, I promise you
This is the last worthless evening

That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening

That you'll have to spend
'Cause it won't be long

With the shades pulled down
God knows, we could use some romance
In this sleepy bedroom town
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything

But there're just so many summers
And just so many springs
And this is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend

Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance
To show you how love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend

'Cause it won't be long
'Til your little heart is on the mend

That you'll have to spend 'cause it won't be long

Don Henley,"Harry got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning

He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

And in these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
And take care of your own
One day they're here
Next day they're gone

I pulled my coat over my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark,
Baby, I've changed, please come back

What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
I know there's somebody, somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe
I believe, I believe

Don Henley,"Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes
I don't know if even Heaven knows
I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true
Now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you

I was either standing in your shadow
Or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl
There's just not enough love in the world

I know people hurt you, so bad
They don't know the damage they can do,
And it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down just like
Children on a playground
Even after that ol' sun went down

I was either standing in your shadow
Or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl
There's just not enough love in the world

Oh darlin', baby, this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile
For the world, for the camera
Still have something left
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody
Just take good care of yourself

I'm not easy to live with
I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, babe
That's one of the things I loved about you
Time will come around when we need to settle down
Got to get of this merry-go-round

I was either standing in your shadow
Or blocking you're light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right

Calls all his customers by name

It's the kind that eats you up inside

Hard to get home with any pride

Watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble

Don Henley,"I watch you sleeping
My weary heart rises up on wings
I hear your laughter
Something deep down inside me sings

Way down here in the land of cotton
You were born on a rainy day
Since then, sweet things long forgotten
They just keep flooding back my way

Oh child, I cannot tell you how the time just flies
But I have had my days of glory under sunny skies
These days, your bright dreams are all I want to see
Sleep tight, Annabel
You can always count on me

In this cold world, folks will judge you
Though they don't know you at all
And I may not be there to catch you
Anytime that you might fall

But, you got my hard head
And your mother's grace
All the likeness of the loved ones right there in your face
And I know in the end you'll be who you will be

So sleep tight, Annabel
You can always count on me",Annabel
Don Henley,"Maybe just a good night's sleep
Would have changed your troubled mind
From that rather permanent decision
So tragic, so unkind
Now, pain is what you've given
And sleep is what you'll get
So far away from that sweet baby child
Who hardly knew you yet

Now he'll grow up to be a fighter
Full of anger, full of shame
Like all the other haunted children
Who wonder why they came
And he'll be in and out of trouble
Until he stands up or he falls
But there will always be a shadow there
No matter how it goes
Damn it, Rose

Is this another cryptic message
Or some kind of cosmic quiz
If there's a lesson to be learned from this
Well, I don't know what it is

You could have given us the finger
Much more constructively than that
Now I sit here with the MTV
And your bloated, Burmese cat
We're being treated to the wisdom
Of some puffed up little fart
Doing exactly what I used to do
Pretensions to anarchy and art
He speaks the language of a warrior
He mounts his misinformed attack
He wears the clothes of a dissenter
But there's a logo on his back
And it's a hollow rebellion
As rebellions mostly are
It's just another raging tempest in a jar

And the seasons keep on changing
And the wind blows hot and cold
Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide
As it ebbs and flows
Damn it, Rose",Damn It Rose
Don Henley,"I hate to tell you this, but I'm very, very happy
And I know that's not what you'd expect from me at all
I'm not the kind to smile and bow out gracefully
I always wanted to take it to the wall

But I found somebody with a heart as big as Texas
I found an angel with the golden wings
She saw me down here in the dark somehow
And everything is different now

Yeah, I miss the old crowd sometimes
And the wild, wild nights of running
You know, a starving soul can't live like that for long
You go around in circles that just keep getting smaller

You wake up one morning and half your life is gone
I got so tired of that; I got so lonely
I dropped down and I called out to heaven
Send me someone to love.
And heaven shot back, you get the love that you allow.
And everything is different now

Oh, and it's sweet to know
The wisdom that living brings
Since I got a telegram from the god of simple things

She said, I don't care what you do for a living.
She said, I don't care what kind of car you drive.
All I want to know right now is what do you believe in
And what it means to you to be alive

Will you stand here in this fire with me?
Are you ready for another life?
So I bit that bullet, I took that vow

I stumbled in my door
Disgusted with my circumstance
Soaked to every pore
When floating from my bedroom
Came a moaning and a sigh
""Oh, I've had one too many
It's just the wind,"" says I

I lit up a cigarette
And I poured a good, stiff drink
You see, I needed to compose myself
I needed time to think
No sooner had I settled down
The moaning came again
Drifting through the silence
Like some otherworldly violin

I bounded up the staircase
I went slippin' and slidin' down the hall
You know, I've been around the whole, wide world
But I was not prepared at all
Uninvited visitor, unsuspecting host
""Well, I see you've made yourself at home.
Good evening, Miss Ghost.""

You're more beautiful than ever
I feel just like a kid
And I commence to trembling
When I think of all the things we did
Skin as pale as marble; lips as red as blood
Imagine my surprise, my dear
I thought that you were gone for good

You look so lovely lying there
All stretched out on your back
But I'm the one who's strung up here
On old temptation's rusty rack
And in the wee small hours
Is when I miss you the most
And I confess it, I have missed you
Miss Ghost

I threw open the window
And I howled at the rain
And I cursed the weakness of the flesh
This breath and bone, and this brute, reptilian brain

What dirty tricks the mind can play
In the lonely dead of night
When you bump into the shadow
Of a faded love that wasn't right

Way down beneath the surface
Far beyond the light of day
So many things lie buried deep
And baby, they should stay that way

Oh, my wicked, little habit
We've really made a mess
Everything's been trivialized 
In our vain pursuit of happiness

And even though you've come for me
I won't go back with you
To some temporary heaven
Down some empty, dead-end avenue
But it's been so good to have you here
And I propose a toast
""Here's to seeing through you,
Miss Ghost.""",Miss Ghost
Don Henley,"A lot of things have happened
Since the last time we spoke
Some of them are funny
Some of 'em ain't no joke
And I trust you will forgive me
If I lay it on the line 
I always thought you were a friend of mine

Sometimes I think about you
I wonder how you're doing now
And what you're going through

The last time I saw you
We were playing with fire
We were loaded with passion
And a burning desire
For every breath, for every day of living
And this is my Thanksgiving

Now the trouble with you and me, my friend
Is the trouble with this nation
Too many blessings, too little appreciation
And I know that kind of notion¡ªwell, it just ain't cool
So send me back to Sunday school
Because I'm tired of waiting for reason to arrive
It's too long we've been living
These unexamined lives

I've got great expectations
I've got family and friends
I've got satisfying work
I've got a back that bends
For every breath, for every day of living
This is my Thanksgiving

Have you noticed that an angry man
Can only get so far
Until he reconciles the way he thinks things ought to be
With the way things are

Here in this fragmented world, I still believe
In learning how to give love, and how to receive it
And I would not be among those who abuse this privilege
Sometimes you get the best light from a burning bridge

And I don't mind saying that I still love it all
I wallowed in the springtime
Now I'm welcoming the fall
For every moment of joy
Every hour of fear
For every winding road that brought me here
For every breath, for every day of living
This is my Thanksgiving

For everyone who helped me start
And for everything that broke my heart
For every breath, for every day of living
This is my Thanksgiving",My Thanksgiving
Don Henley,"I had a good life
Before you came
I had my friends and my freedom
I had my name
Still there was sorrow and emptiness
'Til you made me glad
Oh, in this love, I found strength I never knew I had

And this love
Is like nothing I have ever known
Take my hand, love
I'm taking you home
I'm taking you home

There were days, lonely days
When the world wouldn't throw me a crumb
But I kept on believing
That this day would come

And this love
Is like nothing I have ever known
Take my hand, love
I'm taking you home
I'm taking you home

Where we can be with the ones who really care
Home, where we can grow together
Keep you in my heart forever

And this love
Is like nothing I have ever known
Oh no, no baby
Take my hand, love
I'm taking you home
Taking you home

And this love
Is like nothing I have ever known
Oh no, baby
Take my hand,
I'm taking you home
Yes I am
I'm taking you home

Don Henley,"From the Arizona desert
To the Salisbury plain
Lights on the horizon
Patterns on the grain
Anxious eyes turned upward
Clutching souvenirs
Carrying our highest hopes and our darkest fears

They swear there was an accident back in '47
Little man with a great big head
Splattered down from heaven
Government conspiracy; cover-ups and lies
Hidden in the desert under endless skies

Well, it's a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
Post, postmodern world
No time for heroes, no place for good guys
No room for rocky the flying squirrel

They're not here, they're not coming
Not in a million years
Turn your weary eyes back homeward
Stop your trembling, dry your tears
You may see the heavens flashing
You may hear the cosmos humming
But I promise you, my brother
They're not here, they're not coming

Would they pile into the saucer
Find Orlando's rat and hug it? 
Go screaming through the universe
Just to get Mcnuggets? 
Well, I don't think so, I don't think so
It's much too dangerous, it's much too strange
Here in a world that won't give Oprah no home on the range

Well, it's a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold

But I promise you, my sister
They're not here, they're not coming

To this garden we were given
And always took for granted
It's like my daddy told me, 'you just bloom where you're planted'
Now you long to be delivered
From this world of pain and strife
That's a sorry substitution for a spiritual life

Well, it's a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold

No place for sentiment, no room for romance

Don Henley,"Nobody on the road,
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Don't know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
I don't understand what happened to our love
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow
And you're smiling at everyone
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
Don't look back, you can never look back
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let 'em go, but

I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that top pulled down,
And that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that hair slicked back,
And those Wayfarers on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone",The Boys of Summer [Multimedia Track]
Don Henley,"I hate to tell you this, but I'm very, very happy
And I know that's not what you'd expect from me at all
I'm not the kind to smile and bow out gracefully
I always wanted to take it to the wall

But I found somebody with a heart as big as Texas
I found an angel with the golden wings
She saw me down here in the dark somehow
And everything is different now

Yeah, I miss the old crowd sometimes
And the wild, wild nights of running
You know, a starving soul can't live like that for long
You go around in circles that just keep getting smaller
You wake up one morning and half your life is gone
I got so tired of that; I got so lonely
I dropped down and I called out to heaven
Send me someone to love.
And heaven shot back, You get the love that you allow
And everything is different now

Oh, and it's sweet to know
The wisdom that living brings
Since I got a telegram from the god of simple things
She said, I don't care what you do for a living
She said, I don't care what kind of car you drive
“All I want to know right now is what do you believe in
And what it means to you to be alive
Will you stand here in this fire with me?
Are you ready for another life?
So I bit that bullet and I took that vow
And everything is different now
Everything is different now",Everything Is Different Now [DVD]
Don Henley,"I got the call today, I didn't want to hear
But I knew that it would come
An old, true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you'd found someone

And I thought of all the bad luck,
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door

Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?
I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes

The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter

But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness

Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage

We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
The trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
They're the very things - we kill I guess

Pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
And the more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I'd figured out

I have to learn again
I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes

And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

There are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down you know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you baby; life goes on
You keep carryin' that anger; it'll eat you up inside, baby

I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thought seem to scatter

But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me
I've been tryin' to get down

To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinkin' about forgiveness

Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

And your heart's still on the shelf
It's been over two years for me
And I'm still not quite myself

You can't be with someone new
And you can't go back to him
You're beginning to realize
That it's sink or swim

I see you around sometimes
And my heart just melts
You're lookin' like if you had your wish
You'd be somewhere else

And it just breaks my heart
To see you here this way
Someday I'll get the nerve
To walk up to you and say

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend

When your broken heart is on the mend

Every night it's the same old crowd
In smoky rooms
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes
But it never blooms

I've been around this block a time or two
And I've made some big mistakes
But girl I promise you, I promise you
That this is the worthless evening

That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening

That you'll have to spend
'Cause it won't be long

With the shades pulled down

In this sleepy bedroom town
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything

And just so many springs
And this is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend

Just gimme a chance to show you how
To love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend, baby

'Cause I'll be there when your broken heart
Is on the mend
This is the last worthless evening

Don Henley,"The ungrateful few who tangle inside
Don't care where they're born, they're growing up wild
The rain makes her thirsty and fighting to go
Her mind turns determined, dark as a storm

So her love has grown as sharp as a bramble rose
Like a real good woman nobody knows

I get so ashamed for making you blue
I come back to this porch to make it all up to you
The rain's got me thirsty, falling wasteful and slow
I'm restless enough, I'm so scared to go

So her love has turned as hard as a bramble rose
Just a real good woman nobody knows

Do you think she'll be happy out on the wind?
Do you think she'll get halfway 'fore it's raining again?
Will she find that she's true when it's hardest to be
Or will the notions she follows have all turned on me?

Once her love has blown as far as a bramble rose
Just a real good woman nobody knows
Just a real good woman nobody knows",Bramble Rose
Don Henley,"Some folks don't like workin' hard
Some folks don't like rain
Some folks love to tell you
All about their aches and pains
Me, I take the hand I'm dealt
And I play it as it lays
It's the cost of living
And everyone pays

You can't live in memories
Of all your golden yesterdays
Or spend your whole life grieving
For the one that got away
Common sense says let her go
But your heart disobeys
It's the cost of living
And everyone pays

Blue shadows falling all around me
Still I don't regret a single day

I look in the mirror now
I see that time can be unkind
But I know every wrinkle
And I earned every line
So, wear it like a royal crown

Don Henley,"These are hard times we're living in
Nobody cuts you any slack
We got Space Age machinery, Stone Age emotions
Today a man had better watch his back
Everybody's selling somethin', the baron and the bumpkin
A man has got to fight for what is his
If what they're offering to you looks too good to be true
You can bet your bottom dollar that it is

No, thank you
I don't think so
I think I'm smellin' a rat
Don't tell me what you're gonna do for me
'Cause I've been there done that

Lady Luck's been good to me
I'm as grateful as can be
Never thought this crazy ride would ever last
And though nostalgia is fine, I respectfully decline
To spend my future living in the past
I've been carrying my load down this same old rocky road
Every day I'm getting deeper in a rut
Workin' overtime, now a dollar's worth a dime
And everybody wants a bigger cut

No, thank you
I don't think so
You must think I'm blind as a bat
I sure appreciate what you're tryin' to do for me
But I've been there, done that

Hot wind blowin' off the hill
It's a mystery to me we can't agree to disagree
It's lookin' like we never, ever will

Like a drunkard in the night, swingin' left and swingin' right
Republican or Democrat
Well, I ain't got no love for none of the above
'Cause I've been there, done that

No, thank you
I don't think so
It's a little too pat
Don't tell me to take it easy

And carried the yellow balloon

It keeps time and that isn't all
It tells me how long she's been gone
Gone to the people, the people who are

She pounded the table and brandished the broom
She turned ten thousand when she touched the moon

When we were young and pretty
We ruled the world, we stopped the time, we knew it all, we owned this city
Running with the crowd, carefree and proud I heard somebody say

Take a picture of this
Ooh, take a picture of this

The years went rushing by, in the twinkling of an eye, we rolled with the changes
Our life we knew was gone
Our friends had all moved on, time rearranges
But on our wedding day, they all came back to say, congratulations

Take a picture of this
Ooh, take a picture of this

Then we raised a family of our own
We were so happy baby
But now those kids have grown and gone

I gave it everything I had
Through the good times and the bad

How many heavens are hopelessly lost?
How many tender loves has vanity cost?
Lord, help the soul that can't be satisfied
Too much pride

You don't have to be right all the time
You can't go on with all of these axes to grind

So, why don't you lighten up and let it ride

Now Listen
Empires rise and empires fall
Stick around here long enough, you'll see it all
Now it looks like it's gone nationwide

Put copper pennies on the rails
Locomotive come and squash 'em flat

Cozy in my bed
Dreams of far-off places and other lives to be led
Swirling in my head

And there's a train in the distance
There's a whistle calling
There's a train in the distance
Silver moonlight falling

Now I am a grown man
Turning in my sleep
Debts and obligations
Family ties run deep
Promises to keep
Promises to keep

But there's a train in the distance
There's a whistle calling
There's a train in the distance
There's a light rain falling

You can ride that train to the far end of creation
Away from everything and everyone you know
You better make friends with your angels and your demons
They will be riding with you wherever you, may go
But, you have to go

But he turned out to be a reckless fool
Gone are the days when she was worry-free
Now she's a single mom, she's only twenty-three

And she's waiting tables, she's just waiting tables
She's learned a lot about people, more than she
Ever wanted to know
She's just waiting tables, waiting tables
Biding her time until there's somewhere else to go

When her workin' day is done, she tallies up her tips
And she sighs, dear Lord above,
There must be more than this
Someday she'll see this misery in her rear-view mirror
But for today she'll find a way to get along right here

And she's waiting tables, she's just waiting tables
She's learned a lot about people, more than she
Ever wanted to know
She's just waiting tables, waiting tables
Biding her time until there's somewhere else to go

One rainy night, a handsome man came in
Said he was bound for parts unknown
They talked and talked until the moon went down
But in the mornin' he was gone

Waiting tables, she's just waiting tables
Another year or two and she'll be movin' on
She's just waiting tables, waiting tables
Holding her own till somethin' better comes along

Waiting tables, she's just waiting tables
Biding her time till somethin' better comes along",Waiting Tables
Don Henley,"When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

Well, the worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone new
And you asked me if I could forget

When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

Now, you may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the sky
But you can't teach my heart to forget

That's when I'll stop loving you

Don Henley,"I've done some foolish things
I've been downright stupid
I've been a sucker for a pretty face
Lord, I was polluted
When people say, would you go back?
I say, no way, nohow
Because I like where I am now

I took it hard when I found out
That life just isn't fair
I used to bellyache and moan
But now I just don't care
I'm making one last victory lap
And then I'll take a bow
Because I like where I am now

Where I am now
Father time is a friend
I feel at home
In my own skin

There ain't no limit to the havoc he can wreak
When a young man slips into his self-destructive streak

A little space to think
Might be all we need, right now

Or not enough to drink
We've got to get over this, somehow

It only takes a breath or two
To tear your world apart
Sticks and stones may break your bones
But words can break your heart

Cutting words from careless lips, softly spoken
Oh, you can do damage and never scream and shout
Ooh, emotions get the best of us, we say things we don't mean
And it's too late to take 'em back once they're out

It only takes a breath or two
To tear your world apart
Sticks and stones may break your bones
But words can break your heart

Oh, can we just start over?

We've got to let it go

I can see it in your eyes
This isn't what you wanted
And now you realize
I ain't no knight in shining armor

Now, the merchants in the marketplace
They're selling fantasy
It's a trick of light and shadow
It's not reality
It's just a faded photograph
Of the man I used to be
You're lookin' for a younger man, not me

I knew the day I met you
It was never gonna last
You're an angel from the future
I'm an old devil from the past
So, trust me when I tell you
This is the way it's meant to be
You're looking for a younger man, not me

If you believe in better days ahead
For this crazy human race
That we will somehow be delivered
By goodness and by grace

Don Kelly,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Don Kerr,"Once I dreamed about being a part of the diamond life
Chasing after the flash of cameras and the spotlight
But now I'm chasing forever, I'm chasing forever, it's all right
Lord knows I've tried, but to no avail, 
Was chasing my tail, so I'm off chasing forever
(Chasing forever)

Once it dawned on me what a song can grant you, I learned to write
In every songbook on every piano, eternal life
So now I'm chasing forever on these scraps of paper, it gets lonely
With what's gone before me so daunting, 
It's haunt or be haunted, I'm off chasing forever
(Chasing forever)
Chasing forever
(Chasing forever)

Always wondering to no avail, 
Wondering if I'm on the right trail

Once I dreamed about being a part of that crazy world
But dreams can taunt you and fly off
 when they want to like a mockingbird, ooh-ooh
So now I'm chasing forever, I'm chasing forever, it's all right
As all through the night I lay pondering, 
Am I just wandering, lost, chasing forever?
(Chasing forever)
Chasing forever
(Chasing forever)",Chasing Forever
Don Kerr,"Who gets to heal what's broken? who has the last word spoken?
Everyone knows that the answer of course is time
And if I've disappointed you and you're all disjointed
All I can do is to hope and pray that you'll come around some day

And I'm counting on time I'm counting on time
To heal these wounds to see you through

There was a time when I was always around
Then I was carried along on the sea of dreams I guess
In the pursuit of something better I lost the one thing
That you can never replace and now your face is on my mind

So I'm counting on time I'm counting on time
To heal these wounds to see me through

It seems I'm always working towards it
With nothing to show for it
Nothing but time

Who gets to heal what's broken? who has the last word spoken?
Everyone knows that the answer of course is time sweet time",Counting on Time
Don Kerr,"Down St.Paul there is a gaping hole
Where once my Diana used to be
But summer's faded into autumn
Gone with all her golden opportunities
I was sipping on a soda
Once with my Uncle George
He said he'd take me if I was a good boy
That was long ago
A door forever closed
Still in my mind I see Diana Sweets
And the sweet sweet summers I've known
Sweet summers now long gone
When everything seems to be wrong
Diana
From Western Hill cut to my window sill
In some hotel near Krefield Germany
Am I doomed to wander every back road
Of my mind for all eternity?
Why do I keep on knocking
When there's nobody home
And calling where no one can pick up the phone?
For sentimental reasons
I keep on believing
In some faded dream of Diana Sweets
And the sweet sweet summmers I've known
Sweet summers now long gone
Diana where have you gone?

Why do we keep on knocking when there's nobody home
And calling where no one can pick up the phone?
For sentimental reasons

In some faded dream of Diana Sweets",Diana Sweets
Don Kerr,"Well I've been all around the world
He thought to himself one morning
What have I to show for it? where have I been?

He had a house on a quiet street children at play
Now it hits him where he lives I've been away
I've been away my darlings I've been away
He walks the streets of his home town
He couldn't find a soul around

He stepped into a tavern where his old bar had been
When a man inquired if he knew the score of the game
I couldn't help you there my friend I've been away
I've been away I'm sorry I've been away

There's a crescent moon upon the hill
All around is quiet and still
He walks along the service road as if in a dream
When a voice from somewhere cries is everything okay?

Can I walk beside you now? I've been away
I've been away my brother I've been away
I've been away my brother I've been away",I've Been Away
Don Kerr,"There's something 'bout a lemonade stand
That stands for all that's good
In this makeshift world of man
In his cardboard neighborhoods
Where young enterprising minds are trying
To earn some nickels and dimes
In summertime
Well, ain't life grand?
It's just one big
One big lemonade stand
There's something 'bout a lemonade stand
That stands the test of time
Just like an old tree house abandoned
Where rungs are left behind
For one who longs to climb and find
A secret place to hide
And hold back the tide
From boyhood to man
It's a bittersweet song
The song of a lemonade stand
Two serious boys
Squinting into the sun
I'll be on my way
You've got your business to run
And I got mine
It's just one big
One big lemonade stand

Much I'd love to hold you now
If you listen you'll hear my heart pound

At our window welcoming
The promise of an early spring
And a season made for loving
Miracles all around

You've only to follow the sound
Vibrating all around
Can you hear it?

It's telling me I have a choice
To condemn life or rejoice
I think I'll choose rejoicing

Don Kerr,"Underneath a perfect
Autumn coloured sky
They walked together side by side
Until another season
Caused this love to roam
One less shadow
On the road back home
A heart must have a reason
Our eyes don't understand
There seems to be some unseen hand
Moving souls together
Tearing lives apart
One less shadow
By the old schoolyard
One shadow
Still leaning out
Across a summer lawn
Trying to find out
Where all the other shadows have gone
Words can ring so hollow
When your eyes are full
Of love to comfort and console
This room without a window
This broom without a floor
One less shadow
Darkening my door
One less shadow
Darkening my door",One Less Shadow
Don Kerr,"I heard a sound I turned to see
The wind it must have been for at home there's only me
She's gone and far beyond the sea
Still I find her hand in mine although there's only me

And as I wander around the world anew
Beautiful girls pass me by but they're not you
And should I fail what would I be?
Ashamed no one to blame oh no there's only me

I'd have no one to blame oh no there's only me",Only Me

What's a boy to do to ease the pain?
Teardrops or rain
Rolling down my cheek?

And then they go
They're off somewhere

Ah, that you used to say?
(Spoken): Did you mean it baby?

And a little baby some day.
Ah!  Tell me, where did I go wrong, honey?
Whatever changed your mind, baby?
I've asked myself these questions over a million times, baby, baby.

How can I face tomorrow, 
When yesterday is all I see?
I just don't wanna face tomorrow, if you're not sharing it with me.

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,

Ties that bind
There's a temple in my mind
With an altar
Set for you
So you know my word is true

Don McLean,"In the night, while you lay sleeping
Dreaming of your amber skies
Was a poor boy broken hearted
Listening to the winds that sigh

My little darling, oh how, I love you
How I love you, none can tell
In your heart you love another
Little darling, pal of mine

Many a day, with you I've rambled
Happiest hours, with you I've spent
For I had your heart forever
But I find it's only lent

There is just three things I wish for
That's my casket, shroud and grave
When I'm dead, don't weep for me
Just like those lips that you betrayed",Pal O' Mine
Don McLean,"When evening chores are over at the ranch house on the plains
And there's nothing left to do but lay around
I saddle up my pony and go riding down the trail
Just to watch the desert sun go down

White faced cattle lowing, sagebrush everywhere
Granite spires are standing all around
I'll tell you folks it's heaven to go ridin' down the trail
Just to watch the desert sun go down

Ridin' down the canyon to watch the sun go down
A picture that no artist 'ere could paint
Cactus plants are bloomin' on the mountain side
I hear a coyote calling to its mate

Timber, timber, timber.

Oh, the mountains high, down the canyons wide
Let me roam and ride, ride thru timber
When the day is done, by the campfire's gleam
Let me lie and dream, dream of timber.

Tall timber's callin', and the echoes ring
All nature sings a song along the timber trail
Blue shadows fallin', down the canyon's vale
And the whispering pines entwine along the timber trail.

High in the sky above
The love song of the trees
Will blend and wend its way
Out on the breeze.

Tall timber's callin', and the echoes ring
All nature sings a song along the timber trail.

High in the sky above
The love song of the trees
Will blend and wend its way

Don McLean,"'Round and 'round, the years go 'round and 'round
 And many a dream is lost in the nasty city sound¡­

 Now she's down and out, everyone's above her
 Tried everything a gal could try
 She takes the notion that nobody loves her
 And here's the reason why:

 She came to the city like a good gal should
 Found a little pad in a bad neighborhood
 She learned about life and it was quite a shock
 But now she knocks 'em down with the best on the block
 Ah, right!

 Yeah, and it's really a shame too,
 'Cause she was her daddy's pride and joy

 Daddy, won't you buy that pretty dolly for me?
 It's the only toy I ever wanted
 Won't you take me for a walk in the park?
 I love the big brass band
 And the chestnut stand
 And that sad old man

 'Round and 'round, the years go 'round and 'round
 And many a dream is lost in the nasty city sound¡­

Don McLean,"Cotton candy, two for a quarter
See if the fat man can guess your weight
A big stuffed tiger is what I bought her
And I'm going home 'cause it's late

Roller coasters make me dizzy
And cotton candy makes me sick
I wish I had some Bromo fizzy
Now that would do the trick

Everyone knows that the clowns aren't happy
And everyone knows that the people don't care
I wish I could laugh at the way that they're acting
But I'm so sick, I just don't dare to

High wire dancers kick and balance
White silk horses step in time
The tattooed man displays his talents
I'm not the talented kind

I always go to the circus on Sunday
And there I can laugh at the people I see
But when I leave home in the morning on Monday
Everybody laughs at me

I make other people nervous
I guess that's why they laugh at me
But to me my life is a three-ring circus
And I can see it for free

Have you seen my wife Elvira?
She can tame a lion, you know
Well, I once had a bushy mane
But that was so damn long ago

Tight-collared clowns in plastic buildings
Have happy families as their fate
Happy jobs and happy clubs
And happy people they hate

Everyone's juggling and everyone's acting
With smiles of grease paint three feet wide
Everyone's caught on a carousel pony
And one time around is a lifetime ride",Circus Song
Don McLean,"Mornin', Mrs. Campbell
Lovely day today
I heard about the fire
I wonder what the papers say

Let's see now:
Give me fifty shotgun shells
And a hundred feet of rope
Just add that to my bill

Says here there ain't no hope
They all were burned alive
And four packs of cigarettes
No, I think I'll make it five

I heard about the wedding
I'm so happy for the bride
Why that fire house looked mighty nice
And the whole town swelled with pride

We've watched her grow to womanhood
She's found an upright man
She'll learn this life ain't easy
You do the best you can

No, no, my family ain't so good
My wife just had a spell
And I can't afford the medicine
She needs to make her well

I've been laid off at that factory
For sixteen months or more
I came home last Wednesday evenin'
I found her lyin' on the floor

Bye now, Mrs. Campbell
Say howdy to your son
You can tell him we'll go huntin'
When he gets a bigger gun

It was too bad about that fire
But don't you get me wrong
We've gotta teach these people
How to stay where they belong",General Store
Don McLean,"The angels are lost in the city of stars
Wise men are down on their knees
And the Fruitman of Freeway will sell you his cars
When he's sure that you can't find the keys
And the ladies on Magdalene Lane
All worship the sun and the sand
And the migrants who come can't complain
For this is their promised land

MGM studios can't make the nut
They're auctioning Dorothy's shoes
Gable is gone, the good witch is a slut
And I've got the parking-lot blues
The wizard brought benzedrine smiles
And he never let Dorothy doze
Ha- she died as she walked down the aisle
And all that remains is her clothes

Over the rainbow a Kansas tornado
Can twist up a little girl's head
Aunt Em's on relief and the tin man's a thief
And even the wizard can't wake the dead

The prophet has come to the kingdom of lights
But there's no one to listen or learn
And the saviour performs for the prophet's delight
While dissenters are banished or burned
And the heretics beg to be heard
But the saviour's on tour for the week
Salvation is found in his word
If only he'd learn how to speak!

And Lincoln is laughing with Amos and Andy
Concerning the great Civil War
And Paul Revere sleeps with the worst-looking creeps
While revolution's knocking at his door

Magdalene Lane is the red-light domain
Where everyone's soul is for sale
A piece of your heart will do for a start
You can send us the rest in the mail
For we have our own families to feed
And we can't let them starve just for you
But we'd rather not watch while you bleed
So come back in an hour when you're through

It's just another city full of sorrow
Makes no differ",Magdalene Lane
Don McLean,"There's no need to find a reason for your dreams
for there is always more to dreaming than there seems to be.
And I'll be thankful if through out my life you dream of me.
It's all that I could ask for while I live.
A dream is such a lovely gift to give.
Ah, da, da.

Your fragile beauty caught me in its web.
And I am held by every silver strand of love you spin.
Here in a swirl of sleeping circles all my dreams begin.
Dreams that somehow always end with you.
You're the one that makes my dreams come true.

Sleep is lovely when you sleep next to me.
And while you're dreaming let your thoughts all run free.

But if I could understand what makes you free,
then I would capture you and hold you for eternity.
But I'm afraid that would destroy the love you feel for me.
And loving you is how it has to be.
Reasons don't mean anything to me.
Loving you is how it has to be.
Reasons don't mean anything to me....",No Reason for Your Dreams
Don McLean,"There is no time to discuss or debate
What is right, what is wrong for our people
Time has run out for all those who wait
With bent limbs and minds that are feeble

And the rain falls and blows through their window
And the snow falls and blows through their door
And the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation
When the tides rise, they cover the floor

And they come from the north
And they come from the south
And they come from the hills and they valleys
And they're migrants and farmers
And miners and humans
Our census neglected to tally

And the rain falls and blows through their window
And the snow falls and blows through their door
And the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation
When the tides rise, they cover the floor

And they're African, Mexican, Caucasian, Indian
Hungry and hopeless Americans
The orphans of wealth and of adequate health
Disowned by this nation they live in

And with weather-worn hands
On bread lines they stand
Yet but one more degradation
Yes, and they're treated like tramps
While we sell them food stamps
This thriving and prosperous nation

And the rain falls and blows through their window
And the snow falls and blows through their door
And the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation
When the tides rise, they cover the floor

And with roaches and rickets and rats in the thickets
Infested, diseased, and decaying
With rags and no shoes and skin sores that ooze
By the poisonous pools they are playing

In shacks of two rooms that are rotting wood tombs
With corpses breathing inside them
Yes, and we pity their plight as they call in the night
And we do all that we can do to",Orphans of Wealth
Don McLean,"Ah, it ain't so easy is it? You almost lost your place.
And perhaps you're wondering how you're going to cope with your disgrace.
Well your wealth is well established and your friends were never few,
And all the things they told you of you're finding to be true.
Well if truth can free the guilty while the innocent must die,
Then I respect, respect, respect the coldest lie.

And you talk of human justice while you drive on fancy wheels.
And you push them to their limit just to see how nice it feels.
Well it doesn't really matter if she's living or she's dead,
You just drive away forgetting that your bumper's dipped in red.
Well if that's the kind of justice that our hall of justice claims,
Then I respect, respect, respect old Jesse James.

And most cordially they caught you and they asked you to obey.
And they threw you into prison, just in case you could not pay.
Well King Arthur jousted Lancelot, who stole away his wife;
And your lawyers jousted with the court to save your precious life.
Well if living is what matters though you lie with every breath,
Then I respect, respect, the ones we put to death.

And you won your case most easily and soon you will be free.
But there will be a million more who lose their liberty.
Not because of what they did, but what they did not do:
They did not pay a lawyer or a judge to see them through.
Why, they had no friends to call on and they could not raise their bail.
Well if winning is what matters, I respect the ones who fail",Respectable
Don McLean,"Every thread of creation is held in position
By still other strands of things living.
In an earthly tapestry hung from the skyline
Of smoldering cities so gray and so vulgar,
As not to be satisfied with their own negativity
But needing to touch all the living as well.

Every breeze that blows kindly is one crystal breath
We exhale on the blue diamond heaven.
As gentle to touch as the hands of the healer.
As soft as farewells whispered over the coffin.
We're poisoned by venom with each breath we take,
From the brown sulfur chimney and the black highway snake.

Every dawn that breaks golden is held in suspension
Like the yoke of the egg in albumen.
Where the birth and the death of unseen generations
Are interdependent in vast orchestration
And painted in colors of tapestry thread.
When the dying are born and the living are dead.

Every pulse of your heartbeat is one liquid moment
That flows through the veins of your being.
Like a river of life flowing on since creation.
Approaching the sea with each new generation.
You're now just a stagnant and rancid disgrace
That is rapidly drowning the whole human race.

Every fish that swims silent, every bird that flies freely,
Every doe that steps softly.
Every crisp leaf that falls, all the flowers that grow
On this colorful tapestry, somehow they know.
That if man is allowed to destroy all they need.
He will soon have to pay with his life, for his greed.",Tapestry
Don McLean,"On the first floor' On the first floor
On the first floor there's a young girl reeling
Her body's numb and without feeling
As illusions dance on the midnight ceiling
Now she's falling, now she's kneeling
It's almost like she's bowed in prayer
A savior she's about to bear
She screams for help, but no one's there
On the first floor
On the first floor people walk the halls
But none can hear her desperate calls
There is no sound beyond the walls
So to the telephone she crawls
She telephones her only friend
The one on whom she can depend
But the phone rings on without an end
Then rings no more On the first floor
There's a party on the second floor
And through the picture window you can see them all
They're laughing and they're dancing
Admiring the Renoir that's hanging on the wall
But in the master bedroom where the coats are piled high
A silent, saddened lady thinks of what it's like to die
And as she dwells on all the years she still has left to face
She wonders how she'll ever find someone to take his place
Then suddenly she's jarred by the ringing of the phone
Oh, why do you ring now, just when I want to be alone?
So she walks into the bathroom and drinks some water from a cup
But the telephone stops ringing just before she picks it up
My family was very poor
So I worked hard to be secure
I married one I had to wed
And not the one I loved instead
When I was young my blood ran wild
But we stayed married for the child
Now three flights up, I'm all alone
My wife is dead, my child is grown
My daughter leads a wayward life
She's been a failure as a wife
And though she lives just one floor down
She never calls or comes around
Step off the platform and onto the train
Look out your window and into the rain
Watch all the buildings that pass as you ride
And count all the stories that go on inside
And then ask yourself if it must be this way
Should walls and doors and plaster ceilings
Separate us from each others' feelings?",Three Flights Up
Don McLean,"I've got nothing on my mind: Nothing to remember, 
Nothing to forget. And I've got nothing to regret, 
But I'm all tied up on the inside, 
No one knows quite what I've got; 
And I know that on the outside 
What I used to be, I'm not anymore. 

You know I've heard about people like me, 
But I never made the connection. 
They walk one road to set them free 
And find they've gone the wrong direction. 

But there's no need for turning back 
'Cause all roads lead to where I stand. 
And I believe I'll walk them all 
No matter what I may have planned. 

Can you remember who I was? Can you still feel it? 
Can you find my pain? Can you heal it? 
Then lay your hands upon me now 
And cast this darkness from my soul. 
You alone can light my way. 
You alone can make me whole once again. 

We've walked both sides of every street 
Through all kinds of windy weather. 
But that was never our defeat 
As long as we could walk together. 

So there's no need for turning back 
'Cause all roads lead to where we stand. 
And I believe we'll walk them all 
No matter what we may have planned.",Crossroads
Don McLean,"One, two, three, four!

You see, everybody loves me, baby, what's the matter with you?
Won'tcha tell me what did I do to offend you?

Now the purest race I've bred for thee to live in my democracy
And the highest human pedigree awaits your first-born boy, baby
And my face on ev'ry coin engraved, the anarchists are all enslaved
My own flag is forever waved by the grateful people I have saved

You see, everybody loves me, baby, what's the matter with you?
Won'tcha tell me what did I do to offend you?

Now, no land is beyond my claim when the land is seized in the people's name
By evil men who rob and maim, if war is hell, I'm not to blame!
Why, you can't blame me, I'm Heaven's child, I'm the second son of Mary mild
And I'm twice removed from Oscar Wilde, but he didn't mind, why, he just smiled

Yes, and the ocean parts when I walk through, and the clouds dissolve and the sky turns blue
I'm held in very great value by everyone I meet but you
'cause I've used my talents as I could, I've done some bad, I've done some good
I did a whole lot better than they thought I would so, c'mon and treat me like you should!

Because everybody loves me, baby, what's the matter with you?
Won'tcha tell me what did I do to offend you?

Don McLean,"The grave that they dug him had flowers
Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors
And the brown earth bleached white
At the edge of his gravestone
He's gone

When the wars of our nation did beckon
The man, barely twenty, did answer the calling
Proud of the trust
That he placed in our nation
He's gone

But eternity knows him
And it knows what we've done

And the rain fell like pearls
On the leaves of the flowers
Leaving brown, muddy clay
Where the earth had been dry

And deep in the trench
He waited for hours
As he held to his rifle
And prayed not to die

But the silence of night
Was shattered by fire
As the guns and grenades
Blasted sharp through the air

One after another
His comrades were slaughtered
In the morgue of marines
Alone, standing there

He crouched ever lower
Ever lower, with fear
â??They can't let me die
They can't let me die here!

I'll cover myself
With the mud and the earth
I'll cover myself
I know I'm not brave!

The earth is my grave.â??

Don McLean,"The spirit of Fatima still rules the Earth

Sister Fatima has God-given powers
And on 42nd Street a shop that sells flowers
Is her palace, come and be healed

She knows all your business, your health and your ills
She'll counsel your weddings, divorces and wills
For full restoration five dollars an hour
And with each consultation a free holy flower
And if she likes you, well you can have two

And I came from nowhere like you and your friend
My searching and wandering went on without end
My future was dim, my spirit was crushed
In one sacred moment my questions were hushed

A humble recruit of the taffeta booth
Where all things are known but few are revealed
Sins are forgotten and sickness is healed
For five dollars the flower is free",Sister Fatima
Don McLean,"You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I'm happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

Well, I searched and I searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To find peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

Well, you'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To find peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Take your troubles to a chapel
And you'll surely find the way

Don McLean,"Windows in a silent room, sunlight burns the walls to black
Angles and dimensions melt while colors drip and pillows crack
Reflections of my memories like pictures pasted on a sheet
The ribbon film of separate frames lying curled up at my feet 

The film is just a snake design and the photographs are fading fast
These are not memories of mine I have no future, no past

I've seen a thousand afternoons dissolve into the night
Like sugar crystals on a spoon they disappear from sight

Gray days from the crispest morning to the warmest afternoon in this room

And I like to draw the face I saw so long ago
My image in the mirror tells the jagged lines which way to go

The black and white description of the sole survivor of the Holocaust
All the rest were lost 

Do you see this paper face? It has no color or no mood
My eyes are ageless, as am I. I need no sleep, I need no food
I am a king, but like a child the other children laugh at me
Tongues of fire, wagging wild they dance around me merrily 

I'll kill them all and if I fail I'll kill whoever I can find
Then they'll beg me to be kind

My eyes have seen far more than eyes can ever tell
This planet plunged through mushroom fires of earthly hell

I know that my sweet Jesus said that he'd return
But Babylon has fallen and the cities burn",Aftermath [*]
Don McLean,"I can't answer the questions you ask me,
I don't know what to say.
The answers are somewhere lost in the stars
when the night has turned to day.
But I know if the silence of night could be here,
It would drift through my soul and calm all my fear
And I could reach out and draw you so near to me

Touch me and warm me and I will lie still.
And all that you ask me to give you I will
One living moment we'll have for our own.
A brief flash of time that we spent all alone.
But you ask me for nothing and give what you can
And we're wrapped in a pillow of sleep once again
And my memory drifts through the universe when we are one

Closely we're falling through time
And the earth will turn in the silence of space,
always in motion yet always in place
And all things will change yet remain what they are.
And far will be near and near will be far
And the ages will darken and blend into time
And all that is poetry will no longer rhyme
But our moment together is forever sublime

For the time has arrived when we must understand
That we're lost in a void on this sad speck of sand
And nobody knows where we are, no one cares
And the tears that we shed in the dark no one cares
And the madmen who plunder this world for their fame
Have forgotten that no one remembers their name
But time and the universe are always the same

Closely we're falling through time",Falling Through Time
Don McLean,"It started out quite simply, as complex things can do;
A set of sad transparencies till no one could see through,
But least of all the one inside, behind the iron glass;
A prisoner of all your dreams that never come to pass.

Alone you stand, corrupted by the vision that you sought,
And blinded by your hunger, all your appetites are bought,
But in spite of what becomes of you, your image will remain;
A reminder of your constant loss, a symbol of your gain.

And your friends are together,
Where the people are all gathered,
All along the road you traveled all your days.

And soon, you have succumbed to what the others all believe,
And though the lie affects them still it's you that they deceive,
And all at once you're lost within the emptiness of you,
And there's no one left who's near enough to tell you what to do.

You're left with nothing but your self-potential in the dark,
Like tinder resting on a rock, protected from the spark,
But your fire just consumes you, you alone can feel the pain,
And you stand in all your glory and you know you can't complain. 

But your friends are together,
Where the people are all gathered,
All along the road you traveled all your days.

But you are surely just as evil as the worst my tongue can tell,
For you'll never face my heaven and I'll not endure your hell.
You have lost the chance to mingle by your constant, quiet lies;
Deceptions hidden with your lips, but spoken with your eyes.

For I know you for what you are, not for that's really all you are.
And your talents of a minor order seem to stretch too far.
And we both know that this masquerade can't carry on too long.
You're deep inside the Pride Parade, but where do you belong?

And your friends are together,
Where the people are all gathered,
All along the road you traveled all your days.",The Pride Parade
Don McLean,"You saw me crying in the chapel.
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
We gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

Ev'ry sinner looks for something
That will put his heart at ease
There is only one true answer
He must get down on his knees

Meet your neighbor in the chapel
Join with him in tears of joy
You'll know the meaning of contentment
Then you'll be happy with the Lord

You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way",Crying in the Chapel
Don McLean,"Did you know that love can grow any place where people go,
And I can tell by what I see that you have found a place with me.
The sun is high the day is new and
I have found a place with you.

Every place and every face casts a spell and leaves a trace,
With you in mind and with you near, the myth is gone, the past is clear
And here with scars of now and then so you and I begin again.

Did you know I've been searchin'? Did you know I've been blind?
Did you know I've been touchin' anything I could find?

Did you know that here below, moving where my feelings flow,
You live with me in time that's new, suspended in a love that's true
And far beyond the fatal noise and bathed in all life's simple joys.

Did you know that love can grow any place where people go,
And I can tell by what I see that you have found a place with me.",Did You Know
Don McLean,"Rust on your fingers, you got trouble at your feet.
Keep the home fires burning, but look out for the heat
'cause there's a man at the window who knows just what you think,
And there's a water boy behind you who won't give you a drink

Well it's a hard, hard time, no easy road in sight,
It takes a great big man to win a great big fight.

When it comes to dying, no matter what you tell,
They'll let you into a heaven 'cause you lived your life in hell.
Well they've got no way to reward you but to let those breezes blow,
And you've got nothing left to do but to let your anger show.

'Cause it's a hard, hard time, no easy road in sight,
It takes a great big man to win a great big fight.

Think about your baby, think about your wife,
Think about your banker who's trying to take your life.
Think about this planet that's rolling through the night.
Oh can you turn your back on such a great big fight?

You got the muscle, big man, you got the power,
But you're getting weaker with each passing hour.
Just like a flame in the rain, like a light in the night,
Well if it's you that must stay, well then it's you that must fight!

'Cause it's a hard, hard time, your future's not bright,
It takes a great big man to win a great big
Great big man to win a great big fight.",Great Big Man
Don McLean,"I was walking by the graveyard, late last Friday night,
I heard somebody yelling, it sounded like a fight.
It was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night,
Pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight.
So often have I wondered where these homeless brothers go,
Down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show,
Where the police cannot find them, where the wanted men can go.
There's freedom when your walking, even though you're walking slow.

Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
That homeless brother is my friend.

It's hard to be a pack rat, it's hard to be a 'bo,
But living's so much harder where the heartless people go.
Somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know
That Jesus on the highway was a lost hobo.
And they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill,
And they see the ragged tatters as another kind of thrill.
And they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill,
And they're sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill.

Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
That homeless brother is my friend.

Somewhere there was a woman, somewhere there was a child,
Somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild.
But some where's just like nowhere when you leave it for a while,
You'll find the broken-hearted when you're travelling jungle-style.
Down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men,
Where those who keep their senses have them taken back again,
Where the night stick cracks with crazy rage, where madmen don't
Pretend,
Where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end.

Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
That homeless brothe",Homeless Brother
Don McLean,"If you wanna make me happy

Think I'll take a summer trip
On a sunny sailing ship

When the weather gets this cold. That's why

Since the day we broke apart.

The sandman says maybe he'll take you above,
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows,
Where babies float by just 
Counting their toes.

At the beginning or is it the end?

Love whom you will, but doubt what you hear.
They'll whisper sweet things to make untrue.

You can do.

Don McLean,"You have lived such a gentle life upon this earth
that I am stunned by your sight.
If I could give but a token of the love you have,
then I might not be this lonely tonight.

Let them have their smug and their cool, confined by fashion and peer.
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere.
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere.

Oh, there are so few brave one's like you. Need I explain?
Never wondering what to do, what to venture, what to gain.

And, you have loved, in a total way, from flesh to soul.
You speak, without coy without pose.
Your eyes can see that the emperor has lost his clothes.
And what's more, you'll tell the whole world what he stole.

Forgivin' you is just a waste of time
I don't believe that I'll live to regret it
You're ancient history to this heart of mine

So many times I've heard the same old stories
Why, any fool can learn to read between the lines
But this time, honey, you've burned all your bridges
You're ancient history to this heart of mine

Well I've marked you down as just another lonely page
In the book of heartaches that you leave behind

All the wonders love can bring
Give us strength and understanding
Give us all one song to sing
Let the music play
Play it loud and make it clear
It's time to stand up
To a new world that is now so near
From the bottom to the top
To the leaders of the land
We all have one heart
Everyone of us must lend a hand
And let there be joy in the world
And let there be no sorrow

And let there be peace on earth
And let there be peace on earth
For all the world

What a blessed thing (oh, yeah)

All the walls are falling down
No more children off to war
If we search in our hearts
All the suffering will be no more
And let there be joy in the world
And let there be no sorrow
For all god's children
Let them see
That love, oh love
What a blessed thing (oh, yeah)

Don McLean,"If I could say the things I feel, it wouldn't be the same
Some things are not spoken of, some things have no name
Though the words come hard to me, I'll say them just for you
For this is something rare for me this feeling is so new

You see I love the way you love me
I love the way you smile at me
I love the way we live this life we're in

Long ago I heard the song that lovers sing to me
And through the days with each new phrase I hummed that melody
And all along I loved the song but I never learned it through
But since the day you came along, I've saved it just for you

I don't believe in magic but I do believe in you
And when you say you believe in me
There's so much magic I can do

Now you see me now you don't watch me dive below
Deep down in your love lake where the sweet fish come and go
And I might sink and I might drown but death don't mean a thing
'Cause life continues right or wrong when I play this birthday song
I learned from you, and you can't even sing



",Birthday Song
Don McLean,"I coulda been most anything I put my mind to be,
But a cowboy's life was the only life for me.
It's a strong man's occupation ridin' herd and livin' free,
But strong men often fail
Where shrewd men can prevail,
I'm an old man now with nothin' left to say,
But oh god how I worked my youth away.

Well you may not recognize my face, I used to be a star,
A cowboy hero known both near and far.
I perched upon a silver mount and sang with my guitar,
But the studio of course,
owned my saddle and my horse,
But that six-gun on the wall belongs to me,
Oh god I can't live a memory.

You know I'd like to put my finger on that trigger once again,
And point that gun at all the prideful men.
All the voyeurs and the lawyers who can pull a fountain pen,
And put you where they choose,
With the language that they use,
And enslave you till you work your youth away,
Oh god how I worked my youth away.

Whoopee ty yioh
Whoopee ty yi ay,
One man's work is another man's play
Oh God how I worked my youth away.

You see I always liked the notion of a cowboy fighting crime,
This photograph was taken in my prime,
I could beat those desperados but there's no sense fightin' time,
But the singin' was a ball
'Cause I'm not musical at all,
I moved my lips to someone else's voice.

I coulda been most anything I put my mind to be,
But a cowboy's life was the only life for me.
It's a strong man's occupation ridin' herd and livin' free,
But strong men often fail
Where shrewd men can prevail,
I'm an old man now with nothin' left to say,
But oh god how I worked my youth away.",Bronco Bill's Lament
Don McLean,"On the first floor On the first floor

On the first floor there's a young girl reeling
Her body's numb and without feeling
As illusions dance on the midnight ceiling
Now she's falling, now she's kneeling

It's almost like she's bowed in prayer
A savior she's about to bear
She screams for help, but no one's there
On the first floor

On the first floor people walk the halls
But none can hear her desperate calls
There is no sound beyond the walls
So to the telephone she crawls

She telephones her only friend
The one on whom she can depend
But the phone rings on without an end
Then rings no more
On the first floor

There's a party on the second floor
And through the picture window you can see them all
They're laughing and they're dancing
Admiring the Renoir that's hanging on the wall

But in the master bedroom where the coats are piled high
A silent, saddened lady thinks of what it's like to die
And as she dwells on all the years she still has left to face
She wonders how she'll ever find someone to take his place

Then suddenly she's jarred by the ringing of the phone
Oh, why do you ring now, just when I want to be alone?
So she walks into the bathroom and drinks some water from a cup
But the telephone stops ringing just before she picks it up

My family was very poor
So I worked hard to be secure
I married one I had to wed
And not the one I loved instead

When I was young my blood ran wild
But we stayed married for the child
Now three flights up, I'm all alone
My wife is dead, my child is grown

My daughter leads a wayward life
She's been a failure as a wife
And though she lives just one floor down
She never calls or comes around

Step off the platform and onto the train
Look out your window and into the rain
Watch all the buildings that pass as you ride
And count all the stories that go on inside
And then ask yourself if it must be this way
Should walls and doors and plaster ceilings
Separate us from each others' feelings?",Castles in the Air (Three Flights Up)
Don McLean,"I feel the trembling tingle of a sleepless night 
Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright 
Beams of blue come flickering through my window pane 
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame 

And I wonder if you know 
That I never understood 
That although you said you'd go 
Until you did I never thought you would 

Moonlight used to bathe the contours of your face 
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case 
And the fragrance of your flowers rest beneath my head 
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead 

And I wonder if you know 
That I never understood 
That although you said you'd go 
Until you did I never thought you would 

Never thought the words you said were true 
Never thought you said just what you meant 
Never knew how much I needed you 
Never thought you'd leave, until you went 

Morning comes and morning goes with no regret 
And evening brings the memories I can't forget 
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs 
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs 

And I wonder if you know 
That I never understood 
That although you said you'd go 
Until you did I never thought you would",Empty Chairs

Happy trails to you, keep smilin' until then.

Happy trails to you, 'till we meet again.

Some trails are happy ones,
Others are blue.
It's the way you ride the trail that counts,
Here's a happy one for you.

Don McLean,"South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love, when the stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while I kissed a smile upon her face
'Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered, manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as a whispered, manana
'Cause our tomorrow never came

South of the border, I jumped back one day
There in a veil of white, by the candlelight, she knelt to pray
The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border, Mexico way

The mission bells told me, ding, dong, that I must not stay
Stay South of the border, down Mexico way",South of the Border
Don McLean,"When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world.
It's the end of a world that you had with a girl.
Though it's hard to admit that the memory's sad
when you think what you had, when a good thing goes bad.

Love is so strange, it's a mystery to me.
It's easy to change and to lose what could be.
So you wait and you watch for the one who'll agree
with the things that you need and the life that you lead.

When a good thing goes right, it's a joy beyond worth.
As the roots of your love intertwine with the earth.
And your bodies are one, but you're living for two
and your future looks bright, oh yes, when a good thing goes right.

But time is the test, like the sea pounds the rocks.
And those who love best sometimes fail with the shocks.
And the waves break you down and you watch your love drown.
And she's so far from reach as you stand on the beach.

When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world.
It's the end of a world that you had with a girl.
Though it's hard to admit that the memory's sad
when you think what you had, when a good thing goes bad.",When a Good Thing Goes Bad
Don McLean,"In someone's hand there is a land, where I must surely go, where she is, 
to learn what she must know, when she gives all her love away. 
To him that seems as in her dreams, unbroken by the storm on the sea, 
But quiet deep and warm ever free, to give his love away. 
And when these two have found the land, the world is not the same, 
For though it spins when love begins, the world is not the same. 

This is one change I always have longed for,
I always belonged more to you than to anyone
and in your hand the stars the sand, the rain and wind are new, as we live 
and learn what love can do, when we give all our love away. 
And now we too have found the land, the world is not the same, 
For though it spins when love begins, the world is not the same.",When Love Begins
Don McLean,"I'm walkin' away, and leavin' you standin'
I've nothing to say, for I've said it all the best way I know how
Cry, cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
'Cause that's the wrong thing to do.
Does it ease you to know, that I've thought about stayin'
Yet I think I will go, and let the words of goodbye go unsaid
Speak, speak if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
'Cause that's the wrong thing to do.

All the words that you whisper are words that have nothing to say
And the thoughts they reveal are the reasons I'm goin' away
From the touch of your voice, I can feel separation
So you leave me no choice, for to remain would mean living apart
Touch, touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
'Cause that's the wrong thing to do.
That's the wrong thing to do.
That's the wrong thing to do.",The Wrong Thing to Do
Don McLean,"In the beginning there was nothingness and God but waved his hand
And from the endless void there sprang the beauty of the land
And high above the canyon walls the diamond stars were new
And breezes blew from nothingness and herbs and grasses grew
And silent creatures roamed the Earth and multiplied their [Do7]kind
And man was but a molecule that God had left behind.

[Chorus:]
We have grown we have grown, we have captured the throne
Of the kingdom God made for our winning.
We have grown we have grown, but our children alone
Have so little time left for beginning.

And mountains sprang and chaos rang the overture of life
And rivers coursed the twisted blade of natures sharpest knife
And cut beneath the rolling dales a gateway to the sea
While tidal waves and mighty gales were heard in symphony
And sunshine fell upon the waves and warmed the virgin land
And from the mud a drop of blood was left upon the sand.

(Chorus)
And eagles flew from craggy peaks above the garden wall.
The drop of blood became a man, the tree of life grew tall.
And perfect in his loneliness, a rib pulled from his chest
Formed a sweet companion of pulchritude and breast.
And from the tree of knowledge God said they could not eat.
And perfect was their paradise unto the serpent at their feet.

(Chorus)
Tree of knowledge, tree of death, upon the ground they trod.
The serpent said your eye's will see and ye will be a god.
Defy the word and eat the fruit and ye will never die
And you will chart your destiny and rule the Earth and sky.
And man was banished east of Eden. See what we have lost.
For though the father sets the price, the children pay the cost.

(Chorus)",Genesis (In the Beginning)
Don McLean,"If you could read my mind, love,
What a tale my thoughts could tell.
Just like an old time movie,
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well.
In a castle dark or a fortress strong,
With chains upon my feet.
You know that ghost is me.
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.

If I could read your mind, love,
What a tale your thoughts could tell.
Just like a paperback novel,
The kind the drugstores sell.
When you reached the part 
where the heartaches come,
The hero would be me.
But heroes often fail,
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take!

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script.
Enter number two:
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me.
But for now, love, let's be real;
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.
I don't know where we went wrong,
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back.

And if you read between the lines,
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelin's that you lack.

Don McLean,"It's a wonderful night and the music is right
Will you dance with me and hold me tight
I don't know why I feel this way
It's how I feel when they start to play
That old song we heard so long ago
That I wonder if I can remember every word

It's amazing how fast years have gone past
And that some kinds of love just don't seem to last
But win or loose, I love you still
It's you I choose and I always will
And that old song we heard so long ago
Still reminds me of the girl I used to know

But that's all in a dream that's been over for years
Now things are what they seem, only minus the tears

So, I think of you now the way you were then
And I'll manage somehow to keep trying again
But I don't mind if you don't write
Cause I recall that magic night
And that old song we heard so long ago
Was more beautiful than the love we used to share
Yes, that old song we heard so long ago
Was more beautiful than the love we used to share
Yes that old song ...",Wonderful Night

Don McLean,"[Chorus]
Isn't it strange how a man hides his feelings?
Sometimes the one that he loves never knows.
And isn't strange when she's finally leaving
That it all starts to show when she goes.

I passed my friend, he didn't look the way he did before
I always knew he was a stronger man than me.
I asked my friend if he needed any help from me.
He said she's all I need, I know you know.
I only wish I had told her long ago.

[Chorus] 

I once found love, but never got beyond my selfish dreams.
I took for granted that she'd be there every day.
I closed her out, knowing she could never change he lovin' ways.
Things fell apart and she got scared.
I wonder if she knew how much I really cared.

Isn't it strange how a man hides his feelings?
Sometimes the one that he loves never knows.
And isn't strange when she's finally leaving
That it all starts to show when she goes, starts to go away.
Yeah, isn't it strange when she's finally leaving
That it all starts to show when she goes.

You may find love, if you do you're fortunate.
'Cause that's the rarest thing in all the world you'll find.
Someone who cares, who shares the good an bad of it.
You just make sure she understands how much you care
And wherever you may go she will be there.

Isn't it strange how a man hides his feelings?
Sometimes the one that he loves never knows.
And isn't strange when she's finally leaving
That it all starts to show when she goes, starts to go away.",Isn't It Strange

Don McLean,"[Chorus]
Well I've been left for dead on the road of love.
I was doin' high speed with a load of love
Forgot the first creed in the code of love.
All's fair in love and war.

Well I'm an honest man and I try to be true.
I did unto her like I'll do unto you.
Now you prefer to tell me we're through.
I'm bleedin' through my shirt and tie.
I'm bleedin' and I'll tell you why.

[Chorus]

Well now who is the guy and when did he come?
When did he start to go beatin' your drum?
Well he's hittin' on you. I'm feelin' numb
And she don't believe a word I told her.
I'm cryin' on a gravel shoulder.

[Chorus]

Watch what you're doin'.
Look where you're goin'.
Give me a signal.
Some way of knowin'.
Well now who's at the wheel in the life that drove by.
I could swear it was her made me shift into high.
She's got those dangerous curves
And they're wrackin' my nerves
She always wiggles and swerves.
She's gonna give her driver everything he deserves.

Well now who could want this to lie here alone
With a palate of bricks, a pillow of stone.
Well to think that one kiss pulled me out o' my zone
And I wonder what's the change inside her?
This road has got a long divider.

I know a thing or two I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot

Some fools fool themselves, I guess, they're not foolin' me

Some believe in Mohammed. I don't believe that's true.

Well her dreams have all been shattered, her dignity defiled.
She has lost her way but she must stay

And the silence is broken, and the night is on fire.

It's like chain lightning, this love that I feel.
Who know's where it strikes or when it will hit,
How long it will last, or when it will quit.

In the forest I'm burning, struck down by the blast
The fever is churning, and the heat rises fast.
And those standing nearest can show their concern
But I swear if they touch me that they too will burn.
They fear for their lives for death will soon dwell
In the warmth of your love is the fire of hell.

[Chorus]

And soon the sparks scatter and wind whips the flame
And love will soon shatter what it cannot tame
And the cycle continues, from life into dust
For I am now in you with the fire of lust.
And I hear the explosion, of thunder and rain,
The water is falling, the ashes remain.

[Chorus]

The Indian's tell us that the Phoenix can rise
From the smoldering ashes that once were my eyes
And watch beautiful colours from black and from grey
Be formed into wings and take me away
Where evil is darkness and goodness is light
And love is the lightning that cuts through the night
And strikes only once in a dark place in time
And forms a gold stairway that all of us climb.",Chain Lightning

Straight.
It's been a long time now and i'm really insecure about it all.

For richer, for poorer, 'till we both have grown old
Through all of life's seasons, to have and to hold

And if we can have children, or live all alone
The light of our love, will forever be shown
Our union is timeless, our love beyond worth
To have and to hold, 'till the ends of the earth

To have and to hold, 'till death do us part
In sickness or health, with all the love in my heart
For richer, for poorer, 'till we both have grown old

What will the world be like when you're almost grown?
What will the world be like when you pack your things,
when you leave your home?
What in the world will tomorrow bring?

Will you be safe in the sweet arms of love?
Will you be true to yourself and the things you believe?

What will the world be like when you need a friend?
What will the world be like when you're on the mend?
What will the world be like when you go astray,
and you slip and fall?

Will you find peace and forgiveness and joy?
Will you have children yourself, and be worried like me?

Don McLean,"And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know

I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand

And yes, I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do

The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but love is dead
That is my belief

And yes, I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know",And I Love You So
Don McLean,"And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired of Castles in the Air
I've got a dream I want the world to share in castle walls
Just leave me to despair

Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky
A dream come true, I'll live there 'til I die
I'm asking you, to say my last goodbye
The love we knew, ain't worth another try

Save me from all the trouble and the pain
I know I'm weak but I can't face that girl again
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain

Oh, but how can words express the feel of sunlight
In the morning in the hills away from city strife
I need a country woman for my wife
I'm city born but I love the country life

For I can not be part of her ""Cocktail-Generation Partner's Waltz,""
Devoid of all romance
The music plays and everyone must dance
I'm bowing out, I need a second chance

Save me from all the trouble and the pain
I know I'm weak but I can't face that girl again
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain

And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you

Just leave me to despair",Castles in the Air
Don McLean,"I was all right for a while, I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say ""Hello""
And though you wished me well, you couldn't tell

That I'd been crying over you, crying over you
Then you said ""so long"" left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying crying
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you but it's tru-ue, so true
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do
For you don't love me and I'll always be

Crying over you, crying over you
Yes, now you're gone and from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
Yeah crying, crying, over you",Crying

This is livin' in the U. S. A.
Well this is life, this is Prime Time
This is livin' the American way

I was ridin' on the subway in the afternoon
I saw some kids 'a beatin' out a funky tune
The lady right in front of me was old and brown
The kids began to push her, they knocked her down
I tried to help her out but there was just no way
A life ain't worth a damn on the street today
I passed the ambulance and the camera crews
I saw the instant replay on the evening news

Well this is life, this is Prime time
This is livin' in the U. S. A.
Well this is life, this is Prime Time
This is livin' the American way

Well will you take the car, or will you take the trip?
Remove annoying hair from your upper lip
What's it really worth? Does she really care?
What's the best shampoo that I can use on my hair?
Hey what's the real future of democracy?
How're we gonna streamline the bureaucracy?
Hey, hey, the cost of life has gone sky-high
Does the deodorant I'm using really keep me dry?

Well this is life, this is Prime time
This is livin' in the U. S. A.
Well this is life, this is Prime Time
This is livin' the American way

Well spin the magic wheel and try to break the bank
Think about your life when you fill in the blank
Here's a game that's real if you wanna try
One spot on the wheel that says you must die
American roulette is the game we play
But no-one wants to have to be the one to pay
You get to pass ""GO"", you get to pass away
But before we start our show, here's our sponsor to say:

""Well this is life, this is Prime time
This is livin' in the U. S. A.
Well this is life, this is Prime time
This is livin' in the U. S. A.

Well down in Mexico, the laundry's on the line
There's where you can go if you land on the nine
Canada is nice if you're fond of ice
If you land on the two then we'll send you there twice
We interrupt this game for a news release:
A man has gone insane and been killed by police!
Now back to the game, that's a dangerous play
'Cause if they see you in C-U-B-A you must pass away

Well this is life, this is Prime time
This is livin' in the U. S. A.
Well this is life, this is Prime Time
This is livin' the American way

My supper's on the stove, the war is on the screen
Pass the bread and butter while I watch the Marine
The shot him in the chest--Pass the chicken breast!
The general is saying that he's still unimpressed.
""We had to burn the city 'cause they wouldn't agree
That things go better with democracy!""
The weather will be fair, forget the ozone layer,
But strontium showers will be here and there

Well this is life, this is Prime time
This is livin' in the U. S. A.
Well this is life, this is Prime Time
This is livin' the American way

Well livin' in the country watchin' shadows fall
My reception ain't too good in a power stall
Bombers in the air, missiles in the sea
Chemicals in everything, including me
They don't keep their promise in the promised land
It's getting mighty hard to find an honest man
But coming very soon, a show you'll die to see
It's called ""The End Of The World"", on channel ""C""

Don McLean,"No-one can take your place with me, 
And time has proven that I'm right. 
There's no place I'd rather be, 
Than at your place for the night. 

No time can pass your sight unseen. 
No moment steals away unfound. 
Lifetime lived in such a dream, 
Floats like a feather to the ground. 

[Chorus] 
And for the first time I've been seeing 
The things I'd never notice, without you. 
And for the first time I'm discovering 
The things I use to treasure, about you. 

The birds like leaves on Winterwood, 
Sing hopeful songs on dismal days. 
They've learned to live life as they should. 
They are at peace with natures ways. 

You are as natural as the night, 
And all that springs from you is good. 
And the children born beneath your light, 
Are like the birds on Winterwood.

You stayed away both day and night

Just let me ride your box car
And I'll hobo with you

Don McLean,"The winter season of the year,
When to this world our Lord was born,
The ox and donkey, so they say,
Did keep his holy presence warm.
How many oxen and donkeys now
If they were there when first he came,
How many oxen and donkeys you know
At such a time would do the same?

And on that night it has been told
These humble beasts so rough and rude,
Throughout the noght of holy birth
Drank no water, ate no food.
How many oxen and donkeys now
If they were there when first he came,
How many oxen and donkeys you know
At such a time would do the same? 

As soon as to these humble beasts
Appeared our Lord, so mild and sweet,
With joy they knelt before his Grace
And gently kissed His tiny feet.
How many oxen and donkeys now
Dressed in ermine, silk and such,
How many oxen and donkeys you know
At such a time would do as much?",Burgundian Carol

Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light

Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

When lo! above the earth
Rang out the angels chorus
That hailed the Savior's birth

Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Don McLean,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy",God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen
Don McLean,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

Don McLean,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening, 
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man, 
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, 
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.",Winter Wonderland
Don McLean,"In Nineteen Sixty Seven the draft caught up with me,
Me and my pal Joe went off to war.
We might find hero's heaven, but we'd keep the country free.
We would surely win just like before.
Roy Rogers he was on his horse, and Buck Jones drew his gun.
We would surely win of course when the battle was all done.

Nineteen Sixty Seven I came back alone,
They brought Joe back in plastic on the plane.
Nineteen Sixty Seven seems so long ago,
But I can't forget my friend or ease my pain.
His family may forget him, his children may regret him,
His wife may find another and go on.
His picture may grow faded and the world he knew gone jaded
But as long as I shall live I surely know,
I never will forget my buddy Joe.

In Nineteen Sixty Seven, the war was raging on,
Our country was divided and reborn.
Though I was back at home, I had never left Saigon,
'cause all I got was ridicule and scorn.
This was no place for hero's now, they all seemed to resent me,
They said",1967
Don McLean,"[Chorus:]
I hate fashion, I hate it with a passion
are you a fashion victim, are you a fashion victim
are you a fashion victim, I bet you are.

I see them on the video, they're wearin' fashion shoes.
They're singin' 'bout their troubles. They never paid their dues.
The rhythm's in the background, the fashion's in the front.
They tricked us out of music with this latest fashion stunt.

(Chorus)

The candidate is handsome, he's wearin' tailored clothes.
He's following the pollster everywhere he goes.
His teeth have all been straightened, his hair is very full.
His stupidity is hidden by this image-making bull.

(Chorus)

School is just a showcase where fashion children go.
As long as they look cool, there's little they should know.
Ideas have no power when people cannot read.
Fashion can go sour, it's not cool to be in need.

(Chorus)

How did the land of Jefferson, how did the land of King
become the land of hamburgers and raisins that can sing?
Roosevelt was cripple, Lincoln was a geek.
They'd never get elected, their clothes were never chic.

Don McLean,"Have you seen me I just might be your little baby?
Have you seen me I'm lookin' at you with grown up eyes?

I had a fight with papa and he really likes to swing his fist.
I'm sick and tired of all those stupid rules they hand me.
They try to make me feel I have no right to exist.

I've seen what the grown ups do.
I've seen I can do that too.
Have you seen me?

Well I'm older now than I was the day I vanished.
You might not even know me if you saw me passin' by.

turn your face, walk inside.
Can't close your doors, because I'm yours.

Well I'm fighting in Nicaragua, I'm fighting in Afghanistan.
In Israel I wear a gun, in Palestine a rock is in my hand.
In Africa you see me starve, in America they just throw me away.

One thing you can bet, you won't see it set in infinity.
Gonna take a light beam, on the wings of the Jet Stream.
Gonna take my place in the infinite space of infinity.
How can I be friends with infinity? Can I make ammends with infinity?
How can I complain to infinity? What'll I explain to infinity?

(Chorus)

Give me just a time shield before the world has it's fate sealed.
Protect me for a while before they turn my dial to infinity.
I hope I can contribute, oh, but I don't want a tribute.
Hypocrites will come and say somethin' really dumb in infinity.
I can't hear you sing in infinity. I can't change a thing in infinity.
The absence of light in infinity gives me a fright in infinity.

(Chorus)",Infinity
Don McLean,"A step in the right direction, a stitch in time saves nine
To me you are perfection, and the love you saved was mine.
When I think of all the girls that I've ever kissed
And the ones that I'd wished I could know,
It's a real short list with just one name, you're one in a row.

You're a class by yourself
You're the state of the art
You're alone on the shelf
You're the top of the chart
You're the singular case
You're the queen of the place
You're the star of the show
You're one in a row

There's one chance in a million, there's one sun up in the sky.
I'm glad you were willin', and here's the reason why.
When I think of all the girls that I've ever kissed
And the ones that I'd wished I could know,
It's a real short list with just one name, you're one in a row.

You're the unrivaled champ
You're the boss of the camp
You're the mavin of charm
You're a shot in the arm
You're alone in the bunch
You're a dark horse hunch
You're a heavy-weight blow
You're one in a row",One in a Row
Don McLean,"I find you in my arms, this is how it begins
And we are so close, like Siamese twins.
Though you're separate from me, and we're often apart
Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart.

Joined at the heart.
Joined at the heart.
Joined at the heart.

You don't look like me it's true and I don't look like you
As we lead separate lives our secret still survives
Only we know our special affection,
Only we know our secret connection.

Now you're back in my arms, at the end of the day
And like Siamese twins, with each other we'll stay.
Though you're separate from me, and we're often apart
Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart.

Joined at the heart.
Joined at the heart.

Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart.",Siamese Twins (Joined at the Heart)
Don McLean,"Black crows in the summer sky. Wheat fields turned to gold.
Workers in the blazing sun. Forests in the cold.
Farmers in a cabin room. Portraits of your eyes
Look at me in painful gloom, they've seen so many lies.
You who love the truth, you who love the truth,
You who love the truth have seen, so many lies.

Skeletons smoke cigarettes. A blazing sun that never sets.
A purple forest in the haze. Hands that know of common ways.
Some survive their shattered dreams, but you are lost in colour schemes
Falling down between the seams, you've seen so many lies.
You who love the truth, you who love the truth,
You who love the truth have seen, so many lies.

I wonder how you'd feel today, if you knew the millions that they'd paid
For canvas glowing with your heat, shown in airconditioned suites
With glass and steel and carpet floors, stored in crypts as cold as yours.
Portraits of your bleeding eyes, eyes that saw so many lies.
You who love the truth, you who love the truth,
You who love the truth have seen, so many lies.
You who love the truth, you who love the truth, you who love the truth.",You Who Love the Truth
Don McLean,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried when I 
Read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music
Died

So bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n' Rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n' Rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n' Rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Don McLean,"I feel like a spinning top for a dreidel
The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around this world you go
Spinning through lives of the people you know
We all slow down

How you gonna keep on turning from day to day
How you gonna keep from turning your life away
No days you can borrow
No time you can buy
No trust in tomorrow
It's a lie

Oh I feel like a spinning top for a dreidel
The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around this world you go
Spinning through lives of the people you know
We all slow down

How you gonna keep on turning from day to day
How you gonna keep from turning your life away

And I feel like I'm a-dipping and a-diving
My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels
I'm lost in this star car I'm a-driving
But my air sole keeps pushing big wheels
My world is a constant confusion
My mind is prepared to attack
My past a persuasive illusion
I'm watching the future its black

What do you know
You know just what you perceive
What can you show
Nothing of what you believe
And as you grow
Each thread of life that you lead
Will spin around your deeds
And dictate your needs
As you sell your soul
And you sow your seeds
And you wound yourself
And your loved one bleeds
And your habits grow
And your conscious feeds
On all that you thought you should be
I never thought this could happen to me-e-e-e-e

I feel like a spinning top for a dreidel
The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around this world you go
Spinning through lives of the people you know

How you gonna keep on turning from day to day
How you gonna keep from turning your life away

I feel like a spinning top for a dreidel
The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle

You just slow down",Dreidel
Don McLean,"When I see you on the street, I lose my concentration. 
Just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation.

Won't you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought to know. 
Well I've been thinkin' about you day and night
And I don't know if it'll work out right
But somehow I think that it just might, if we try.

Faces come and faces go in circular rotation. 
But something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation. 

Won't you look my way once before you go 
And my eyes will say what you ought to know. 
Well you've got me standin' deaf and blind
Cause I see love as just a state of mind
And who knows what it is that we might find, if we try.

You're walking a different direction from most people I've met. 
You're givin' me signs of affection I don't usually get. 
I don't want you to pledge your future the future's not yours to give. 
Just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you live.

'Cause when I see you on the street, I lose my concentration. 
And just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation.

Won't you look my way once before you go 
And my eyes will say what you ought to know. 
Well I've been thinking about you day and night
And I don't know if it will work out right
But somehow I think that it just might, if we try. 
Somehow I think that it just might if we try. 
Yes somehow I think that it just might if we try.",If We Try
Don McLean,"If you want to make me happy, here is all you gotta do
Take me where you're going and I'll take care of you
'Cause I got this need that's growing to keep you satisfied
And if you keep your green light showing well you can take me for a ride

[Chorus]
'Cause I la la la la la la love you,
And I la la la la la la care.
And I really want you with me baby everywhere

Well, I like the way you're moving, and I like a the way you go
I like the way you let your locomotion show
'Cause my drivin' wheel is drivin' and my piston's working good
And if your motor gives you some trouble baby, 
I'll take a look underneath your hood (yes, I would)

[Chorus]

Well, I know you like your transportation with a motor and a rubber wheel,
But when you move you cause a transformation in this lover and the way I feel

So if you want to make me happy here is all you gotta do
Just let me ride your boxcar and I'll hobo with you
'Cause all I got is on my shoulder, I'm walkin' on my trav'lin' shoes
And before I get much older I'm gonna kick these lovesick blues

[Chorus]

Yes, I la la la la la la love you,
And I la la la la la la care.
'Cause I",La Love You

Don McLean,"Windows in a silent room, sunlight burns the walls to black
Angles and dimensions melt while colors drip and pillows crack
Reflections of my memories like pictures pasted on a sheet
The ribbon film of separate frames lying curled up at my feet 

The film is just a snake design and the photographs are fading fast
These are not memories of mine I have no future, no past

I've seen a thousand afternoons dissolve into the night
Like sugar crystals on a spoon they disappear from sight

Gray days from the crispest morning to the warmest afternoon in this room

And I like to draw the face I saw so long ago
My image in the mirror tells the jagged lines which way to go

The black and white description of the sole survivor of the Holocaust
All the rest were lost 

Do you see this paper face? It has no color or no mood
My eyes are ageless, as am I. I need no sleep, I need no food
I am a king, but like a child the other children laugh at me
Tongues of fire, wagging wild they dance around me merrily 

I'll kill them all and if I fail I'll kill whoever I can find
Then they'll beg me to be kind

My eyes have seen far more than eyes can ever tell
This planet plunged through mushroom fires of earthly hell

I know that my sweet Jesus said that he'd return
But Babylon has fallen and the cities burn",Aftermath [#]

Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky,
A dream come true, I'll live there till I die.
I'm asking you to say my last goodbye.
The love we knew ain't worth another try.

Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain.

But how can words express the feel of sunlight in the morning,
In the hills, away from city strife.
I need a country woman for my wife;
I'm city born, but I love the country life.

For I cannot be part of the cocktail generation:
Partners waltz, devoid of all romance.
The music plays and everyone must dance.
I'm bowing out. I need a second chance.

Save me from all the trouble and the pain.

We can make a go of it everything will turn out good
We can have so much fun we'll really have it made

And the Fruitman of Freeway will sell you his cars
When he's sure that you can't find the keys
And the ladies on Magdalene Lane
All worship the sun and the sand
And the migrants who come can't complain
For this is their promised land

MGM studios can't make the nut
They're auctioning Dorothy's shoes
Gable is gone, the good witch is a slut
And I've got the parking-lot blues
The wizard brought benzedrine smiles
And he never let Dorothy doze
Ha- she died as she walked down the aisle
And all that remains is her clothes

Over the rainbow a Kansas tornado
Can twist up a little girl's head
Aunt Em's on relief and the tin man's a thief
And even the wizard can't wake the dead

The prophet has come to the kingdom of lights
But there's no one to listen or learn
And the savior performs for the prophet's delight
While dissenters are banished or burned
And the heretics beg to be heard
But the savior's on tour for the week
Salvation is found in his word
If only he'd learn how to speak!

And Lincoln is laughing with Amos and Andy
Concerning the great Civil War
And Paul Revere sleeps with the worst-looking creeps
While revolution's knocking at his door

Magdalene Lane is the red-light domain
Where everyone's soul is for sale
A piece of your heart will do for a start
You can send us the rest in the mail
For we have our own families to feed
And we can't let them starve just for you
But we'd rather not watch while you bleed
So come back in an hour when you're through

It's just another city full of sorrow
Makes no difference why I came
And I only know I'm leaving here tomorrow
And only the motel man knows my name",Magdalene Lane [Live]
Don McLean,"I want her so bad
Mother Nature has a hold on me
I want her so bad
Mother Nature won't you let me be untied?
'Cause it hurts my pride
To be tossed off like the morning covers
And crossed off, like her other lovers
Casually

I see her walking by my window- mhmmhmmhmmhmm!
It seems to me I know her well.
But like the flowers in the spring-time,
Growing toward the sunshine,
Her beauty falls upon me in a fragrant spring-time spell

And I want her so ba-aa-aad
Mother Nature has a HOLD on me
I want her so bad
Mother Nature won't you let me be untied?
'Cause it hurts my pride
To be tossed off like the morning covers
And crossed off, like her other lovers
Casually

Is she an icy winter woman? Mm-hhmm!
That chills my body when she's near
Sweet fever in the morning
I don't know if I'll survive.
She walks by me as though she didn't
Know I was alive

And I want her so ba-aa-aad
Mother Nature has a hold on me
I want her so bad
Mother Nature won't you let me be untied?
'Cause it hurts my pride
To be tossed off like the morning covers
And crossed off, like her other lovers
Tossed off like the morning covers,
Crossed off, like her other lovers
Tossed off like the morning covers,
Crossed off, like her other lovers",Mother Nature [#]
Don McLean,"Was all the summer, and all the fall,
Just trying to find my little all in all
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Lord I'm sitting on top of the world

Was in the spring, one summer day
Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Oh I'm sitting on top of the world

An' you come runnin', holdin' up your hand
Can't get me a woman, cranky you can get a man
But now you're gone, and now I don't worry
Lord I'm sitting on top of the world

Have been days, I didn't know your name
Why should I worry or cry in vain
But now she's gone, now I don't worry
Lord I'm sitting on top of the world

Went to the station, down in the yard
Gonna get me a freight train, worked and got to home
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Oh I'm sitting on top of the world

The lonesome days, they have gone by
Why should you beg me oh say goodbye
But now she's gone, and I don't worry
Oh 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world",Sitting on Top of the World
Don McLean,"Chorus

I don't want to be like old George Reeves
Stuck in a Superman role.
I've got a long way to go in my career
And some day my fame will make it clear
That I had to be a Superman 

Verse 1
He came from another place deep in his mind
As far as the planets in space.
As galaxy's mysteries start to unwind
Some changes are bound to take place.

Though gravity constantly weighs on my travels
My mission is close to adrift
Though I can be strong when my power unravels
I still come to you for a lift.

(Chorus)

Verse 2
I know I can fly when my plane hits the sky
I believe I've got nothing to lose.
But when I'm alone with the bed and the phone
I get the terminal metropolis blues

I flew to the coast where Superman's Ghost
Lay shot on the bedroom floor
He said ""Watch out for TV it crucified me,
But it can't crucify me no more.""


(Chorus)

Verse 3
""I'm red white and blue, I've got justice to do
I'm the man of your fantasy dreams
But I'm an alien man from an alien land
Who's alive on your orthicon screens.
I once ruled the world and when flags were unfurled

I performed for you live not on tape.
But the public is cruel when played for a fool
As you see by the blood on my cape.""

(Chorus)

Verse 4

""Well I never was real or stronger than steel.
I'm a figment of Freudian need.
And the video screen is a psychotic scene
And it's all done with mirrors and green

My agent just called, the talks have been stalled
I soon will be pulled from the air.
But the image persists in the video mists
That a Superman still will be there!""

(Chorus)",Superman's Ghost

Don McLean,"As I was a-gwine down the road,
With a tired team and a heavy load,
I crack'd my whip and the leader sprung,
I says day-day to the wagon tongue.
Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

Went out to milk, and I didn't know how,
I milked the goat instead of the cow.
A monkey sittin' on a pile of straw,
A-winkin' at his mother-in-law.
Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

Met Mr. Catfish comin' down stream.
Says Mr. Catfish, ""What does you mean?""
Caught Mr. Catfish by the snout,
And turned Mr. Catfish wrong side out.
Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

Came to a river and I couldn't get across,
Paid five dollars for a blind old hoss;
Wouldn't go ahead, nor he wouldn't stand still,
So he went up and down like an old saw mill.
Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

As I came down the new cut road,
Met Mr. Bullfrog, met Miss Toad
And every time Miss Toad would sing,
Old Bullfrog cut a pigeon wing.
Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

Oh I jumped in the seat and I gave a little yell
The horses ran away, broke the wagon all to hell
Sugar in the gourd and honey in the horn
I never been so happy since the day I was born.
Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.",Turkey in the Straw [#]
Don McLean,"I find you in my arms, this is how it begins

Though you're separate from me, and we're often apart
Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart.
Joined at the heart.
Joined at the heart.
Joined at the heart.

You don't look like me it's true and I don't look like you
as we lead separate lives our secret still survives

Only we know our special affection,
only we know our secret connection.

Now you're back in my arms, at the end of the day
and like Siamese twins, with each other we'll stay.

Don McLean,"I was a cowboy, ridin' the range
I got a little boy, I guess it's not strange

And he makes that pony sound (Whinny!)

I keep dreamin' of you and what the river will do
As it starts flowin' over me.

I got to follow the flow.

'Cause you know I'm in so deep.

I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when the blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling

Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree

With things, things for you and for me

When the world falls in love

Seems to say

May your New Year dreams come true
And this song of mine
In three quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too

Don McLean,"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head:
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said,
""For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.""

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With peace on earth, good will to men.""

Till, ringing singing, on its way,
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime,
Of peace on earth, good will to men!",I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day
Don McLean,"It came upon a midnight clear that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heav'n all gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hast'ning on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heav'n and earth shall on the Prince of peace their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I've bought some corn for popping,
The lights are turned way down low,
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight,
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Darkness in my soul.

Sketch the trees and the daffodils

Catch the breeze and the winter chills

In colors on the snowy linen land.

How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen
They did not know how

Perhaps they'll listen now.

Are soothed beneath the artist's
Loving hand.
And now I understand what you tried to say to me

How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free.
Perhaps they'll listen now.

For they could not love you
But still your love was true

And when no hope was left in sight on that starry
Starry night.
You took your life
As lovers often do;
But I could have told you
Vincent
This world was never
Meant for one
As beautiful as you.

Starry
Starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls

Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes
That watch the world and can't forget.
Like the stranger that you've met

The ragged men in ragged clothes

The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken
On the virgin snow.
And now I think I know what you tried to say to me

How you suffered for your sanity

How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen
They're not
List'ning still
Perhaps they never will.",Vincent (Starry Starry Night)
Don McLean,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die",Amercian Pie [Live]
Don McLean,"Starry, starry night 
Paint your palette blue and gray 
Look out on a summer's day 
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

In colors on the snowy linen land

Swirling clouds in violet haze

Don McLean,"There's nothing left for me
Of days that used to be
I live in memory, among my souvenirs

Some letters tied in blue
A photograph or two
I find a rose for you
Among my souvenirs

A few more tokens rest
Down in my treasure chest
And though they do their best
To give me consolation

I count them all apart
And as the teardrops start
I find a broken heart
Among my souvenirs

I live in memories

Don McLean,"I told Mary about us I told her about our great sin
Mary cried and forgave me and Mary took me back again
Said if I wanted my freedom I could be free evermore
But I don't wanna be and I don't wanna see Mary cry anymore

Oh devil woman devil woman let go of me
Devil woman let me be and leave me alone I wanna go home

Mary is waitin' and weepin' down in our shack by the sea
Even after I've hurt her Mary's still in love with me
Devil woman it's over trapped no more by your charms
'Cause I don't wanna stay I wanna get away woman let go of my arm

Oh devil woman devil woman let go of me

Devil woman you're evil like the dark coral reef
Like the winds that bring high tides you bring sorrow and grief
You made me ashamed to face Mary I barely had the strength to tell
Skies're not so black Mary took me back Mary has broken your spell

Oh devil woman devil woman let go of me

Running along by the seashore running as fast as I can
Even the seagulls are happy glad I'm coming home again
Never again will I ever cause another tear to fall
Down the beach I see what belongs to me the one I want most of all

Oh devil woman devil woman don't follow me
Devil woman let me be and leave me alone I'm going back home",Devil Woman
Don McLean,"Don't worry 'bout me, it's all over now
Though I may be blue, I'll manage somehow.
Love can't be explained, can't be controled
One day it's warm, next day it's cold.

Don't pity me, 'cause I'm feeling blue
Don't be ashamed it might happen to you.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, love, kiss me
One time then go love, I'll understand
Don't worry 'bout me.

Sweet, sweet, sweet, love will I want you to be
As happy as I when you love me
I'll never forget you your sweet memory it's all over now Don't worry bout me.

One heart is free, one heart will cry

Don McLean,"Kaw-liga was a wooden Indian standing by the door.
He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store.
Kaw-liga just stood there and never let it show,
So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no.""

[Chorus]
Poor ol' Kaw-liga, he never got a kiss.
Poor ol' Kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed.
Is it any wonder that his face is red?
Kaw-liga, that poor ol' wooden head.

He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk.
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped some day he'd talk.
Kaw-liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign,
Because his heart was made of knotty pine.

Kaw-liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere.
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair.
Kaw-liga just stood there and never let it show,
So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no.""

And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid,
And took her, oh, so far away, but ol' Kaw-liga stayed.
Kaw-liga just stands there as lonely as can be,
And wishes he was still an old pine tree.",Kaw-Liga
Don McLean,"[Chorus]
Love me, oh love me
Love me like nobody else can do
Need me
And just let me go one needing you

Well if you want to try to make me over
And there's something else that fits your plan
It's alright if you would only tell me
What it's going to take to be your man

If you ever say you're going to leave me
Lord I don't know what on earth I'll do
I could never face a new tomorrow
If I had to face it without you

Don McLean,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
Night-time would find me in Rosa's cantina;
Music would play and Felina would whirl.

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina,
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden;
I was in love but in vain, I could tell.

One night a wild young cowboy came in,
Wild as the West Texas wind.
Dashing and daring,
A drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina,
The girl that I loved.

So in anger I

Challenged his right for the love of this maiden.
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered in less than a heart-beat;
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the FOUL EVIL deed I had done.
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran,
Out where the horses were tied.
I caught a good one.
It looked like it could run.
Up on its back
And away I did ride,

Just as fast as I

Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the bad-lands of New Mexico.

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless.
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left.
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death.

I saddled up and away I did go,
Riding alone in the dark.
Maybe tomorrow
A bullet may find me.
Tonight nothing's worse than this
Pain in my heart.

And at last here I

Am on the hill overlooking El Paso;
I can see Rosa's cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward.
Down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys;
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me.
I have to make it to Rosa's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side.
Though I am trying
To stay in the saddle,
I'm getting weary,
Unable to ride.

But my love for

Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen,
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest.
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle.
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.

From out of nowhere Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina, good-bye.",El Paso
Don McLean,"Ribbon of darkness over me
Since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before
Ribbon of darkness over me
Clouds a-atherin' o'er my head
That kill the day and hide the sun
That shroud the night when day is done
Ribbon of darkness over me

Rain is falling on the meadow
Where once my love and I did lie
Now she is gone from the meadow
My love goodbye

Ribbon of darkness over me
Where once the world was young as spring
Where flowers did bloom and birds did sing
Ribbon of darkness over me

Here in this cold room lyin'
Don't want to see no one but you

How mine just aches and breaks all day

Don McLean,"The story of my life is very plain to read
It starts the day you came
And ends the day you leave
The story of my life begins and ends with you
The names are still the same
And the story's still the truth

I was alone.
You found me waiting and made me your own
I was afraid
That somehow I never could be a man that you wanted of me

You're the story of my life, and every word is true
Each chapter sings your name
Each page begins with you
It's the story of our times and never letting go
If I die today, I wanted you to know

Stay with me here
Share with me, care with me
Stay and be near
and when it began I'd lie awake every night
Just knowing somewhere deep inside
That our affair just might write

It starts the day you came
It ends the day you leave",The Story of My Life

Place no one on earth above you
Time goes by and still I haven't changed
Time goes by and I still miss you
Wanna hold you close and kiss you
Time goes by and still I haven't changed

You told me to forget you
And find somebody new
But I don't want somebody else
I'm still in love with you
I love you and you should know it
What else must I do to show it
Time goes by and still I haven't changed

I love you, I do so madly
So completely and so gladly

Don McLean,"Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife

You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I never done
It's been one hill after another
I've climbed them all one by one

But this time, Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman got tired of heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife

She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

But this time, Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time",You Gave Me a Mountain

It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights

On the village green

When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone

When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year

The love we knew, ain't worth another try

Save me from all the trouble and the pain
I know I'm weak but I can't face that girl again
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain

Oh, but how can words express the feel of sunlight
In the morning in the hills away from city strife
I need a country woman for my wife
I'm city born but I love the country life

For I can not be part of her ""Cocktail-Generation Partner's Waltz,""
Devoid of all romance
The music plays and everyone must dance
I'm bowing out, I need a second chance

Save me from all the trouble and the pain
I know I'm weak but I can't face that girl again
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain

And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
And it poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year

It was a mess of good years",(It Was) A Very Good Year

Don McLean,"I feel like a spinnin' top or a dreidel 
The spinnin' don't stop when you leave the cradle,
You just slow down.

'Round and around this world you go,
Spinnin' through the lives of the people you know 
We all slow down.

How you gonna keep from turnin' from day to day'
How you gonna' keep from turnin' your life away'
No days you can borrow, no time you can buy,

No trust in tomorrow, it's a lie.

No days you can borrow, no time you can buy,

No trust in tomorrow, it's a lie.
And I feel like I'm a dippin' and a-divin'
My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels.

I'm lost in this star car I'm a-drivin'
But my air soul keeps pushin' big wheels.
My world is a constant confusion,

My mind is prepared to attack 
My past, a persuasive illusion,
I'm watchin' the future it's black.

What do you know' You know just what you perceive.
What can you show' Nothin' of what you believe,
And as you grow, each thread of life that you leave

Will spin around your deeds and dictate your needs
As you sell your soul and you sow your seeds,
And you wound yourself and your loved one bleeds,

And your habits grow, and your conscience feeds
On all that you thought you should be 
I never thought this could happen to Meeeeeeeece

I feel like a spinnin' top or a dreidel
The spinnin' don't stop when you leave the cradle,
You just slow down.

'Round and around this world you go,
Spinnin' through the lives of the people you know -
We all slow down.

How you gonna keep from turnin' from day to day'
How you gonna' keep from turnin' your life away'

The spinnin' don't stop when you leave the cradle,
You just slow down.

Don McLean,"When I see you on the street, I lose my concentration.
Just the thought that we might meet, creates anticipation.

Well, I've been thinkin' about you day and night
an' I don't know if it'll work out right.
But somehow I think that it just might, if we try.

Faces come and faces go, in circular rotation.
But something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation.

Won't you look my way, one before you go,
and my eyes will say, what you ought to know.
Well, you got me standin' deaf and blind.
'Cause I see love as just a state of mind.
And who knows what it is that we might find, if we try.

You're walkin' a different direction from most people I've met.
You're givin' me signs of affection I don't usually get.
I don't want you to pledge your future, the future's not yours to give.
Just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you live.

'Cause when I see you on the street, I lose my concentration.

It's just the rain that's rollin' down my cheek.
It's just the wind that makes me hear you speak.
It's just the song that anyone can sing.

It's just the past that's tearin' us apart.
It's just the time we have so little of.

I was ridin' on the subway in the afternoon
I saw some kids 'a beatin' out a funky tune
The lady right in front of me was old and brown
The kids began to push her, they knocked her down
I tried to help her out but there was just no way
A life ain't worth a damn on the street today
I passed the ambulance and the camera crews
I saw the instant replay on the evening news

Well will you take the car, or will you take the trip?
Remove annoying hair from your upper lip
What's it really worth? Does she really care?
What's the best shampoo that I can use on my hair?
Hey what's the real future of democracy?
How're we gonna streamline the bureaucracy?
Hey, hey, the cost of life has gone sky-high
Does the deodorant I'm using really keep me dry?

There's where you can go if you land on the nine
Canada is nice if you're fond of ice
If you land on the two then we'll send you there twice

A man has gone insane and been killed by police!

Don Menza,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

We talked until two and then she said

I will sing, I will praise, lift my hands to honor You
Because Your word is true, I will sing

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow

Don Neely,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last

With the sun in my heart

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Vamos a matarnos

Don, salí de Carolina
Estoy buscando estos fequeros
Llámate al Boster
Voy pal área de los vaqueros
Si veo un fantaseo, un nebuleo, algo extrapola, tranquilo!
Yo les meto aquí en Cata
Que paso, cabrón
Ustedes quieres hacer nombre
Yo no le temo a ningún hombre
Negro, ahí se sienten dos gua-guas nebulosas

Don, dale pa´ la base! Los pillamos en Barbosa!

Esta es noche de casería
Sobreviven pal de astutos
Tu y tu corillo me huelen a luto
Ando capeando en el Mercedes
Aunque los tuyo me alumbren

Hector, no los comemos vivos aquí en Las Cumbre!

Mira, mamao, a mi no queda vivo ni un solo enemigo
Hoy que si que voy a acabar contigo
Te juro por quien tu quieras que la cara yo te doy

Don, nos activamos en La Perla, y los tiramos por el Morro!

Pal´ carajo el miedo
Yo vivo entre balacera
Pa´ muerto, hago pal de aen la galeras
Están roncando pa´ plantar bandera

Hector, que se tiren, que estamos con los ful aquí en Cantera!

No te limites, vamanos a criterio
Los de tu parte va a ser un misterio
Cuando no se sepa si te paso por encima un tren

Don, en Lloren les dimos cien!

Entonces vamos a matarnos
Ahora si que nos vamos hasta abajo
Ya no hay arreglo, me matas o te mato
Yo vivo en guerra y estamos cazando
Entonces, Boster, vamos a matarnos
Ahora si que nos vamos hasta bajo
Ya no hay arreglo, me matas o te mato
Yo vivo en guerra y estamos cazando
vamos a matarnos

No experimenten
Los que se sienten que te estén fogoniando
Los de mi bando a ustedes están cazando
Que no me tienen o activo los sicarios
Y vamos hacer que se revienten

Que se sienta el sopleteo

Me crie en Villa Palmera
A puño suelto y cambumbeo
De grande aprendi
Que la vida no es un tripeo

No voy con fantasmeo
Ni pero's, ni nebuleos

Soy bandolero como el mister politiquero
Que se robo to el dinero y lo postularon de nuevo
(Como si na) si fuera Calde o Don Omar
Nos daban conspiración la llave bota
Y yo no soy ejemplo mi respeto a tempo
Su único delito fue tener talento
Que tu quiere que yo escriba

De que el D.E.A me tiene en la mira (yo se)

Me cogí un caso y apuntaron el deo
Ya no era el rey del perreo
Ahora era tecato y otro posible reo
Que me metieran preso dos dijeron mal lo veo
Yo no les creo a su sistema de reformación ingrato
A mi me arrestaron dos puercos por pasar el rato
Y yo aquí pichando aguantando
Callando si nadie es perfecto de que me están juzgando
Y hace con mi vida lo que cualquiera puede
Vivir como quiere, tener sus placeres, mi gente
Yo no distinto a ustedes
Y hoy en dia soy cantante porque ustedes quieren
Me dieron las primeras planas
Cojen rapero con marihuana, pistola y cosa rara
Solo quedara en su mente clara
Cuando crezcan donde yo crecí se críen donde me criaba
Diablo me duele tanta baba

Unos por profesión, otros por bochincheros (exclusivo)
Dale a la sin hueso socicharronero
Haciendo dinero con el sufrimiento ajeno
Yo no soy un santo pero estoy en clave
Estoy pagando toas mis maldades
Y estoy aquí tirando pa lante
Como quiera que lo pongas hago menos mal que antes
A ti lo que te jode es que te matastes tratastes
Te superatses pero te olvidastes (de que)
De que el papa upa esta mirándonos de arriba
El unico que juzga el niche que no discrimina
Y yo no he visto ""Al Manini Van Dog"" (yo no)

Sorprendio en la cama de un extraño
Jugando a quererse
Nunca penso que la venganza a un desengaño
La hicieran perderse
Tal vez fueron las copas, el ambiente o tanta gente
O aquella excusa frecuente
O aquel refran de que la vida es sola una
Y hay que vivir el presente

Que engaño dos extraños jugando a quererse
En lo oscuro el amor no puede verse
Es que tengas la vida de frente
Es morir o détente, détente

Estos es una experencia de 2 enamorados
De 2 soñadores
De 2 amantes
Que permitieron que tan solo en 1 minuto de su vida
Decidieron dentro de la misma
Ironico el momento
En que el amor, se convierte en muerte
Que descansen en paz
Vive la vida minuto a minuto
Y encontraras en cada uno de ellos
Un motivo por el cual conducirte
En la forma correcta

Gota de sudor le baja
Ventaja, tengo lo que a ella relaja
Dale chiquitita
Vente ahora que me voy horita
Pégate, pégate para sentir tu piel suavecita
Ay na mas
Mackie hazle la sillita 
Ay na mas
Voy a hacerle la sillita
Y alborota 
Suda, suda,
A to'as es que va 
No le importa na

Quiere que la guaye a'lante
Y que a mí,
Nacido en la tierra de Gigantes
Otra nota
Pero yo nunca engancho los guantes
Otro coñac, tequila, margarita y pa' 'lante

Está bailando en su nota 
Chequea como se agota, gota, gota
Es pura calentura dura
Una soltura en esa cintura
Y sube la temperatura

Don Omar,"Marta tiene 23 años y está estudiando
En su corta edad tiene apartamento en condado
Ella no sale con hombres, ni acepta regalos
y todo por la culpa del maldito Carlos

Marta viene arrastrando la desilusión
De que el hombre que amó, la dejó y se marchó
El mismo día de su boda

Nilda tiene la misma edad y es un poco más loca
Le gusta usar pelo corto, y ropa de hombre a la moda
Nilda viene arrastrando la desilusión 
De que papá la tocó donde no se debía
y marcó su vida

y así viven 2 mujeres gritándole al cielo
y diciendo su amor sera eterno
Aunque la sociedad margine
Un amor de muñecas de porcelana
Dos mujeres que son una 
Son una en dos

Son 4 senos que se aman en la misma cama
Un amor que es prohibido, pero en fin es amor
y caminan de mano a la Universidad
¿Qué dira papá si se llega a enterar?
De que su doncella ya no quiere más
Volverse a enamorar de ningún patán
y que ahora solo se quiere besar
Con su amiga, con quien jugo a las muñecas
Con quien jugo a las muñecas

y que dira mama si nunca la escuchó
Es mas fuerte el dolor, cuando papa lo hizo
No hay quien halle pecado en esta relación
Pues el sufrimiento ya las redimio
No hay sonrisa visible en tanta oscuridad
No se puede hablar de amor sin tener felicidad
No hay razón alguna para maltratar
A quien te dio su amor, sin poner medidas

Una nube de humo que te arrebata 
Sintió un hechizo de sus ojos de gata 
Que te seducen y en sus garras te atrapan 
Esa es una sata que a vacilao' contigo 
Y que ha puesto a gatiar a to' tus amigos 
La trato de cambiar pero no lo consigo 
Pues me hipnotiza moviendo el ombligo 
Y yo tan receptivo, que me tiene manso 
Comiendo de su mano por que no me alcanzó 
Atrapa, pasa, ganza y esa no da un paso 
Eso es puro atraso, pero me caso por un chokonaso 
De beso y abrazo, na' de compromiso

Cautivan sus colores en sus tonos blanca arena 
Esa es una sirena que cautiva toa' tus penas 
La nena te lleva a donde no te espera 
Tan fiera, que te mata donde quiera 
Ya ve la, como todos lo desean 
¿Qué esperas? para que sea tuya y tú de ella 
Esa juega con tu mente, hasta dejarte demente

Oh aleluya

Los que santificamos el nombre
Que va por encima de todo nombre
Y hay de que aquel hombre que confié en otro
Pues ese otro le hará saber
Que tendrá que poner la cara dos veces
Pero hay de aquel que padece por el rey de la gloria
Porque lo sacara del lodo cenagoso y lo pondrá en victoria
Como en victoria, señora, agárrese
No suelte ese juego por sus hijos
Mire que no es juego, que del cielo va a caer fuego
Que consumirá todo lo que después de la trompeta quede vivo
Y aunque cada cual escoja su destino y su camino
Agárrese de esa promesa
De que a Jehová le serviríamos yo
Y los que en mi casa vivimos
Oh hermano seremos bendecidos
Los que sufrimos persecución por causa de su palabra
En situaciones donde la verdad no esta clara
Oh hermano y recuerde de que cuando usted mida
Será medido con la misma vara
Iglesia abre los ojos que criaturas malévolas
Que se esconden detrás de tu rostro
Pero orar verdad sin cesar dice la palabra
Para que siempre acampen ángeles alrededor de nosotros

Hermano
Y hay de aquel que caiga bajo la ira del Dios de los cielos
Pues será consumido
Como son consumidas las aguas por los secos suelos
Rasgados como el mismo velo, sin consuelo
Y allí será el lloro y crujir de dientes
Pues no podrán obtener su vuelo al cielo
Pero tú y yo iglesia
Estaremos sentados a la diestra de Dios padre
Todo poderoso, creador del cielo y de la tierra
Que nos dio a Jesucristo su único hijo

No me chupe nene, dale ven mi nene 
Le doy cremita que de esta nadie tiene 
Como en la mano y en la boca se te viene

Queriendo morir, llorando
Quien le hizo eso a ella, tan bella
Que ahoga hoy sus sueños en esa botella

Usted se fue y la dejo en un rincón llorando
Y aun aquí estoy yo por sus besos rogando
Como no pudo ver lo que por dentro es
Ya no quiere querer y que le puedo hacer
Todo fue culpa de usted que la dejo llorando
Y aun aquí estoy yo por sus besos rogando
Como no pudiste ver lo que por dentro es
Ya no quiere querer y que le puedo hacer

Nadie deja que muera una flor tan bella
Ni deja sin castillo a una doncella
Quien bajo del firmamento tan linda estrella
Le pago con sufrimiento y hoy no brilla ella

Don Omar,"Este es un tema que nacio en el orfanato
y que hizo creer a un incredulo corazon
Que penso que luego de aver sido lastimado
Nunca volveria a amar
Hoy por ti le doy gracias al tiempo... Un beso (El rey)

Hoy note un instinto, algo distinto
En que me fije, esa mirada, y esa sonrisa
Que de lejos me distes

Quiero decirte mil cosas, estamos creciendo
Lo has notado... yo lo se
No se si estoy confundido
No te enojes conmigo
Creo que te gusto y tu a mi tambien

Solo recuerda el colegio
Los años de niño
Justo a tu lado
Soy el chico aquel...
Que te vio crecer...
Que te vio creceeeeeeeer...
y hacerte mujer...
Que te vio creceeeeeeeer...
y hacerte mujer...

You Dennis !
She is my queen...
y yo su rey...
Tu sabes
El orfanato

Quizas soy muy callado
y nunca te he hablado
Es lo que siento y ya no aguanto mas
Como es que no te das cuenta
De que al solo verte...
Yo que soy tan fuerte...
Empiezo a temblar...
Me canse de escribir cartas...
y dejarlas en tu puerta...
Nunca supiste quien era...
No me atrevi a firmar...
Que mas querias que hiciera...
Si me pedias la luna...
La luna te daba, para ti nada mas...

Soy bandolero como el mister politiquero
Que se robo to el dinero y lo postularon de nuevo

Que tu quiere que yo escriba
Guasimilla, mentira
De que el D.E.A me tiene en la mira (yo se)
Yo estoy claro claro, mis impuestos pagos
Critican si trabajo, critican si soy vago (que se va hacer)

A mi me arrestaron dos puercos por pasar el rato
Y yo aquí pichando aguantando 
Callando si nadie es perfecto de que me están juzgando
Y hace con mi vida lo que cualquiera puede
Vivir como quiere, tener sus placeres, mi gente 
Yo no distinto a ustedes
Y hoy en dia soy cantante porque ustedes quieren
Me dieron las primeras planas
Cojen rapero con marihuana, pistola y cosa rara
Solo quedara en su mente clara
Cuando crezcan donde yo crecí se críen donde me criaba

Estoy pagando toas mis maldades

A ti lo que te jode es que te matastes tratastes
Te superatses pero te olvidastes (de que)
De que el papa upa esta mirándonos de arriba

Don Omar,"Ella y yo
Dos locos viviendo una aventura castigada por Dios
Un laberinto sin salida donde el miedo se convierte en amor
Somos su marido, ella y yo

Mi esposa y yo
Igual que ustedes compartimos en la vida un eterno amor
La dama perfecta, toda una belleza, ella es mi inspiración
Somos feliz ella y yo (ella y yo)

Amigo ella y yo
Solos nos vemos a escondidas para ahogar esta prohibida pasión
Y aunque tiene dueño, yo solo tengo un sueño, ser su protector
Somos su marido, ella y yo

Oye Don lucha por amor
No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Oye mi pana lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tu, no sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Mi esposa y yo, somos felices dos almas matrices se lo que es el amor
Por eso te entiendo y aunque sea casada no
Te alejes por temor, no lo hagas Don, oh no no no

Mi amigo ella y yo teníamos claro que era una locura esta relación
Pero la carne nos llamaba, y la cama nos hacia una invitación
A solo hacer el amor

Ay ya te explique
Cuando hay personas que se aman, el amor tiene que vencer,
Y ya el marido entiende que perdió su hembra ahora es tu mujer,
No pueden ganar los tres

Y te repito lucha por amor
No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

No seas tan tonto lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tu no sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Amigo pido perdón yo nunca te falle,
Me traicionaron las ganas de volverla ver
Y aunque todavía no puedo creer,
Lo que este amargo encuentro me hizo comprender,
Pues tu también llegaste a ese lugar,
Donde tantas veces yo la fui a buscar
Y aunque no es fácil lo que voy a hacer
Admitiré que salí con tu mujer

Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer

Que te perdone Dios, yo no lo voy a hacer
Los perdí a los dos y a la misma vez
Ya que todo era mentira cuando ella me decía
Que se iba pa' Puerto Rico a vacaciones con su amiga
Me mintió, tu y ella en una cama, haya en Bayamo
Quizás en Isla Verde o Carolina, cuantos hoteles ensucio,
Tu también, los odio a los dos

Que yo soy quien mas sufro con todo esto,
Me mata el dolor

Fue una traición

Perdí un amigo por la tentación
Perdón

Un recuerdo leve de esto que siento
Una sacudida, a mis salidas
La cima de un beso en un brinco suicida

Su fuente de energía cautiva mis sensores
Pues no hay que la controle cuando baila encendi'a
Tiene dentro esa chispa que quema transistores
Vive de una elipsis que enciende sus motores

Chequea como se menea

Ella es ese sueño que tuve despierto
Un recuerdo leve de esto que siento
Una sacudida, a mis salidas
La cima de un beso en un brinco suicida

Su fuente de energía cautiva mis sensores
Pues no hay que la controle cuando baila encendi'a
Tiene dentro esa chispa que quema transistores
Vive de una elipsis que enciende sus motores

Sé que tenemos que hablar,
Nada va bien,
Tenemos que aceptar
Que nos pasó
Lo que tanto temor
Teníamos
Se nos murió el amor

Y no sé,
Si quizás,
Volverá a renacer,
Esto, que fue amor
Perfecto sin una condición

Y el tiempo me dará
Quizás la solución
Ahora podrás marchar
Vete ningún rencor
Adiós que te valla bien

No sé si fue
Tal vez quizás,
No puse atención al amor
Pero siempre he de reconocer
De mí te di lo mejor
Entonces me voy adiós

Adiós, adiós, se nos murió
Adiós, adiós, se nos murió
El amor que un día tuvimos
Y no sé si sé
Si el tiempo me dará la solución
Siempre he de reconocer
De mí te di todo lo mejor
Adiós que te valla bien

Adiós amiga que te valla bien
Que a mí me irá bien, también
Amiga que te valla bien
Que a mí me irá bien, también
Se nos murió el amor

(La vida nos permitió compartir todo este tiempo juntos
Y ese mismo tiempo hoy en día nos da la oportunidad
De convertirnos en mejores seres humanos
Cada cual por su camino te deseo éxito
Son mis más sinceros sentimientos
Siempre estarás en mi
Es imposible sacarte de aquí súper imposible
Que te valla bien un beso)

Voy pa encima y con todo me quedo
Sigo al mando de los controles sin que me descontrolen
En control total así que enrolen
Sube el volumen prenda quien fume
Que en mi planeta se suele mosquear de viernes a lunes
Si respiras no te tires pues puedes que aspires de lo toxico
En mi atmósfera y te retires

Te voy a estar buscando por cualquier parte de la galaxia
A mi no me sorprende lo tuyo
Este va pa ti y pa ti

Yo sentao en mi trono los descojono
Si le subo dos tonos los intoxico en carbono
Mango frecuencia y sigo la secuencia
Sin perder la paciencia porque para mi esto no es ciencia
El astronauta hijo de Toñita full en criptonitas
Ando en el enterprize cazando alienitas (Cazando extraterrestres)
El ultimo informe que reporta mi bitácora
Dice que son dos cascaras (Chota) terminador pura mascaras

Mírame bien en lo que me convertí pon tu cara o tu cabeza
Yo siempre fui soy y seré más grande que tu
Sencillo soy el negocio seguro de la industria
Estoy cuadrando la libreta y by the way
Quiero informarte que estas en descuadre

El ultimo informe de la R I A gordito pa que te rías
Dice que tu compañía era tremenda porquería
Un montón de fracasados sin talento que pa nada servían
Que no eras nadie y a nada llegarías
Y tu guillo de Al Capone a todos les debías
Entonces de la noche al día te busca la policía
Te le desapareces al títere que te escribía
Tienes tres panas presos por ti haciendo día
Chota yo siempre supe que tú no servías
Te quedan deudas en mi caserío todavía
Y toda una vida pa pagar tu hipocresía
Gusano yo siempre supe que tú no servías
Ruégale a Dios que no te toque en una celda fría
Con los panitas los que sueños le vendías
Cuando te toque demostrarles a todos la hombría
Ponga la cara como yo puse la mía

Que te quede claro que te vamos a seguir buscando por todo el resto de la galaxia
Donde te pillemos te desintegramos
Te vamos a enseñar tu negro futuro

Buscando tu luz

No estabas tú

Tú y tus ojitos agua De color azul
Por ti pasé un invierno En el frío de moscú

Nadé hasta el sur
Buscándote
Por África
Casándote

Tú en pirámides
Escondiéndote
Casi me cansé
Pero te encontré

Crucé en barco el mar
El cielo en jet
Por ti llegué
Hasta el Tibet

Casi muero de sed
Cuando el desierto crucé
Y solo me salvo el oasis
Que yo en ti encontré

Que por la discoteca baila
Revuelta con sus amiguitas
Yo que me muero por tocarla

Es una diosa que camina (solo que ella lo tiene)
Seria pecado no adorarla (on your knees)
Lleva en su lengua medicina (éxtasis)
Que suministra al besarla
Usa un perfume que hipnotiza (popper)
Y un polvo mágico que hechiza (finisimo de colombia, pues)
Fuma cigarro que da risa (straight from washington remix)
Y la pastilla que la eriza (europea)

Llena de sol y arena
Una diosa en su cara
El cielo entre sus piernas

Le dije esta noche
Sangra la luna llena
Si quieres te recojo en mi coche
Y te llevo a ver las estrellas

Ella, ella, ella, ella
Tan bella, tan bella
Ella, ella, ella, ella
Baje del cielo una estrella
Ella, ella, ella, ella
Tan bella, tan bella
Ella, ella, ella, ella
Yo soy su príncipe, ella mi doncella

Esta es la noche en la que victorioso saldré
Con ella caí en el juego yes
Será en la suite o en mi casa tal vez
Lo que yo sé es que va a ser hasta tarde
Nena me vuelve loco tu figura sensual
No dures tu cintura cuando rompe al caminar
Intensa en un viaje espacial
Es que está buena pa' bailar, pa' bailar

Una belleza así en cualquier lado no se ve
Te voy a dar lo de ella duro sin timidez
Su desnudez me llevo hacia otra parte
Te voy a dar lo de ella hasta saciar la sed
Una belleza asa  en cualquier lado no se ve
Te voy a dar lo de ella duro sin timidez
Su desnudez me llevo hacia otra parte
Te voy a dar lo de ella hasta saciar la sed

Desde que te vi al minuto me puse pa' ti
Acepto eres mi obsesión
Te has convertido en mi adicción
Quieres quitarme la vida a mi
Atrevida, eres una bandida
Quién te mando a curarme y a sonsacarme
Vas a tener que dar la liga

Fenomenal one, fenomenal two
Fenomenal noche especial
Fenomenal si te saco a bailar
Fenomenal si dice si
Te dejaras llevar por mi
Porque amanecerá as frente al mar
Consultaría a la oscuridad
Y la luna le pediré
Que si cae linda esta noche
Vaya entonces seamos tres
Yo nunca vista asa , cintura de mujer
Que juegue con el mar y me haga enloquecer

Nunca vista asa , cintura de mujer
Con tanto poder que me haga retroceder
Nunca vista asa , cintura de mujer
Que me lleve a las alturas
Y las estrellas me haga ver

Te conocí esa tarde
Llena de sol y arena
Una diosa en tu cara
Y el cielo entre sus piernas
Le dije esta noche
Sangra la luna llena
Si quieres te recojo en mi coche
Y te llevo a ver las estrellas

Don Omar,"Hay veces que ser yo no lo es todo
Cuando tienes tanto y sientes no tener nada
Caminas por la vida solo
Yo callo pero aveces es así que me siento
Aprendes a aceptar que las cosas mas grandes se acaban solo con un momento
Aprendes a vivir en un mundo de traición
De fuego y mas caras con valor
Te acostumbras a llevarlo a todos los extremos
Somos de la calle y así es que todo lo hacemos

No se mide mal ni bien
Ni se valoran cosas que convienen
Todo va tan rápido, hasta que llego a casa y te miro a los ojos
Te abrazo y todo se detiene
Y me arrepiente de haber hecho tanto
De por tanto tiempo de haber caminado ciego
Y haber perdido el sentimiento en miedo

Kendo me dijo que me metiera a la cabina y me concentre
Que la música es eterna y por eso estoy aqui diciendo esto,
Para el día en que yo falte lo guardes para siempre

El orfanato!
Ángeles Y demonios

Me siento y saco números un octavo en dos mil quinientos
entre mes y cocina se van doscientos
veintidós paquetes de cuarenta y dos y viran tres mil novecientos
en semana y media, el negocio es super lento

Recupero, los veinticinco de la pieza voy y los entrego
y de ganancia quedan uno, dos, seis, cero
se tiraron y al que se llevaron fue a mi socio
cojo mas fianza en verdad que no es negocio

Mi nombre suena
y los problemas van en cadena
el case no es mio pero pronto mi sello se estrena
el dinero fue mi eclipse en luna llena
y el doctor le diagnostica, cáncer a mi nena

Bueno
Syko me estoy volviendo loco

Que paso escucho tu voz como ajora

Yo he guerreado tres veces por el case y con necesidad

Pero yo cabrón. No tuve el ticket ni pa' navidad

Donde vea al flaco papi se la voy a dejar pegar
y que se muera!

Kendo dale cuerda antes de meterle al flaco
Hay que darle al del B M el es la mano derecha

Naa, el bobolon no es ni la izquierda
Y después que le demos Syko arranca mierda

Anoche me visito un ángel pregunto que precio tiene
no poder ser feliz y no ver crecer a tus nenes
dijo que el diablo encuentras a vivir detrás del reca
recuerda que la loca fue quien se llevo a tu vieja

Deja atrás to, recoja busca rumbo tienes tiempo
no confíes ni en ti mismo no hay amigo en el infierno
Sentí una paz inmensa cuando aquel ángel me hablaba
De repente otros en la puerta tocaban

Me dijo no andes solo no te envuelvas no te dejes
tu naciste pa' eso saca pecho no te quejes
no sueltes la pistola que es tu única garantía
de que mañana te alumbre la luz del día

Piensa en la familia, en la renta, la comida
la nena esta enferma ya tu mai murió de SIDA
contéstame cabrón vas a dejar que el destino por ti decida?
o vas a cojer la ley en tu mano y buscar la salida?

Donde te parquiaste?

Afuera del case frente a casa de Nindativa
a hablar de una vía pero ya no se si sirva

Olvídate de eso, hablemos sin dar lata

Pues vamos a movernos que detrás del cemento oyen las ratas

Somos dos dentro del carro los cristales no pueden bajarse
si nos ven entrando juntos el chisme va a regarse
no puedo tirar de afuera hay que entrar y asegurarse
la cuarenta tiene problemas con el peine y va a trancarse

Tas loco tienes que matarme
yo si que voy a bajarme
yo he guerreado por este caserío y no voy a dejarme
el kisko es mio, las reglas van a cambiar,
si ganamos si le metemos, si perdemos hay que mudarse

Me baje yo creo que me vieron
un par corrieron
Kendo lo tengo de frente, me dieron

Hirieron a Syko le enganche el clip de veinte a la nueve
el que mata es en este caserío hoy es el día que lo pruebe

Entre detonaciones y sirenas
la voz de mi nena
dice papi es mejor que te quedes
no salgas me duele
lo que mi nena no sabe es que su papi se debe
a una guerra de calle, un bato se muere
que el dinero nunca se regala y del cielo no llueve
que por ver crecer al primer cabrón ya le di nueve

te falle mi amor quizás nuestros sueños se troyaron
pero a este otro hijo de puta le di los once que quedaron
los guardias llegaron, me rodearon, dispararon
trate de ganarles pero como quiera me cazaron
te escribo desde la cárcel por si no te contaron
o por si lamentablemente fallecí y me enterraron

Anoche me visito un ángel pregunto que precio tiene
no poder ser feliz y no ver crecer a tus nenes
dijo que el diablo encuentras a vivir detrás del reca
recuerda que la loca fue quien se llevo a tu vieja

Deja atrás to, recoja busca rumbo tienes tiempo

Ángeles y demonios oo
hablándome a mi y no oo
No quise escuchar

El día en que mi barrio conozca y reconozca
que sangre llama mas sangre
nunca vamos a terminar con las drogas
si no que ella va a terminar con todos nosotros
que los asesinatos suben cada día mas
y que somos todos y cada uno de nosotros
los responsables de que nuestras comunidades sigan en porvenir

Diagnostico detienen enfermedades oportunistas
Si tu me das un virus encefalitis la primera en su lista
Síndrome de inmuno deficiencia querida
En su etapa terminal decide ya perdió la vida
Yo lloraba lloraba pidiendo entendimiento
Padre amado ayúdame con esto de la forma en que se pueda
Porque de tanto desde quinto no volví a la escuela

Sin familia sin un techo sin nevera
Lograr cumplir un sueño en un cielo sin estrellas
No era algo coherente y hasta pensé que dios se había
Olvidado de mi y me demostró que siempre me tuvo en su lente
Mataron a menor en la autopista Martinena
Alguien en el nombre lleva su alma se pudo salvar
Mama descansa en paz no te tienes que preocupar
Tu nene suena entre los grandes Yankee Don Omar

Kendo enfoca la cámara de tu vida
Hacia los objetivos que de verdad tienen importancia en la vida
Vas a tomar la mano al fuego del éxito

Nunca falta el drama para quien vive en un teatro
Nosotros estamos en la real
Echa pa' adelante pídele a dios que te bendiga
Que te sabiduría sabiduría de lo alto
Como la que pidió Raymond Ayala

La vida es una rueda
Ayer me encontraba en silla de ruedas
Hoy voy a cien y no esperes que retroceda
Con lagrimas de sangre jure que me quedaría con el canto
En el nombre del padre del hijo y espíritu santo
Agarre su manto y seco todo mi llanto
Dejo que pusiera en alto la isla del encanto
Me han tirao con balas con chilla con versos
Pero yo soy imparable voy a mi contra el universo
Mi destino esta escrito por orden divino
El camino es duro pero el duro se queda en el camino
Aja digan lo que digan yo disfruto mi trabajo
Tienes dos opciones quererme o irte pal carajo

Así de sencillo ando con los pies en la tierra
Y mi autoestima en las nubes D Y
Yo soy imparable mi hermano
Con temor a dios y sin miedo al hombre
Te arrodilla busco a dios y después me mato
Con los hombres D Y desde el orfanato tu casa
Y el Cartel la mía Los Insuperables

Reporte de fiscaliza tres de marzo y doce y una de la madrugada
Un auto 108 impacto dentro Baby Rasta
La prensa se aferra a publicarla pero en algo erra
Mientras wilmer alicea en su odisea se aferra
A la promesa celestial que hiciese algún buen día
De consagrar a dios su vida si del hospital salia
Decisión del duro Rasta no se iría
Y lo dejaría vivo pa' que cantara algún día

Tranquilo voy pa' adelante cante quien cante
Po' encima mi misión la cima
Un par de balazos y el duro me echo el brazo
Y me dijo Rasta hoy no es tu día
Yo sigo mejorando mis fans siguen rezando
Y sobre la brea mis lobos están cazando
En mi a mi lado vela por mi vida

La conocí una tarde
Llena de sol y arena
Una diosa en su cara
El cielo entre sus piernas

Le dije esta noche
Sangra la luna llena

Y te llevo a ver las estrellas

Ella, ella, ella, ella

Baje del cielo una estrella

Esta es la noche en la que victorioso saldrá©
Con ella cae en el juego yes
Será en la suite o en mi casa tal vez
Lo que yo sé es que va a ser hasta tarde
Nena me vuelve loco tu figura sensual
No dures tu cintura cuando rompe al caminar
Intensa en un viaje espacial
Es que esta¡ buena pa' bailar, pa' bailar
Una belleza así­ en cualquier loa no se ve
Te voy a dar lo de ella duro sin timidez
Su desnudez me llevo hacia otra parte
Te voy a dar lo de ella hasta saciar la sed
Una belleza así en cualquier loa no se ve
Te voy a dar lo de ella duro sin timidez
Su desnudez me llevo hacia otra parte

Desde que te vi al minuto me puse pa' ti
Acepto eres mi obsesión
Te has convertido en mi adicción
Quieres quitarme la vida a mi
Atrevida, eres una bandida
Quien te mando a cuidarme y a sonsacarme
Vas a tener que dar la liga

Fenomenal one, fenomenal two
Fenomenal noche especial
Fenomenal si te saco a bailar
Fenomenal si dice si
Te dejaras llevar por mi
Porque amaneraras frente al mar
Consultaría a la oscuridad
Y la luna le pedirá
Que si cae linda esta noche
Vaya entonces seamos tres
Yo nunca vista así­, cintura de mujer
Que juegue con el mar y me haga enloquecer

Nunca vista así, cintura de mujer
Con tanto poder que me haga retroceder
Nunca vista así­, cintura de mujer
Que me lleve a las alturas
Y las estrellas me haga ver

Te conocí esa tarde
Llena de sol y arena
Una diosa en tu cara

Vela como sólita mansita se roba el show
Mientras aquel DJ quita bon de de de de de de

Gatita gatarita comenzó la función
Comenzó con la cinturita en acción
Deja que el ritmo del DJ te suba la presión
Pa baja la tensión date toque hechate un bong

Dale candela pa encima no se quita
Tengo el B12que su cuerpo necesita
Tengo el pure que su boca solicita
Me tiene loco loco pues la pongo loquita

Si arriba la acaricio abajo se toca sólita
Con su servicio que tengo por su vueltica
Adicto de sus besos no se su cinturita
Pa ella soy su cura
Ella es mi curita

Nos vamos a fuego donde el cuerpo lo permita
Le doy pal muro pa lo oscuro y se me excita
Le doy mas duro porque duro pa mi grita
Solo me la corro

Quiero besarle el cuello
Bailarle hacerle el amor
Quiero caerle en su juego de la seducción

Cuando la acaricio bailando reggaetón
Quiero llevarla pa casa
Hazle un tri-son

Dale to la noche pa que se levante happy

Yo quiero un cantito de eso que ella da de gratis
Yo quiero ver su cuerpo bailando una del DJ
Mary me arrebata y ella es toda guille

Y hay una historia y su historia como la pille

Quien es otra cosa rosa búscala rastrillen
Bebe fuma hierba y al garete piden

Don Omar,"Ayer te vi
Y sentí que en tu vida ya no existe
Un poco de amor de ese que me diste
Nuestro amor se enfermo de repente
Si aquí estuviera seria feliz
Si una llamada tuya recibiera
Te juro que todo seria diferente
El tiempo me ha vuelto un tempano
Sin ti me siento huérfano
Sin ti me siento huérfano (huérfano)
Me siento solo por el mundo


Sigo siendo el mismo huérfano que te enamoro (que te enamoro)
Que te enamoro (que te enamoro)
Vivo solo por el mundo
Sigo siendo el mismo huérfano que te enamoro

Yo quisiera explicarte, y decirte tantas cosas
Que se convirtieron en murciélagos mis mariposas
Que la rosa que me diste tu, se llenaron de espinas
Y que tu recuerdo ya es una serpiente venonaso, que me sigue
Que me dice syko, que pa' atrás no mire
Que en el mundo hay mucho gente, espera que tu amor se expire
Que el amor que sentía se fue a una zona de combate
Lo hirieron y hoy entre la muerte se debate
Que el amor es de papel y brilla como el aluminio
Uno como una casa, otros es un condominio
Ese es nuestro caso, gigante como un edificio
Por el medio a las alturas, se fue por el precipicio
Hay amor que si es sincero
Hay amor que es embustero
Hay amor que dice te amo
Otro que dice te quiero
Hay amores para siempre
Hay amores por un rato
Hay amores como el nuestro que se le venció el contrato

Ayer te vi
Y sentí que en tu vida ya no existe
Un poco de amor de ese que me diste
Nuestro amor se enfermo de repente
Si aquí estuviera seria feliz
Si una llamada tuya recibiera

Te juro que todo seria diferente
El tiempo me ha vuelto un tempano
Sin ti me siento huérfano
Sin ti me siento huérfano (huérfano)
Me siento solo por el mundo
Sigo siendo el mismo huérfano que te enamoro (que te enamoro)
Que te enamoro (que te enamoro)
Vivo solo por el mundo
Sigo siendo el mismo huérfano que te enamoro

Me enseñaron que la vida es como un rompecabezas,
Que lo nuestro esta incompleto,
Solo faltaba una pieza,
Que el amor que te tenia se contagió de costumbres.
Soy un huérfano en la noche
Ya no hay sol que me alumbre.
Soy un barco que navega en el mar sin dirección.
Un soldado desarmado,
Sin ninguna misión,
Que ha fallado en la hazaña de encontrar el amor perdido,
Sin sentido.
Hoy siento que cupido es mi enemigo.
Que me odia,
Aveces creo que me abandona.
Me siento en la nada,
Perdido en el amazonas.
Amor tan complicado,
Creo que me has abandonado.
Es como ser juzgado en juicio
Sin servicio de abogado.

Ayer te vi
Y sentí que en tu vida ya no existe
Un poco de amor de ese que me diste
Nuestro amor se enfermo de repente
Si aquí estuviera seria feliz
Si una llamada tuya recibiera
Te juro que todo seria diferente
El tiempo me ha vuelto un tempano
Sin ti me siento huérfano
Sin ti me siento huérfano (huérfano)

Vieja dijo Kendo esta maldito

Un asesino no piensa en 
Los muertos ni se acuesta sintiendo los gritos yo de
Chamaquito me encerraba dentro 
De un gran bombo tibio porque la
Sombra del closet solo hablaba del suicidio, 
Nunca conteste porque
Mi abuelo me contó sobre 
Las trampas los demonios y los anzuelos,
Hay algo debajo de mi cama y me desvelo,

Sera verdad que moriré y subiré sin alas al cielo a morar, 
O mi alma vagara sin descansar poder 
Y seré un alma en pena que en la oscuridad, 
No se si sea real que el infierno veré, 
Si no confieso mi pecado mortal, 
Donde fueron a parar los que dijeron que, 
Jamas solo me iban a dejar, 
Tu me puedes contestar si existe quien, 
Que venga pronto necesito conversar nada se ve bien todo anda mal,

Pensamiento erróneo de un cerebro enfermo quien hablo de reencarnar,
Ya abandono la opción los cielos y el infierno, 
En ocasiones siento cosas dentro de mi casa
Como sombras ruidos y reflejos, 
Siempre pregunte que pasaría si
Llamo la muerte siete veces de frente al espejo, 
A veces pienso tanto que me puedo confundir, 
Sera verdad que hay gente que presiente
Cosas antes de morir, 
Si hay algo de lo que yo tengo claro es que
Todos

Vivimos bajo esta duda realmente habrán otros seres con vida en el
Universo o que significa 
La luna cuando alumbra el triangulo de las bermudas, 
Buscando el sueño me acuesto en la cama el cuarto gira y
Me pongo a pensar si algún día me decido por optar tratar de
Renunciarle a la vida podre llegar al cielo perdonado y sin pecar
Un pastor me dijo imposible hijo agárrate de dios mantén la fe y
Camina fijo desde que hablo directo con el ya no tengo intermediarios
Y me quite del cuello el crucifijo

A ser algo mas que un problema interno
Le digo gritando me voy de este infierno

Hoy solo quedamos 2 soldados heridos en esta nuestra guerra avisada
Al parecer el ego y el orgullo nos robaron la mirada
No se si te hace falta pero, dame una llamada
No hay peor castigo que el silencio no te quedes tan callada
Dame una llamada, dejemos que hable el corazón

Ya para mi nada tiene sentido
Tu te haz robado hasta mi corazón
Sin tus besos yo me siento perdido
A pesar de todos tienes la razón

Tu te fuiste, te marchaste
Contigo se fue toda mi fe
Si te sientes, lo que siento
Es que piensas en mi también

Dime si tu piensas en mi
Como yo pienso en ti
Dime si aun vivo en tu corazón
Y si es mía tu mirada

Dime si tu piensas en mi
Como yo pienso en ti
Si yo soy el dueño de tu corazón

Dame una llamada
Te diría tantas cosas
Pero lo ultimo en tu estatus dice ocupado
Y te agradecería si uno de estos días mi numero marcaras

Mi vida en el teléfono con un corazón roto
Esperando tu llamada y conversando con tu foto
Un compromiso contigo que se cae por las escaleras
De un amor que se muere si el teléfono no suena
Un viento que no sopla, una tormenta sin final
Mil consejos pa' que cambie pero nada va cambiar
Soy el mismo, la misma manía y el mismo lunar
De tal manera que te espero en el mismo lugar

Todo se resuelve con una llamada
Solo quiero hablar contigo
Déjame saber si todavía te sientes
Como el primer día que nos vimos

Todo se resuelve con una llamada
Solo quiero hablar contigo
Déjame saber si todavía te sientes
Como el primer día que nos vimos

Como yo pienso en ti
Dime si aun vivo en tu corazón
Y si es mía tu mirada

Dime si tu piensas en mi
Como yo pienso en ti
Si yo soy el dueño de tu corazón

Dame una llamada

Yo se que quizás no fui el hombre que tu imaginabas
Pero en estos momentos te pido
Dame una llamada
Quizás una duda o que sea mas de una razón
Tal vez por presumido lo olvido

Ya para mi nada tiene sentido
Tu te haz robado hasta mi corazón
Sin tus besos yo me siento perdido
A pesar de todos tienes la razón

Tu te fuiste, te marchaste
Contigo se fue toda mi fe
Si te sientes, lo que siento
Es por que piensas en mi también

Dime si tu piensas en mi
Como yo pienso en ti
Dime si aun vivo en tu corazón
Y si es mía tu mirada

Dime si tu piensas en mi
Como yo pienso en ti

Volvió a pasar
Que cupido no volvería a enredarme en su juego
Y aquí ahora estas
Hablando de amar
Hablando de amar

Tu tienes algo inusual que aun no lo descifro
Pero alteras mis sentidos
Otros amores del pasado me han dejado diabetica
Y no puedo ser dulce contigo
Le temo a que tu y cupido me vendan un sueño
Y falle de nuevo
A que hoy estés conmigo y mañana con tu dueña
Si me vuelve a pasar me muero

Oh oh oh uoh
Me gustas pero tengo miedo de fallar en el amor
Oh oh oh uoh
Me gustas pero tengo miedo de fallar en el amor

Yo a cupido no le creo pero en tus ojos veo esa actitud
Que te hizo confiar?
El pasado a sido duro pero casi estoy seguro que princesa tu
Lo puedo cambiar

Con la forma en la que sexy me bailas
Y lo rico que tus labios me besan
A tu lado se me pasan las horas
Lejos de ti no sales de mi cabeza

Con la forma en la que sexy me bailas
Y lo rico que tus labios me besan
A tu lado se me pasan las horas

Y yo que prometí que al amor no le creería más
Y aquí ahora estas
Me la paso pensando en ti todos los días
Hablando de amar
Y yo que caminaba solo en el mundo, sin rumbo
Y aquí ahora estas
Y ahora aquí estas tu devuélveme la luz

Esa guapa me hata al party, vamos a estar así como mierda
Solicite un alcofrado, que embotelle o cotice

De la forma en que bailas y le pones sentimiento
A ese cuerpo que me tiene loco

Pa' este baile no hay salida, que corra el tiempo
Pégate y zumba conmigo con movimiento
Pa' este baile no hay salida, que corra el tiempo
Pégate y zumba conmigo con movimiento

Pa' este baile no hay salida, que corra el tiempo
Pégate y zumba conmigo con movimiento
Pa' este baile no hay salida, que corra el tiempo

Don Omar,"Hijo me tengo que ir
De este hogar
Quiero que sepas que yo siempre estaré aquí
Que el amor que yo sentía por tu madre
Es diferente al que siento yo por ti

Papi no te preocupes que yo puedo entenderlo
El amor que tú nos tienes no es igual
Que por ti lo aprendí todo
Me enseñaste a comprender a los demás
Solo te pido
Que de mi tú no te olvides nunca
Jamás

Hijo me voy, yo sé que me vas a extrañar
Cuando seas tú más grande entenderás
Pero me duele
Estar lejos de ti me duele

Yo sé lo que sientes
Te amo, soy tu hijo y puedo comprenderte
Nada puede cambiar lo que siente mi corazón
Donde estés tú
Estaré yo
Por siempre estaremos juntas

Lo que yo siento nunca cambiará
Mi pequeño nunca yo
De ti me voy a separar
Nunca cambiaré este amor
Lo que yo siento por ti es especial
Un sentimiento muy profundo
Yo te traje a ti a este mundo
Y nunca te voy a abandonar

No cambiará naaaa nana naaa nana siempre estaremos juntos
Naaa nana naaa nana nada de eso cambiará
Naaaa nana naaa nana siempre estaremos juntos
Naaa nana naaa nana nada de eso cambiará

Voy a creer en lo que veo, voy a confiar en tus palabras
Yo aprenderé a ser el hombre que ocupe tú lugar
Y no me hables de dolores, no me hables de llorar
Tu siempre serás mi padre y eso nadie lo cambiará
No me digas adiós sino hasta luego
Tu hijo siempre lo seré yo y tu mi padre perfecto

Hijo me voy, yo sé que me vas a extrañar
Cuando seas tú más grande entenderás
Pero me duele
Estar lejos de ti me duele

Yo sé lo que sientes
Te amo, soy tu hijo y puedo comprenderte
Nada puede cambiar lo que siente mi corazón

Debes empezar a vivir
A soñar, a reír
A gozar y sentir
Todo lo malo quedó atrás
Decide no sufrir
Piensa en ser feliz

Y solo baila
Olvida las penas y el dolor
Ven y derrama el sudor
Solo baila
La vida es una sola
Y mejor
Bailar con la luna y el sol

Vida, pura vida
La vida es una copa
Y se bebe gota a gota hasta el final
Vida, pura vida

Y se bebe gota a gota hasta el final

Hasta el final

Hasta el final

Eres candela
Y llevas la llama por dentro
Déjala salir
Vive el momento
Y lo que pase mañana

Déjalo venir
Pero solo piensa en bien vivir
Y en reír
Mira a tú alrededor
Todos apostamos a ti

Y celebra que la vida es una
Que pa' tu cintura, temperatura
Esto sí que es vida, libera la tuya
Bailemos con el sol y la luna

Y celebra que la vida es una

Baila como si no hubiera gente
Que brille el sol bien caliente
Y lo que se va no vuelve
Vida es una sola
Vive sin miedo de lo que piensen
Ríe sin detenerte
Y ama sin contenerte
Vida es una sola

Vida, pura vida
La vida es una copa
Y se bebe gota a gota hasta el final

Huele a sereno, a puro y veneno

No salgan sin paraguas que esta noche hay trueno
Cojan su esquina, se me juntan las mas finas

Sin grillete, el mio y su billete y pa la calle
Y pal que falle el combete

Si te lo agarra esta dificil que salga
Siempre ready por si le caigo chingo
En la mano abierta un condón

Aunque parezca un bonbon
Uno nunca sabe cuanto se la han comido el toto
Mientras mas buena estan y le dan a la cuestión
Tu sabes que no se puede sin protección
De laton y el hijue puta en el microphone
Para que acelere el ambiente
Basura para el zafacon

Estas sintiendo la presión
Si siente fuego que te quema
Descontrola tu sistema y reguardemos la pasión

Báilame con esa mirada
Que tu sabes que me hechiza
Y me saca de concentración
Quiero tenerte hasta mañana
Y repetir en una cama
Lo que un día ya paso

Pégate más que quiero ver quien eres
Los movimientos me dicen que fuiste tu
La que con besos me lleno de placeres
Mientras bailábamos pegaos a poca luz

Por que tu obsesión conmigo?

Serán esos ojitos que me vuelven loco
O lo rico que me das picos poco a poco
Esa locura que se vive en tus caderas
O esa cintura que me lleva a las estrellas

Mami tu tienes la culpa, me dejas con las ganas
Me dice que otro día, visitará mi cama
De pronto eres de esas, que quiere algo en serio
Pero como me gustas, no me queda más remedio

Que tratar tratar tratar de convencerla
No no no no conmigo no vas a jugar
Tratar tratar tratar de convencerla

Cuando me bailabas sexy, bajo el sol
De todas tus amigas eras la envidia mi nena
Bailame de frente y bañame en sudor

Aquella noche frente al mar cartagena
Tus ojos negros, tu cuerpo y la luna llena
Fueron tus besos y el calor de la noche nena
Que me tiene llamando, contéstame morena

Que el tiempo corre y la brisa de las palmeras
Solo me acuerda tu voz y piel canela
Son los recuerdos de una noche entera
Que murieron como espumas a orillas en la arena

Ma tienes la culpa, me deja con las ganas
Me dice que otro día, visitará mi cama
De pronto eres de esas que quiere algo en serio

A soledad por vida eterna
A todo se negó por miedo al dolor

Por un cretino fue que ella olvido
Los besos, las caricias y rechazo el amor
Por culpa de un cobarde fue que ella cambió
Y nunca más volvió a enamorarse

Lagrimas de dolor, soledad sin consuelo
En eso se convirtió, su corazón lleno de miedo
Lagrimas de dolor, soledad sin consuelo
En eso se convirtió, ya no confía en nadie no
Ya no confía en nadie no

Se canso de llorar y condeno su corazón, a una celda
Para protegerlo del amor, del peligro nunca estar cerca

A todo se negó, por miedo al dolor

Por culpa de un imbécil que nunca la amo
Hoy llora noche y día viviendo del dolor
Por culpa de un estúpido que nunca vio
Que ella todo lo dio al entregarse

Hoy sufre arrepentida llora sol a sol
Al más grande cobarde que la traiciono
Al sucio, mentiroso que me la engaño
Y sueños le vendió sin valorarle

Lagrimas de dolor, soledad sin consuelo
En eso se convirtió, su corazón lleno de miedo
Lagrimas de dolor, soledad sin consuelo
En eso se convirtió, ya no confía en nadie no
Ya no confía en nadie no

Como sacábamos tiempo para nuestros encuentros, cerca de aquí
Esos momentos intensos del deseo dos presos, cuando era así
Dicen que han cambiado los tiempos
Que ahora tienes dueño
Y no me corresponde a mí
Solo te mientes a tí
Hoy como que tengo ganas
De olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Desperté con ganas de llamarte
Deseos de verte
De pasar a buscarte
Y no se puede aparente
Quiero la cabeza dañarte
Arrastrarte pa meterte
Beber toda la noche
Y en high arrebatarte

Te voy a enseñar que de tu cuerpo
Soy el dueño de sus partes
Con quien duermes de noche, no sabe ni tocarte
Contesta mi llamar, antes de que se haga tarde
Vuelvas a sus brazos, donde yo ya no pueda darte

Como aquella noche de pasión
Donde éramos fuego, quemándonos intensos
En tu habitación
Donde aún guardas recuerdos y el olor de mi cuerpo
Cerca de ti
Yo solo invento un pretexto y envíame un texto
Y yo te correspondo a ti
Cuando te sientas así

Y tu como que tienes ganas

Ganas, de olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Yo se que tienes a alguien
Que tu dices que lo quieres
Pero no le hacemos daño
Así evitamos que se entere

No dejes que la conciencia te frene
Que tu quieres que te haga lo que te hace siempre tu nene
Loco por sentir como ahora te mueves
Imaginarte me pone caliente
Y más cuando yo se como tu eres
Cuando comienzas nada te detiene

Maldy!
Hey tu sabes que esto no es amor
Las ganas son sentir tu color y tu calor
A ley nena pa que te tire la mision
Tengo un secreto que tu eres mi perdición
Eres sensual a lo bruto si es tu decision
Ah, de espalda para que baje el sudor
Es que yo quiero castigo pa tu cuerpo
Y lo telefones off
Sexo entre dos
No hay rastreo ni motivos pa discusión

Hoy como que tengo ganas
De olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más

Ponte un traje de baño y vamos pa' la playa

Playa corazón y arena, dos mamis bien buenas
Whiskey con cojones, la música que suena
Si habrá party en piscina con la hija de la vecina
Bebiendo todo el corillo y smokeando en una esquina

Un dembow de mi cocina y mucha gasolina
Volumen para la bocina que hoy vamos para encima
Hoy nos fuimos al garete aunque llamen la policía
Activados los monsalvetes que la calle esta prendía

Shorty anda encendida, corriendo por la mía
Modelando en la de ella con su tropa prendida
Coquetea lucia para montarse en la mía
Y como yo ando prendido esta noche si es mía

Hasta abajo poseida en dembow y brujería
El deseo la controla, esta noche hay avería
Esa, esa baila sola si el Dj la motiva
Y como menea la cola, la muy zorra me la activa

Con 36 se desquita
A mí solo me juzga Dios
Y me perdona toñita
Yo soy de la esquina
Donde el chamaquito suyo capeaba
Y mientras la nota bajaba
Yo la trabaja
De la esquina donde por 10 pesos
Se complicó
Crecía ya ganancia de dos
Me lleva el policia
Por donde 500 sucios pesos
Los panas se matan
Y esperan a que caiga preso
Y hasta las doñas se clavan
Donde no existe lealtad
Respeto ni sentimiento
Dime tú que hay de bonito
En esta selva de cemento
Donde se pasa hambre y la educación es pobre
Y a los chamaquitos les corre jugar a ser gangster

Señor gobernador, yo se que la culpa no es suya
Y perdone la bulla, pero aquí no se vive mejor
Quizás de donde yo soy se fuma como es
Pero de donde usted viene se en huelga hasta los pies

Que irónico, usted pensando en un conflicto bélico
Antes de ser lógico y reformar a su gente

Pana son las que me hingan, ombe no

Y salí sin ningún rasguño del tintingo
Veterano de mil campañas que lo logró
Gracias a dios y a todos ustedes, que lo que hago le gusto
Enserio, cárcel, cementerio o tirar todo el mundo al medio
De traqueto a sapo es un cambio inmenso
Yo que tu como que lo pienso
Detenidamente antes que te sientes
En la silla de testigo contra tu gente
Witness protection, nueva identidad new direction, you know
Para que no te den dembow
Asuma consecuencias papi, espero alla guardao
O triste sera su caso
Vivi en tus zapatos mucho tiempo mulato
Meta cojones asi mismo a lo macho
Purachito adentro, otro afuera
La prison es parte de esta novela
Pa que te enteres, pa mi calle solo eres
Cuando to cojan los feos, y no coperes
No te embleques, no sapees
Entendiste ahora nene

Callejero soy
Nunca olvido de donde vengo
Y le sigo dando gracias a dios
Porque sobreviví
Y sigo aquí
Yo en la calle nací, vivo y muero

Que empezamos el tiri tápate

Esta caliente, ahora sofócate
Derrito el marshmellow, tiembla like hielo
Titanic ya chocaste con el témpano de hielo

Sigue ahí, verano que te espera
Sigue ahí, la espera desespera
Sigue ahí, quien ganará el encuentro
Date un par de shot y tirate al medio

Que cierren la balbula de escape
De aquí no te vas, hasta que esa faldita destape
Igual que todas las botella, escoge cualquiera
Para llevarte pa las estrellas
Cuando bajes ella te atropella
Siente el golpe, canto cabrón

Don Omar,"Yo soy de aquí
Del barrio que me vio nacer
De la esquina que me vio crecer
Del callejón con los panas fumando
Con fama soñando
Cantando y llegué.
Lejos del barrio estaba otra ciudad
Y en otro cielo se escuchó mi canción
Pero lo que jamás podré olvidar
Es de donde salí pues eso es lo que soy

Yo soy de aquí, bien orgulloso me siento
Directo de PR los reyes del movimiento
Don-Don, Yandel esto no es un invento
Esto es algo que cotizao’ son más de quinientos mil
A mi público yo le doy las gracias
Porque a pesar de la distancia nos siguen con ansias
Don-Don, Yandel mucho porte y elegancia
Talento desde la infancia
Porque soy de aquí
Pa’ lante voy a seguir
No voy a permitir
Que nadie me ponga el píe
Yo voy a tirar pa’ lante

Papi yo soy de aquí y aunque en Puerto Rico no nací
Represento la tierra donde yo crecí
Acostumbrado al tambor y al sonido del coquillo
Yo soy así de calma, sí, yo soy de aquí
Donde en esto comencé y con la calle me inspiré
Primero gatié, me paré y luego caminé
Poco a poco fui forrándome en plata
Viajando el mundo más que una azafata
Y yo no sé si tú lo entiendes pero así las cosas van
Conozco el avión por dentro
Ya parezco un capitán
Gracias a Dios le doy por escuchar mi coro
Le pedí plata y me respondió con oro

Yo soy de aquí
Del barrio que me vio nacer
De la esquina que me vio crecer
Del callejón con los panas fumando
Con fama soñando
Cantando y llegué
Lejos del barrio estaba otra ciudad
Y en otro cielo se escuchó mi canción
Pero lo que jamás podré olvidar
Es de donde salí pues eso es lo que soy

Nací pobre pero un tesoro vive dentro de mi corazón
Y esa es la perla del Caribe
Quien arropa mi bandera cuando duermo en campo santo
Es el orgullo de la isla del encanto
Varios los frustra con to’ lo mío
Entramos por el monte y salimos por el río
Un ícono mundial vacilando en los chinchorros
Mi gente fuerte y firme como el morro
Soy el indio, el esclavo y conquistador
Par de manos
Soy el hijo de la humildad, la libertad y del tirano
Un talento del caserío (ajá)
Donde la esperanza es una *** (ajá)
Donde los difuntos resucitan (¿Cómo?)
En forma de graffiti

Yo soy de aquí
Del barrio que me vio nacer
De la esquina que me vio crecer

Don Partridge,"First girl I loved
Time has come I will sing the sad goodbye song
When I was seventeen, I used to know you
And I haven't seen you now in so many years
And the last time I saw you
You said you joined the Church of Jesus
But me I remember your long red hair
Falling in our faces as I kissed you

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
And you're probably married now
With a house and car and all
And you turned into a grown-up female stranger
If I was lyin' by you now, I wouldn't be here at all

Well we parted so hard
Me rushing 'round New York with a guitar
Making love to people I didn't even like to see
And I still sometimes think of you
As I lay here in the six at morning
And in the lonely midnight
I've got to hold your face before me

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
And you're probably married now
With kids and all
And you turned into a grown-up female stranger
If I was lyin' by you now, I'd just have to fall

And I never slept with you
Though we must have made love a thousand times
'Cause we were just young
Didn't have no place to go

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
So its goodbye, first love
And I hope you're fine
I have a sweet woman
Maybe someday she`ll have babies by me
(She pretty)
She`s a true friend of mine",First Girl I Loved
Don Patterson,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me

That I adore you, dear
But grant me

I'm not entirely to blame

Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.

Now and forever and when forever's done

As all Summer days turned to Autumn nights
But like a bird who needs to fly into the sun,
You couldn't say
Why did you go away?

You left with the sun did me so cold,
So when Winter turns to Summer, 
Will I find my September Love?

Well every Spring I hoped that I would find that special kinda love
To last me for all time
But still I wondered in the days and nights of Summer saved away,
until the day you came,
Girl you rise me up just to let me down,
You took me for a ride and left me on the ground,
And now I'm sending out a message in the sky, for only you
And every word is true

September Love, where did you go? 
You left with the sun did me so cold,
So when Winter turns to Summer, 
Will I find my September Love?

Ohhh, September dream,
Stolen away,
Still I believed you'd come back one day (come back for me)
I'm searching for the heart that once was mine,
My September Love, yahh
And everywhere I go, I only see your face
I try to let it pass but my mind just can't erase 
So will the Winter gray, turn the skies to blue
And so I'll follow every road that leads to you....

Yah September Love, where did you go? (where did you go?)
You left with the sun did me so cold, (ohhh, did me so cold)
So when Winter turns to Summer, 
Will I find my September Love? (ohhh)

Ohhh, September dream, (September dream..)
Stolen away, (Stolen away...)
Still I believed you'd come back one day 
(I believed back in you... that you'd come back one day)
I'm searching for the heart that once was mine, 

Oh, My September Love, 
Yah September Love,
You took the sun and you did me so cold..",September Love

Night after night
Don't know what you do
But you sure do it right
There's nothing mistaking,oh
What my love is for
You make me love you
All I wanna do is love you...more
Like the sunshine warms my body
Like a love song soothes my soul
Like this feeling deep inside me
There are some things I just can't control
It happens so naturally
Girl as you live and breathe

I see forever when you kiss me
It's like heaven when we touch
Every whisper makes me shiver
Seems we never can get close enough,no
I can't count the stars in the sky

Has this effect on me

I got your letter just the other day,
You said you saw but walked away,
Said that I looked happy, I looked ok,
And you decide that I was better off that way

I may have seemed just fine,
But everyday your on my mind,
I miss you all the time, yah

And do you know what you'd see,
If you could see me now, (hey yah)
Just a fool with a broken heart,
Missing you somehow
And baby that's what you'd see,
If you could see me know,
You know the person who broke your heart,
Is missing you right now (yah, oh yah)

I got lost chasing all of my dreams,
I guess our love came apart at the seems,
I made a mark, but I've paid the price (yeah, yeah)
A pot of gold, and a heart of ice,
And since I went away
I think about you everyday
And wished that I had stayed,

And do you know what you'd see,
If you could see me now, (hey yah)
Just a fool with a broken heart,
Missing you somehow
And baby that's what you'd see,
If you could see me know,
You know the person who broke your heart,
Is missing you right now (right now, oh yah)

If I could change
Turn back the hands of time yah
I'd give you back my heart, my soul, my mind
And I'd be a different man
I'd do all that I can
And if you'd come back
I'd make everything alright again (yah)
.... yeahh girl ....

If you could see me now, if you could see me now
You would see my broken heart,
You would see a broken man, baby

And do you know what you'd see,
If you could see me now, (hey yah)
Just a fool with a broken heart, (just a fool)
Missing you somehow (somehow, baby, baby, that's what you'd see)

Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know
Don Reitan,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way
