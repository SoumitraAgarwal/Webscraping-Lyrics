Robert Berry," Have we been pretending we live this street life
Ones the tough ones thinking now we've grown
You say the feelings are changing now with every night
Don't know where a lonely rebel goes
On the other side you found something different
The other side of life you say you've never known

But either you do or you don't, girl, can't you tell me?
Either you will or you won't, gotta make up your mind
You either go or you stay, there ain't no pretending
We've gotta do it together and keep our love alive

Keep turning back the pages, pictures of a time that kept us strong
Pieces of a life that we gave meaning
How can you wonder if those days are gone
But the other side you heard the minds rest easy
The other side of life you say you need to know

But either you do or you don't, girl, can't you tell me?
Either you will or you won't, gotta make up your mind
You either go or you stay, there ain't no pretending
We've gotta do it together and keep our love alive

Can you just give up what your heart still tells you
Oh, the very things that kept our hopes alive
But the other side you say that we could make it
Oh, the other side of life will keep us both alive

Oh but either you do or you don't, girl, can't you tell me?
Either you will or you won't, gotta make up your mind
You either go or you stay, there ain't no pretending
We've gotta do it together and keep our love alive
Oh but either you do or you don't, girl, can't you tell me?
Either you will or you won't, girl gotta make up your mind
You either go or you stay, there ain't no pretending
We've gotta do it together and keep our love alive, oh, oh, oh ",You Do or You Don't
Robert Berry,"Well, I rush out blazin'
My pulse is racin'
As the rain streams down my face

There's no turning back now
To fight with fate
Outnumbered an' out of place

They said, ""Go west young man, that's best
It's there you'll feel no pain""
Bel-Air's okay if you dig the grave
But I want to live again

Can't let go
There's a madness in my soul tonight
Can't let go
Must stop ridin' like the storm

Can't let go
Will I run out of control tonight?
Can't let go
Until every trace is gone

It's a winding road from Cuesta way
Down sunset to the beach
Though Canoga Park is a straight safe drive
It's too far outta reach

But now the headlights are flashin' by so fast
All directions seems the same
And the windscreen wipers keep a beat repeatin'
You can't let go again

What's in a name on the street tonight
I'm only a face in the crowd
I'm all in the dark and afraid tonight
There's nowhere to run or to hide

But I can't let go, no, no, no

Sometimes the world outside'll take you in
With just a smile
And you're so blinded with desire

A hundred sleepless nights have left me
Wasted and so cold
But I can take it I'm hangin' on

Can't let go
There's a madness in my soul tonight
Can't let go
Must stop ridin' it like the storm

Can't let go
Will I run out of control tonight?
Can't let go
Until every trace is gone

Can't let go
Can't let go
Can't let go
Can't let go

Can't let go
Can't let go
Can't let go
Can't let go
Can't let go",Can't Let Go
Robert Bradley,"Can you see it
When it's coming
Feel the danger
Got you running
From the color
Disappearing
So much gray skin
Is appearing

They never see the day of light
They like to feel in the night
They like to gamble in the street
They like to gamble with your life

Can you hear it
When it's calling
Turn your head brown
Keep on talking
Tryin to stay cool
The demons keep on pullin
Someone keeps on givin
The fire keeps on burnin

They never see the day of light
They like to feel in the night
They like to gamble in the street
They like to gamble with your life

Daylight is coming
Devil got you runnin
City bus is hummin
The future is runnin
Sometimes that I feel that
It's time I'm on my way back
Find out where I been from
God knows I need some

They never see the day of light

Robert Bradley,"[Kid Rock]
And if you feel it
Then let me know it
Show it, here's your chance
Don't blow it
I got game too player
Now watch me throw it
I feel we owe it
To the people on the real side
To collide styles because it seems
Real music died
We got pride in our city, Detroit
Kid Rock and Bradley baby, mmm,
Now that's the real joint
And when it hits it's like a fist
From Joe Louis
Try to get higher than us
You'll just blow through us...


[Robert Bradley]
I saw lightening
I heard thunder
As the river bout to flow
I saw faces
So many places
Wonderin where I got to go
Feel like I got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Where I can rest my aching soul

Take me higher
A little higher
Save my soul
Come higher
Take me up
Higher
A little higher

I heard stories
I got older
Wonder if I truly believe
But I'll take what
You give me brother
Wonder if I really need
But I know that
Come tomorrow
I'm gonna reach a higher spot
Smoke and fire
Take me higher
Somehow I got to breathe

Take me higher
A little higher
Save my soul
Come higher
Take me up
Higher
A little higher

A little higher

And if you feel it in your toes
And you won't stop
And if it's deep in your soul
Then you can't stop
And if you know what I know
Then you won't stop
We're goin way up, way up
Way up, way up, way up

Robert Bradley,"I went down to Mississippi
Stopped a night in New Orleans
There was so many pretty women
So many answers to my dreams
Well I went to see Mr. Tony
As a bottle hit my shoe
He was there sittin' there rollin' a stogey
Diggin' on some good ol' rhythm and blues
Sometimes I feel like lovin'
Sometimes I feel like kissin' too
Sometimes I feel like lovin'
But most of all I like lovin' you

Well I went up to New York City
Tiffany gold diamond ring
Girl there's so many things happenin'
You showed me how to play the game

Sometimes I feel like lovin'
Sometimes I feel like kissin' too
Sometimes I feel like lovin'
But most of all I like lovin' you

Sometimes I feel like lovin'

Robert Bradley,"I still back remember
Sitting down on my mother's knee
She told me a story about love
How it was gonna be a mystery

Oh, I used to know ya
Back when you were in high school
Went off to college
Got you some knowledge
Now you think I'm a fool

Go on and ride
Go on and ride
Hold your head up high
Go on and ride
Go on and ride
Hold your head up high

Up there on the movie screen (screen)

Robert Bradley,"The door's open to heaven wide
I took a look on the other side
Took a drink for you and me
In our heart, I hope we can be free

War keeps on goin on
Stood on the rocks to rise above the storm
So much love cried out the years
Forget all the heartaches, so many tears

Take love and receive it
You know, that you need it
Take love where you find it
You know I don't mind

Dreamed a dream for all mankind
The light of love lightens up my mind
Take me up, Lord where beauty lies
So much love if we can grow inside

Take love and receive it
You know, that you need it
Take love where you find it
You know I don't mind

Now we're back for the evermore
Here comes the ships taking us to that shore
The glory of life will shine all the time
Lord I know it really gets my mind

Take love and receive it
Don't you know, that you need it
Take love where you find it

Robert Bradley,"Take time to discover
That I'm runnin', runnin' out of space
Talk to the others
That I'm livin' time in a chase
And I feel
The wind is gonna blow
Madness all around me
And I feel it's time to go
Tryin' to make it right
Wake up from the night

Take time sure to wonder
That there's life in another place
Do you believe in the magic all around us
In this life you got to face
I wanna tell y'all
Seen a man on the move
There's so much out there
But I know he's comin' soon
And I feel good, good
And I feel good right now

Robert Bradley,"I was born on a farm in Alabama
And I was raised on God and cane and old ways
But now I'm rollin down the road in the Motor City
This is a tramp singin a song about a tramp

Well I did some time blow my mind in Texas
And I fell in love down in Monterey
But now I'm rollin down the road in the Motor City
This is a tramp singin a song about a tramp

Oh Lord, I wasn't born here
And I pray to the Lord above I'll never die here
But now I'm rollin down the road in the Motor City
This is a tramp singin a song about a tramp
Oh like that river
I got to keep on rollin
Like that river
Got to keep on rollin

And I toast some wine down in Harlem

Robert Brookins,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,

Robert Brooks,"There's a dear old land of leprechauns
And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven
Robert Brooks,"There's a spot in my heart,
Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,
Never sounded or known;

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Robert Calvert,"A flight of steel eagles tearing by
The ripped-silk screaming of the rended sky
Flame on through sound and make time fly
What a good way to go
What a good way to go
In the aerospaceage inferno

Fly through the ground like a circus hound
Through the burning hoop with just one bound
So not even your ashes will be found
What a good way to go
What a good way to go
In the aerospaceage inferno

Set the controls for the heart of the earth
The silver machine is worth more than you're worth
But the Phoenix soul is bound for rebirth

Robert Calvert,"Catch a falling starfighter
Put it in the pocket of your jeans
You can use it as a cigarette lighter
Or as an opener for a can of beans
Catch a falling starfighter
Shine it up and wear it on a chain
You will find that it will be much brighter
If you empty out its cockpit down the drain
If you empty out its cockpit down the drain

I focused the magnifying glass
That brought the downfall of Icarus.
Balloons were easy; a simple pin;
Or a knife in the case of the zeppelin.
That blade was the cause of many a prang
In the early days of stick and string.
I am the gremlin. 
I was there.
Making mischief in the air
And always will be wherever man
Flies in the face of Creation's plan.

Robert Calvert,"There's only one course of action
Left for me to take
I've tried every switch selection
That might control this state
I think for my protection
I'd better make it straight
Into ejection
Better tell base, ejection
That I think it's a case for ejection 
Blown into space, ejection
Protect my face, ejection

The radar screen's projection
Tells me I'm too late
To make a course correction
I'm about to meet my fate
No time for reflection
I'd better make it straight
Into ejection
Bust through the sky, ejection 
The air rushing by, ejection 
It's a case of goodbye, ejection 
I'm too fast to die
Ejection 

When a ship meets with destruction
The captain stays to drown
But no tin contraption
Is going to drag me down
My reference intersection
Tells me that I'm bound
For ejection 
Eight times my weight, ejection 
Got to escape, ejection 
Only one move to make, ejection 
Abandon this crate, ejection 
Abandon this crate, ejection",Ejection
Robert Calvert,"I see myself a hero
While one wings falls away
And the dial approaches zero
In a spiralling display.
My past life flashes feverishly,
And lives I did not lead,
Like the time I was a hero
Of a weird, outlandish breed.

One arm of flesh and muscle
And one of feathered scale
I was hero with one wing
That was of no avail.
I could only fly in circles
Like a corkscrew in the sky,
My one wing flapping frantically
While birds just glided by.

I launched myself from mountains
And from the highest trees
And though I could get nowhere
Just landed on my knees.
But still I was a hero,
With one wing more than most.
Almost half an Angel;
A whirling holy ghost.

My father was an eagle
With two wings wide as sails
My mother was the west wind witch
With grasping finger nails.
She lured him from his aerie
With her twittering device.
She kept him in a golden cage
And fed him field mice.

Shield-clad and shining,

They lie down with long-hairs, they make love to guitars
They ride round in vans, not in limousine cars

Her eyes were plastered with a lot of mascara
And her hair was cut by Vidal
I was wondering how I was going to score her
A real live intellectual

And then she started talking bout a new production
Of Dostoyevsky in drag
The way her mouth moved was pure seduction
When she said she'd written it up in a mag

It was over my head, over my head

And what did I think of Godard
I tried to imagine her in a bikini

Where the hero loses his soul?

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

I hear her whisper, ""Baby, let me in""
I sat up in my bed
""She's hear"", my heart cried

Just like I fantasized

I opened up my door and smelled her sweet perfume
Opened up my arms and smelled her satin skin
She said, ""I'm yours tonight""
A fire glowed in her eyes

Just like I fantasized
Just like I fantasized
Just like I fantasized

She waits on tables at my favorite cafe
I tease and tempt her with games we can play
This evening with dinner she served me a smile
She said, ""I'll be back when I get off tonight""

She had sugar-sweet lips and magical hips
Just like I fantasized
What a slow ride, she moaned and she cried
Just like I fantasized

Loved her a thousand ways all in my mind
And now I feel
The dream is by my side

It's a dark and dreary morning
With the clouds covering up the sky

[Chorus:]
The forecast calls for pain
The forecast calls for pain
My baby's turning cold
And the forecast calls for pain

We stayed up all night talking
She's grown restless she confessed
She says there's no one new
But deep down I know that's next

[Chorus]

She says she tried and tried yes she has
But slowly her love has died
I can see that deep down inside she's changed
The forecast calls for pain
The forecast calls for pain
The forecast calls for pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can hear approaching thunder
I can feel chills run up my spine
I've seen love freeze before
And I know I'm on borrowed time

I can see the lightning
I can feel the pain
Oh, it's gonna rain

Robert Cray,"I paid the clerk and moved right in
A single room with one big twin
There's a chest and mirror
Shower's down the hall
Room 16 ain't got no view
But the hot plate's brand new

I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her

Once again I've been burned
My suspicion's been confirmed
I saw her having lunch
With some new guy
I walked up and said, ""Goodbye""
She said, ""Wait, can we talk tonight?""

I guess I showed her
Mmmm, I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her that a man, yeah
Has his limits

Another man is where I draw the line
She can have the house
And everything that's in it
I guess I showed her, yeah
I guess I showed her

She will be surprised
When she comes in tonight
Flips on the light
And finds an empty home
Yeah, every time she's lied
Will flash before her eyes

I guess I showed her, yeah, yeah
I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her, yeah, yeah

Now she can have the house
And she can keep the car

Robert Cray,"See him cuddled in the shadows
Sleepin' on his cardboard bed
Using rags for a pillow
Where he lays his unwashed head
His blanket's old newspaper
Not much good against the snow
See so many like him out there
When you walk the night patrol
When you walk the night patrol

Oh, you wonder where he came from
Where he's gonna go
Was it a woman or a bottle?
That's brought him down so low
What's happened to his family?
Do they know he's out here in the cold?
He's just a nameless soldier
Marching on the night patrol
Marching on the night patrol

Like that girl on the corner
She can't be more than seventeen
She's run away from somewhere
Taking nothing but her dreams
Now those dreams are lying shattered
As the street exacts its toll
And she's just another victim
Lost out on the night patrol

Oh, you could ask me why I'm out here
Where do I fit into the scene?
Now I'm drawing unemployment
Got replaced by a machine
And I'm tortured by my bad habits
Sometimes, I lose this struggle to control
And the street has its attractions

Don't need nothin' but a woman

Give me French brandy that will clear my head

Nothin' but a woman, yeah, yeah

I heard him shout who is he, she mumbled low
He said baby don't you lie to me no more
And I'm listening through these thin walls silently
As he called out my name I was right next door

It's because of me
It's because of me

She was right next door and I'm such a strong persuader
That she was just another notch on my guitar
She's gonna lose the man that really loves her
In the silence I can hear their breaking hearts

At daybreak I hear him back and say goodbye
I can hear him slam the door and walk away
Right next door I hear that woman start to cry
I should go to her but what would I say

It's because of me

I've been used to all the heartache
The jealousy and pain
So I'm well aware of what it takes
To win her back again

I played a fool for her smile, I found a groove in her style
I hung on every word that she said
But she was living up inside my head
And I better think this whole thing through for awhile

I'm not one to gamble
But in love my rules slide

Robert Cray,"I stood there waiting as you drove by, sad but true
All the years that we've been friends, shame on you
Now times are rough when you're not around
And I wish you well with the new life you've found
But someday, baby, I'll see you on the road down

In times of trouble it's easy to turn and walk away
Life is too tough, guess, it's too much for you to stay
I guess, it's safe to say I'll be around
It'll sure be hard to stay in the same town
But someday, baby, I'll see you on the road down

Never thought I would lose
I can't shake this awful feeling

I can do a lot fo things
But let me tell you girl
I can't make it by myself in this great big world
The price I pay for loving you

Do I love her anymore
Or is it loneliness that I feel
Do our hearts still beat as one
Or are we held together by the years

Make sure, did we forget anything?
Turn the lights out and close the door
Tell the mailman we don't live here no more

They said it was paradise
And that we'd live here forever
And they stabbed us in the back
With a poison dagger

Stood by the river
And watched us drown
Smiled, then they waved
While we went down

But once was will never happen
Again
Now we travel out of Eden

I know you would stand up
For what is right
And I know you would you stand up
Against what's wrong

Our neighbors were blind
But we had each other
And we became strong

They said it was paradise
And that we'd live here forever
Then they stabbed us in the back
With a poison dagger

Wrongly accused
Rightly upset
When our friends turned their backs
We knew we'd never, never forget

What once was will never happen
No, no, again
Now we travel out of Eden

Put your suitcase down
Lay on the bed
I'll open up the window
Clear skies ahead

We can sit on the beach
Or swim in the ocean
We survived on a life of devotion

They said it was paradise
And that we'd live here forever
And they stabbed us in the back
With a poison dagger

Tried and convicted
Without hearing our side
Now everyone's sorry
But there'll be no next time

What once was will never happen again
Now we travel out of Eden
Now we travel out of Eden
Now we travel out of Eden

And her porchlight's on
The signal
That her man is gone
She'll open her back door wide
I'll slip down the alley, then slip inside

She's waiting
Just inside the door
In perfume
Probably nothing more
She'll greet me with her arms spread wide
Hit by the darkness, we'll fly, fly, fly

Standing here
I feel just like a criminal
Returning to the seen of the crime
Every time that we steal these loving hours
We promise that it will be the last time

Sneak out
Just before the dawn
Knowing that we've done her man wrong
He's out working while we're at plays
And my conscious hounds me
The whole long day

My blood starts to stir
All my thoughts go back to her
At midnight my guilt will ease

That she was just another notch on my guitar
She's gonna lose the man that really loves her

Robert Cray,"Last night once again I had the dream
I tossed and I turned
That old feeling's still the same
It was so real, I woke up cold and sweating
I wonder did I call her name?

In the dream she was right there with me
Right there with me in the bed
She said, ""Bobby, come and kiss me""
""Never leave me"" is what she said
But when I reached out to hold her
Oh, I woke my wife instead

Once again, once again, I had the dream
Six years since I've seen her
Ain't no doubt about what it means, no, no
I tried hard not to think about her
But all she left me was this dream

All she left me was the dream

Robert Cray,"I still remember
The day I went home
The taxi dropped me on the street

I saw a lady on the porch
That I knew from years before
She said, ""Sorry about your father""
From behind the closed screen door

Robert DeLong,"I think it burns my sense of truth
To hear me shouting at my youth
I need a way to sort it out.

After I die, I'll re-awake,
Redefine what was at stake
From the hindsight of a god.

I'll see the people that I use,
See the substance I abuse,
The ugly places that I lived.

Did I make money? Was I proud?
Did I play my songs too loud?
Did I leave my life to chance
Or did I make you fucking dance?

Symmetry exists only in our mind.
Our brain is shaping squares.
So I woke up with entropy defined
But the forms still linger there, in my head.

I'll see the people that I use,
See the substance I abuse,
The ugly places that I lived.

Did I make money? Was I proud?
Did I play my songs too loud?
Did I leave my life to chance

That if you can hear reacts to every sound
But no two people move the same.

Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam

I'm sayin' son you'll see me searchin', sizzlin' down that broad hiway
Dollar signs in both my eyes, I'm seekin' out my prey I'm prayin'
""Jesus, will you send me just another three or four?""

The day the fever got him, and took him far away
Far away from always knowing that the love they shared was true
Far away the fiddler's bowing, the grass forever blue
It was in the dead of winter when her man first caught the chill
And he said he heard the angels singing 'Cabin on the Hill'
Through the springtime he was groaning 'The good times are past and gone'
By the summer she was moaning 'Old lover please come home'
[Chorus:]
Now she stands out in the midnight in the moonlight all aglow
She prays to Carter Stanley 'Won't you please tell Bill Monroe
Rather be in some dark hollow or some dark deep shady grove
Than to be a bluegrass widow'
Spoken word break:
I started listening to bluegrass music in Bryan Duckworth's rust red 1970 Ford Maverick. 
Had an eight track tape deck and an eight track tape of Bill Monroe's Greatest Hits. 
We used to skip second period chemistry and go over to the Shamrock station across the street from the high school and get a case of Texas Pride beer. 
Charge it on my dad's credit card and get 'em to write it up as oil so dad never knew the difference. 
Then we'd ride around and drink Texas Pride, listen to Bill Monroe. 
Soon we got to be bluegrass experts. 
And we'd stop in another Shamrock station and get another Texas Pride case, 
Drink that and listen to the Stanley Brothers and then we'd go get a tape of Jim and Jesse and it was on to the Kentucky Colonels and Mack Wiseman and the New Grass Revival, Peter Rowan, and finally I got the brilliant idea one day to take all the greatest bluegrass song titles in the world and string 'em together to make this song right here,
The Bluegrass Widow. Quite possibly the worst bluegrass song ever written. 
I did this in tribute to the Front Porch Boys, which was a bluegrass band I was in in College Station, Texas. 
We were a little four piece band, we played weddings and parties and out on the porch and beer joints and one weekend on a handful of cheap amphetamines, we decided to go to Crockett, Texas. 
We entered the International Bluegrass Band Competition and took second place. 
We could play faster than anybody in the competition. 
The other two bands took first and third, respectively. 
I met some friends and went off into the night separated from the Front Porch Boys and met back up with them in the cold, gray light of dawn, as the bluegrass songs say. 
They were standing underneath a giant pine tree there in Crockett singing the rudest, most grotesque, nastiest bluegrass songs you've ever heard in your life. 
I'm talking about the kind of song where not only is the character in the song dead by the end of the song, but he's been dismembered as well. 
And the Front Porch Boys stopped and looked up at me just long enough to say, 'We're taking bluegrass music where it's never been before. 
And we're not taking you with us ''cause you don't have that high and lonesome sound that bluegrass music requires.' Well, I'm not one to fight failure. 
I packed up my stuff and left. 
The Front Porch Boys broke up three days later when they realized I owned the PA system.
'Will you miss me when I'm gone?' were his final words to her
'Darlin' think of what you've done,' then replied his Knoxville girl
And the leaves had started turning when his mind began to fail
Then he broke down in a breakdown, now she wears a long black veil.
And she stands out in the midnight in the moonlight all aglow
She prays to Carter Stanley 'Won't you please tell Bill Monroe

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","I left Houston, Texas on a Gulf Coast Hurricane
I was blown down by tornadoes, washed up by the rain
Well my pappy wasn't happy with me, he told me to go
So I stole my daddy's Cadillac, and I headed down the road
I had a grin from ear to ear with each and every mile
I'm headed for the border man, I'm goin' down in style.
Well I hit Corpus Christi, and the wind was at my back
I drove them women crazy in my daddy's Cadillac
I'd cruse them down the boulevard, treated them like queens
I took them all the places that they wanted to been seen
And when I had to leave them, I'd tell them with a smile
I'm headed for the border, man I'm goin' down in style
Well, you've got to take your chances if they ever come along
Close your eyes and listen to that great big engine wind
And it down really matter, whether you are right or wrong
Cause when you cross the border yeah you leave this world behind
I stomped down on the pedal, I set the cruise control
Five hundred raging horses blew on by the state patrol
Yeah, there sirens were screaming, Lord the lights were flashing red
A dozen more were waiting at the road block up ahead
I scattered them like chickens, I heard one of them cry 
""He's headin' for the border man, he's goin' down in style.""
Yeah when you cross the border you ain't ever coming back
And there ain't no redemption when the cops are on your tail
The closest thing to heaven, is the great big Cadillac
The city lights of Houston, or the fiery gates of hell
They nabbed me on the hill that overlooks the Rio Grande
I'm feeling just like Moses looking at the promise land
They hauled me back to Houston, they threw me into jail

And I know the wheels beneath us will roll.
And time surely steals this moment we hold.
But tonight is the night that dreams are made of.

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","I gave up the fast lane for a blacktop county road.
Just burned out on all that talk about the mother lode
I traded for a songbird and a bigger piece of sky.
When I miss the good old days I can't imagine why.

Still I get restless and drive into town
I cruise once down Main street and turn back around.
It's crazy but God knows I don't act my age
Like an old desperado who paints the town beige.
Down along the river and past the swimming hole
You can find your piece of mind with just a fishin' pole.

And you can walk the river for miles and miles on end
And never stop believin' in that dream around the bend.
Still I get restless and drive into town
I cruise once down Main street and turn back around.
It's crazy but God knows I don't act my age
Like and old desperado who paints the town beige.

Deep down in the winter time slows to a crawl.
There's really nothin' much to do until the first spring thaw.
It's then I get to thinkin' I must have gone insane.
Old memories roll through my mind like a long slow railroad train.

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","I crossed the desert on a dining car
In the spring of ninety-one
I met some people drinking at the bar
They were laughing having fun
I told 'em that I hadn't heard the joke
That was so hilarious
They said that I was just a dumb cowpoke
I didn't want to make a fuss
So I shot 'em down
One by one
Then I left 'em 'long the rails
I use my gun
Whenever kindness fails
The moon was in the sign of Scorpio
The sun was at my back
I didn't know how far the train would go
Until the law would find my track
I saw the brakeman and the engineer
Drinking wine and eating brie
I asked 'em who would brake and who would steer
They started pointing back at me
So I shot 'em down
One by one
Then I left 'em 'long the rails
I use my gun
Whenever kindness fails
I only have a moment to explain
Just a chance to let you know
When it's time for you to board the train
There are two ways you can go
You can ride the wheels into the sun
Feel the wind upon your face
Or you can laugh into a loaded gun
and you'll likely lose your place
So I shot 'em down
One by one
Then I left 'em 'long the rails

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Oh when I was a little boy
Only one or two
The first thing I did enjoy
Was a plate of Barbeque

[Chorus]
Barbeque sliced beef and bread
Ribs and sausage and a cold Big Red
Barbeque makes old ones feel young
Barbeque makes everybody someone
If you're feelin' puny and you don't know what to do
Treat yourself to some meat eat some barbeque

Now there was a girl I knew
She treated me so mean
I offered her my Barbeque
She licked my platter clean

Or any Swiss fondue
Baby if you want to rock me

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","It's a long stretch of highway
At midnight in New Mexico
It's a small colored light
That shines from your car radio
It's the old motel owner
Who sleeps on a cot
And gives you the very last cup from his pot

It's a lonely feeling, it's what you've got
It's a lonely feeling, like it or not

It's the crack in the sidewalk
Right next to a pay telephone
It's someone's recorder 
When you're hoping someone is home
It's an hour to kill
To do what you please
But nobody's up for shooting the breeze

It's a lonely feeling, it's like a disease
It's a lonely feeling, you pray that it leaves

It's three men from Chile
Who are tired and they want to go home
They've run out of money
And they're stuck up in east Oregon
So you give â??em the small bit of change in your hand
You try to speak Spanish but they don't understand

It's a lonely feeling, it gets to a man
It's a lonely feeling, that runs through the land 

It's your best friend from high school
Who sees you and wishes you well
You try to breakthrough 
But you run out of stories to tell
So you bid him goodbye and you step into space
There are so many questions that you cannot face

It's a lonely feeling, taking his place
It's a lonely feeling, you just can't erase

It's statue of Jesus your grandmother had when she died
All cracked and all yellow
And you know you should throw it aside
But you're growing religious, the older you get
You haven't been saved
But it could happen yet

It's a lonely feeling, full of regret
It's a lonely feeling, won't let you forget

It's a bus stop, a street cop, an old dog, the new kid, a bum
It's fright and rejected
Neglected, and blind, deaf and dumb
But you look in the mirror
And you're still hanging in
It's there to remind you how lucky you've been

It's a lonely feeling, now and again
It's only a feeling that comes now and then",Lonely Feelin'
"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","The lonesome oak tree held its fire into November
He watched the last brown leaf
Hit the ground and blow a  way
An evening gunshot lets him know the hunt is  over
A familiar cold moves in
Some where between snow and  rain

Just last spring you know his heart was burning
Before his Lynnville love hit the road to chase her dream
Now he thinks of her each night and in the morning
He laces his coffee cup with whiskey instead of cream

[Chorus]
Her story is she's changed her mind
She  just can't help herself
She wrote  please don't meet me at the Lynnville train
Cause I'm coming in with someone else
He's a quiet man, the neighbors say
But his pain won't go a way
So for  better or worse he's going down
To meet the Lynnville train

He blew a tire on the road to the station
He jacked it up and thought out loud, 
""She never should have let me down.""
Just six months ago she vowed she was leaving
Now she's coming home with a stranger
To settle down in Lynnville town

[Chorus]

Steel wheels scream, the whistle blows,
His heart is breaking
She steps onto the platform, her new love by her side
He reaches in his coat, his had is shaking
The time has finally come, this really is goodbye

His story is he's changed his mind, 
He just can't help himself
So he's getting on board the Lynnville train

Through the wall of rain
In the shadow of the mountains
On the barren plains
To my angel in the village
Where a lamplight glows
If the dogs there don't betray me
No one will know

In the city of the soldier, in the time of war
There I met my Angelina, I was 24
We made arrangements soon thereafter
Wedding plans were drawn
Just beyond the sound of laughter
Cannons thundered on
When I enlisted in the Army, Angelina cried
I whispered to her, ""Don't you worry
God is on our side.""

His plan was soon revealed
He guided me to fame and glory
On the battlefield

Oh ooh the coyote cries

We fought them through the emerald valley
To the sacred hill
In the end we were defeated, I was left for dead

I took to hiding in the mountains, through the wintertime
In the spring I rode to safety across the borderline
I sent word to Angelina, soon I will return
With the full moon in the window, let your lamplight burn

From the bluff above her village
My hope has turned to fright
Only darkness in the windows
Not a single light
I cursed my God and shook my angry
Fists at Him above
Twice forsaken, once in war

Stricken by my loss
I vowed to leave my lifeless body

I had a little place just up the block
Had me a French girlfriend I loved the way she talked

Findin' things to do that we could do for free
When we split up she said you don't do enough for me

I had robbed myself of all my precious time

Had my first gig here in the neighborhood

Hocked my old shotgun bought a used P.A.
We got a quart of rum drank it all that day
When the big gig come we were just to drunk to play

One's in Hollywood one's a millionaire
Some are gone for good some still livin' here

Some out in the pup tents

Back in a canyon where you cain't feel no breeze

Where the cactus flowers grow
I was wishin' that the world would stop
When you said we'd better go

We took a rowboat 'cross the Rio Grande
Captain Pablo was our guide
For two dollars in a weathered hand
He rowed us to the other side

And we were dreamin' like the end was not in sight
And we dreamed all afternoon
We asked the world to wait so we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon

We stepped out onto the golden sand

Rented donkeys from an old blind man
Saddled up and rode to town

Tied our donkeys to an ironwood tree
By the street where the children play
We walked in the first place we could see
Servin' cold beer in the shade

We were drinkin' like the end was not in sight
And we drank all afternoon

Was running from the DEA
He left a home, a wife, a family
When he made his getaway

We followed him on down a street of dust
To his one room run-down shack
He blew a smoke ring and he smiled at us
I ain't never goin' back

We were flyin' like the end was not in sight
And we soared all afternoon

Who played an old gut string guitar

And he sang like Marty Robbins could
Played like no one I've known

It was ours to take back home

He cuts and trims the grass for me he makes the flowers bloom
He says that he comes from a place not far from Guanajuato
That's two days on a bus from here, a lifetime from this room.

I fix his meals and talk to him in my old broken spanish
He points at things and tells me names of things I can't recall
Sometimes I just can't but help but wonder who this man is
And if when he is gone will he'll remember me at all

I watch him close he works just like a piston in an engine
He only stops to take a drink and smoke a cigarette
When the day is ended, I look outside my window
There on the horizon, Mariano's silhouette

He sits upon a stone in a south-easterly direction
I know my charts I know that he is thinking of his home
I've never been the sort to say I'm in to intuition
But I swear I see the faces of the ones he calls his own

Their skin is brown as potters clay, their eyes void of expression
Their hair is black as widow's dreams, their dreams are all but gone
They're ancient as a vision of a sacrificial virgin
Innocent as crying from a baby being born

They hover around a dying flame and pray for his protection
Their prayers are all but answered by his letters in the mail
He sends them colored figures that he cuts from strips of paper
And all his weekly wages, saving nothing for himself

It's been a while since I have seen the face of Mariano
The border guards they came one day and took him far away
I hope that he is safe down there at home in Guanajuato

They've got guitars and trumpets and sweet senoritas who won't want to let you go

Inside Amanda's we was a dancin' with all of Amanda's gals
I won some silver at seven card stud so I was out doin' my pals
But the whiskey and mescal, peso cigars drove me outside for some air
Somebody whispered ""Your life or your money"", I reached but my gun wasn't there

I woke up face down in Amanda's back alley aware of the fool I had been
Rushed to my pony, grabbed my Winchester and entered Amanda's again
Where I saw my partners twirling my pistols and throwing my money around
Blinded by anger, I jacked the lever and one of them fell to the ground
Amanda's got silent like night in the desert, my friends stared in pure disbelief

Amanda was kneeling beside the dead cowboy plainly expressing her grief
And as I bowed my head a trembled shot through me my six-gun was still at my side
I felt my pockets, there was my money, I fell to my knees and I cried
A nightmare of mescal is all that it was for no one had robbed me at all
I wish I was dreaming the sound of the gallows they're testing just outside

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Flatter than a tabletop
Makes you wonder why they stopped here
Wagon must have lost a wheel
Or they lacked ambition one

On the great migration west
Separated from the rest
Though they might have tried their best
They never caught the sun

So they sunk some roots down in the dirt
To keep from blowin' off the earth
Built a town around here

And when the dust had all but cleared
They called it Levelland
The pride of man in Levelland

Granddad grew the dry land wheat
Stood on his own two feet
His mind got incomplete
And they put in the home

Daddy's cotton grows so high
Sucks the water table dry
But rolling sprinklers circle round
Bleedin' it to the bone

And I won't be here when it comes a day
It all dries up and blows away
I'd hang around just to see

But they never had much
Use for me in Levelland
They don't understand me
Out in Levelland

And I watch those jet trails
Carving up that big blue sky
Coast to coasters watch 'em go

And I never would blame 'em one damn bit
If they never looked down on this
Not much here they'd wanna know

Just Levelland
Far as you can point your hand
Nothin' but Levelland

Mama used to roll her hair
Back before the central air
We'd sit outside
And watch the stars at night

She'd tell me to make a wish
I'd wish we both could fly
Don't think she's seen the sky
Since we got the satellite dish

And I can hear the marching band
Doin' the best they can, they're playing
""Smoke on the Water"", ""Joy to the World""

I've paid off all my debts
Got some change left over yet
And I'm gettin' on a whisper jet

I'm gonna fly as far as I can get from
Levelland, doin' the best I can
Out in Levelland, imagine that

Randy, his brother Bob and my old G-M-C
We had some moonshine whiskey
And some of Bob's homegrown 
We were so messed up we didn't know 
If we were drunk or stoned
Randy was a sad-sack, tall kinda frail
Bob was a raving maniac, crazy in the head
They been kicked out of high school several years ago
For pushin' over port-a-cans at the 4-H rodeo
Since then they've done their little dance 
Right outside the law
Popped twice in Oklahoma, once in Arkansas
And I don't know what possessed me 
To want to tag along
Cause I was raised a Christian
And I knew right from wrong

Randy's sweetheart's paw
Sold them at the livestock sale
Outside of Wichita

We got $900 and never did suspect
The world of hurt we'd be in once 
We cashed that check
Next day we heard the story
On the local radio
Made our plans that very night 
To go to Mexico
I swear we would have made it
If it wasn't for that shine
I got sick about the time we crossed 
That Kansas line

Came screeching to a halt

It was all my fault

There were men and dogs 
And helicopter buzzin' all around
They had the brothers on the
Pickup hood and me down on the ground
Bob flew all to pieces but randy he
Held tight when a black man in a
Suit and tie stepped out into the light
He told his men to turn us loose
They put down their guns
He said these are just some 
Sorry kids, they ain't the ones

There were mean times they were rough

We were thinkin' of tyin' the know

Make up have a kid
Break up and we did
But only just for awhile

Then came lo mein and going insane
At the Chinese cafe way downtown
I was steamed I was fried but you stood by my life
When I had my nervous breakdown

There were noodles galore
All over the floor
And hot mustard sauce everywhere
But I held your hand 'til you calmed down again
And picked out the rice in your hair

After that we agreed
When in fact what we need
Is to pack up and take the first plane
Take a bus take a bike
Take care take a hike
Take out but leave the lo mein

Where cool spring mountain waters 
Meet the warm Pacific sun

Burn away like mornin' fog and vanish in the air

In Scottsdale Arizona
It was in the summertime it must have been '02
We got there way too early and we sat around for hours
Loaded in when the man came down
And the smushball game was through

You can fry an egg out there on the city sidewalk
You can fry your bacon and and and and
I understand why lizards live in sunny Arizona
Why people do and call it home I'll never understand

It's hotter than a furnace fan out in Arizona
110 ain't nothing when you live out there you see
Stars come out you scream and shout ""Hey it's good to know you""
If you're going there and you don't mind say hello for me

Uncle Joe he lives out there in Phoenix Arizona
He wears a cap that spells it out ""I'm Uncle Joe""
His kid is in the restaurant biz
So he bought us fourteen boxes
Of chicken strips and ranch style dip
And wings from buffalo

It's hotter than a furnace fan out in Arizona
110 ain't nothing when you live out there you see
Stars come out you scream and shout ""Hey it's good to know you""
If your going there and you don't mind say hello for me

The room was small but the crowd turned out in Scottsdale Arizona
They listened to the stuff we played
And sometimes sang along
We finished up but they wanted more
So we kept right on playing
We played and stayed in the desert shade
'Til we played up every song

Hide it in a mason jar

At the hands of hapless john
With your baby waitin' for ya'
You were.... before the dawn
You know your shakin hands wil
When your mouth is goin dry
When that law man back in datin
Wouldn't look you in the eye

He was nothing but a drifter
And he came to play the part
Disquised as luke the drifter
Talk about a cheatin heart

when he rode into your town
Same old indian giver
Struck a match and burned. .. down

Looking down from up above
Needing something to believe in
One lonely truth and love

How can I tell my father?

Didn't ever mean to be

Has set the stage

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Then there was the time
I saw the great Hank Williams singing on the stage in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania and he was all dressed up in drag
From his rose red lips to his rhinestone hips he belted
Out song after song as he drank from a brown paper bag
And the songs he sang of love and pain,
So pure perfect reflections of human imperfections,
It damn near choked me up
But the rest of the show, was kind of slow
And then someone woke me up

Later on the Astros were silently beating the living crap
Out of Cincinnati on the TV above
And a little to the left of the great Hank Williams' head
As a busty suicide blonde waitress poured him a double shot of 'whatever you got'
And laughingly said ""I thought you were dead""
The pool balls cracked as he tilted his head back
And told her how he had been a big star but now country music was full of freaks
He sat there, in the TV glare
Mascara streaked his cheeks

When I was only sixteen years old I went from Houston to Abilene
With a spunky stunningly handsome woman in a Volkswagen Bug
She was grown with some kids all her own,
A commitment-free divorcee, and I was a man in love
We had only one 8-track tape but it was of the late great
Hank Williams and we sang in two-part harmony
""Hey good lookin', how's about cookin'
Something up with me""

Back at the bar they were calling last call
So I gave the barmaid a credit card to pay up my tab
The TV was turned off and the stage was dark
And the great Hank Williams was gone so I asked her to call me a cab
She said if you like I can give you a ride,
So there we were out the door and into the city of brotherly love
Into the night, out of sight
In a VW Bug

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","One night as I lay on my pillow
Moon shining bright as the dawn
I saw a man come-a-walkin'
He had a long chain on

I heard his chain a clankin'
It made a mournful sound
Welded around his body
Dragging along on the ground

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

He came up to my window
He looked at me and he said
""I am so tired and hungry
Give me a bite of your bread""

He did not look like a robber
He didn't look like a thief
His face was all covered in sadness
He had a voice full of sorrow and grief

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

I went into my kitchen
Got him a bowl full of meat
A drink and a pan of cold biscuits
That's all I had for him to eat

And though he was tired and hungry
A bright light came over his face
He bowed his head on his bosom
He made a beautiful grace

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

(Long chain, long chain, long chain)
(He had a long chain on)
(Long chain, long chain, long chain)
(He had a long chain on)

I fetched my chisel and hammer
Offered to set him free
He shook his head and said sadly
Guess we had best let it be

When he had finished his supper
He thanked me again and again
And though it's been years since I saw him
I still hear the rattle of his chain

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on",Long Chain
"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","One day after twenty-five years
Head of service at the local Sears
Helen Walker put her pencil down and walked away
And all they found was a little note
'Adios' was all she wrote
But as she left, someone heard her say
""Gonna buy me a ticket to the end of the line
Wanna feel the air, breathe the countryside
As long as those wheels keep rollin', I'll be satisfied
Gonna ride, ride, ride""
Saturday night I was down at Joe's
He was moppin' up gettin' ready to close
He sat down and poured me one last brew
And he said to me with a sideways glance
""If I ever get the chance
I'm gonna sell this joint, and this is what I'll do""
""Gonna buy me a ticket to the end of the line
Wanna feel the air, breathe the countryside
As long as those wheels keep rollin', I'll be satisfied
Gonna ride, ride, ride""
I suppose I could stay
In this little town 'til my dying day
But in my heart I know I've gotta go
So I'm standin' at the station waitin' for the train
Don't know when I'll be back again
Mr. Engineer, won't you let your whistle blow
Got me a ticket to the end of the line
Wanna feel the air, breathe the countryside

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","In a year that is not now
From a place unknown
I travel on the mountain roads
Looking for someone

Sewn inside my vest, a letter
Tells me where and when
In my purse a sacred dagger
On my horse I run

Restless girl beside the water
Tending to a fire
Kissed a boy and then another
Suiting up for war

Heard a broken band of gypsies
Singing ancient songs
Gave all my silver to a beggar
Still he wanted more

Oh the town of stone and timber
Celebration reigned
No one there seems to remember
Why they carry on

Crowded 'round a man of marble
Speaking foreign tongues
There the stone began to crumble
And the crowd did moan

In the unforgiving morning
Caravans of shame
Turn south to the dry land highway
I turn to the sea

Like a snake so quick and deadly
Sleepless, coiled and cool
The one I seek is making ready
Waiting patiently

Pity not the weary traveler
He lives in his mind
He is friend of wind and weather
And from fire is born

Pity then the cool betrayer
Waiting patiently
No precaution made will save him
From the traveling storm

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Drove from Albuquerque to Ft. Smith, Arkansas
Then all the way to New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras
You should have seen... the craziness down there
What I really mean... I wish you were here

And we were down on Beale Street, Memphis, Tennessee
With the blues, the booze, the bar-be-Q's, our name on the marquee
And you should have seen... the crowd we drew in there
What I really mean... I wish you were here

I'm sending you this postcard
To tell you that I'm fine
And let you know wherever I go
You never leave my mind

Broke down in Kentucky; in Richmond there was snow
We saw our friends in Charlotte; we played on the radio
And you should have seen... us singin' on the air
What I really mean... I wish you were here

I'm sending you this postcard
To tell you that I'm fine
And let you know wherever I go
You never leave my mind

Tonight we're in the city, and it's like Disneyland
But I'm sick and tired and I can't wait to get back home again
And I have this dream... you'll be waitin' there

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","I'm looking for somebody who might have come this-a-way
Could have been an hour ago, or maybe yesterday
She's pretty as a flower and shining as a star
I never thought she'd ever come so far

I'm tryin' to find a woman, friendly as can be
She's never met a stranger, I'm sure you would agree
And if you got to talkin', she probably made you laugh
Here she is in this photograph

We were the wild ones
The young guns
Restless as the wind
We were the wild ones
Now I run
And when I'm done
The wild ones will run again

I went on the road alone and left her there behind
I was thinkin' of myself, she said she didn't mind
But love is like a songbird and every song she sings
You'll hear a sweet reminder of her wings

We were the wild ones
The young guns
Restless as the wind
We were the wild ones
Now I run
And when I'm done
The wild ones will run again

Maybe she's across the street or half a world away
I've got to find her if only just to say...

We were the wild ones

Restless as the wind
We were the wild ones
Now I run
And when I'm done
The wild ones will run again

We're the wild ones

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Standin' down on Main Street 
Across from Mr, Blues
In my faded leather jacket 
And my weathered Brogan shoes
A chill north wind was blowin'
But the spring was comin' on 
As I wondered to myself
Just how long I had been gone 

So I strolled across old Main Street
Walked down a flight of stairs 
Stepped into the hall 
And saw all my friends were there 
A neon sign was flashin' ""Welcome come on in""
It feels so good feelin' good again

Instrumental

My favorite band was playin' 
An Otis Redding song
When they sang the chorus 
Everybody sang along
Dan and Margarita 
were swayin' side by side 
I heard they were divorcin' 
But I guess they let it slide
And I wished I had some money with 
which to buy a round

I wished I'd cashed my paycheck 
Before I came to town
But I reached into my pocket 
Found three twenties and a ten
It feels so good feelin' good again

There was old man Perkins
Sittin' on his stool
Watchin' Butch and Jimmy John
Talkin' loud and playin' pool
The boys from Silver City
Were standin' by the fire
Singin' like they thought
they were the Tabernacle choir
And I wanted you to see them all
I wished that you were there
I looked across the room
and saw you standin' on the stair
And when I caught your eye
I saw you break into a grin

Where the cactus flowers grow
I was wishing that the world would stop
When you said we'd better go

We took a rowboat across the Rio Grande
Captain Pablo was our giude
For two dollars and a weathered hand
He rowed us to the other side

And we were dreamin like
The end was not in site
And we dreamed all afternoon
We asked the world to wait

So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon
We stepped out on to the golden sand
The sun was high and burning down

Rented donkeys from an old blind man
Saddled up and rode to town
Tied the donkeys to an iron wood tree
On the street where children played

We went in the first place we could see
Servin cold beer in the shade
And we were drinkin like
The end was not in site

And we drank all afternoon
We asked the world to wait
So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon

Met a cowboy who said that he
Was running from the DEA
He left his home and wife and family
When he made his getaway

We followed him on down a street of dust
To his one room run down shack
He blew a smoke ring and he smiled at us
I ain't never goin back

And we were flyin like
The end was not in site
And we soared that afternoon
We asked the world to wait

So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon
He said there is one last place that you should go
He took us to the towns best bar

He know a crusty (?) caballero
Who played an old gut string guitar
And he sang like Marty Robbins could
Played like no one I have known

For a while we knoew that life was good
And it was ours to take back home
And we were singin like

When they asked me if I'd like to stay

And I already knew
For a while
That you’d be going
Soon as the summer began
But it didn’t set in
Until you were on that plane
It felt like I was losing
One of my very best friends
Sometimes we gotta leave
We gotta find the things
That we’re seeking
All the things we’re needin’
The things that you leave behind
Often will cross you mind
But you won’t forget them
You won’t ever forget them
‘Cause friends like those
Never really go
They never really say goodbye
And you and me are always gonna be
Best friends until we die
Until we die

They got lives with women
Women I’ve never met
Their kids probably wouldn’t
Know me from chocolate pudding
But I guess it’s just the same
I don’t think it changes a thing
Friends like those
Never really go
They never really say goodbye
And you and me
Are always gonna be
Best friends
Even after we die
After we die and turn to dust
And there ain’t no one around that remembers us
After we die and our bodies grow cold
And they ain’t no one who knows a thing
About the songs we wrote
The words you spoke
Or that joke you told me
When it’s all said and done
I bet we had a lot of fun

Robert Ellis,"Nobody talks too loud 
In my hometown
Nobody stands too tall
For fear of getting knocked down
Just follow straight lines
And teach your children how
Well you just do your job
And conceal your doubts

And the flames of hell they seem so high 
When I can barely see over the pue
I was just a boy when they told me that lie
But lord it felt so true

With one big voice
All the children sing
The grown folks led
And they praised his name
Like an army camp marching off to fight
Like a mindless chant
Will make you right

That's a hell of a thing to do to a kid
Just to teach him right from wrong
You can burn in hell the rest of your days
Or you can choose to sing along

Sing along

Well you can speculate about the way things end
Or you can sit and wait
For the resurrection
But a child believes in whatever they're told
A pillar of flames 
The street of gold

And the flames of hell they seem so high
When I can barely see over the pue
I was just a boy when they told me that lie
But lord it felt so true

Robert Ellis,"I won't take much of your time
I just need someone to talk to that's kind
You know all my darker shades
You know everything I keep hidden away

And whenever it seems as if nothing is going my way
You will call and it seems like you always know just what to say
And whenever it seems as if something's gone terribly wrong
There is some kind of power in the sound of your voice and it keeps me strong

You are steady as the rising sun
But, like the moon, you keep on shining long after the day is done
It seems impossible to think somehow
That there is a love that won't ever let me down
And honey, I hope your love won't let me down

Life can drag you through the dirt
And a man can't always tell you exactly where it hurts
But you've touched my un-healing heart
By making known your very own until I can't tell us apart

And if a storm or a gale ever capsize the sails, let these words resound
You're the finest of sailing companions a sailor has ever found
When I lose or I win, when the audience thins, you have stuck around
Oh, I may die in the fight but with you at my side that won't get me down

You are steady as the rising sun
But, like the moon, you keep on shining long after the day is done

Robert Ellis,"I met my old lover on the street last May
She seems so glad to see me
I just smiled and we talked about some old times
And then drank ourselves some beers
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years

I'm not the kind of man
Who tells social lies
I seemed to lead on a familiar wage
And I'm no fool of love songs
That whisper in my ear
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years

Four in the morning'
I laugh away
I never worry, well, why should I?
'Cause it's all gonna fade

So I sit by my window and I watch the cars
I fear I might do some damage one day
But I would not be convicted by the jury of my peers

Robert Ellis,"She'll find someone to talk to
When she's feeling all alone
She'll find someone to cook for
And to care for when I'm gone
She'll find someone to go with her
To all the hokey parks
She'll fin d someone to dance with her
When the jukebox plays our song

Though I can't be with her
She's always on my mind
But there's many things I can't do from
'Carolina
Soon she'll start wondering what it is that I provide
Why the heal of husband can't by his woman's side
It's the choice I make
It's the price I pay
Just to hang out in a cheap bar
And to spend ten hours in a car
And to sing a couple of songs
But they don't let us play too long
For they shut us down and kick us out
And move to some other town
Well it ain't so glamorous as it sounds
And I need her now

She'll find someone to help her
With all the handy work
When she wants to see a movie
He will take her to the show
And maybe she will ask him
What he thinks of me and her
Will he probably' in control and insecure
When I ain't there to help with all the duties of a man
Well,she'll probably wondering what I'm doing and where I am

Maybe she'll imagine me alone with someone else
And maybe she'll think she'll find someone herself
And it's so hard to let
In this bed I made
Ina back of a dirty crapped car
I'm driving to some hipster bar
With people that I don' want to see
But I appreciate the company
On an end string of one night stands
With okay girls and shitty bands
And the good one comes now but I want to be back home again
Home again,
I hope she'll be there when I come back home again
Home again
I hope she'll be there when I come back home again

She'll find someone to tell her
That she looks good in a dress
That moment that I can send her from a 'express
And in the shoes I bought her
She will walk by other man
And every one will stare and hope
That she walks by again
I know that she loves me and I know her love is true
But when she needs some company
What else she could do?
She'll have some tough decisions
That may try in her heart
But everything seems different from a million miles apart

I know just how to cope
How to keep my worried trapped

I'll go out to the nearest bar
I'll shoot some and play some cards
Put the jukebox on the 32
The song that makes me think of you
I'll get so drunk that I'll can't stand
And think of you with another man
And cloud the pieces of my mind
That remind me what I left behind",Tour Song
Robert Ellis,"I am not a failure, I played the hand that I was dealt
But every now and then I do pretend that I am someone else
It takes no imagination, just a flick of the remote
Then I am on vacation in a life someone else wrote

Maybe I'm a millionaire, I travel over the world
I'm handsome and respected, I get all those pretty girls
So calm and mysterious, fighting for the greater good
People love and adore me from New York to Hollywood

Well, this may not be the healthiest, I know
But I'm happiest when I exist through my favorite TV shows

I'm a gun fighter, I'm a bull rider
I'm the captain of some pirate ship at sea
For a couple hours I got super powers
Oh my God, I love watching my TV, oh yeah
Oh my God, I love watching my TV

Oh, Betty Draper, I wish my wife was less like you
It gets so hard to take her, she complains the whole day through
And when I get home from working I just hate to hear her speak
But we do spend time together at least three nights a week

We'll watch the one about the family with that great big ole house
Or the one with the detectives who always find the bad guys out
Or the one about the lawyers who make sure that the right guy wins
Or the couple that is still in love and needs never to pretend

Well, no matter what is going on at home
I can always get a smile or two when my favorite show comes on

I'm a gun fighter, I'm a bull rider
I'm the captain of some pirate ship at sea
For a couple hours I got super powers
Oh my God, I love watching my TV, oh yeah
Oh my God, I love watching my TV

God bless you, Walt Disney, you were a father to me
I used to fall asleep with the TV on at night
Through my roughest days you put a smile on my young face
You kept me company when no one else had time

I'm a gun fighter, I'm a bull rider
I'm the captain of some pirate ship at sea
For a couple hours I got super powers

Robert Ellis Orrall,"You can get lucky baby you can get high. 
Sometimes its better just to try and get by. 
You understand the way I'm feeling inside. 
You can't always fight it. 
 
You're the main attraction but your heads in a swirl. 
You look for action in your everyday world. 
Some satisfaction; you're not just another girl. 
You can't always find it. 
 
You know where I'm goin' tonight. 
You can find me where it feels alright. 
 
I'm not about to watch you walk away. 
I thought Id walk away from you someday. 

Baby, please let go. 
You make it harder this way. 
I didn't want to do it but I couldn't say no. 
 
Oh Baby, please don't go. 
Unless you mean it this time. 
Id really want to stop you but I couldn't say no. 
I couldn't say no...
 
I get the feeling you're not willing to try. 
Its so revealing in the way you satisfy. 
And now I'm kneeling here and asking you why 
You're making me fight it. 
 
There's another question you've forgotten to ask.

Robert Ellis Orrall,"I had the impression our love was ""a-ok""
When I looked in her eyes I thought I had it made
We were cruisin' right along down a wide open road
But what lurks around the corner I guess you never know
It was love beyond a shadow of a doubt
That's when the lights went out

Like steppin' off a corner on a busy street
Like a pretty girl can knock you off your feet
Like a change in the weather or the drop of a hat
Boom! It was over just like that

Like a touchdown pass in overtime
Like a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky
Like a knockout punch sends a man to the mat
Boom! It was over just like that

Maybe I didn't know what I thought I knew
Now was it what I did or what I didn't do
You know I thought she thought I was a helluva guy
Ain't it funny how things change in the blink of an eye
She smiled a smile so sweet and calm
That's when she dropped the bomb

Like steppin' off a corner on a busy street
Like a pretty girl can knock you off your feet
Like a change in the weather or the drop of a hat

Would rather die
Than be apart

For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin
Robert Farnon,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know
Robert Farnon,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Robert Farnon,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Robert Farnon,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Robert Farnon,"Promises are easily made,
Sometimes they're not sincere,
But I'm making this one from the heart,
And I'll keep it too, my dear 

I'll make up for everything the world has done to you,
I'll make every little dream you ever dreamed come true.
I won't ever give you cause to shed another tear 
Just when things aren't going right, you'll find me near.

We'll share all the rainy days that fate may have in store,
Laugh a lot, and darling what is more
You will find the peace of mind that happiness can bring,
For I'll make up for ev'ry thing.",I'll Make Up for Everything
Robert Forster,"I took her out of her world and put her into mine
I took away what she knew, had treasured over time

Let's sail away, baby
I can't explain what I see
Let's sail away, baby
Please try and follow me

I took her out of her home, a cabin near the woods
And took her to this desert with threatening
Neighborhoods

Well I believe, baby
I thought it was better for us
Yes I believe, baby
There was gold in that dust
 
And now I see, baby
I put distance into your own life
Let's sail away, baby
Let's sail into this life

She drove a golf white diesel, she drove me through the
Streets
She took me into her world of parks and wooden seats

We'll hold and save all of what came
We won't let it run away
If it rains

If it rains, different this time
We won't break the chain or make our own rain
We'll just take what came
If it rains

If it rains, we'll worship again
We've seen what came without the rain
We'll be thankful that it came

Robert Glasper,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Two lovers dance face to face with undulating grace
They gently sway then slip away to some secluded place

You gotta be with someone you like
If you think we've got what it takes to go the distance
I can tell you're now oh you aha
Ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah

You're the star that will always shine
Forever you'll be with me

Uh, it go like
You ever see the inner depths of a man's soul?
Or ninja turtles pouring out of manholes
This is balance
Between a comic and a conscious, that's the challenge
Between the solitary and the conference that I examines
That I imagine was a figure
Would be the start of world peace and the transformation of niggas
Like the transubstantiation of liquor
But that's just turnin' them into blood
And we'll be right back where we was
Not a peace-sign, but a fascination with scissors
So I can cut
Myself off from the calculations of empress, empires, and the sinners
For advancement of human suffering
And other things trying to impede my publishing and editorials
That's gon' bring it back to us again
A boomerang might as Halle Barry and Eddie and everybody fuckin' it

You're in my heart, you're in my mind
You're the star that will always shine
Forever you'll be with me

Shotgun
Even though independent cars ain't got one
I got some and more to spare
No more despair
My motor-ware don't match my motivate to mate
Also I drive to stay alive and ride this over there
My momma so mad, so no alcohol in here
I'm Aries Spears on my Jay-Z shit
Affion on the Drake skit
Now how many more can I make with just one voice
They might call it fake shit
This some deep shit
It's my me impersonatin' we shit
Vicariously in every rap I speak with
I hope you're speakin' for me, if I'm ever speechless
Cause I'mma be you
Even though you're not here to be with
I hope I see these gangsters actin' like teachers
Wake up out they sleep, then they dream
And the world so Martin Luther King-less

You're in my heart, you're in my mind
You're the star that will always shine
Forever you'll be with me

And to my hero Heron, Gil Scott
In a discourse with Baldwin
On a jet plane with no fear for fallin'
But wishin' it never lands
Reminiscent of the dream time
Presently en route to the rhymes of the machine time
Magazine times
With coffee more sugar and milk than coffee
Aborted rhymes, rotten beats, and failed hooks
Roads as bumpy as braille books
Fail cools, bad French, and mad push at the door
Gourmet food at the starving soiree
A choice of one easy woman at a time
I'll take three the hard way
Trying to be as abstract as possible
And vulgar, the more shocking the more profitable
A baby fed molten gold
And sat upon a pedestal promote getting called 24 carot souls
How to describe this
Insightful remarks such as the best thing I've ever heard is silence
Some more technically impressive
In a faux Spanish romantic hues of a Marxist dialectic
Please listen to the critics, pointless is the common passerby
Might as well not even exist, not even a bit
In the event of my demise give everything I prize to the poor
And to the oppressors, I leave a war

Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace
I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues",A Mess of Blues
Robert Gordon,"Since my baby left me, never said a word
Was it something I done, something that she heard?
My baby left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me, hey, and never said a word

Now I stand at my window, wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman, hate to say goodbye
You know, she left me, yes, she left me
My baby even left me, hey, and never said a word

Play it blues, boy

Baby, one of these mornings, Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me and baby, your daddy will won't call you
You know she left me, my baby left me
My baby even left me, hey, and never said goodbye

Now I stand at my window, wring my hands and moan
All I know is that the one I love is gone
My baby left me, you know, she left me
My baby even left me, hey, and never said a word
Yes, since my baby left me, hey, and never said a word

But I must go alone
Till the Lord comes and calls
Calls me away, oh yes

And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black
As the sea, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed
Changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow

I can hear the chords resound
Of sounding brass
That seems to say I've found
I've found you, I've found you.

Strange music in my ears
Only now as you spoke, did it start.
Strange music of the sphere
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?
You appear and I hear song sublime
Song that I'm incapable of.
So Dear, let me hold you near
While we treasure every measure,
So that time can never change
The strange, new music of love.

The look you gave in answer to my pleas,
These are the things I love.

Oh, once I thought that life was just a Winter thing,
My heart was cold;
And then you came to me,
And like a breath of Spring,
You turned the silver to gold.

The babbling brook beside our rendezvous,

I see that old, familiar smile,

I stop and say, ""Hello, My friend,""

that I locked up my heart,
and threw away the precious key.

Robert Goulet,"She's a babe
Just a babe
Still cavorting in her crib
Eating breakfast with a bib

With her baby teeth 
And all her baby curls
She's a tot
Just a tot

Good for bouncing on your knee
I am positive that she
Doesn't even know that boys aren't girls
She's a snip

Just a snip
Making dreadful baby noise
Having fun with all her toys
Just a chickadee who needs a mother hen

She's a cub, a papoose
You could never turn her loose
She's too infantile to take her from her pen
Of course, that weekend in Trouville

In spite of all her youthful zeal
She was exceedingly polite
And on the whole a sheer delight
And if it wasn't joy galore

At least not once was she a bore,
That I recall
No, not at all
Ah! She's a child

A silly child
Adolescent to her toes
And good heaven how it shows
Sticky thumbs are all the fingers she has got

She's a child
A clumsy child
She's as swollen as a grape
And she doesn't have a shape

Where her figure ought to be,
It is not!
Just a child
A growing child

That's so backward for her years
If a boy her age appears
I am certain he will never call again!
She's a scamp and a brat

Doesn't know where she is at
Unequipped and undesirable to men
Of course, I must confess
That in that brand new little dress

She looked surprisingly mature
And had a definite allure
It was a shock in fact to me
The most amazing shock to see

The way it clung
On one, so young!
She's a girl,
A little girl!

Getting older, it is true
Which is what they always do
Till that unexpected hour
When they blossom like a flower!
Oh no, oh no 

But...but,
There's sweeter music when she speaks
Isn't there?
Could I be wrong?

Could it be so?
Oh where, oh where
Did Gigi go?
Gigi! Am I a fool without a mind

Or have I merely been too blind to realise?
Oh Gigi! Why you've been growing up before my very eyes
Gigi! You're not at all
That funny, awkward little girl, I knew

Oh no! Over night there's been a breathless change in you
Chorus Verse:
Oh Gigi! While you were trembling on the brink
Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star?

Oh Gigi! Have I been standing up too close 
Or back too far?
When did your sparkle turn to fire?
And your warmth become desire?

Oh what miracle has made you the way you are?
Gigi! 
Gigi! 
Gigi! 

Oh no! I was mad not to have seen the change in you
Oh Gigi!",Gigi

But they don't listen to me
I talk to the stars
But they never hear me

To stop and hear what I say

But suddenly my words
Reach someone else's ears
Touch someone else's heartstrings, too
I tell you my dreams
And while you're listening to me
I suddenly see them come true

I can see us on an April night
Sipping brandy underneath the stars
Reading poems in the candlelight
To the strumming of guitars

I will tell you all the books I've read
And the way I met the King of France
Then I'll send the servants off to bed
And I'll ask you for a dance

A smile brought us together, and I was wond'ring whether
We'd meet again some day
The moon was yellow and the song was sung
That vocal inspiration gave me the inclination 
To give my heart away

Here we are, is our romance to continue?
Will it be my luck to win you?
May I look that far?

My love is mellow and my hopes are strung
Around that Cupid fellow

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You

Trees sigh to me, soon my love I will see

Poinciana, your branches speak to me of love
Pale moon is casting shadows from above

Poinciana, somehow I feel the jungle heat
Within me there grows a rhythmic savage beat

Love is everywhere, its magic perfume fills the air
To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care

Poinciana, though skies may turn from blue to gray
My love will live forever and a day

When the snowflakes cover up the sky
And little faces breathe a happy sigh
Old man winter's here to entertain
It's December time again

That lovers like this season of the year
Those sleigh rides so exciting

Robert Goulet,"All I do is dream of you the whole night thru
With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're every thing, 
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, Winter, Autumn and Spring
And were there more than twenty four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and night time too
All I do the whole day thru, is dream of you

Didn't we?
This time we almost made some sense of it
Didn't we?
This time I had the answer, right here in my hand
Then I touched it and it had turned to sand

This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made it, made it to the moon

Robert Goulet,"Goodbye, No use leading with our chins,
This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.

Where we would weave such wonderful dreams

To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star.

This is my quest, to follow the star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause.

Then my heart will lie peaceful and calm

When I'm laid to my rest.

How can I help to ease their way?

That cools the pavement with a patent leather shine 
He came into my life and made the living fine 
And gave a meaning to this empty world of mine 
He fills my heart 

He fills my heart with very special things 
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings 
He fills my soul with so much love 
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely 
With him along, who could be lonely 
I reach for his hand, it's always there 

How long does it last? 
Can love be measured by the hours in a day? 
I have no answers now, but this much I can say 
I'm going to need him till the stars all burn away 
And he'll be there

Robert Goulet,"Hear my voice
Where you are
Take a train
Steal a car
Hop a freight
Grab a star
Come back to me

Catch a plane
Catch a breeze
On your hands
On your knees
Swim or fly
Darling please
Come back to me

On your mark
Now get set
Hop a mule
Hop a jet
In a towel wringing wet
I don't care
This is where you should be

From the hills to the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the highways to dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world
Only just come back to me

Must I yell 'til I'm blue?
Where are you and will you
Come back to me?
Have you gone to the moon
Or the corner saloon?
In Rome or Rangoon
I'm a wreck
Where in heck can you be?

In a crate
In a trunk

Roaring drunk
In a rolls or a van

Robert Goulet,"The sound of applause is delicious
It's a thrill to have the world at your feet
The praise of the crowd, it's exciting
But I've learned that's not what makes a life complete

There's one thing you can do for the rest of your days
That's worth more than applause
The screaming crowd, the bouquets

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man you're everything to

Fame if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to
Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found him, build your world around him

Make someone happy 
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy, too",Make Someone Happy

Robert Goulet,"When hearts are passing in the night, in the lonely night
Then they must hold each other tight, oh, so very tight
And take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll stay together, so much in love

And in the silence of a mist, of a morning mist
When lips are waiting to be kissed, longing to be kissed
Where is the reason to resist and deny a kiss
That holds a promise of happiness?

Though yesterday still surrounds you with a warm and 
precious memory
Maybe for tomorrow we can build a new dream for you and me

This glow we feel is something rare, something really rare
So come and say you want to share, want to really share
The beauty waiting for us there, calling for us there
That only loving can give the heart

When life is passing in the night, in the rushing night
A man, a woman in the night, in the lonely night
Must take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll be together, so much in love
Together, so much in love

So tell me

You're not afraid to take a chance, really take a chance

To the music of romance, of a new romance

Robert Goulet,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Robert Goulet,"You know the game of love, so the flame never burns you

I know it should be you and so I say

Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

I would be, caught in the undertow

And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Robert Goulet,"Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams,
Funny, but here's that rainy day.
Here's that rainy day they told me about,

After it brought my lover near?
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day,
Funny, that rainy day is here.

Brother, won't you carry me along
This dry dusty road

Children shallying
Playing in the morning sun
Spike-heeled lady
Running through the burying ground

You set my soul on fire
You set me on my own
Broke-down car but the wheels still roll
Down the dry, dry dusty road

Stuck inside a tunnel
Beset with diamond lies
Wings of night enclosing
Like a long, long night without a dawning

Being bent on ruin
I tried to sell my name
All that I got for it
Was one good look at flame

Drive, drive dusty road
Dry dusty road
Oh brother, let me carry you along
This dry dusty road

In that flame I saw a face
I've never seen before
If they ask me why, I know
Just who I done this for

No one else to come to
Not much else I know
Not much else I'm good for
Lay away my lady-o

Robert Hunter,"I heard you singing
What were you singing when the people got right?
Were you singing 'Stand And Deliver'?
Or was it 'Down By The River'?

Were you singing a fine old tune like 'Gone To Glory'?
Laying it down with grace and power
Long about the midnight hour

I heard the people all singing
Like they'd never sung before
All over the country
Who could help but stand beside you?

Hello, hello, is there anybody here?
My knuckles are sore from rapping all day
I said, ""Give me one more chance
I'd do it for you if I had your way, if I had your way""

What do I know? What do I see?
Don't know nothing but the name of the game
It's high-card draw with everything wild
You bet your life like anyone's child
What else would you want to do?

I heard the people all singing
Like they never sung before
Singing in key and strumming
Everything they heard from you
Hello, hello, hello, hello, goodbye

Looking back across the years
Other matters disappear
In the murmur I can hear
Familiar voices loud and clear
Hello, hello, hello, hello, goodbye

I heard you singing
Like one last song in the middle of the night
Were you singing 'In Tongues Of Fire'?
Or was it 'Knots Of Anger'?

Were you singing a fine old tune like
'Love Me, Love Me, Love Me Only'?
Were you caught between the curtains
Thinking this was too uncertain?

Remember the people were singing
Like they never sung before
All over the country
Did you love the way they loved you?

Ain't no knocker on the last big door
Just push on the panel and walk on in
Hello, hello, is there anybody here
But a two-bit high and a busted mirror?
Hello, hello, is anybody here?
My tongue is so sore from rapping all day

Sunshine in the dead on night
I know that can't be right
Could it be? I don't know
But it never done that thing before

So close to my own back door
It got me wondering what to do
And the only thing was to come and tell you
Because I heard you singing, I heard you

Robert Hunter,"The silver fox has shed its tail now
Left it by the frozen water
The leaves were drifting down
Now they are gone, gone, gone

I draw milady's carriage
Ever since her horse retired
I don't think I can pull much longer
I've never been this tired before

Up jump the black chain dancers
Empty hands that grasp for answers
Fasten on to one another, fly
Fly away

Ariel is sweetly singing
Wait you, just one more season
You're not blind, you only hide your
Eyes within your hands, within your hands

Ariel, Ariel

There is no night like this night
Where candles burn through daylight
Minds restrained by golden tethers fade
Fade away

The sun objects with smiling sadness
Roman highways laced in diamonds
Sink like grave Atlantis into
Dreams of other days they fade away

Monuments to crippled madness
Puppets dangle in the treetops
The cold magician carves his voice in stone
Then flies away, then flies away

Ariel sings overhead
Deaf men mouth the words she's said
But they don't hear the songs she's singing now
Oh no, not now

Ariel, Ariel
Ariel, Ariel

As wild and unholy place
As any place I've ever been
You can knock and knock and knock
No one comes to let you in, no one comes

As solid and as fine a floor
As any floor I've walked upon
Broke beneath my footsteps
I've got no place left to stand, not any more

Loves to love and not to chain
Some are lost but some remain
Nothing can replace the light
That once has died turned to night, no one can

If I had the sense to know
Which things count and which are show
I'd hold my fate within my hands
Instead of all these chains and bands
Yes, I would

Robert Hunter,"Up near the border where the cruel white water
Drowns vagabond who sleeps too low
Me and my companion, famous Jack O'Lanterns
Tracked the misty mountain through the snow

Ran across the hidden chord, couldn't learn the changes
Blue Pacific called, I had to go
There was holly on the ivy in the apparition mountains
The warmest bed I found was ten below

Courted lady Greensleeves, she threw me out the window
I landed like a feather in the trees
Took off across New Mexico and landed in the Bayou
But the catfish was too lean, I had to blow

Don't lie for gold, no, no, no
Don't lie for love, turns out cold
If life depends, just get out whole
Don't lie for less, no, no, no, no

Marie, Marie Helena
You're my amour, you're my own heart
Oh, Marie, Marie Helena
Oh Marie, Marie Helena

Left the life of ease and caught the black iron steamer
Across the barren waste to your arcade
I sang, 'Take me to your leader in my strangest country tenor'
The bed I meant to lay was halfway made

Leftover pieces aren't exactly what I needed
They didn't have much meaning on their own
There was some talk of deviation from what was never mentioned
So I set out to find the wrong way home

Home inside the hour, tuning my guitar
Well, I get that sudden urge I know too well
I finished my rendition of don't pity my condition
Then I looked around to find what I could sell

Can't sell your soul, leave that alone
Can't change your role, Big Daddy Low
Don't break your back less than love
Don't trade your love stars above

And Marie, Marie Helena
My firelight, you steal my heart
Oh Marie, Marie Helena
Oh Marie, Marie Helena

Caught up with Jack O'Lanterns in a town called Make It Hurt
Preaching three card Monte in the Live And Let It Church
The choir was down and dirty, drawin' bad and bettin' worse
Left at ten to six in a padded hearse

I might find companions in the after-hour taverns
Tell a tale or two I've never heard but the strangest song I know
Is 'What the thunder says to lightning'
And I never could recall a single word
Except

Up, near the border where the cruel white water
Drowns the vagabond who sleeps too low
Me and my companion, famous Jack O'Lanterns
Tracked the misty mountains through the snow

Don't lie for gold, no, no, no
Don't lie for love, turns out cold
If life depends, just get out whole
Don't lie for less, no, no, no, no

Robert Hunter,"What you gonna call that pretty baby?
You must call it one thing or another
This one parted water, that one walked upon
Perhaps I'll call this child a Rose of Sharon

What's to be the ground that child walks upon?
Will it be solid rock or shifting sand?
Think I'll set him down on concrete highways
We'll bring him up to walk the land

Think I'll call him just another stranger
Believe I'll call him knocking at your door
Asking you for shelter from the lightning
Space to rest upon your kitchen floor

Will he be a man of constant sorrow?
Born to beg a coat against the storm?
Will he want a house with marble pillars?
And fire of a night to keep him warm?

And if a stranger comes for troubled shelter
With hounds and torchlight on his midnight trail
Will he find a moment free of madness there?
And ears that still can hear to tell his tale?

Then you could call that child the Rock of Ages
You could call him raft upon the flood
He has been the face of many races
He has been the palace in the blood

If that child should end up in a prison
As sometimes chance will deal to honest men
One room is like another to a stranger
Any man of worth will be his friend

Now what you gonna call that pretty baby?
You must call it one thing or another
Think I'll call him flame out on the water
Think I'll call him shore between the sea

Drop him on the rocks and he will shatter
Cut him with a blade and he will bleed
Plant him in the ground, he will rise up again
Sometimes as a flower, sometimes a reed

What you gonna call that pretty baby?
You must call him one thing or another
This one parted water, that one walked upon
Perhaps I'll call this child a Rose of Sharon

Robert Hunter,"In a torrid little cabin 'neath Aurora Boreeay
Wild Bill waxed his whiskers, dabbed perfume behind each ear
From a flask of Spanish lotion that he'd had for many years
Kept it for occasions when he went to see his dear
When he went down to see that little girl

Slipped off a ring of silver, slipped on a ring of gold
With a twenty-carat diamond that was carved into a rose
An ivory-stemmed revolver was reflected in his boots
That glittered like the cuff studs setting off his lovin' suit
When he went down to see that little girl

Threw a handful of ash on the fire
Made his way out through the snow
To the finest cuisine south of Canada
The finest north of Mexico

The lady who was his intension
With the look fit to fetch or to kill
Had tattooed 'neath the lace on her bosom
'Wild Bill Loves Diamond Lil'

She was not just the girl of his dreams
He was not only fond of her charms
She could knock down a man at ninety paces
While he rolled her around in his arms

Shot a hole through the hand of Michael Miller
As he crept up behind Wild Bill
She said, ""Now share a little of the life I've saved you
Where you know you can relax and not get killed""

Jacob nailed the ladder to the floor
Now we can't move the ladder 'round no more
Sunday is the day I go to church and pray the Lord
Take me when I die to golden shores

Monday is the day I go to work and pay our bills
Saturday I go and spend what's left at Diamond Lil's
Yeah, that's the day I go to Diamond Lil's

In a torrid little cabin 'neath Aurora Boreeay
Wild Bill waxed his whiskers dabbed perfume behind each ear
From a flask of Spanish lotion that he'd had for many years
Kept it for occasions when he went to see his dear
When he went down to see Diamond Lil

Robert Hunter,"Anxious hope and thoughts of love
Will never let me down or let me go
Inside, my heart's a cage of ice
Where love and loss still toss the lonely dice

I burned the whole night long
My thoughts were never far from you
Love that locks and binds must die
But when it dies a part of you dies too

Born, born, born upon the world
The restless heart keeps flying
Trying to become the heart of home
Love, love, love, it picks you up
And spins you round
Sets you right back down, where you belong

My head don't fit my hat sometimes
It gets so full of clouds
Every time I pass your door
I hear you cry out loud

Sometimes I look the same to you
As you have looked to me
My eyes get filled so full of stars
I don't know when I leave

Born, born, born upon the world
The restless heart keeps flying
Trying to become the heart of home
Love, love, love, it picks you up
And spins you round
Sets you right back down, where you belong

Love is like the April rain
That makes the harvest grow
And when it grows it's like the summer gold
Love is like the colored leaves
That drift down from the trees
One by one 'til every tale is told

If I go a-dancing out across the yellow moon
I'll be home by morning if it doesn't come too soon
If you seek protection go and find a safer man
And if he can't give you what you need
Then come on by again

Priestess of the sun and moon
And goddess of the wind
You know too much to ever lose
And not enough to win

Though you built your house upon the rock
And not upon the sand
You're still looking out your window
For another traveling man

Born, born, born upon the world
The restless heart keeps flying
Trying to become the heart of home
Love, love, love, it picks you up
And spins you round
Sets you right back down, where you belong

Love, love, love that picks you up
And spins you round
Sets you right back down where you belong

Robert Hunter,"Does God look down on the boys in the barroom?
Mainly forsaken but surely not judged
Jacks, Kings and Aces, their faces in wine
Do Lord deliver our kind?

From singin' for whiskey, three strings on a fiddle
Four on the guitar and a song that I love
Many's the night we spent pickin' and singin'
In hopes it be pleasing both here and above

Jack string fiddle to my saw tooth bow
Who loves loneliness, loves it alone
I love the dim lights like some love the dew
The only thing I wonder sometimes

Is does God look down on the boys in the barroom?
Mainly forsaken but surely not judged
Jacks, Kings and Aces, their faces in wine
Do Lord deliver our kind?

Robert Hunter,"Tiger Rose got new clothes
The ladies love her so
They laugh at her connections
But they don't say no

Get down high, get down low
Get your heels in tow
We don't care what
Mama don't allow here anymore

Tiger tea, tiger gee, you my Tiger Rose
Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song
On the bank where children play 'ring a levio'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

There's the day breaking
Windows shaking at my cabin door
Love me like you did last night
Just one time more

I know it don't make sense
But then it don't intend
You keep coming by
We'll make it up again

Get up, Johnny, sing along
Get along now, get along
I could be right, I could be wrong
Pretty soon be long gone

Lay me down in worried sleep
Listen while the river weep
Thought I heard it sing a song
Delta Queen done come and gone

Tiger tea, tiger gee, you my Tiger Rose
Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song
On the bank where children play 'ring a levio'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

Come on, big eyed handsome moll
And be my party doll
We'll live in jive o county
'Neath the waterfall

If people say, ""What can you play?
Just tell 'em, ""Anything""
Cut glass spur or a silver chime
Can make 'em ring

Tiger Rose, heaven knows
I just love you so
Maybe that's the reason
That you don't say no

You get high, get down low
You my rodeo
We don't give a damn
What Mama don't allow here anymore

Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song

Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

Robert Kyle,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Who want to stay out of hell

Crawling 'cause I can't talk

Staring into the half-life of eternity

No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle",Mam'selle
Robert Mandell,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Robert Mandell,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation
You were born to be kissed
I can't resist.

Robert Mandell,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares

My every kiss with theirs

You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

The fireworks blasted in that desert sky. I saw an angel in those pretty blue eyes.
I thought that things would be so perfect. A beautiful girl I thought I’d never have.
I used to think she was so cute when she started to fight.
Mary disappeared into that Hollywood night.

Robert McAtee,"The picture’s crooked on the wall. Do you think it’s a sign for me to get up and leave?
My head is getting tired ‘cause you’re messin’ with me.
You’re leavin’ marks on my body. Am I somebody to you or do you have something to prove?
I feel like I’m sinkin’ in the floor. Should I have another drink?
Should I go this way or that? I look up to the mirror and see my face.
It’s a look that I’ve seen before. Am I gonna walk out that door?
Or do I have something to prove?
Love comes with pain. It’s a game we all know.
Why must we play when we wink this low?
Are you gonna save me or am I destined to lose this game of love?
I’m not a quitter by nature but now I’m stuck in the middle …
Of joy and sorrow and pleasure and pain. I’m a rock with a soft spot.
My head’s on the bar. I’m not makin’ it very far cause I’ve got something to lose.
Who knows where she’s off to right now.

I can’t stand to see the truth again and again.
I wanna kiss your lips like I did before.
I wanna fuck you, Love, on the bedroom floor.

I’ve seen things that I shouldn’t ‘ve.
I’ve been to places I should’ve never gone.
And where has it left me? A bird with no wings.
Who am I to kiss you? Who am I to love you?
Who am I to touch you? Who am I to cry for you?
Sometimes I think you see right through me.
You see the devil in my eyes.
Yeah I’ve been to hell and yeah I know it well.
I’ve got a fire in my heart. I’m fallin’ apart.

So why can’t I stop dreaming? And why can’t I stop thinkin’ of you?
And why can’t I stop feeling? You left me so why won’t you go away?

You’re smile in that photograph will last a lifetime. But a lifetime’s too long.

And I can see you laughing but I can’t hear a sound ‘cause you’re gone.

I don’t know what to do with myself. I’m starting to feel old.

It’s a full moon and I’m too sober. December is the end of the year but I’m still here. 
Sounds of the night and something’s just not right. And I can’t turn off the light. 
I can’t go to sleep. She’s screamin’ in my head reminding me that I haven’t been fed like a beast in the night. 
I’m losing my mind waiting on time to bring her back again. 
I scribble on a notebook tryin’ to hide from that sweet little sexy girl. 
But I feel her hot lips whispering in my ear it’s almost the end of the year but she’s still not here. 
For days and for nights I can’t turn out the lights until she’s back in my bed. 
She’s the dominatrix of my head. And I wanna touch her with every bit of my skin. 
The rain drips down. The night slows down. The lights spin around in this sleazy town. 
And time goes way too fast. And that’s the last time that I’ll look the other way. 
Next time I’ll know what to say to her. I think about driving but it’s too cold outside and I wanna hide from the world. 
And I’m too sober for my own good, Hollywood. I don’t like to say goodbye. 
Ham and cheese on rye. The fireplace is filled with ash. I’m all out of cash. 
I’ve seen better of days. A picture of her plays in my head like it’s real only I can’t feel her anymore. 
I’m sitting on the floor ‘cause it just ain’t right when she’s not in my bed. 
I can’t smile and I’m falling down. I’m too numb to cry. Thirsty but I can’t move.

There’s something nice about hunger. I need a long hot shower. 
I need a smooth shave. I want her to skydive onto me. That would be a sight to see. 
I need to simplify. French toast and ice cream make me think of her. 
I wanna see her run around in circles in a hotel room that doesn’t exist. 
I wanna tear open the present under the tree of the past. I never had to wear a cast. 
Knock on wood. She was so good like a book that couldn’t put me down. 
A light in my eye I follow back and forth. I don’t know why some things annoy me so much. 
I need to simplify. The greatest sense is touch. Sometimes ignorance can be cute. 
Sometimes intelligence is overrated. I need to simplify. I need to simplify. 
The torture is a matter of opinion. Abstaining can be pleasing to someone, two, three, four frogs hop by. 
The stream is ice cold. I don’t like to do what I’m told unless it’s coming from her. 
The first sip of beer is always nice. I gonna pick her up and take her far away.

How far can I go without turning around?

Nobody can do that. I look in the rearview mirror and it gets smaller ‘til it’s gone. 
But she’s comin’ with me at least in memories. And she’s a mystery that I thought I knew. 
All the clues but things have a way of changing in the blink of an eye. Why? 
That’s the question of the day. I feel like I should be cryin’ and tomorrow I’m flyin’ away. 
For three weeks I’ll be gone. I guess that’ll help me move on and make things right. 
Somehow. Some way. Twenty one days. The radio’s broken and I sing her a song. 
Tonight this road seems so long. I feel like I should cry.

I feel like I should turn around ‘cause I’ve never found anyone like her in the world. 
What a wonderful girl she is. But I don’t think the world is on our side. 
Don’t know how or why. I feel like I should be smokin’, I don’t know why I feel this way. 
I feel like I should be drinking the night away into the morning. 
But I really feel like I should turn around.

My cell phone says 4:32, I still don’t know what I’m going to do. 
But I still keep my foot on the gas and in my mind I’m still lying on top of her. 
Traffic is stopped as they tow some cars away. Accidents sometimes are part of the day. 
Sometimes you just don’t have the right words to say. 
And you leave the words, the wrong words up in the air and you wish you could take them and tear them like a little piece of paper and say them all again. 
I don’t know where or when we’ll see each other again. 
I yawn and I hold onto the wheel sometimes time moves in slow motion when things aren’t going great. 
Sometimes it’s hard to wait for the next time that I’ll see her face. 
I pull up to my place and walk up the stairs. Sometimes I feel like no one really cares. 
I drop my keys and take off my clothes and get under the blanket. But now I can’t sleep.

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh",Fool on the Hill
Robert McCarther,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Robert Merrill,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song
Robert Merrill,"O holy night! The stars are brightly shining, 
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining. 
'Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth. 
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices, 
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. 
Fall on your knees! 
Oh, hear the angel voices! 
O night divine, the night when Christ was born, 
O night, O holy night, o night divine! 
O night, O holy night, o night divine! 

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming, 
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand. 
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming, 
Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land. 
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger, 
In all our trials born to be our friends. 
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us to love one another, 
His law is love and His gospel is peace. 
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. 
And in his name all oppression shall cease. 
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, 
With all our hearts we praise His holy name. 
Christ is the Lord! 
Then ever, ever praise we, 
His power and glory ever more proclaim! 
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night
Robert Merrill,"Silent Night 
SPOKEN Intro: ""To you the man, woman, the child we have never met but think of as a friend, this is Nelson Eddy wishing you a Christmas complete with the excitement and pleasure of giving and receiving presents and warm and inspiring with its spiritual beauty. May the coming year bring this blessed land of ours a little closer to that day of eternal Christmas, that day of peace on earth."" 

Silent night! Holy night! 
All is calm all is bright 
round yon virgin mother and child 
Holy infant so tender and mild 
sleep in heavenly peace! 
sleep in heavenly peace! 

Silent night! holy night! 
Shepherds quake at the sight 
glories stream from heaven afar 
heavenly hosts sing Alleluia

Robert Miles,"Maybe this world is a broken mirror,
Reality in reverse,
Maybe it's just a shadow,
Of a parallel universe, I don't know 

Why do I want to go there? 
Why do I really care? 
Why should I climb a mountain? 
Find your way, if you dare. 

There's a universal language, I shall learn to speak 
Maybe then I will find, the answers that I seek 
And I will fly to higher ground, high above the clouds 
See the stars up closer watch the world go round,

A universal language, we can learn to speak 
Talk with the creator, no more hide and seek 
Global understanding, an end to all the strife 
Seems to me the only challenge that we have, is everyday life",Everyday Life
Robert Miles,"All my life I have searched for clues
This is what they taught me
Every mystery I pursued
Was a secret I already knew
Deep down you know, in your soul
Love is in control
Oh, if you could find the angel within
Time, time to have faith in your wings

Free, everybody's free
In the new day that's coming
Freedom for all is our destiny

Every stone that I left unturned
Soon came back to haunt me
Every fall, every finger burned
Was a step on the road to truth
That I am you, my soul
You are not alone
Oh, when your heart is turned to stone
Love, love is the only way home

Free, everyone's free
In the new day that's coming
Freedom for all is our destiny

Free, everything's free
In the new day that's coming
