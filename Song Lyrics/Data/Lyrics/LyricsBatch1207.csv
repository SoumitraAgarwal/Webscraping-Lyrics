Someone with a future as fucked up as mine.
So, I'm unpredictable,
Is this some fucking sign of the times?
I take pride
In what I do, and I do it well.
Call me easy-going
But at least I have a finished story to tell.
'Cause tomorrow I just might be
Another face on your T.V.
Being arrested for telephone fraud
Or beating someone to death with my guitar!
But I know I will go far, I know I will go

Far enough to tell you that I love you
But I know I'm stupid
Just because I run right back to you.
I got your letters yesterday
But I don't have a thing to say,
So I'll nail 'em to my wall
And just pretend they'll go away!

I don't want to love you,
But it's something that I love to do.
So I'll say this one last thing and then I'm
Gone away for good

The Ataris,"You inhale the toxic fumes,
I look away, and then resume to...
Do all the things that I told myself
I wouldn't ever do.
Why do I always believe,
That I'm in love with everyone I see?
And, why did the next one have to be you?
Why do you believe that everything I say is
True?
(chorus) why must I always do this?
Why do I put myself through this?
Love is blind and so unkind...
I never can make up my mind!
I undo the thought from my head,
Forgetting all you ever said.
Today it's you, tomorrow someone else,
Maybe I'm just better off by myself!
I forget that it's just you...
And not some person that I've always knew!

And did you make the same mistakes
That I made, a million times before I met

You
Did you go, did you run, did you think of
Your son?
Did you know you're not the only one

That tried to make a piece of coal into a 
Diamond yeah!
So everything's fine now, at least you say
Maybe that's o.k.

But you know it's 
Wrong
Was I right, did it last?
Were you dwelling on the past?

Or hanging on to a memory
So you say your time will never come
Maybe you should go ahead and jump
Then you'll become exactly what you are

Standing there on the bridge
With your feet on the ledge

And send you falling straight to the ground.",Clara
The Ataris,"How many bands have wrote this song before?
I can name at least fifty
I bet you could name a hundred more.

They'd run this one into the ground?!

I'm putting a stop to it once and for all
I'm putting my fist right through the wall

We could write a four chord wonder

A little bit neglected.
When it comes to your ex-boyfriends,
Well, I guess I'm overprotective.

Lately I've been thinking 'bout
Stickin' my hand in a toaster.
I never asked to take a ride 
On this emotional roller-coaster.
It's you that I want,
And lately it feels like you're not there.

Lately I've been contemplating 
Jumping in the ocean.
Sometimes even Spock would show
A little more emotion!
Do you still love me now
As much as you loved me yesterday?

I try to let it out
I bitch, cry, moan, whine, scream and 
Shout today,
But the wall wouldn't listen to me!

I'm sick of always cryin'
I don't want to be sick of trying,
But you've gotta want me too.

Lately I've been hoping for 
A little bit of affection.
Sometimes I wish that you had came
With your own set of directions.
I guess it's not that easy,
But I hope that you still love me anyway.

Lately I've been thinkin' 'bout
Takin' a vow of silence,
I've never seen a monk result
In any acts of violence.
Or, maybe I'll just cry
And hope you come around again today.

Should I say goodnight??? 
...go to bed, turn out the fucking light and leave you shining in the past. Should I try and forget??? 
...even though next week it's something I'll regret. Or, should I try and make it last? 
I think about the day when I felt you'd throw it all away to try and make me feel like I'm the one. 
You were my best friend, and I never ever thought those days would end but now it seems like they are gone.

What more can I say???

I'm gonna speak my mind. 
You should speak your mind!

But in the end it was the only thing we could be.

Angie, I'm sorry I wasn't right for you
Just what did you expect for me to do?
You know that I would have done anything for you.

I sometimes think about how things could be

We'd cruise along the 101 in the California sun
Sing Descendants songs and have ourselves lots of fun.
Stay out drinking really late, stumble home from lower State.

I'm better off alone.

You fall in love
Then break your heart.
You fall in love again
Its never ending.

I used to have this friend
Who took his fiance
To see billy idol
A couple weeks before
Their wedding day.
The chick got backstage
And left my friend outside.
Next day he called
From a hotel
Asking for a ride.

I guess I'm giving up on love (x3)
'cause it really kind of sucks

Uninspired
And growing tired
Why am I always
So attracted to drama?

So here I am
Grown up at 23
Will someone tell me
What it takes to be happy?

I play in my band
And write a lot of songs
About relationships
And how mine went wrong.
Maybe I'll meet that special
Girl along the way
Then she'll break my heart
And leave me crying.
",Giving Up on Love
The Ataris,"Postcards on the floor
But this pen can't write loneliness no more.
Waking up all alone
On the opposite side of the coast.

I'm committed to insecurity and you.
And love is overrated.
It leaves you devastated
Heart ripped in two

Roadside state of mind
Boulevard of broken dreams washed out this
Time after time I was lost and looking
But knew I'd never find
What is mine in a world that's so unkind.

And love is overrated.
It leaves you devastated.

The only things I know are
Road signs and rock songs and lonely hotel rooms.
But still I need you here, what's new?

It's 6am. Las Vegas doesn't look so cool
Once the sun come up.
I draw the blinds and I dream of you.

I'm committed to all these memories of you.
And love is overrated.
It leaves you devastated.
Love is overrated.",Road Signs and Rock Songs
The Ataris,"The time has come to say goodbye
To all our past regrets. I'm sorry to inform you
But I doubt you'll really ever understand.

Friendships aren't built on false promises
I've failed without defeat.
In this game of disrespect
I'm a victim a small town tragedy.

Here's the difference between you and I
I'll tell the truth and count my blessings
So thanks for all you've done
But I won't let you get the best of me.

You think I'm just a kid but
You don't fucking get it.
I'm strong in my conviction
And don't you forget it.

So many things are left unsaid
But I won't even waste my time
For us to go our separate ways
I hope you miss me when I'm gone.

Friendships aren't built on false promises.
I've failed without defeat.
In this game of disrespect
I'm a victim of small town rivalry.

Farewell to all my friends
With self respect intact.
Nothing will last forever
Never looking back.

End is forever.
",Song #13
The Ataris,"Three years gone by and still everyone screws up our name
No matter what you do still some things never change
Seen a lot of the world, met a lot of friends
Got a lot of fond memories
There's nothing like playing a basement show
On a Saturday night in Pennsylvania.

Start the show, here we go
Jumping in the crowd
We've gotta tear this building down.

The cops show up as usual
To try and ruin our fun.
It's time to show 'em all
Just how its done.

Gonna have a teenage riot.
They'll never understand
What it's like to be a kid today.
Gonna have a teenage riot.
Let's blow 'em all away.

Another night we'll be
Staying in some crack hotel
And sneaking everyone in
Through the bathroom window.

Gonna blow up everything in sight
And get chased away into the night
By some crazy bastard with a
Shotgun in his hand.

Jumping in the crowd
We've gotta tear this building down.

And try to ruin our fun.

The Ataris,"Maybe you should work for ""sick of it all""
Or get a job with the LAPD
Did someone switch your Ritalin with ephedrine?
Just don't take your fucking problems out on me.

I'd buy you a little fuzzy bunny
I'd put you on my x-mas card list
If you'd promise not to take your job so seriously
And realize you don't have to be so pissed.

Life ain't all that bad. life ain't all that bad.
Even if Henry Rollins is your dad.
Life ain't all that bad. life ain't all that bad.
Buck up little camper, don't be sad.

Maybe you could go hunting with Ted Nugent
And see how many animals you could kill.
I'd pay all of my friends just to hang out with you
And take you out to sizzler for a meal.

I'd take you to my favorite karaoke bar
And you sing ""let the sunshine in"".
You could stomp my ass into oblivion

The Ataris,"Nobody on the road,
Nobody on the beach.
I feel it in the air,
The summer's out of reach.

Empty lake, empty streets,
The sun goes down alone.
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home.

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby.
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

I never will forget those nights.
I wonder if it was a dream.
Remember how you made me crazy,
Remember how I made you scream.

Now I don't understand what
Happened to our love.
But, baby, when I get you back,
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
I see you walking real slow and you're
Smiling at everyone.
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

Out on the road today I saw a Black Flag
Sticker on a Cadillac.
A little voice inside my head said:
""Don't look back, you can never look back.""

I thought I knew what love was.
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever.
I should just let them go, but

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got that top pulled down,
And that radio on, baby.

And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,
After the boys of summer have gone.

I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got that hair slicked back,
And those Wayfarers on, baby.
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,
After the boys of summer have gone.",The Boys of Summer

Purpose, lust and charm, dance to an old refrain

Rinse out the dream, in the washing machine
Take out the ring, two fates sealed - negotiated a business deal -
Is this true romance? Champagne bubbles
Going flat, gone flat
Will you dine with me tonight
Will you dance and hold me tight
Send me an orchid on Valentine's day
What more need you to say,
Will you be my wife, be mine
Honor and obey, be mine
Drink some more white wine, be mine
Think it over one day, be mine

Do believe cause you know you cannot win

Spent most your life pretending not to be
The one you are but who you choose to see
Learned to survive in your fictitious world
Does what they think of you determine your worth?

If special's what you feel when you're with them
Taken away you feel 'less than' again

Gotta make a try
And with time it'll start to go away

I'll be here when you need
That one to sit and cry to
Cause I'm the you you forgot
The only one you know you cannot lie to

Bitter you'll be if you don't change your ways
When you hate you you hate everyone that day

Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom 
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas 
Pero pa montarlo aquí tengo la pieza 

Despacito 
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito 
Deja que te diga cosas al oído 
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo 

Despacito 
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto 
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo 
Quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le enseñes a mi boca

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro

Is Dexter ill today, Mr Kirk, Dexter's in school
I'm afraid he's not, Miss Fishborne
Dexter's truancy problem is way out of hand
The Baltimore County school board have decided to expel
Dexter from the entire public school system

Oh Mr Kirk, I'm as upset as you to learn of Dexter's truancy
But surely, expulsion is not the answer!
I'm afraid expulsion is the only answer
It's the opinion of the entire staff that Dexter is criminally insane

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all

It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

A little bit of give and take is what it needs

Gonna cut him don't you know
You can try to hide all you want to boy
There ain't nowhere to go
Somebody get my shotgun
Somebody get my blade
Sally's been layin' with another man 
And he's sleeping in my place

Now Sally don't go thinkin' 
That you got off so clean
I'd kill you too if I had the nerve
But I just ain't that mean
So I go and get my murder tools
I throw them in the lake
Gonna steal me an automobile

And drive so far away
Now I am a fugitive
I'm always on the run
Sally told the policeman
Exactly what I'd done
I went and got my shotgun
I went and got my blade
Killed poor Sally's lover
And I put him in the grave.

Now all you ramblin' fellas
You listen close to me
That woman she gonna bring you pain
Your heart is gonna bleed
But it ain't worth the trouble
The sufferin' or the grief
A bleeding heart is better than the penitentiary

I killed ppor Sally's lover
One dark and dreary day
Sally got another
And I got sent away
Somebody get my shotgun
Somebody get my blade
Sally's been laying with another man 
And I set him in his grave",I Killed Sally's Lover
The Avett Brothers,"I know that you're smiling, baby
I don't even need to see your face
Sunset at the shoreline, we are laughing, breaking up
Just like the waves
Are you feeling, feeling, feeling like I'm, feeling
Like I'm floating, floating, up above that big blue ocean
Sand beneath our feet, big blue sky above our heads
No need to keep the stressing from our everyday life on our minds
We have got to leave all that behind

Well, I have got a sister
And she has got a baby with brand new eyes
And her daddy is an engineer
And they just took her to the sea for the first time
Now they're under, under, underneath a big umbrella
Summer, summer, summer time to help us forget, nine to fives
We have got to leave all that behind

I have worries to give to the sea
We can walk dear the pier is farther than it seems

Midnight at the shoreline, fireworks above us
A screaming bloom
They're sent by some teenager and kid whoever you are
I am thanking you
Now we're dancing, dancing, dancing with no music
What is happening, happening, happening and no feelings
Except this is right
We just had to leave all that behind",At the Beach

Once I cursed the things I've done
Won't you please forgive me
Won't you please forgive me

Burn the questions burn the shame
You don't have to live by them

Wait 'till morning when I call

And I hear you call my name
I will break into a run without a pause
And if your love laughs at your dreams
Well it's not as bad as it seems

And if you take of my soul
You can still leave it whole
With the pieces of your own you leave behind

And see you shine so bright in this world of woe
And they will pay us all in fame
But that is not why we came
And if it compromises truth then we will go

The Avett Brothers,"November came and went, 
Like a summer that I spent, 
With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes. 
I returned to my home, 
With a heart part made of stone, 
And I cried all night for a girl I never knew. 
From the east it comes, 
Her love and the rising sun, 
And I pray each time they come, it's not the last. 
You see I've got strong, 
I made it through what came along, 
But I can't move on for the beauty of the past. 

Came across a pretty girl, 
For about a month she was my world, 
And I held her hand, and swore we'd never part. 
I moved on, she stayed behind, 
I said I'd call, she said she'd write, 
We lost touch the moment I drove off. 
I left town like a gambler with, 
The sense of cashin' all the chips, 
Before I lost them all on a bad deal. 
I made believe I was in a race, 
Drove ten thousand miles in seven days, 
While writing a book called ""Being A Free Man"". 
Met more people than the president, 
The good times came and the good times went, 
And I learned how to ignore my hunger pangs. 
I looked ahead to the open road, thought about the people and what they know, 
And wrote a book called ""People Don't Know Nothin"". 
(no matter what they tell ya, man) 

Once I spent my last dime, 
And counted the ratio of miles to time, 
I looked up to my disdain and my surprise. 
I had driven my car around the world, 
Ended back in the town with the girl, 
So I wrote a book called ""Life in Prison"". 
(Volume. 1) 
I see that girl every now and then, 
And we drink to having such good friends, 
And apologize for the way it did not last. 
Funny thing that it's all true, 
And I'll always love November Blue, 
But I turned her down for the beauty of the past.

The Avett Brothers,"I was in love with your beauty from the day you walked my way
Oh how I wish that was enough to have made me want to stay
See I'm as true as I want to be and I must say my girl
I tried the best to give to you all of the truest in the world

But when I left your house that morning in that ragged Thunderbird
I tried so hard to fight the voices from the devil's that I heard
See there's a highway to the right of us I took it a year ago
And since a year ago can't drive past, without turning down that road

And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong

So give me a try at describing just how difficult it is
When you kinda love two girls to figure out which one you miss
Stumble away from your stairway with your perfume on my clothes
Well I kinda loved two girls but now I've kinda lost 'em both

And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong

And if I could gather up the damage that I rendered in my life
Place it on a scale and weigh against the damage done that night
Then it'd be safe to say the weight of all I did and didn't do
Would surely float against the lightest wrong I ever did to you",Distraction #74

Readin' and writin' and readin' and thinkin' 
And searching for reasons and missing the seasons.
The Autumn, the Spring, the Summer, the snow. 
The record will stop and the record will go. 

Latches latched the windows down, 
The dog coming in and the dog going out. 
Up with caffeine and down with a shot. 
Constantly worried about what I've got. 

Distracting my work but I can't make a stop 
And my confidence on and my confidence off. 
And I sink to the bottom and rise to the top 
And I think to myself that I do this a lot. 

World outside just goes 
It goes it goes it goes it goes it goes
And witness it all from the blinds of my window.

I'm a little nervous 'bout what you'll think
When you see me in my swimming trunks
And last night in New York I got raging drunk
Remember one time I got raging drunk with you 

Now, I can recall a time when we made the city
Streets our playground, kissing in the fountains
Filled with cigarettes and bottles
Sped through Italian city streets of cobblestone

Because we had to
Because I loved you
Because the damned alcohol
Because what ever at all

Now I've grown to aware of my mortality
To let go and forget about dying
Long enough to drop the hammer down
And let the indolence go wild and flying through

Because I loved you

I will rearrange my plans and change for you

If I could go back
That's the first thing 
I would do I swear that I would
Do my best to folow through
Come up with a master plan
A homerun hit, a winning stand
A gaurantee and not a promise
That I'll never let your love slip from my hands

If it's the beaches
If it's the beaches' sands you want
Then you will have them
If it's the mountains' bending rivers
Then you will have them
If it's the wish to run away

Pack the old love letters up

Just do your best
Just do your best

It's the only way to keep that last bit of sanity
Maybe I don't have to be good but I can try to be
At least a little better than I've been so far

I hear things that aren't really there
I feel things when I shouldn't really care

The Avett Brothers,"Love writes a letter and sends it to Hate:
""My vacation's ending, I'm coming home late
The weather was fine and the ocean was great
And I can't wait to see you again.""

Hate reads the letter and throws it away
""No one here cares if you go or you stay
I barely even noticed that you were away
I'll see you or I won't, whatever.""

Love sings a song as she sails through the sky
The water looks bluer through her pretty eyes
And everyone knows it whenever she flies
And also when she comes down

Hate keeps his head up and walks through these streets
Every stranger and drifter he greets
And shakes hands with every loner he meets
With a serious look on his face

Love arrives safely with suitcase in tow
Carrying with her the good things we know
A reason to live and a reason to grow
To trust and to hold and to care

Hate sits alone on the hood of his car
Without much regard to the moon or the stars
Lazily killing the last of a jar
Of the strongest stuff you can drink

Love takes a taxi, a young man drives
As soon he sees her hope fills his eyes
But tears follow after at the end of the ride
Because he might never see her again

Patience, patience, patience

Hate gets home lucky to still be alive
He screams over the sidewalk and into the drive
The clock in the kitchen says 2:55
And the clock in the kitchen is slow

Love has been waiting patient and kind
Just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign
That the one that she cares for who's out of his mind
Will make it back safe to her arms

Hate stumbles forward and leans in the door
Weary head hung down, eyes to the floor
He says, ""Love, I'm sorry,"" and she says, ""What for?
I'm yours and that's it, whatever
I should not have been gone for so long
I'm yours and that's it, forever
Your mine and that's it, forever""",The Ballad of Love and Hate

Stitched by threads of notes with perfect pitch, perfectly composed
Sound in tune and key, a code of rhythm, and harmony

Each song that I sang all the notes were wrong and poorly played
Both my sleeves had holes, my knees were patched, my shoes needed soles
No clever disguise no way to hide my offensive tone

I wonder which brother is better
Which one our parents love the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble
They seem to let the other go

A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He said I love you and I'm proud of you both
in so many different ways

Go read the letter in my desk
Don't worry with all my belongings

Make sure my mother knows the same

Blurry and gray like the roar

The Avett Brothers,"I went on the search for something true.
I was almost there when I found you.
Sooner then my fate was wrote
Perfectly it slit my throat
And beads of lust released into the air.
When I awoke you were standing there.

I was on the mend when I fell through.
The sky around was anything but blue.
I found as I regained my feet
A wound across my memory
That no amount of stitches would repair.
But I awoke and you were standing there.

There's no fortune at the end of the road that has no end.
There's no returning to the spoils
Once you've spoiled the thought of them.
There's no falling back asleep
Once you've wakened from the dream
Now I'm rested and I'm ready,
I'm rested and I'm ready to begin.
I'm ready to begin.

I went on the search for something real.
Traded what I know for how I feel.
But the ceiling and the walls collapsed
Upon the darkness I was trapped
And as the last of breath was drawn from me
The light broke in and brought me to my feet.

There's no fortune at the end of the road that has no end.

The Avett Brothers,"I ain't from Texas, but I made my way from Dallas
And I know the lonesome sound is following
I ain't a gambler, but I can recognize a hand
And when to hold, when the queens are staring back at me

Once I was a carpenter, man my hands were calloused
I could swing a metal mallet sure and straight
But I took to the highway, a poet young and hungry
And I left the timbers rotting where they lay

Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
And when the black cloak drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember

And I followed till I finally lost my way

And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
And when the black dress drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
We're all in this together

And my life is but a coin, pulled from an empty pocket
Dropped into a slot with dreams of sevens close behind
Hope and fear go with it, and moon and the sun go spinning
Like the numbers and fruits before my eyes

Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind
Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind

You gave your heart away like that.
I didn't want to fall in love with anyone, but you did.
I can still hear the song,
The melody behind the kiss you gave me.
You were wrong, I was right so I walked away,
And left you there, alone
I got so tired of talkin' on the telephone,
How many times would we say the words goodbye

I made mistakes, and one was telling you that I'd be there,
When telling time had come,
I should've said I didn't care.
Oh, the time I would have saved,
If I had been less willing to accommodate,
You'd been a little less likely to cry.

You go back to the high life,
And I'll go back to the low.
I should've known, but now I know

There'll be no word from you,

And it was in the smile you gave me when I was a kid

To talk to you is through my prayers
I only wanted to tell ya I care

I find myself crying when the memory hits
Sometimes it knocks me down, sometimes I can just put it away

Alive but unforgiving

Bring me life from where I thought it was dark
Be the spark that has a chance to light the candle

As soon as her beauty was seen
By young men who try to reduce her down
To a scene on an x-rated screen

Is she not more than the shine on her lips?
Does she not dream to sing and to live and to dance down her own path?
Without being torn apart
Does she not have a heart?

I step out my front door and I feel it surround me

When my feet won't walk another mile 
And my lips give their last kiss goodbye 
Will my hands be steady?

My hopes and my doubts 
The rings on my fingers 
And the keys to my house

When the sun hangs low in the west 
And the light in my chest 
Won't be kept held at bay any longer 
When the jealousy fades away 
And it's ash and dust for cash and lust 
And it's just hallelujah 
And love in thoughts and love in the words 
Love in the songs they sing in the church 
And no hard feelings

Lord knows they haven't done 
Much good for anyone 
Kept me afraid and cold 
With so much to have and hold

And it finally lets me free 
Where will I go?

Through Georgia grain or tropical rain 
Or snow from the heavens?

Will I join with the ocean blue 
Or run into the savior true 
And shake hands laughing 
And walk through the night 
Straight to the light 
Holding the love I've known in my life 
And no hard feelings

'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dares
Disturb the sound of silence

Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""

And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""

Spreading salt on fertile ground.
Honest pleasures now forsaken,
Drastic measures to be taken.
Can't accept your difference,
They call it bad influence.

It's time for liberation to flow.
Free mind, free soul,
It's time, so let your future unfold.

Dangerous walls are closin' in.
They twist the truth,
Then give it a spin.

So good, so good,
But people say I'm a bad influence.

Wide mouths, narrow minds,
Can't accept your difference.
Open season on new ideas,
They call it bad influence.

My bad, my bad influence.
Just a bad influence.
My bad, my bad influence.

Narrow minds, creak and grind.
Rally to a peaceful sound,
Let the barriers tumble down.

Told myself I'd get by without love

I had to turn my heart away
Smiled like the sun, kisses for real

You lying so low in the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me

Now wouldn't you, Barracuda?

Back over time we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me
No right, no wrong, selling a song
A name, whisper game

And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn it to the wick, ooh, Barracuda

Dive down, deep down free my head

All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools

From a part of Pennsylvania even Jesus couldn't save 
With towns named after Indian chiefs and Union Army generals 
It's nowhere in particular but everywhere in general 

History says Americans, we have the right to choose 
But they never mention those of us whose opinions aren't used

Well, the big flood came in '72 and tore the railroad bridges down 
Washed away our only means of getting shipments out of town 
And the government won't subsidize rebuilding the Central Line 
So there's barroom fights and anthracite and loads of extra time

But here I sit too proud to admit and too damn old to change 
Now, the monuments at Gettysburg keep the tourists going there 
But we died too slow and quietly for anyone to care

Over hillsides in the snow

Into the valley there below 
When the fields turned into parking lots

And throw him into a cage 
And expect him to be thankful 
For the shelter that you gave

And reasons for a routine

And self-depreciation

Eases the trials of isolation

Where she reclines alone
Her breathing labored, she begins to roam

In a beautifully crafted paradigm

Down in his little hell
He had time to decide even if it 
Was worth the ride

Than a good time

What are the risks of burnin' hot 
If you can't even see

Of the flashing lights

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...

If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me

So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...

I give her my heart but she wanted my soul

Abe said, ""Man, you must be puttin' me on""
God said, ""No"" Abe say, ""What?""
God say, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me comin', you better run""
Well, Abe said, ""Where d'you want this killin' done?""
God said, ""Out on Highway 61""

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know""
Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man, I got to run""
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61""

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
""I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son""
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done""
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now, the roving gambler he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61""",Highway 61 Revisited
The Band,"Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn that he not busy being born
Is busy dying

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be
One more person crying

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not fergit
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only","It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"

Ruben Remus ain't no doctor

I knew the man and tried to remember
Just where it was that I'd seen his face
Long ago, in a movie show
He was like that man singin' bass
Knew him by his nursery rhyme
The 'Story Of The Rabbit Man'
Fell right in and said to him
""I'd like to help you if I can""
I know the film would only shock ya
Ruben Remus ain't no doctor

He only needed what you had
Asked for nothing more
Said he'd like to take you on
But it's been done before
You couldn't see he's a travelin' man
And he cannot take your hand
It's very hard to understand
Why his songs were never banned
Guess the man would never knock ya
Ruben Remus ain't no doctor

No one seen ya since he's been gone
It's been a day, maybe more
I took a walk in your yard
And knocked on your back door
Why don't you let me in?
I'm not the one who did ya in
Is Mr. Remus still your friend?
You say you don't remember him
Turn me down, would ya?
Well, I've got news for you
Turn me down would ya?
Can't ya tell?
I'm gonna change your mind before I'm

The Band,"Stranded out in the night
Eliza took me down
To see the widow give
Rain to the town
It's against the law
To be a tonic man,
But the widow knows
She's got the upper hand
So I went on in
Feelin' kinda wheezy
You know she soothed my mind, boys
She rocked me kinda slow and easy
All day and all night

Pick a card before you go
It's a long trip to Mexico

Eliza wait by the door
I can't stay here anymore, no, no

Then she took a pill
She washed her feet in the mud
She said look out son
You know, I just ordered a flood
For forty days and forty nights

Then I dropped my shoes
Eliza called my name
She said it looked to her

Like it's gonna rain
Then the cotton king
Came in chokin'
And the widow laughed and said
I ain't jokin'
Take once for all
She said now don't ya tease me
I just fell in love, boy
So rock me kinda slow and kinda easy
All day and all night

Sweet William said
With a drunken head
if I had a boat
I'd help why'all float
Eliza stood there watching
William in a trance
As the widow did the St Vitus dance
But just then an old man
With a boat named breezy
Said you can ride with Clyde, boys
If you rock it kinda slow and easy

The Band,"After a while we took in the clothes
Nobody said very much
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants
Which nobody wanted to touch
Mama come in and picked up a book
An' papa asked her what it was
Someone else asked,what do you care
Papa said well, just because
Then they started to take back their clothes
Hang 'em on the line
It was January the thirtieth
And everybody was feelin' fine

The next day, everybody got up
Seein' if the clothes were dry
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed
Mama, of course, she said,hi
Have you heard the news he said with a grin
The vice president's gone mad
Where downtown when last night
Hmm, say, that's too bad
Well, there's nothing we can do about it,said the neighbor
It's just something we're gonna have to forget
Yes, I guess so said ma
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet

I reached up, touched my shirt
And the neighbor said, are those clothes yours
I said, some of them, not all of them
He said,ya always help out around here with the chores
I said, sometimes, not all of the time
Then my neighbor blew his nose
Just as papa yelled outside
Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes
Well, I just do what I'm told so I did it, of course
I went back in the house and mama met me
And then I shut all the doors",Clothes Line Saga

The Band,"[Chorus]
Daniel, Daniel and the sacred harp,
Dancing through the clover.
Daniel, Daniel would you mind,
If I look it over.

I heard of this famous harp years ago back in my home town
But I sure never thought old Daniel be the one to come and bring it around
Tell me Daniel how the harp came into your possession.
Are you one of the chosen few who will march in the the procession?

And Daniel said,
The sacred harp was handed down, from father unto son,
And me not being related, I could never be the one.
So I saved up all my silver, and took it to a man,
Who said he could deliver the harp, straight into my hand.

Three years I waited patiently,
Till he returned with the harp from the sea of Galilee.
He said there is one more thing I must ask,
But not of personal greed.
But I wouldn't listen I just grabbed the harp,
And said take what you may need.

Now Daniel looked quite satisfied, and the harp it seemed to glow.
But the price that Daniel had really paid, he did not even know.
Back to his brother he took his troubled mind.
And he said dear brother I'm in a bind.
But the brother would not hear his tale,
He said Old Daniel's gonna land in jail.
So to his father Daniel did run,
And he said oh father what have I done.
His father said son you've given in, you know you won your harp,
But you lost in sin.

But as he looked to the ground, he noticed no shadow did he cast.

I play the game, but to my real shame
You left me to dream all alone

The Band,"It makes no difference where I turn
I can't get over you and the flame still burns
It makes no difference, night or day
The shadow never seems to fade away

And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door

Now there's no love
As true as the love
That dies untold
But the clouds never hung so low before

It makes no difference how far I go
Like a scar the hurt will always show
It makes no difference who I meet
They're just a face in the crowd
On a dead-end street
And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door

These old love letters
Well, I just can't keep
Cause like the gambler says
Read 'em and weep
And the dawn don't rescue me no more

Without your love I'm nothing at all
Like an empty hall it's a lonely fall
Since you've gone it's a losing battle
Stampeding cattle
They rattle the walls

And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door

Well, I love you so much
It's all I can do
Just to keep myself from telling you
That I never felt so alone before",It Makes No Difference

Listen to the rice when the wind blows 'cross the water

I work for the union 'cause she's so good to me
And I'm bound to come out on top

I will hear every word the boss may say
For he's the one who hands me down my pay
Looks like this time I'm gonna get to stay
I'm a union man, now, all the way

The smell of the leaves,
From the magnolia trees in the meadow
King Harvest has surely come

Dry summer, then comes fall,
Which I depend on most of all
Hey, rainmaker, can't you hear the call?
Please let these crops grow tall

Long enough I've been up on Skid Row
And it's plain to see, I've nothing to show
I'm glad to pay those union dues,
Just don't judge me by my shoes

Scarecrow and a yellow moon,
And pretty soon a carnival on the edge of town
King Harvest has surely come

Last year, this time, wasn't no joke,
My whole barn went up in smoke
Our horse Jethro, well he went mad
And I can't remember things bein' that bad

Then there comes a man with a paper and a pen
Tellin' us our hard times are about to end
And then, if they don't give us what we like

You know where I want to go
Straight down the Mississippi River
To the Gulf of Mexico

To Lake George, Louisiana
Little Bessie, girl that I once knew
And she told me just to come on by
If there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me
To the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
And I bet on another to show

Odds were in my favor
I had him five to one
When that nag came around the track
Sure enough we had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up and blew it in my face
Just for a laugh

Now there's one thing in the whole wide world
I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
Dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack
We had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings
But I love to hear him talk""

Now that just gave my heart a fall
To the bottom of my feet
And I swore and I took another pull
My Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

As a flood out in California
And up north it's freezing cold
And this living off the road
Is getting pretty old

So I guess I'll call up my big mama
Tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kinda tempted
To go and see my sweet Bessie again

Sweeties' Snack Bar, boarded up now
And Eagles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the gray decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel

There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent, waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent, staring are her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter, ghosts, history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and
""I don't like you""
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night
They're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals

Fallen to hard luck
And time and other thieves

He pins me in a corner and he won't take ""No!""

He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines of the freeway

I looked a Coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
He went running through the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes - just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play

No regrets, Coyote
I just get off up aways
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too fat from the Bay of Fundy
From Appaloosas and Eagles and tides
And the air conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free, free way",Coyote

When the Chinatown patrol came down

Shoot out in Chinatown
They lined them up against the wall

Till the break of dawn
'Twas Frisco in its heyday
Imported from Hong Kong
For about five dollars
Or one thousand yen
You could gamble and ramble in a brothel
Or take it to the opium den

They're gonna level it to the ground
And close it up for evermore

There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene and they all did agree

If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she cries over my bones

For a rusty tanker leaking oil, and the burning sun was on my back
Traveled up the ragin' river, I watched the jungle burn
And in the reddenin' twilight, I wondered would I ever return.

Ridin' on a river of dreams,
Broken dreams.
I'm ridin' on a river of dreams.
Amazon, Amazon,
Is it heaven or hell?
Amazon.

An eagle flew above us, I felt the breezes blow.
Fish with teeth like ivory, waited down below.
On shore they cut and hammered, and fenced them in with wire.
While ancient fires in the jungle, burned our souls like fire.

Ridin' on a river of dreams,
Somebody's dreams.
I'm ridin' on a river of dreams.
Amazon, Amazon,
Is it Heaven or hell ?
Amazon.

What kind of creature's gonna rise up from these ashes?
What's gonna fly in the moonlight feathers aglow?
What kind of rain could come in from these sorrows?
Nobody knows, nobody knows.

At dawn we crossed the rapids, a place where few men go.
I felt the desolation, where nothing seemed to grow.
When I got my wages, I hung my head and cried.
I could not stop these visions, that swept in like the tide.

Ridin' on a river of dreams,
Broken dreams.
I'm ridin' on a river of dreams.

It's time for you to dream away,
For what a big day you've been through.
You've done all the things that you wanted to do.
All la glory, I'm second story,
Feel so tall like a prison wall.

I'm lookin' for a star bright
To shine down your light now
And keep the little one safe and warm,
'Cause to her it's just a fantasy
And to me it's all a mystery.
All la glory, I'm second story,
Feel so tall like a prison wall.

And before the leaves all turn brown,
Before they fall to the ground,
You will find the harmony,

Wait and see.
Listen to the serenade,
Little girl, promenade now.
You've got the sunshine in your hand
And maybe come some sweet day
You'll walk that Milky Way.

Feel so tall like a prison wall,

The Band,"If I never saw you
You'd still live in my dreams
Calling out from stages
And music magazines
?If I were a painter
You'd be green and gold
Carved out of matches
But broken out of stone
?Taken from the fire of your fiddle
Words of unspoken, blinding truth
If I couldn't see it, I was lost in my youth
But I'm going back to Memphis - after you.
?If I could have seen you
With blood on your bones
Poison in your fingers
But music in your soul
?You could have been my lover
Taught me everything I know
But now we are your children
Your flowers in the snow
?But all you ever wanted was to see the heart of the city, oh
And all you ever got was hand to mouth
So I know you'll be walking for a long, long time
Cause you're going back to Memphis - heading South.
?Brothers till the night came
And whispered in the pines
Tempting me with secrets
To play a game with time
?Now I feel you in the walls
And I know you're in the air
And it's just like I can touch you
You're living everywhere
?But all you ever wanted was to be in the heart of the city, oh
And all you ever got was handed out
So I know we'll be walking for a long, long time
Cause we're going back to Memphis - heading South
Going back to Memphis - heading South. ?

I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith

Where it is you're really comin' from

Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing

We would be the great triangle and to this we swore
Julie was my sweetheart, little John was my cohort
And all the wild horses in the world couldn't keep us apart
Once we went for a swim in the noonday sun
And promised to return before the moon struck one

Julie came running through the pasture, she was screaming at the sky
She fell down to her knees and the tears did fly
Little John was stung by a snake over by the lake
And it looked like he s really, really hurt, he was lying in the dirt
Who, we went it as fast as we could run
But we lost little John as the moon struck one

I was vacant, Julie was a bird with a broken wing
We were always afraid of what tomorrow might bring

 And ricochet like an old water well

It's dark and wide and deep, towards the sea it creeps
I'm so glad I brought along my mandolin

Poison it or dam it
Fish in it and wash in it
Swim in it and you can die in it
Run, you river, run
Son, you ain't never seen yourself

No crystal mirror can show it clear, come over here instead
Son, you ain't never eased yourself
 Til you laid it down in a river bed

And gets louder as the day grows dim

Don't you raise the sails anymore.

It's for sure, I've spent my whole life at sea
And I'm pushin' age seventy three;
Now there's only one place that was meant for me:

Oh, to be home again,

Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
We're gonna soothe away the rest of our years,
We're gonna put away all of our tears,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.

Slow down, Willie Boy,
Your heart's gonna give right out on you
It's true, and I believe I know what we should do.
Turn the stern and point to shore,
The seven seas won't carry us no more.
Oh, to be home again,
Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
I can't wait to sniff that air,
Dip'n snuff, I won't have no care,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.
Hear the sound, Willie Boy,
The Flyin' Dutchman's on the reef.
It's my belief
We've used up all our time,
This hill's to steep to climb,
And the days that remain ain't worth a dime.
Oh, to be home again,
Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
Would-a-been nice just t'see the folks,
Listen once again to the stale jokes,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.
I can hear something calling on me

And you know where I want to be
Oh Willie don't you hear that sound

Oh to be home again down in old Virginny
I just want to get my feet back on the ground
Oh to be home again down in old Virginny

I'd love to see my very best friend
They call him Rag-time Willie

To learn to sing below the surface

Called to me in a voice so soft and low

And then she faded like a rainbow

Her golden spaceship with the mother of the earth
Carved in stone, the queen of avatars
Where seventy children were given birth
She then returned back to the stars

And lead our people into the light of day
For they are lost and know not where they're goin'
And all their leaders are cast in clay

Now disbelief and mass confusion
Spreading wild across the land
You can call it love or call it wisdom
To be not savin' a drowning man

There's a hundred lucky ladybugs landing everywhere I see
I won a million dollars for a dollar in the lottery
My best friend C.W. is due
He beat every charge that the police threw

I'm in high cotton, the popcorn's popping
There ain't no stopping me now

The summer wind is heavenly and the honeysuckle's everywhere
I'm gonna pick my Gibson mandolin on the back porch chair
Worst Stan just got the news
His wife took a lover and his money too

For a good time rock and roll barbecue

The Band,"Old Beale Street is coming down
Sweeties' Snack Bar, boarded up now
And Eagles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the gray decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel

There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent, waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent, staring are her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter, ghosts, history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and
""I don't like you""
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

W.C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fay
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night
They're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck
And time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street

There's a [unverified] woman, sweet mystery
She let the rope fall down in the well
Like it was meant to be

She put the jug upon her head
Walked with her back to the wind
I followed her tracks the moment she said
""Why don't you come in?""

She killed the light
She dropped her glove
She said, ""Are you looking for trouble
Or looking for love, love, love?""

I woke in the morning dying of thirst
Headed straight back to the well
There she was with a jug on her head
The rope had just fell

The well in her eyes was deep and black
With no question or answer
She wiped my brow and I followed her back
To the Tropic of Cancer

She killed the light
She dropped her glove
She said, ""Are you looking for trouble
Or looking for love, love, love?""

You know where I want to go
Straight down the Mississippi river
To the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles Louisiana
Little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by
If there's anything that she could do

Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, as she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me
To the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
And I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor
I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track
Sure enough we had won

Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me
If I spring a leak, as she mends me
I don't have to speak, as she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up and threw it in my face
Just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world
I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
Dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me
If I spring a leak, as she mends me
I don't have to speak, as she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack
We had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings
But I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb
To the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull
My Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me
If I spring a leak, as she mends me
I don't have to speak, as she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

As there's a flood out in California
And up North it's freezing cold
And this living on the road
Is getting pretty old
So I guess, I'll call up my big mama
Tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down
I'm kind of tempted
To go and see my Bessie again

Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me

No, you can't blame a girl, hey",Lasso
The Band Perry,"Wish I would have noticed sooner
All that crazy in your eyes
Do you practice in the mirror
On that tempt and crooked smile

Like the serpent in the garden
You came crawling back to me
Twice I ate that poisoned apple
Made me sick of being Eve

I'll admit that I was wrong
You said I miss you
Oh yes I do
Honey I miss you being gone

I saw that floozy you've been wooing
On your ex-best buddies arm
And I knew you'd soon be slinkin' back
Turning on the charm

Yea well, cupid ain't a bruiser
And I'm tampered throwing darts
Do you think I walk around
With a bulls-eye on my heart

Well, I'll admit that I was wrong
You said I miss you
Oh yes I do
Sugar I miss you being gone

I miss you like
Drama queens and cat fights and braces on prom night
I miss you like
Boy bands and cheap cologne our song as chaperons and probably other things that I've outgrown

Well you know you've got the mojo
But it ain't working me no more
And I swear I won't be checking you out
When you walk out my door

I'll admit that I was wrong
You said I miss you
And boy you got issues
Honey I miss you being gone

Being gone
Being gone, being gone
Thank God you're gone",Miss You Being Gone
The Band Perry,"I was meant to be by your side
And I have waited here a long time
For you to turn around and notice me
But now you're here holdin' hands with me

Walk me down the middle of the county fair
Walk me down the middle like you don't care
Walk me by the Ferris wheel and make sure that she sees
Let the whole world know you belong to me

I've heard about your bitter end
'Bout how she stole your heart and put it back again
Well I may not be the prettiest girl around
But I sure am a sight for sore, sore eyes

Walk me down the middle of main street
Walk me down where the whole town will be
I don't need no parade but make sure that she sees
Let the whole world know you belong to me

I'd walk through fire for you
Walk through barbed wire for you
I'd walk for miles, it's true
Just to be with you

If you'll walk me down the middle of my mama's church
Walk me down that aisle in your finest shirt

Let the whole world know
You will walk me down the middle of the county fair
Oh walk me down the middle like you don't care
Walk me by the Ferris wheel and make sure they all see
Let the whole world know you belong to me",Walk Me Down the Middle
The Band Perry,"It ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow but baby I ate it
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes and tell me that you're sorry
Well you might as well throw gasoline on a fire
The way you lie

You lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
And you lie like a cooped up dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie

That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys and baby I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now and do the whole wide world a service
Well my daddy's gonna straighten you out like a piece of wire, like a piece of wire
The way you lie

You lie like the man with the slick black hair who sold me that Ford
And you lie like a pine tree in the back yard after last month's storm
Well you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie

Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive until the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm gonna cry well maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
And give it a big ol' fling and watch it sink
Down, down, down
There it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around

Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
You lie like a coondog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well it's what you do, it's who you are",You Lie
The Band Perry,"Would you walk to the edge of the ocean?
Just to fill my jar with sand?
Just in case I get the notion,
To let it run through my hands.
Let it run through my hands.

I don't want the whole world,
The sun, the moon and all their light.
I just wanna be the only girl,
You love all your life.
You love all your life.

Would you catch a couple thousand fireflies?
Yeah, and put 'em in a lamp to light my world.
All dressed up in a tux and bowtie.
Hand Delivered to a lonely girl.
To a lonely lonely girl

I don't want the whole world,
The sun, the moon and all their light.
I just wanna be the only girl,
You love all your life.
You love all your life

Lately I've been writing desperate love songs.
I mostly sing them to the wall.
You could be the center piece of my obsession
If you would notice me,
Yeah, ooh yeah

Well I don't want the whole world, no
The sun, the moon and all their light.
I just wanna be the only girl,
You love all your life.
You love all your life

You love all your life, life, yeah.",All Your Life
The Band Perry,"If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh uh oh

Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when
She stands under my colours, oh and
Life ain't always what you think it oughta be, no
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life,
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young bury me in satin.
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life,
Well I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life,
Well I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh (uh oh)

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need 'em oh

The sharp knife of a short life,
Well I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls",If I Die Young
The Band Perry,"I remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, new boyfriend
He was as sweet as he could be
One look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me

Like a postcard from Paris
When I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond
Was from her old promise ring
Coming back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now I'm ruined
(I'm ruined)

In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me
I should've gone over, right over
I should've never let you leave
But it's the never knowing that keeps this going
And drives me crazy

Like a postcard from Paris
When I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond
Was from her old promise ring
Come back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around

Just when I thought things were alright
My eyes played tricks on my mind
Will I ever be satisfied
'Cause all I ever seem to find

Is a postcard from Paris
When I need the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond
Is from an old promise ring
Come back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did
The cruelest thing you ever did
The meanest thing you ever did is come around

I am ruined
I'm ruined
I am ruined, yeah
I am ruined, yeah",Postcard from Paris
The Band Perry,"I don't know what I was thinking,
You were no good but you could do some fancy talking
I know your tricks and delight for a Gumball Machine (no)
You can keep you cold of man 'cause you won't get nothing sweet out of me

I'm quitting, (quitting), quitting,(quitting), quitting, I'm quitting you
Like a girl wants her chocolate, yeah, I know that I'll miss you
But I'm quitting, (quitting), quitting, (quitting)
Quitting, I'm not kidding I'm kicking you,
'Cause you're my bad habit and I'm quitting you

I don't know what the heck you're thinking
It's gonna, gonna take a better man, I bet, to win my hand,
I'm not gonna play your game, I don't like the high stakes,
I'd rather sit alone at home that one more round of, Oh man

I'm quitting, (quitting), quitting,(quitting) quitting, I'm quitting you
Like a gambler leaving Vegas, boy, you know that I'll miss you
But I'm quitting, (quitting), quitting, (quitting)
Quitting, I'm not kidding I'm kicking you,
'Cause you're my bad habit and I'm quitting

Cold turkey, giving you the cold shoulder,
Off, like a band-aid, one quick sting, then it's over

I'm quitting, (quitting), quitting, (quitting)
Quitting, I'm not kidding I'm kicking you,
Cause you're my bad habit and good have it,
You're my bad habit and I'm quitting you, you, yeah",Quittin' You
