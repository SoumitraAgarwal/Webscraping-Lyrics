B.J. Thomas,"Wish I was the Superman
Stoppin' trains and makin' diamonds in my hands
A big reporter man
I'd write all the news today
And it would say
Up, up, baby and away

'Cause I got fire in my head
And my feet they wanna dance
But I ain't got a chance
If I'm gonna have to wait forever
Well it might as well be never
Don't have a chance, no
I said I don't have a chance

Well, well, it's the underdog
And every door leads right back to the fog
You know baby, I don't wanna win 'em all
I just wanna win this one, that's all

Hey, hey 'cause I've got a fire in my head
And my feet they wanna dance
But I ain't got a chance
If I'm gonna have to wait forever
Well it might as well be never
I don't have a chance, no
I said I don't have a chance
No, no I don't have a chance

No, no 'cause I've got a fire in my head
Am I gonna have to wait forever
Well it might as well be never
I don't have a chance, no
I don't have a chance",Superman
B.J. Thomas,"Everybody's goin' away
Said they're movin' to LA
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town

Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Find the sunshine, leave the rain
They said this town's a waste of time
I guess they're right, it's wastin' mine

Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues

Ya know my heart keeps tellin' me
""You're not a kid at thirty-three""
""Ya play around, ya lose your wife""
""Ya play too long, you lose your life""

I got my pills to ease the pain
Can't find a thing to ease the rain
I'd love to try and settle down
But everybody's leavin' town

Some gotta win, some gotta lose

Good time Charlie's got the blues

B.J. Thomas,"Met the girl that I want to get to know a little better
Tonight I'm gonna take her to the picture show
Gonna park in the darkest spot I know
I got a question
That I never asked anybody else before

Hey would you help me make it to my rockin' chair
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
No more

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go

I've been told about love for so long
Been left cold without love for so long
Told of disappointments all so wrong
And I can't see me
In tomorrow
Without you beside me

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
No more

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go

B.J. Thomas,"God bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me.
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Let it be me.
Each time we meet love
I find complete love.
Without your sweet love
What would life be?
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me.
Each time we meet love

B.J. Thomas,"The morning sun woke me
I felt the warmth of soft skin beneath my hand
Last night the devil got to me
And today I'm just a common man
So I'll get up and say goodbye
On my way home I'll make up the lie
That holds our lives together one more time

I'll be lyin' again
I'll be tryin' again
Hopin' I don't hurt you 
Like the last time
But you'll be cryin' again
You know I'm lyin' again
Telling you
This is the last time

I'll be lyin' again
I'll be tryin' again
Again",Lyin' Again
B.J. Thomas,"Yeah they say the blues
Are hard to forget
I wouldn't know I haven't been there yet
I'm happy
Got the sunshine above me

The rent note is spent
And bills to pay
And I don't know if I'll find a way
But I'm happy 
And we're happy together

Now I don't know much about tomorrow
I only know that I love you today
Hey hey hey

So I don't care
Rain or shine
Cause a cup of rain
Will taste like wine
If you're happy
And we're happy together
You and I

Yes I'm happy 
And we're happy together

Now it take much to make me happy
Most times a smile from you will do
As long as I know you'll keep on loving me
I know that I'll get by
That'll see me through

So warm me up
And keep me tied
If this is how it feels to be satisfied
Cause I'm happy
And we're happy together
You and I

Yes I'm happy
And we're happy together

Yes I'm happy
And we're happy together

B.J. Thomas,"I don't want to read the paper this morning
I don't want to hear no busy city sounds
There's so many things that's so much more important
And they're the only things worth thinkin' bout

Why don't go somewhere and love
It's been a long long time
Why don't we just go somewhere and love
And lock the world outside

Why don't we just lay down what we're doin'
We don't need a reason or a rhyme
Don't take the time to stop and think about it 
If we talk too much we might just change our mind 

So why don't we go somewhere and love
And leave it all behind
Why don't we just go somewhere and love
And stay a long long time

Why don't we go somewhere and love
And leave it all behind
Why don't we just go somewhere and love

B.J. Thomas,"It's lonely out tonight
And the feelin' just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song

Hey, wontcha play another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

So please play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry-why-why-why
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong
Cause I don't want to cry all alone

Hey, won't ya play another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

B.J. Thomas,"City boys singing country songs
And they tell you what they've seen
City boys singing country songs
But they don't know what they mean
How can a boy from Philly tell ya
How it feels it feels to be in the arms 
Of an Oklahoma girl
And how can a New Yorker born and raised
Taste the taste of the popcorn
In an Indiana drive-in movie

City boys wearing western blue jeans
Walking down the streets
Snap down shirt
And cowboy boots
Just a shining on their feet
What good will blue jeans do ya 
If you ain't gonna roll around 
In the Mississippi mud awhile
And how will the boots come in that handy
If the dandy don't wanna walk across an Iowa cornfield
On a Sunday morning

City boys singing country songs
And they tell you what they've seen
City boys singing country songs
But they don't know what they mean
Now how can a boy from Philly tell ya

B.J. Thomas,"I was all right 
For a while
I could smile for a while
And then I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello
As you wished me well
You couldn't tell that
That I'd been crying

I thought that I 
Was over you
But it's true oh so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darlin' what can I do 
For you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying 
Over you

Over you

Yes now you're gone
And from this moment on

Won't you give me an appointment
Been so long since I've had a check up
Can you squeeze me in today ?

Emergency situation
And I need you

Now I have come to seek the prophet, yeah

And tell him to come and take me by my hand

Can you forgive me for the way I've been living

B.J. Thomas,"Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me, it won't be long
'Till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me

'Cause I know this will never work out
But honey my loves grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt
This can never be
You keep saying it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I wanna hold on

When even a fool would let go 
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now is it wise holding you
When even a fool would let go

My love had no reason
Like the words to a song that don't rhyme
My loves' got no season
I just know that it's there all the time
Baby just you and me
I can believe that's wrong 
Thinkin' bout you and me
Makes me want to hold on

B.J. Thomas,"Here you come again,
just when I've begun to get myself together,
you waltz right in the door,
just like you've done before
and wrap my heart 'round your little finger.

Here you come again,
just when I'm about to make it work without you,
you look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
and pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.

All you gotta do is smile that smile
and there go all my defenses.
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
you're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses.
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to;
and shakin' me up so that all I really know
is here you come again and here I go.

You were mindin' your life 
And I was mindin' mine too
Lady when you looked my way
I had a strange sensation 
And darlin' that's when I knew

That it's sad to belong to someone else 
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else 
When the right one comes along

Oh I wake up in the night 
And I reach beside me hopin' you will be there 
But instead I find someone 
Who believed in me when I said I'd always care

Oh it's sad to belong to someone else 
When the right one comes along
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else 
When the right one comes along

So I lived my life in a dream world 
For the rest of my days 
Just you and me walkin' hand in hand 
In a wishful memory 
Oh I guess that's all that it would ever be

Wish I had a time machine I could 
Make myself go back until the day I was born
And I would live my life again 
And rearrange it so that I'd be yours from now on

Oh it's sad to belong to someone else 
When the right one comes along 
Yes it's sad to belong to someone else 
When the right one comes along

Then dad's hair was turnin' white

Mother's faith just growed strong.

Fell on this little boy.

Give back the innocence stolen from them.

And ever since lived by the golden rule

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay,
In fields where they lay tending their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

[Chorus]

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise Men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

[Chorus]

This star drew nigh to the northwest,
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

[Chorus]

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie,
One entered it them for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty.

[Chorus]

Then entered in those Wise Men three,
Full reverently upon the knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

[Chorus]

Between an ox stall and an ass,
This Child truly there He was,
For want of clothing they did Him lay
All in a manger, among the hay.

[Chorus]

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made Heaven and earth of naught,
And with His blood mankind hath bought.

If we in our time shall do well,
We shall be free from death and hell,
For God hath prepared for us all
A resting place in general.

B.J. Thomas,"Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior`s birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appear`d and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.",O Holy Night

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would last through the years
Through the trials
Through the smiles
Through the tears

Today is all we've planned
We say tomorrow we'll understand
If it all should end
We'd be alone again

Has been replaced

And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
Oh
This is my grown-up Christmas list

As children we believed
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely
Wrapped beneath our tree
But Heaven surely knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal
The hurting human soul

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start 
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
Oh
This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is this illusion called
The innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief
Can we ever find the truth

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start 
And time would heal the heart
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end

B.J. Thomas,"I've been lookin' at people
And how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seein' are people
Throwin' love away and losing their minds

Maybe it's me who's gone crazy
'Cause I can't understand why
All these lovers keep hurtin' each other
When love is so hard to come by

So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for?

I've been listenin' to people
And they say love is the key
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe

I see love-hungry people
Tryin' their best to survive
While in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even tryin' to keep it alive

So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever

B.J. Thomas,"I always heard about the great Atlantic
How it humbles you to stand upon it's shore
So I thought I'd take some time to go and see it
Since I had no ties upon me anymore
But I don't know what I'd wasted my time for

You call that an ocean?
To me it's just a pond that's almost dry
If you want to see an ocean
You should see the tears her leaving made me cry

So I headed west to see that famous canyon
That the Colorado cut so deep and wide
I thought seeing something lower down than I felt
Might cheer me up and ease my troubled mind
But I just got disappointed one more time

You call that a canyon?
It's nothing but a pothole in the yard
If you want to see a canyon
You should see the hole she left here in my heart

So now I stand here staring at the Rockies
I've heard they reach right up to heaven's door
They're like that little hole and that blue puddle
And I see now what I should have seen before
Without her life holds no wonders anymore

You call that a mountain?
It's just a little pile of rocks and dirt
If you want to see a mountain
You ought to try getting over her

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

He don't chase rainbows, he don't need good times, no.

That's my only chick, that's my only chick
If she's a good girl, won't let the homies hit
And if there came a day where I could not hold on to it
Then it would end my whole world like a polar shift
I'm talking 'bout your love

Your love, keeps lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before",Higher

It keeps rollin' and (uh-huh)
It'll take you anywhere, don't matter where your going yeah

So I just want to let you know that,
I'm about to let it blow
Ain't on that middle grade no,

It ain't gone be no pain
I'm about to let it go (let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go)
Goodbye (goodbye), I'll be gone for a while, I'm on cloud 9

I'll be gone for a while, I'll see you next time
I'll be gone for a while, I on cloud 9

B.o.B,"I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day, hell it might be Monday

I remember thinking man I need a decent ride
And I would have to ask my momma for the keys to drive
With my brother riding in an old Cutlass
Black and Mild lit, whole hoof busted
Well who knows maybe one day we'll have a little more
We'll finally shop somewhere else besides the corner store
My little sister say she gotta have a pair of Dior's
But right now they'll probably stop us before we hit the door
My Uncle say that's how it is where we come from
And if it weren't for bad luck, we wouldn't have none
Hard to tell the good days from the bad ones
If I could catch a shooting star then I would grab one
I'd grab one for real

I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day, hell it might be Monday

I remember feelin' trapped and no I couldn't get out
And when they laid my momma off no it just didn't amount
I still remember how she looked when she walked into the house
But still she tried her best to show what was Christmas about
And if we wanted hot water we had to microwave it
And everyday the power cut off but we tolerate it
The thoughts of all the beats I lost because I forgot to save 'em
I'm screaming at me in the mirror like ""I gotta make it!""
My teacher tryin' to get through to me because of my behavior
I said ""I got big dreams and I gotta chase 'em""
I never cared a damn thing about a college major
I only had one need, that was a lot of paper
But see I never had a thing but a lot of prayers
After school, open mic night, rockin' stages
It all started from a demo, to a limo
From a limo, to a Lambo
And all of this came up outta Decatur, 'cause

I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day, hell it might be Monday

I used to dream about these days and the things that I'd do
Had to get a new life, 'cause the old just won't do
I used to dream shades of grey, now the sky's shinin' blue
And everyday it feels like there's no way I can lose

'Cause I knew one day, I wouldn't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'mma get those keys to that new ride
I knew one day I'd be fine
And I knew one day I'd get mine
Yeah and I knew one day, and not just Monday, yeah",One Day

B.o.B,"Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Yeah, yeah I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
Cause after all the partying and smashing and crashing
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at the phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
So airplane airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and
I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Yeah yeah somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was trying to get a tip at subway
And back then I was rapping for the hell of it
But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant
I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hoping we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars

I'm eons and eons beyond these peon's
Another human like me there will never be one
The planet that I'm from, I can't even speak on
The stars is what I sleep on
The moon I put my feet on
The way my aura glow, you swear I'm made of neon
Cooler than the freon on, its in your dodge neon
They say the future is now, to me it hasn't begun
Stay tuned to me and their will never be a re-run
So come and leap on my body and as we come
You'll probably feel moist like the trees on the tropics
We gone we gone, we out it, no we don't need rockets
We hope up on the mother ship an we gone, we sliding
We slipping through dimensions, we hyper space gliding
Blasting through the atmosphere
Frightening in the lightening
I know I'm out my mind girl, but you know you like it
So hope up on my cosmic highway so we can ride it

Shorty are you going my way
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
(Ooh) let's go (Ooh) let's go
Shorty I cant take earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

Well, fresh up out the sky I'm like a meteorite
So when the studio, no I don't need to write
Man I just came up in the game cause y'all just needed more light
So, so by the time I'm done their ain't gonna be no more mics
And people ask me B.o.B what kind of language is that
Cause I may blast into the future, I may never come back
And I'm a leave with a thirty thousand a night yearly
Headed to a distant planet called B.o.B
And then I'm gone, man they not ignoring me
Taking off from half court Air Jordan'
All systems go in  ten seconds I'm orbiting
Hanging in the cosmos like a space ornament
Heat 'em up like a solar flare oh yes I bring the pain
Similar to asteroid that's headed to your brain
My lane is something that they really cannot explain
They try to hold me down but  man it's me that they cant contain

Shorty are you going my way
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
(Ooh) Let's go (ooh) let's go
Shorty I cant take earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

Come and go with me, I'll take you to my galaxy
I'm talking Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mars, Mars
And I'm saying girl, I'll ride all night
And I need you for this ship to take flight
Let's go, let's go
Come on baby let me take it off
Another second we gone blast it off

Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face

Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that 
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it, 
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
He slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that

Looked over and I see B.o.B. with this strange cigar
He's standing on top of Dunkin Donuts, it's like he own it
We at the corner of ""Give It To 'Em"" and ""They Don't Want It""
We out here somewhere and me in Europe, they out here yawning
My niggas threw out way too much jewelry, my chain lonely
But they don't know about black pearls, but I will show them
""Why the world sleeping on black girls?"" Hey I don't know, man

Blowing tiger stripe bubbles with ""Go To Hell"" bubblegum
When I was younger space shuttle got hung in front of everyone
And grandmum tells me to stay humble but do not un-der-stand
One of these mumbles will make 'em throw up they arms and hands
Now stumble and they will know I put on my pants

But everybody look at why we do it, it take us more time
Excuse me if I'm no exhibitionist
According to the internet
3000 got a big old dic-tionary full of words
He must know how to use 'em
It also says I play the violin and that ain't true but
You give me six strings and a pick
And I will make a guitar talk, why, I ain't gotta say shit
And I encourage any child to pick up some instrument
'Cause if you're mad at your dad or mum, you can grab it and strum

Growin' up in a house with no stove, no doors, no walls, no windows

I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go

Heroes and villains become harder to identify
Kindred spirits separated at birth
Fighting for their place in time to be solidified
The clock ticks faster and faster
While time runs a marathon in this Babylon
But see, the end is only the beginning
The beginning of the calm before the storm

I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate
It seems the bigger I get, it's the more they get mad at me
'Cause it ain't no rules inside this fight that we battlin'
And it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
But creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate, I guess
And I ain't too big on duality, but
You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me

So fly, no gravity
So high, Mount Everest
And the show must go on, yes
But I don't have to act in it

From a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve

And whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge
Fuck rules, fuck boss
You can be whatever you want
You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
In the springs, or the falls you could never see it all
If you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?
Man I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far
Now I be beast mode up on these bars
Freak out a beat and then beat it out raw
Good God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety
I won't need Viagra naw, even if I had a dog
I be the canine, I'd have a ball
Better watch out when you cross my yard
I am a flame, I am the spark
I am in drive, y'all are in park

Look at the crowd as soon as I start
Look in they eyes and look in they hearts

Thinking about my partners death
I'm angry, in a flash he was gone
Man how can that day not rearrange me
All of my days, they cloudy
All of my nights, they rowdy

B.o.B,"They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
Don't care about that
Let them take my words
It’s all I've got
They can have this fame
It ain't worth a lot
Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go

As she takes the stand
By the look in her eyes I can tell that she knows
That she’s holding the fate of my world in her hands
Damn, fo’ real
This was never the plan
It was never intended for her to end up the defendant
And I guess it just happened by chance
Damn, and you hope
You hopin’ that a miracle happens
You prayed that the judge doesn't bang that gavel
Just so you can go back and avoid a disaster
And you could still be holding her hand
Like the last note of the saddest song
Or like the last word at the end of the poem
You know, there's nothing worse than being alone
It’s funny how you never know what you got ‘til it’s gone

Who do you know in the world you would die for?
Who would lie for?
Who if they committed a crime you would stop on a dime and do time for
'Cause it was me she would ride for
And that was her that I cry for
Now I'd give it all away to get her back
'Cause she ain't free, no, just waiting July 4th
Yea, no, it don't sound logical
But there's some things in this life that you gotta do
Brother, one thing in this world that got to you
I'd let it all go but I ain't dropping you

They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
Don't care about that
Let them take my words

But there's no looking back and we won't sleep tonight
We're living while we're young and this is worth the fight

Talk is nothing, talk is cheap
Time is money, money is power
Power corrupts eventually, damn
So what are the options?
What are the choices left for me?
What other rule there's left to break
I guess my fate is a quest for me
Man I'm a dog that ain't got no leash
Man got a crib, it ain't got no lease
Man got a flow that ain't got no brain
But I still get brain, no hands no teeth
Nowadays, niggas are killas on the beat
But where I was raised all of the killas was down the street

Better do your research
Feeling like I fell out of the sky and landed feet first
My squad go hard, my squad go concrete, watch my team work
Hell yea, you can tell that the boy finna eat 'cause I took my seat first
3 course meal, full entrée, refills and I want my dessert
So why not make a toast? Tomorrow could always be worse
Now keep them bottles coming by the kiloliter
And get that Ana off your chest, try to keep a clean shirt
I’m so Grand Hustle, you ain’t even in my league sir
What’s up with these nerds?
They be out here, gettin’ their salads tossed, gettin’ their leaves turned
The game just ain’t what it used to be, the quality is blurred
But a dying breed survives and a dynasty emerged
So put it in the air if you entirely concur
She call me hippie 'cause I live without any concern
Up on this green earth, I’m on them green herbs
Yeah yeah, yeah, I stay in them trees like the Keeblers
And they say that I look higher in person
As a kid I played in the yard, but now I’m astro turfing
I lived the actual version of the fantasies they utter
Made up stories of threesomes, they must just be seeing double
Run for cover, here comes trouble
My heart has grown cold so I gotta sleep with warmer covers
Polar bear pimpin’, solar flare spittin’
Somebody tell ‘em that this is professional stuntin’, don’t attempt it
Society is twisted, they tryna take us under
So when you see them folks, don’t forget to warn a brother
I made it out alive but still the battle is a struggle
Veni, vidi, vici, I came, I saw, I conquered
They mad 'cause I murdered the game
And their name wasn’t in the will
You see, most of these haters are mad rappers who just still waiting on a deal
And they jealous of my success 'cause my shoes cost more than a bill
But I’ll never sit down at another table unless I’m invited to the meal
To some it’s like conquering mountains, to me it’s like stepping on hills
Remember the images in your mirror can be bigger than they appear
And the truth can be hard to swallow, depends on the size of the pill
And by the looks it’s about the time that you had your prescription filled

There are no intermissions, no time for commercial breaking
A fighter in his prime, a legend in the making
There’s no debating when you let your numbers make the statement

Could have been fatal
Must have had an angel

Why am I here in the same club with my back to the wall?

The world can be ruthless, foolish and blind
Abracadabra, illusion and lies
Fed food to consume and influence the mind
Sacrificial executions disguised as
Shootings and crimes, the news televises
Who pulls the strings? Who has the dots?
Asking these questions I lose track of time
So I ask, how human am I?

Nobody told me you can lose when you win
And if they did, I'd still be missing

I ran away from home just to try to make a million
Yea, just to try to make a million
And when you get a million it's a different type of feeling
When you look around and what you really need is missing
It's like, it's like suffering from a sickness
Can't find a doctor to fill out the prescription
Or diagnose the illness
Can't leave it in the book, can't buy from the dealer

And I find it ironic
Yeah, I find it ironic
How I can buy anything that I ever wanted
But I really had it all when I ain't have nothing
They always say that mo money, mo problems
I guess I, I guess I should've listened to the warning
I guess I, I guess I should anticipate the stormy weather
I guess I'd illustrate a different story,
However, well if it's clever
I couldn't find the words to say it better
I'm knee-deep within these endeavors
But all that glitters with gold is not treasure
I'm ready for whatever, I never let up
I work even better when I'm under pressure
They say money don't make you rich
'Cause you can't buy shit that can make you better, word

Nobody told me money don't make you rich
And if it did, I'm missing something
Nobody told me you can lose when you win
And if they did, I'll still be missing

I guess I bit off more than I could chew
And nobody told me, nobody told me
Had it all and never knew
'Cause nobody told me",Nobody Told Me

Ain't no democrat, and by far I'm no republican
This the type of talk that'll probably piss off my publicist
And I ain't even started, the water ain't even bubbling
The type of talk that'll probably get me in trouble with the law
Or make the government come after me in public
Won't hear this on the radio, this here ain't for publishing
This ain’t that bubble gum shit, no, this ain’t that double mint
Consider this a risk, I swear I see 'em building pyramids brick by brick
They'll aim at anyone bold enough to go against the shit
You don't believe me? Look what happened to the Dixie Chicks
It's like nobody else complains
Till you tryna be more than a nigga with a chain
Cube already told you, they corrupted everything
And we these out here just tryna function, tryna maintain

And of course it's unfortunate that niggas out here robbing for Jordan's
Can we not afford them but got enough to get a Glock 40
Is our views on reality kinda distorted
But still, even though I understand the story
I still fall weak for a booty that's proportionate
On a sexy short bitch, so what's the score?
Chilling with some Regs dog, drinking white man's poison
Ah, now that's a forfeit
Selling what's for free, that's extortion
But still I'm wondering what family was present when history was recorded

A 100 thousand miles an hour runnin' when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
I pray in heaven ain’t no fuck niggas ain’t allowed

You think you really know what's going on?
They passing laws where they can run up in your own home
Cameras on your laptop, TV and your iPhone
The battery don't come out, that means it's always on
Smile and say cheese, yeah niggas got you
I told you fuckers three years ago 'bout the watchers
If you won't take the microchip then you can't make no dollars
This ain't no lovely day for a neighbor, ain't no Mr Rodgers
Don't let these fuckers rob us for our freedom and your rights
And you be like: ""it's on the news so it must be right""
Who's pulling the strings? Who's rolling the dice?
Who's calling the shots and who's starting the fight? Think twice

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow
B.Q.E.,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again

B.S.H. (Bass Sultan Hengzt),"Du kommst wieder mal zu spät, frag mich ganze Zeit, was machst du nur
Arbeiten ist schön und gut, aber nicht rund um die Uhr
Schau dich an, du guckst weg, haust ab in das Badezimmer
Denke mir alles cool, doch es wird mit dir immer schlimmer
Kennst du mich noch, ja genau ich bin dein Freund
Dieser Junge der dich nicht enttäuscht
Man wie ich dir das sage, ich weiss du bist nicht dumm, du kapierst und ich hoffe, dass kein Schiess passiert
Gib mir doch ein Kuss bevor du gehst, du hängsst wieder mal am Telefon
Mir kommt es vor, als ob ich hier in unserem Haus alleine wohn
Doch ich merk, dass du dich seltsam benimmst und das irgendetwas nicht mit dir stimmt

Du bist viel zu gut, um mir irgendetwas anzutun
Doch ich hab gehört dich hat jemand fremdes angerufen
Diese Stimme klang nach einem Mann, ich bin mir ganz sicher
Du bist dir ganz sicher, guck wie meine Hand zittert
Doch du redest nicht, wenn man dich drauf anspricht
Was ist dein Problem Mädel, komm sag´s mir in mein Gesicht
Ich hoffe nicht, dass du mich anlügst
Doch ich glaube, dass du mich betrügst
Warum bist du dann so wie du bist und distanzierst dich von mir
Du bist nicht die die du mal warst und sowas passt nicht zu dir
Sag mir, was ist passiert, wer ist dieser Mann
Wer ist dieser Typ, der denkt, dass er mit dir reden kann

Und jetzt sitzen wir hier beide und du sagst mir nun was sache ist
Es gibt da so ein Mann und ich denke mir wie krass du bist
Wie konntest du, wer ist dieser Typ der dich bängt
Und du sagst, hör mir zu, es ist nicht so wie du denkst
Dieser Mann kriegt dafür Geld, dass er dich verfolgt
Schon seit zwei Wochen, nach der ersten Woche hatte er Erfolg
Ah, versteh du lässt mich ausspionieren
Ich sag, hau die Fakten auf den Tisch, denk was kann mir schon passieren
Du zeigst mir ein Foto, da bin ich zu sehen
Arm in Arm mit einer fremden Frau an einem Badesee
Ich kann mein Augen nicht trauen
Und du sagst, und deswegen kann ich dir nicht in die Augen schauen

Ich hab' mein Album fertig bekommen
So mit Herzblut und ehrlichen Songs
Mit Ach und Krach das hier geschafft
Ganze vier Jahre gebraucht, das es passt

Ich hab' gesehen, wie sich die ganze Welt verpisst
Und danke meiner Anwältin für nichts
Hab' mir den Arsch aufgerissen,
Die Decke fiel mir auf den Kopf
Kauf' dir den Scheiß man , ich rappe nicht umsonst!

Ich hoffe es rentiert sich
Das nächste Album dann mit vierzig
Deshalb brauch ich ganz viel Kohle die ich von euch hole

Dann kommt wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Von mir und ich denk' ich kann's mir leisten
Wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Und ich fühl' mich wie der Geilste.
Wieder vier Jahre nichts hören
Würde mich gar nicht so stören
Ich verprass' die Kohle frei von Sinnen
Und komm' zurück, wenn ich dann Pleite bin.

Yeah, wünsch' mir Geld und Glück
Und wenn ich Gold geh, komm ich nich' so schnell zurück,
Dann kenn' ich keinen der Jungs mehr
Dann hab' ich einen der mich rumfährt
Amina Millionär
Schieb' den übelsten Starfilm
Geh' in den Club, sag dem DJ dass ich da bin
Spiel' mein Song und 'ne Flasche auf's Haus
Und wenn ich keine kriege, dika raste ick aus
Verlass' meine Frau
Denn hab jetzt mies Erfolg
Und bumse noch mit Frida Gold
Zieh' mein Geld durch die Nase, mir egal was ihr wollt

Jetzt hört ihr wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Von mir und ich denk' ich kann's mir leisten
Wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Und ich fühl' mich wie der Geilste
Wieder vier Jahre nichts hören
Würde mich gar nicht so stören
Ich verprass' die Kohle frei von Sinnen
Und komm' zurück, wenn ich dann Pleite bin

Und nach vier Jahren bin ich wieder abgebrannt
Hab nix Bares und 'n Minus vor dem Kontostand
Dann komm ich wieder an bei meiner Frau
Steh mit Koffern vor der Tür doch ein Anderer macht auf
Shit, muss wieder mal ein Diss aufnehmen
Weil mein Name im Club nicht mehr auf der Liste steht
Nur noch 'n Bus oder billigen Wagen
So'n Scheiß, nicht mal Frida Gold will mir ein blasen, es ist
Höchste Zeit, mein Album muss kommen, weil ich
'Ne Abmahnung von Aldo bekomm' bevor ich
Alles verlier' und alles weg ist, na dann rapp' ich

Wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Von mir und ich denk' ich kann's mir leisten
Wieder vier Jahre nichts mehr
Und ich fühl' mich wie der Geilste
Wieder vier Jahre nichts hören
Würde mich gar nicht so stören
Ich verprass' die Kohle frei von Sinnen
Und komm' zurück, wenn ich dann Pleite bin

Wieder Vier Jahre nicht mehr

B.S.H. (Bass Sultan Hengzt),"Okay, wo fangen wir an?
Schon mit der Schule hab ich's mies verkackt
Nichts probiert und nicht studiert
Bisher hab ich's einfach noch zu nichts gebracht
Und Schulden hab' ich tonnenweise
Wie konnte das passieren?
Ich könnte mit meinen Rechnungen Wände tapezieren
Was soll die Scheiße?
Alles hab' ich abbekommen
Alles, das was schlecht ist
Alles haben sie mitgenommen
Was nicht niet- und nagelfest ist
Jeden Tag der selbe Kack, nichts zu tun
Steh' spät auf und gucke Talkshows im TV und reg' mich auf
Und will da ehrlich zu dir sein
Mein Studio ist eher rustikal
Und die Breitling um meinen Arm ist nur ein Dublikat
Schon im Kindergarten musst' ich mit mir selber spielen
Und die Hälfte meiner Freunde bei Facebook sind nur Fakeprofile
Leider ist mein Marktwert bei den Frauen auch sehr gesunken
Mit denen ich dann noch was hatte, die waren eher betrunken
Nein ich will dich nicht belügen
Nein ich kann dir nicht viel bieten
Außer einer klitzekleinen Sache

Ich werd' dich so lieben wie kein anderer Mann seit Anbeginn der Zeit
Doch wenn du gehst gehört mein Herz dir

Okay, du weißt Bescheid
Manchmal kommt viel scheiße raus, wenn ich was sage
Man muss mir die Sachen so erklären als wär ich noch fünf Jahre
Und kann auch nicht gut mit Geld umgehen
Bei mir ist nichts mit Pfennig drehen
Doch kann ganz laut im Kino ständig an mein Handy gehen
Ja, ich kann schon peinlich sein, und taktlos allemal
Kann schon passieren, dass ich zum Polizisten sage „Arschloch, alles klar“
Ich bin nur am Rauchen, trinke viel zu viel
Bin schnell abgelenkt, wenn die Leute mit mir diskutieren
Und man, glaub mir, es schmeckt nicht, wenn ich dir was koch'
Doch habe wenigstens die Nummer von dem Pizzamann im Kopf
Ich mache immer einen auf krass
Und bin einer von den Coolen
Doch ist einer stärker, kack ich ab und ruf' die Bullen
Falls wir etwas trinken gehen
Kommen von mir nur blöde Ausreden
Wie ""Ich hab mein Portmonnaie verloren, du musst mir auslegen""
Nein ich will dich nicht belügen
Nein ich kann dir nicht viel bieten
Außer einer klitzekleinen Sache

Ich werd' dich so lieben wie kein anderer Mann seit Anbeginn der Zeit

Irgendwann wird er ihr sagen „Hau mal ab, ich hab keinen Bock“
Weil er sie geknallt hat
Dann ist sie furchtbar enttäuscht und wieder einsam
Ihm ist es egal, denn sowas ist für ihn nur Alltag
Sie wird krass verarscht
Ist die rosarote Brille, die sie trägt, aus Panzerglas? (Kann sein)

An Tagen wie diesen hass ich den Mist
Ganz blass im Gesicht (Ob es dir passt oder nicht)
Auswege gibt es nich'
Bald nehme ich den Strick
Wenns so weiter geht, dann fickt es mich
(Beruhigt hab ich mich jetzt nicht)
(Wiedermal hunderttausend Hände schütteln
Die Füße und die Achseln längst am müffeln
Essen gehen, Nasi-Goreng, Trüffel
(Und es wird sich hier nichts dran rütteln)
Alles still und ich häng dran
Wie kann ich mich entspann'
Alle laufen, ich renn dann
(Es wird sich hier nichts ändern)

B.S.H. (Bass Sultan Hengzt),"Wir sind zusamm'n gekomm'n, da war'n wa grade siebzehn
Man sah uns beide jeden Abend durch den Kiez gehen
Und schon da sagtest du, du suchst nach einem der dich reich macht
Und du bist gegangen, weil ich's einfach nich' gepeilt hab
Du hast mich oft nach meim' Masterplan gefragt
Genau so oft hab ich dir gesagt, dass ich keinen habe
Ins erste Studio hab ich investiert, tausend Mark
Jenny ich mach Mukke jetzt, Jenny hat mich ausgelacht
Drauf gekackt, ich mach es klar und werde Rap-Star
Ich wollte dir beweisen, dass du damals nich' im Recht warst
Und ich habe auf die Schule geschissen
Statt im Unterricht wollte ich im Studio sitzen
In mein Reim-Buch reinschreiben
Ich dachte, irgendwann wirst du dich wieder bei mir einschleimen Jenny
Zwölf Jahre is' das her
Und was ich dir jetzt sagen werde fällt mir wirklich schwer, doch ich sag's Jenny

Du hast immer gesagt
Dass nix aus mir wird und du hattest Recht, Jennifer
Ich bin immer noch broke
Die gleiche Wohnung und das gleiche Bett, Jennifer
Ich leb in den Tag
Hab nix gelernt und hab kein' Cent auf Tash, Jennifer
Jennifer ey
Und ich geb es gerne zu Jenny, Jenny du hattest Recht
Jennifer, Jennifer (yeah)
Jenny du hattest Recht

Mein erster Auftritt beim Sommer-Fest, nix reimt sich
Ich hab von A bis Z verkackt, ich war dir echt peinlich
Ich wollt ein Star sein, Haufen Geld haben und Videos dreh'n
Doch hatte nich' mal Geld um mit dir ins Kino zugehen
Auf dem Pausenhof mit den Jungs freestylen
Paar Lines war'n cool, Jenny konnt' es nie leiden
In dein' Augen gab's kein Ziel für mich
Ich musste immer wieder verstehen, denn sie fühlt es nich'
Du hast mir pausenlos die Wahrheit auf die Nase gebunden
Und deine Ignoranz is' auch nich' mit den Jahren verschwunden Jenny
Denn heut hast du 'n Mann der 'n guten Job hat
Einen der was auf der Tasche und auch was im Kopf hat
Und ich wohn jetzt wieder bei mein' Eltern
Es hat nich' ganz gelappt, so wie ich mir das vorgestellt hab
Jenny, zwölf Jahre alles gleich
Und was ich dir jetzt sagen werde fällt mir echt nicht leicht, doch ich sag es Jenny

Du hast immer gesagt

Jennifer, Jennifer (yeah, Jenny)
Jenny du hattest Recht

Ich weiß, du hast mir oft genug gesagt
Doch Jenny ich kann nix dafür
Auch meine Eltern haben's satt
Und setzen mich bald vor die Tür
Millionen Stars am Firmament
Und ich bleib der den keiner kennt
Ich hab wohl wirklich kein Talent
Ich hab es in den Sand gesetzt

Lass mich noch ein Mal um die Erde kreisen
Bevor ich wieder komm noch ein Mal nach den Sternen greifen
Denn wenn ich meine Augen schließe könnt ich glauben ich könnt fliegen
Denn ich habs auch Mal verdient dass ich ne Pause kriege
Ich fand alles außer Liebe nur paar echte Freunde blieben
Und Familie hab für falsche Freunde unterschrieben
Kack auf jeden, ich sehne mich nach leben
Deshalb bin ich wie ich bin und rede nicht mit jedem

Und hier oben kann ich Kind bleiben
Kann sagen was ich will und es hinschreiben
Nach Lust und Laune alles hinschmeißen immer dann
Wenn ich nicht weiter weiß verpiss ich mich ins Nimmerland
Und wenn ich meine Augen schließe könnt ich glauben ich könnt fliegen
Ansonsten würd ich alle übern Haufen schießen
Denn die scheiße steht mir bis zum Hals
Gönn meiner Wenigkeit n bisschen Zeit für n bisschen halt
Ich schmeiß den Wecker an die Wand, er setzt mich unter Druck
Und verrät jedes Mal mein Unterschlupf

Bin ich nicht mehr ganz so am Arsch

Ich war der, der in Garagen Tapes eingepackt hat
Du der 31er, bei GEMA gemacht hat
Letztens verkauftes du am Bahnhof dein Arschloch
Heute machste im Internet auf Pablo von Narcos
Von Daggio Romanzo zu WhoShotYa?
Du kamst von Gangsterrap zu 'nem Schuhplattler
Fick auf's Splash, Boy, ich lasse die Ratten unter sich
Ich war öfter auf dem Index als im Matheunterricht

Gang-Gang-Gang-G-G-Gang-Gangbang
Ich bin zurück, Battleking Sultan Hengzt
Südberlin Heroin, es ist wieder Zahltag
Ich kann nichts dafür, dass deine Mutter es anal mag
Was-W-Was-Was-Was los?
Mach immer noch den Schulhof zum Schlachthof
Südberlin Kokain, es ist wieder Drive-by
Ich fick deine Mutter und dein Vater gibt mir High Five

Heut ist Bingoabend und ich fahr deine Mutti
Scheiß auf Prada und Gucci, ich trag Carlo Colucci
BMW, TMR, Berlin bleibt hart
Weil ich immer noch die Basy auf dein Schienbein schlag
Ich hab damals unterm Tisch in der Schule onaniert
Laut der Prüfstelle hab ich eure Jugend ruiniert
Wurd als Kind wie bei Marvel einer Strahlung ausgesetzt
Neben mir lag direkt ein Viagra Monatspack, yoah
Deine Ma gibt mir ein sexy Kuss
Ihre Muschi reicht zum Wenden eines Flexibus
Mein Rap ist Kunst und ich parshippe jetzt
Frag deine Ex, warum ich nur vom Arschficken rapp'
Es ist Bass Sultan Hengzt, Totgesagte leben Länger
Der letzte Typ mit Eiern, in 'nem Land voll Ehrenmännern
Der Index will dass ich wie ein Kind rapp'

Und den Hatern wird gekloppt, mit dem Penis auf den Kopf
Es gibt kein Battle, geh und such dir einen Job
Ich vergebe hier am Block wie 'ne Nähmaschine Stoff
Ich bin funny Mister Hengzt, deine Mami wird geprankt
Ich hab Gang-G-G-Gang-G-Gang-Gangmoney auf der Bank
Heute Abend box ich ein paar Kinder auf dem Abiball
Danach geht ihr bei den Bullen singen wie 'ne Nachtigall
Deutschrap macht Fitness, um bei Facebook zu posten
Und geben freie Rimjobs an jeden Franzosen
Amstaff anlein', Gangsters am Wein'
Ich und Gina-Lisa gründen einen Gangbang-Verein
Zuchthengst, ich bin eher so der Suchtmensch

Hast jetzt auch nen Channel und machst Comedy und Witze
Aber deine Mutter gurgelt diesen Song mit meiner Wichse
Berlin bleibt hart, solange wie ich lebe
Ich drück Female MC’s meine Schlange in die Kehle
Randale auf der Fete, ich mach Stress im Friedenschor
Die Nutte bläst mir das Rohr, sie denkt ich stell ihr Sido vor
Fick auf Mainstream, ich bin und bleibe Gossenrapper
Komme aus dem Untergrund und baller auf Risottofresser
Was los Junge? Mach ma nich auf Flava Flav
FourMusic hat nen eignen Wagen auf der Gayparade
Deine Frau trägt Sandalen und fickt für ne Milchschnitte
Während ich wie Schwesta Ewa Fans auf den Strich schicke

Ich weiß warum du Hurensohn an Fasching als ein Bastard kommst
Alle diese Wörter gehören bei mir noch zum Fachjargon
Komm mit vierzig Kinneks und misch deine Tour auf
Denn ich bleib der Grund, warum Rap kein Abitur brauch
Und das heißt, jetzt weiß jeder Hundesohn bescheid
Ficke jeden von den Orsons, bis das Jungfernhäutchen reißt
Ich lade Pimmelpics auf den Goethe-Institut Server
Lasse meine Aggressionen an Schwachen aus wie Wutbürger
Die Katzenberger steht nun mal auf große Schwänze
Zu viele Kinneks hier, ich forder eine Obergrenze
Auf Instagram machst du einen auf Latina
Doch in deinem Dorf kennt man dich als Drei-Loch-Martina
Ich muss nicht wie die Rapper über Stolz reden, nein
Will doch nur Berlins nächster Rolf Eden sein

Du bist gut situiert, wenn du Pute dinierst
Ich bin zu tätowiert, der dich Hure frittiert
98 fing es an, ich hab Rapper gefickt
Jetzt ist 2017 und ich änder mich nicht
Ich bange die Bitch, heute gibt es Würstchen im Schlafrock
Micaela Schäfer hat ein würziges Arschloch (würd ich lecken!)
Danach gönn ich mir nen Jägermeister
Überrede Weiber mit nur einem Satz wie Jedi Meister
Die Antilopen Gang macht einen auf Herzensmensch
Lasst euch doch von Schwulen ficken, bis euch die Poperze brennt
Rapper drehen Filme, ein wenig was zum mitverdienen
Mit gleichen Zuschauerzahlen wie Zehlendorfer Wichskabinen
Ich bin auf Ritalin, klau MILFs ihre Handtaschen
Werfe mit paar Pfandflaschen, kack dir in den Sandkasten

Got me wondering to myself how could this be
They way we touched was more than a fantasy
Just knew that what we had was more reality

My wifey is who I thought you'd be
Maybe one day raise a see H I L D
Broke my heart when you didn't wanna be with me
And all this time I was a fool in L O V E

Beautiful, baby that was you and I
Now everyday I got to sit and wonder why
The way we kissed, got a feeling deep inside
What I'm hearing girl, it has to be a lie

How could you, just keep me to the side?
You never even gave this thing a T are why
Don't understand these feelin's you try to hide
Now all the sudden you been actin' F you N N why

How could you do this to me?
You led me to believe you wanted me
Now I can't change how I feel inside

And no one has my back like you do.
Girl you're one of a kind and you blow my mind.
And I'm glad to say you're mine.
Girl you're the one that changed me from a boy into a man.

[Chorus]

It took a while for me to see how special you treated me.
Maybe that's the reason why I love you.
You're my heart girl.
And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here girl.
No one else can make me feel like you do.
You've shared my world.
Baby that's the reason why I love you.

Maybe that's the reason why I love you.
You're my heart girl.
And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here girl.
No one else can make me feel like you do.
You've shared my world.
Baby that's the reason why I love you.

Until I caught her in the act
Down right gettin' it on
How could I not see
That eventually she would break my heart
Where did it all start
It started with a little bitty kiss

Mistook that kiss for kindness
How could I be so blinded
Should've ran instead I
Made it easy 
But I won't let my heart get hurt

Was taught to me by one kiss

And bring the ghetto out of me, huh

But I'm feelin' you 
But not the things you do
I'd rather set you straight
Then smack you in you're face

This is not you're ex-relationship
'Cause all I gotta say

[Chorus]
Girl you just don't realize
You gotta figure out 
I'm not like the other guy
Because I wear saggy jeans
Tim boots and don't lie
Like the rest do
you gotta figure out 
I'm not like the other guy
Not like the other guy

There's no reason for
All these crazy confrontations, huh
Let's set the record straight
You're the only one for me, huh

Mature at heart I am
Please just understand, o.k huh look
First I gave you up
Then I played the role
Then I fell in love with you girl

[Chorus]

Heartfelt unselfish love
All thoughts revolve around you

Uh I mean I just 
I don't understand
I mean I know what you had
And wut you've been through
But I'm here and I'm different

B2K,"Yo, why y'all had to bring this up man
I Mean it ain't
Like I forgot but
It's like I wasn't thinking about it man
Now that you
Want to talk about it
Got me all watery in the eyes ya know
But uh 
Its all good 
I wanna tell y'all three man 
I love y'all like y'all love me
But if y'all know what I am talking about 
Fizz holler at ya' boy


For the first three yrs
We was on coat fax
No deals no money
But everybody had our back
We know it would happen and that's for a fact
Until then we were just watching Cosbys in the laundry mat
Scrounging up change for a pizza guy
No ride to Roscoe's
We made our own sunrise
Getting sick off cheetos
Skittles and benekos
Mark yelling cause we eat his last tacito

Wishing for a bank account with at least to zeros
Playing ball all day
Sharing one Gatorade
No dogs of our own
So we walked Bear and Jane
Playing B-B bridges
Hopping over gates
Just to go swimming
Yeah we was bad
Trying to holler at all the women, huh
Man
Times where hard
You know we didn't get to much
But we always had each other man that was enough

[Chorus: x2]
We been through thick and thin
But we still here
No matter what goes down
Were still friends til the end
Ups and downs
Yeah that's a hard-knock life
Yeah its ride or die
Cause we are boys for life
Ya heard

It's getting hard now
What are we to do now
Years are passing
Its time to make moves now
We got our act together
Faced the bad weather
Told ourselves it was either now or never
So we grabbed our stuff and
Started shopping at labels
Perform demos and did whatever it takes
Damn every label slammed the door in our face
But we kept our heads up until we found the right place

[Chorus: x2]
We been through thick and thin
But we still here
No matter what goes down
Were still friends til the end
Ups and downs
Yeah that's a hard-knock life
Yeah its ride or die
Cause we are boys for life
Ya heard

We found a home now
It's on 
We in the game now
Chris and Max done made this thing crack now
Now we work with Tommy and Polly with Dee Mack now
Took us a while but we got a name now
A platinum album with dough up in the bank now
No more lounging around, we businessmen now
Epic helped us and put us in the right gear
Video and radio thanks for the great year
I'm glad the time that it took was a struggle
So that when this time came we would be grateful and humble
We thank God for making all this happen for us
We thank all our fans for having love in us
Come on

[Chorus: x2]
We been through thick and thin
But we still here
No matter what goes down
Were still friends til the end

Yo but we ain't gotta worry about
That no more
I mean we here now
All y'all who slammed the doors 
In our face, said we wasn't goin' to make it
We couldn't sing, we couldn't

Do this, we couldn't sell records, 
We couldn't have our hits on the radio
This one for y'all I mean we ain't mad
I'm sorry we couldn't be friends
Have a relationship, but we home now

I like to vacate down in Bermuda
Sip my coleurs while I'm headed down to Hooters

The chickens wanna tutor
Girls wanna fight and
Throwing ice from the cooler

Same shit she said about me
She said about Gutta
But if it wasn't for this rap shit
I never would have knew her

Now that our family's here

Friends who are dear with us

It's time to trim the tree

We light the fire

It's Christmas Eve

Welcome to the table for some holiday fare

As we join our hands

In Christmas prayer



[Chorus]

I'm so glad the season is finally here

Our house is nice& full like it was last year

Nothing feels better than Christmas cheer

When everyone's home for Christmas Eve



[Verse 2]

Outside snow fills the air

Colorful lights

Are seen everywhere

Sleigh bells

I heard through the night 

Little ones know 

Santa's coming tonight

Christmas trees

Carolers sing our favorite songs

So,let's grab our coats and sing along

Come on,come on,come on



[Chorus]



Christmas trees

Carolers sing our favorite songs

So,let's grab our coats and sing along

Come on

Yeah I'm by myself

It's getting late

Everyone's starting to leave

Man I wish Christmas would never end 

I love y'all

Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh
Over the hills we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-rails ring
Making spirits bright
Oh what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight!

[Chorus]

Now the ground is white 
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack you'll take the lead

Rollin' down the street
Doing donuts in a CLK
While the homies in the back

Santa will be coming to my town
And it will be his first time

My first Christmas time
It's so beautiful, so special to me
All my family gifts under my tree

The birds will sing, oh what a joy it will bring
Never thought I'd see the day
That Santa will bring Christmas my way

Trying to see what my mom and dad got for me

TV's on the back with DVD's

Can you guys tell met he story about Rudolph

Its red

Had a very shiny nose (like a ruby)
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows 
(like a light bulb,like some high beams)

Used to laugh and call him names (names)
They never let poor Rudolph 
Join in any reindeer games
 
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Hold five to six hoes
Causin frenzies round the globe
And my belly stay froze, 'cause my chain hang low
Now I'm gettin paid, every single day
Wit my niggas, my niggas Chris and J
Now its best you move out my way
'cause why'all been havin bad days ever since I took place
Who's with fast names
Casin um wit a race
Don't try to spit dog
If you can't make a hit
Don't try to make her shake
If she don't move like a snake
Throw it on her like a Cham-pien
Bouncin like a tramp-line

I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you

Shorty, it was only one mistake
Can you forgive me? No
You and me, we got a special thing
I can't let you go, no

You know I'll take care of you
Give you anything, be the man you want me to be
You're everything, you know I love you

Lemme show you, I know I was wrong
Then you shoulda kept a smile on my face

Baaba Maal,"The agouyadji is sounding
Able bodied men rise up
In today's world, honor is becoming rare
So let us examine our consciences
And seek to refine our race

Our language is not the least important factor
In our dignity
So let us learn it and let us teach it
That will pay off

From here to the Fouta, Poular is spoken
From Somalia to Mali
From Benin to Guinea
From Cameroon to Gambia
From Egypt to Ethiopia, they speak Poular

If all these people came together
They'd know we have the same mother
Whatever the difference in our dialect
We have the same father

I called Coumba and Coumba replied
I called Samba, Samba replied likewise
I used to believe those of us who speak Pulaar
Were inferior, but I realized I was wrong
Let us be united

From whichever part of the country we come
We are all Senegalese
If you go to Casmance, they speak Diola
Go to Cap Verde, and you'll hear Lebou
In St Louis, the dialect is Wolof
At Sine, it is Serer

If you address the Senegalese, the Mandinkas will reply
Or the Bassaris, or the Halpoulars
The Kassounkes, the Manjacks or the Gnominkes
Sayang, Sayang, Ibrahima Malick

Malick Barou Sall, you are a good friend
Sayang Sissokho who comes from Mali
Ibrahima Kalilloulaye
Yangkou Ba, my friend from the Gambia

Malick Pathe Sow, father of Pathe Sow
My friend from Senegal
Baaba Baidy, Baaba Debbo from the Fouta
Wherever we come from
We are all Senegalese

Ah, it is late my dearest Mariama Dianke
It is very late Mariama Soda, Mama
Marie don't be cross with me
Dearest one, be careful not to cross me

Peace is all I want
Don't ever take my love for granted
I would never give you my love and then withdraw it
If we break that trust our enemies will laugh at us

For me all I want is peace
Let us be of one mother
Let us have one father
Let us work together
So that our country may prosper

Mama
Ah my son, Oumar Malle
My friend, my little babe
Oumar yoo, Oumar
Don't lose your temper with me
Oumar, Oumar Barou
Don't be angry with me

",Agouyadji
Baaba Maal,"If God could turn me into a pigeon
A golden pigeon or a turtle dove
I could fly to my homeland
At Douwayra

Back home where my folks are
If God could give me everything I wish for
Long life, happiness and prosperity
Then I would live always beside

Those who are dear to me
My parents and my friends
While I was in France
Learning more about art and life

One terrible phone call
Summoned me home where I found
My mother was already dead and buried
Orphan, orphan, orphan

Mama, mama, mama, my darling mother
Papa, papa, papa, my dear father
Oh Mother most kind
Oh Father full of pity

What sadness when they go
How sacred is the family
Mama, Mama, Mama Aissata
Samba Boubou Yacine Wade

Mother of Fatou, mother of Mama
Mother of Laye Malle and of Chillo
Of Ndeye Khar and of Ndeye Gaye

Of Hameth Malle and Baaba Baidy Baaba Debbo

Ah Aissata Samba Boubou Yacine, ah mama

Baaba Maal,"I'm gonna love you
Like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as mountain
And deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't even bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true
If you let me, ooh

You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
Now won't that be fine?

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

Come rain or come shine
High as mountain
And deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

Well, I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
Yeah, but don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true
If you let me, if you let me

Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
Now won't that be fine?

Now days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always, yeah honey
I'm with you always

I am with you always
I'm with you, baby
Rain or shine

And just when I thought time had set me free,
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me.
Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew,
Though each and ev'ry part of me has tried,
Only you can fill that space inside,
So there's no sense pretending, my heart is not mending,

Just when I thought I was over you,
And just when I thought I could stand on my own,
Oh, baby those mem'ries come crashing through,
And I just can't go on without you.

On my own, I've tried to make the best of it alone.
I've done ev'rything I can to ease the pain.
But only you can stop the rain.
I just can't live without you, I miss ev'rything about you.

Just when I thought I was over you,
And just when I thought I could stand on my own,
Oh, baby those mem'ries come crashing through,

Without you.
Without you.

Baba Saad,"Unterm Strich gibt es auf dieser Welt nur 2 Arten von Menschen, 
Du hast die Schwätzer und die Macher. 
Die meisten sind Bloßschwätzer, die können nix als labern. 
Aber wenn alles gesagt ist, 
Dann sind es die Macher die diese Welt verändern 
Und wenn sie das tun verändern sie auch uns weswegen wir sie nie vergessen. 
Zu welchen gehörst du ? 
Schwätzt du nur rum oder stehst du auf und tust was. 
Denn eins kannst du mir glauben, alles andere ist gequirlte Scheiße.

Halt deine Füße still ich bin zurück, 
Jetzt wird gefickt junge sdoppela neues Album neues Glück, 
Setz die Messlatte hoch, 
Rap die ganz krassen Flows bin in Topform 
Ihr bringt nur noch Pfandflaschen raus Baba Saad 
Ich bin weder feind noch bin ich dein Kamera, 
Mikrofon Massaker mit Songs die sonst keiner hat 
Kill dein Rap seit Jahren ich pack die Freshness auf Beats 
Hab hier absolut kein Platz, weil du lesbisch aussiehst. 
Es ist 2013 ich zerleg wenn ich das Mic nehm' 
Rapper können heim gehen und einsehen 
Das ich absolut der beste bin in meiner sparte 
Ich piss' auf dein Ghetto geb' ein Fick auf die Straße 
Ich mach nie wieder den Kragen hoch, scheiß' auf Lederjacke 
Ich hoff' du Missgeburt erstickst an deiner Nase Koks

Und wenn dir dieses Album gefällt dikka kauf es!",Intro
Baba Saad,"Endlich bin ich über dich hinweggekommen Jamila
Um dich zu vergessen zog ich wie behindert Kokaina
Hab mich selbst gefickt und es nicht mehr gemerkt wurde zum Drogenopfer
Was ein scheiß alter wegen einer Hurentochter
Als ich fast gestorben bin hast du nicht angerufen
Es war dir scheißegal du wolltest mich nicht mal besuchen
Ich weiß das du an dem Tag in einer Disco warst
Wie eine ehrenlose sagst das es nicht so war
Weißt du eigentlich das ich an dem Tag dein Blut verlangte
Doch ich wollt nicht in den Bau rein wegen einer Schlampe
Die Drogen die ich wegen dir genommen hab warn genug
Als ich wach wurde war ne Frau das warst nicht du
Obwohl ich schon erwartet hätte das du kommen würdest
Doch du warst am lutschen wie ne Nutte in nem Bonzenviertel
Keine Sorge nein ich weine dir nicht hinterher
Ich will dir nur warum du heute hier sein musst erklärn

Jamila
Bis heute hast du Glück gehabt Glück gehabt
Du Nuttentochter ich hab die Geschichte satt
Jamila
Sag mir was ist bitte mit dir los
Jamila,Jamila
Das ist dein

Doch heute hast du kein Glück
Du Nutte dein scheiß lächeln hilft dir kein Stück
Jamila
Sag mir was ist bitte mit dir los
Jamila Jamila das ist dein Tod

Wie bereits erwähnt
Es war ne Frau das warst nicht du
Sie hat sich um mich gekümmert das mit jedem Atemzug
Obwohl ich sie zu dieser Zeit nicht geliebt hab
Doch jedes mal als ich sie gebraucht hab war sie da
Eines Tages wurd ich endlich wieder gesund
Sie sagte mir:""Hoffentlich wird irgendwas aus uns""
Jamila wegen dir dacht ich jede Frau ist ne Bitch
Doch ich hab mich geirrt diese Frau war es nicht
Komisch aber mit der Zeit lernt ich sie zu lieben
Auf einmal war es vorbei mit den Schmerzen und den Krisen
Zwei Jahre später hab ich sie zu meiner Frau gemacht
Du Schlampe hast es mitbekommen und jetzt aufgepasst
Du hast dich schlecht gefühlt und wurdest eifersüchtig
Das sie von mir schwanger war darauf nahmst du keine Rücksicht
Also dachtest du Nutte du lauerst ihr auf
Jamila du wirst heute sterben für den Tritt in den Bauch

Jamila
Bis heute hast du Glück gehabt Glück gehabt
Du Nuttentochter ich hab die Geschichte satt
Jamila
Sag mir was ist bitte mit dir los
Jamila,Jamila
Das ist dein

Denkst du ich hab mit dir Mitleid
Du sitzt hier und weinst
Bettel mich nicht an du Hure denn darauf gib ich nen scheiß
Du hast mir mein Kind genommen drum nimm ich dir dein Leben
Du solltest eigentlich wissen warum spielt man nicht mit Ehre

Deswegen wird Jamila sterben wie ne Schlampe
Guck mich an während ich die schlachte wie ein Lamm
Nutte wenigstens wurdest du geschlachtet von nem Mann",Jamila

Warum kommst du bei mir an?
Warum willst du mich zurück?
Warum nennst du mich dein Mann?
Denkst du, wenn du von mir weißt, dass ich mich interessier',
Mir werde scheißegal, sogar wenn du Bitch krepierst
Es gibt Sachen, die man nie ändert kann
Eine Nutte, bleibt 'ne Nutte, so wie du ist bis ein Leben lang.
Ich hab gesagt, das du Schlampe dich verpissen sollst
Und hab es ernst gemeint, hast du nicht ein bisschen Stolz?
Ich hab deine Sippe beleidigt, und jetzt willst du mich zurück, du Nutte
Nein, ich verzeih nicht
Du hast bei mir nix verloren um zu finden,
Das einzige was du jetzt machen kannst ist verschwinden
Was du kriegen sollst ist irgendso ein Bassad,
Der dich behandelt so wie Scheiße, ja du hasst das
Mehr als Wahr die Tun, eh spiel' nicht den Engel,
In der Hölle sollst du innerlich verbrennen

Ich hätte nie daran gedacht, das du so bist,
Du Misststück, ich wünsche, das du tot bist
Ich hasse dich, du bist 'ne Hurre, 'ne Blamage
Und ich wünsche du würdest verbluten an ein Tagen

Ich hätte nie daran gedacht, das du so bist,

Ich hasse dich, du bist 'ne Hurre, 'ne Blamage
Und ich wünsche du würdest verbluten an ein Tagen

Südländische Nutte, es ist egal was du jetzt von mir sagst,
Es ist mir auch egal, das du mir mal wichtig warst
Du kannst erzählen was du willst, ich war der erste,
Der dich gefickt hat, verweist du noch die Schmerzen
Ich musste was gestehen, du warst nie gut im Bett.
Lern von deiner besten Freundin, sie ist nicht wie du ein Brett!
Hat dich das verletzt, egal du Bitch verreckst
Hab ich dich nicht mal gesagt, ich gewinne in dem Fang
Du hast mir nicht geglaubt, du dachtest ich komm wieder an.
Merk dir eins du Nuttentochter, ich bin nicht wie jeder Mann.
Ich hab mein Stolz und jetzt fickst du mich bestimmt nicht.
Hol die Jamila an, das ganze Land beschimpft dich.
Du bist nur eine Rattentochter, die auf nett macht,
Deine Zeit ist abgelaufen. Wer frisst den Dreck, Schatz?
Deine Ehre, ja ich fick sie tot,
Jeder weißt es, ich bin nicht dein Habibi, du Missgeburt!

Ich hätte nie daran gedacht, das du so bist,
Du Misststück, ich wünsche, das du tot bist
Ich hasse dich, du bist 'ne Hurre, 'ne Blamage
Und ich wünsche du würdest verbluten an ein Tagen

Ich hätte nie daran gedacht, das du so bist,

Baba Saad,"Baby es ist wahr für mich hat jeder Tag ein Happy End, 
Wenn du mir dann am Abend vor dem Schlafen gehen ein Lächeln schenkst
Ich hab in der Nacht den Song für dich geboren
Weil ich dich liebe ohne dich bin ich in Krisen voller Zorn sag
Was ist mein Leben wert? Wenn dein Herz nicht jeden Tag für mich schlägt
Es ist unmöglich und nicht schwer
Jeder Atemzug von mir ist für dich bestimmt
Neben dir bin ich unschuldig wie ein kleines Kind
Alles was ich dir erzähle ist auch ernst gemeint
Und dass ich für dich sterben würde ist auch ernst gemeint
Dieser Song ist wie ein Antrag
Ich will dass du meine Frau wirst ich versteh ja dass du angst hast
Aber das brauchst du nicht
Denn was ich fühl' ist echt

Als ich sagte du bist anders hatte ich damit recht
Keiner kann mir geben was du hast
Ich werde zum reichsten Mann der Welt wenn du lachst
Und deine Augen wenn sie glänzen unbeschreiblich
Ich bin nicht einfach gestrickt ja das weiß ich
Aber für dich würde ich die Wolken ausradieren
Damit die Sonne scheint mein Schatz ich will keine außer dir
Ich kann mir mein Leben ohne dich nicht vorstellen
Ich reiß mein Herz für dich raus kann ich vorstellen
Das ist das Herz von mir
Das ist das Herz von Saad
Dieses Herz hat dich geliebt seit dem ersten Tag
Und bis es nicht mehr schlägt es gehört nur dir
Auch wenn du es wegschmeißt
Es gehört nur dir
Nimm es an, denn du hast es dir verdient
Bis der Tod uns dann scheidet bleib ich in dich verliebt",Seit dem Ersten Tag

Viele waren verwirrt, weil von Baba Saad lang nichts kam

Vieles lief schief, doch auch ich habe gelernt
Ich versuche euch jetzt die momentane Lage zu erklären
Oft werde ich gefragt: ""Saad, Deutschland oder Libanon?""
Ich weiß es leider nicht, weil ich beide Länder liebe Punkt
Warum ich mein Leben hier niemals bereue?
Gott gab mir was ich brauche
Hab Familie und Freunde
Ob ich jemals erfahren habe was Liebe bedeutet
Ist so schwer zu sagen, doch versuchs auf Neue
Blonde Haare, grüne Augen
Dein Aussehen ich arisch deutsch
Welche Sprache ich kann? Arabisch und Straßendeutsch

Weil ihr Mütter kleine Huren sind, die Hurensöhne

Scheiß auf Schule-Themen, ich will nur das du verstehst
Dass es wichtig ist das du deine Patte machst
Also sei nicht abgefuckt, sieh' verdammt nochmal das du dein Abschluss schaffst
Grad in Mathe muss ich stets um gute Noten bitten
Denn wie willst du Vollidiot ohne Wissen Drogen ticken?
Modeflittchen werden oder Koka sniffen
Wenn du gute Kurse hast mit Prozenten 
werden sie sogar Schore spritzen
Lern' doch Fremdsprachen, 
oder haben meine Jungs nicht verdeutlicht
dass nicht jeder deutsch spricht?
Anatomie hat mein Kopf gefickt, wobei es lustig war zu wissen, 
Junge, wem man welche Knochen bricht
Hoffentlich checkst du das, Ethik darauf musst du kacken
Solche Fächer nutze ich nicht einmal um mir Luft zu machen
Nein du brauchst auch keine guten Noten in Geschichte schreiben
Denn allein durch deine Taten wirst du schon Geschichte schreiben

Saad BC, fick das Alphabet
Ja am Ende eines Satz muss ein „Alter“ stehen
Rechtschreibreform ist ein dreckiges Wort
Ich bin euer Lehrer heißt es werden Gangster geformt
Saad BC, fick das Alphabet
Schule ist schon wichtig nicht dass ihr das falsch versteht
Es ist der Halunkenchef
Sieh meine Pläne sind wie dumme, laute Schüler
denn sie werden einfach umgesetzt

Yeah, wenn ein Halunke verschläft, uha
Dann kommt er halt paar Stunden zu spät
Ja man so gesehen verlief es für mich ohne Regeln
Mein Zeugnis war egal ja, denn ich kann keine Noten lesen
Nutz ich nicht, geographisches Wissen ist ganz cool
Damit du Opfer weißt in welcher Hood du bist
Aber Bio hab ich echt nicht begriffen
Da ging's um Grünzeug aber nicht um Blättchen zu kiffen, häh?
Doch in ? ging's das erste Mal um Gangstergeschichten
Hab zum Messer gegriffen und nach etlichen Stichen
Meine dumme Lehrerin dann aus dem Fenster geschmissen
Denn in Sexkunde zeigte sie mir hässliche Titten
Hatte ein schlechtes Gewissen, so als hätt' ich beschissen
Doch von der Schule musste ich mich letztendlich verpissen
Aber versuch meine Message zu blicken:
Zieh' die Schule lieber durch, denn nicht jeder wird ein Rapper im Business

Baba Saad,"Sie haben mich schon früher einen Dickkopf genannt
Weil sie merkten, dass mein Leben nur aus HipHop bestand
Ich die Regel und Norm in jeglicher Form
Nur missachtet hab, ständig gingen sie gegen mich vor
Schon in der Schule, als ich im Büro vor meinem Direktor saß
Hat er gesagt „Du bereust das mit dem Rap nochmal
Denn im Ernst, das ist doch kein Beruf“
Aber ich hab nur gedacht, Alter komm, du bist schwul
Meine Klassenkameraden dachten immer, dass ich dumm bin
Unsinn, und ich wusste, was dich nicht umbringt
Macht einen nur stärker, also arbeit' ich härter
Selbst wenn ich weiß, dass es gar keinen Wert hat
Was sie alle so reden, manche lieben, manche hassen dich eben
Und genau das ist das Leben
Und ich laufe lieber Jahre durch den prasselnden Regen
Als mein Herz an eine falsche Sache zu geben wenn du ihnen glaubst

Sie haben immer nur gesagt, was ich nicht kann
Gesagt, dass ich nichts kann, du wirst kein Glück haben
Wenn du ihnen glaubst, denn wenn du ihnen glaubst
Kann es sein, dass du dein Leben verbaust, Pläne gehen nicht auf
Wenn du an irgendjemand anders deine Seele verkaufst
Wenn du immer nur auf sie und ihre Regeln vertraust
Sei ein Mann und nehm' die Fehler in Kauf
Denn es ist aus, wenn du ihnen glaubst

Es war nicht nur das Verhalten, nein, mein Aussehen sollt' ich auch ändern
Die meisten Leute sahen mich immer nur als Ausländer
Doch ich blieb ich selbst, nein, sie hatten sich geirrt
Denn der Araber in mir konnte das nicht akzeptieren
Nein, es wurde echt schwer
Und mit der Zeit habe ich drauf geschissen mich mit Worten zu wehr'n
Ja, der ganze Hass machte in mir etwas kaputt
Und das erste mal im Leben hab ich ein Messer benutzt
Ich hab zugestochen, jeder Lehrer hat es prophezeit
Anfang beim Direktor und das Ende bei der Polizei
Ohne Scheiß, ich hatte stets ein gutes Gewissen
Man gab mir eine Chance, doch ich hab die Schule geschmissen
Und jeden scheiß Tag hoffte ich auf morgen
Denn für mich und die Familie konnte ich als kleiner Junge noch nicht sorgen
Doch heute kann ich sagen, ja, aus mir ist was geworden
Dabei schrieb ich nur paar Songs und so schoss ich halt empor

Sie haben immer nur gesagt, was ich nicht kann
Gesagt, dass ich nichts kann, du wirst kein Glück haben
Wenn du ihnen glaubst, denn wenn du ihnen glaubst
Kann es sein, dass du dein Leben verbaust, Pläne gehen nicht auf
Wenn du an irgendjemand anders deine Seele verkaufst
Wenn du immer nur auf sie und ihre Regeln vertraust
Sei ein Mann und nehm' die Fehler in Kauf
Denn es ist aus, wenn du ihnen glaubst",Wenn du ihnen glaubst

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

I just fell into this old parade
They told me it’s my time to shine
And they got ways to light me up at night

They didn’t care from where I came
It seemed they lost their pride and shame
Looking for a fire of their own
One last ember hits the ground
The wood’s all burned, it's ashes now
If you look up to the moon, you’ll help me carry on

Old man in a bar tonight
He sits down on a stool to watch the fight
He says “One last drink to light me up
And then I do believe I’ve had enough”

Chasing dreams that end in pain
I’ve chased the sun, I’ve chased the rain
But nothing ever seemed to fill my cup
I see the angels circling now
I feel the moon behind the clouds
That’s the kind of fire I’d be proud to carry on",Carry On

Though sometimes we don't see 
How they could
Struggles that break our hearts in two
Sometimes blind us to the truth

Our Father knows what's best for us
His ways are not our own
So when your pathway grows dim
And you just don't see Him,
Remember you're never alone

God is too wise to be mistaken
God is too good to be unkind
So when you don't understand
When don't see His plan
When you can't trace His hand
Trust His Heart
Trust His Heart

He sees the master plan
And he holds our future in His hand,
So don't live as those who have no hope,
All our hope is found in Him

We see the present clearly
But He sees the first and the last
And like a tapestry He's weaving you and me,
To someday be just like Him

God is too wise to be mistaken
God is too good to be unkind
So when you don't understand
When don't see His plan
When you can't trace His hand
Trust His Heart

He alone is faithful and true
He alone knows what is best for you

His pants fell down and actin' like a clown

Big Jake did the boogaloo too
Got lucky, he cried like a drunk
His operations ain't no ??? for you

Ella-May was dancin' to the sound of the blues
Her belly must be wobblin' right down to her shoes

Babette Allen,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Babs Gonzales,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

When them people riding with four doors - up my click
Showing them off to rookie cops to watch out for me
And I know this from crooked cops that get blocks from me

And I might start over with them Burberry tims

Brand new caddy with the Jews and jets

Aye, I flip it twice and I serve in the game
Shout it Ride fly, 20 birds on that thing

And my five pound germ might sing
A song, if you want to sing say Bling
And if you ever see my pa say King
And if you ever see his son say Weezy baby!
New prints of the Big Easy baby
Y'all niggas can't see me, but I see you lil Pha Pha baby
Ya dude can't lose I'ma spread my wings and fly away

Stay dipped in every kind of ice

We pluck polar bear winter on my side
Sitting on the swine alligator punch-line
Super stitch in my leather pockets full of cheddar
Smoke sticky, icky, icky, icky
We drank absolute cristal for breakfast
New whips come out I puts it together
Tell you how I do it I change my leather
No stock Blackwood with the foreign feathers
And German eyes with them Gucci sweaters
Bought mami the matching shit and plucked her feathers
I wipe it down bitch bird lady forever
Birdman switch from Rees to leather

[Chorus]

[Baby]
She was a raggedy bitch, switched her up, cleaned her life
You no longer a scrub you the Birdman's wife
So don't you think twice about this mink and leather shit
You drive by the hood and bird shit on a bitch
Drive anything you want cause you the Birdman's bitch
Get anything you need and you roll with the clique
Go to the club and get a front row seat
Pop mo Don P just shit on a bitch
See your fly now mami used to be a dirty bitch
Got all these hoes trying to ride your dick
You maintain mami you never just wild out
That's why Stunna put you in that big ass house
With the German floors with the wood grain side
Mink on the door with the foreign G ride
Bird berry Gucci be a surprise
No cost too high for my bitch to stay fly

Treat you like my sticky icky or my sweet ooy gooy (For real though)

You got me lifted feeling so gifted

Now I ain't worried about a thang 'cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a super fly chick
There ain't nothing you can say to a playa'
'Cause doo-wop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right she's full grown settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' the ozone
So fly like a dove, fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Barada
Rockin' Dolce & Gabbana, hydro in a Cubana

You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted

You'll be there when the money comes

And I know that she be feeling me


She in love with a hustla, someone she could trust uh
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas
Sleep all day, and grind all night
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks
And even though sometime, it might seem strange
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

She don't be messing with them suckas
Looking so good, little tight jeans on and g-string on

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucka romance
Love to see me get the lapdance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
Now that's living like, who's the boss
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce
Even though she approached by them big time ballas
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand what kind of man she in love with,
But she don't give a damn

She's in love with a hustla

It's such a filthy game
Such a dirty game
The game don't eva change
My image is everything

You know my image as a pimp, it can be kind of hard to ignore
Because of my image, I might call you a whore
You know my image as a pimp, it can be hard to accept
You gotta be open for some disrespect

Word around town is I hold these G's

Feds after me 'cause I serve this D
Got blessed as Golden child

I dominate the ladies, insult the ladies
Some think that Oral Bee is badgering the ladies
I massage some ladies.but keep it on the hush
I'm a pimp, shit, I'm not supposed to have no crush
Met this lady, she was off the hook
A playa got hard off her sexy look
To my homies I said that she was crazy horny
And, like most bitches she was dumb and corny
Well, the truth is that this girl was mad intelligent
I wanted to follow her ass everywhere it went
Yes Suh! This mama turned me on
But then she met some slick-talkin' playa and was gone
He was a nasty playa who called her a queen
Now, I can't do that, I am a pimp-machine
Sometimes I wish that pretty bitch still was mine
But, I got the image of a pimp, and I stay true to it all the time

[Chorus]

Image of a pimp is what I got
Take a look at me girl I live it hard
I ain't chose to rhyme my game is cold
Million dollar mouth piece have you bringin doe
Back to the daddy in a candy caddy
Wit a half bag of Afghanastani
'cause me and Beesh see we blowin' big
Can't help us now 'cause we on it
Ohh look we slammin' da bom on it
Don't act like yo ass ain't noticed it
I'm rollin' wit a bunch of hoggs
Y'all ready know they like to ball
I get paid fo sex give me the money on a daily basis
Have yo ass on the track till 8 in da morning

Baby Bash,"Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion 
Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

Another day when I'm waking up 
I turn my TV on CNN 
Another homie done bit the dust, my best friend's back up in the pen 
Somebody hit the twin towers,and the buildings came tumbling down 
All we could do was watch in tears 
While the people of America wondered how we let it go down 
Then, I heard a sound when I turned around 
This old man said pray for me 
Said I've been in the world for 88 long years and go now can you stay for me? 
I looked him in the eyes, and gave him a smile and said mister I don't mean no harm 
But you ain't going nowhere, so just pull up a chair 
I got greens fresh off the farm 
And with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin' ima give it a try 
I said hold up pops, I ain't forget about the nana you promised so pass it by 
And then he said

Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion 
Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

From dusk to dawn, mom's always tellin' me you must move on 
Let the past be the last thing to dust you son 
And I trust you mom 
But the doesn't mean my lust for fun, want to bust my gun 
Wasn't much to some, then you measured up to most started walking down the road 
To the treasure up the post 
You just never fucking know what you gonna see, where ya gonna be, who you gonna meet 
It's true you gonna sleepin', slip into silence 
Shot guns fired, choppers and sirens 
Spotlight shinin', flashin' on the glance 
At a boy without a chance and the Devil on his ass 

I be sayin' though, livin' my life, wishin' and hopin'
I be sayin' though, chasin' the dreams
I be sayin' though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why 

I be sayin though taken away from the frustration 
I be sayin though teach me to use my imagination 
I be sayin though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why

I got a fat sack and a super fly chick
There ain't nothing you can say to a playa'
'Cause doo-wop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right she's full grown settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' the ozone
So fly like a dove, fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Barada
Rockin' Dolce & Gabbana, hydro in a Cubana

You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted

Sugar how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?

You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Girl you keep it so fly with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes

You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Girl you keep it so fly with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes (For real though)

This is ain't nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Need to chill, try to stop
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop

I'm with my Momma rent-a-car with ten and a half pounds
No DL's, an endless amount of rounds
With my mind on my mansion, I'm smashin' about the town
You thought I was a hog
Wait till I clown now
That's when you believe me, disturbin' three for the fifty
And I wish that motherfucker would try to get with me
'Cause I'm nifty with the milly when the torch is on
And play every play like its fourth and long
Now when the horse is gone, I beat the shit out the pig
It don't take much to split a fool's wig
See I'm only one shot from making the headlines
So quick niggas are quarters and dead lines
Shakin' the bed time, they checking my barcode
A.T.F, I.N.S and the U.S. Marshal
And this ain't nothin' new to me
Capitalize on opportunity, uh

He my smokin' nephew, we be checkin' brazin' cash
We kept G's on the omni floor
Put the bloody bills with the Tommy in the drawer
Tell Mommy with the rock, I'll break a lil' corner off
I don't like that bammer, I don't wanna cough
You got to watch every step
P walk and pull out a tech
I thought you knew I'm a vet
Let loose and threw up my set
A W A X to latex
Glove on my left hand can only mean death, man

I spit heat, hit the street, stack by the window
Bay area lingo is what a playa blessed with
Ten shots with his own spots is all I ever messed with
So if you broke, I ain't even heard of ya
Come around me again and I'm a murder ya
I need some loot, so watch how I take your town
A bitch wanna hold me, I track her down
Get up in the brain, take over the soul
4 G's a night, I'm ready to roll
A big long black hella beat in the trunk
Baby kick back, it's hella heat for the funk
A dear mutherfucker, a step to the low
One too many drinks now he's gettin' a roll
So thought I 'cas kiss tell them hit this
It's JT, I'm a dog when I spit this

Second Ward, that be the place where I do my dirt
Kick in doors, sellin' dope, only my God knows
I have to do what I have to do, just to stay alive
I lost a friend, but God blessed me with some real niggaz
Hell is soft, I kept it real from the fuckin' start
I stay strapped, cause my neighborhood so dirty
I kiss my Grandma goodbye, but my jefa looks so worried
Pit bulls from my terrier that I call my home
It ain't much, but its something I can call my own
I go to war at any times, at any place
Why yo punk twelve gauge, all in your face
I want your jades, your jackets, and your jewelry
What the fuck you on my block, if you ain't cool with me
You crossed the line, ain't no time to press rewind
I caught you slippin' cause I heard that you dropped a dime
On my perro, now he doin' twenty-five to life

Ghetto clothes, but I'm feeling like I'm ghetto far

Money stackin, by any means keep your gadget
And find a way to keep supporting my weed habit
I get my shit dirt cheap, the way I like it
You disrespect the clip, puto I get excited
My trigga finger get itchy, like I was Lionel Richie
A Commodore, when I go to war
So get down so I can touch you quickly
No substitute for these thugs, who love to shoot and cut the loot
You fuckin punk, that's why I don't fuck with you

Y'all soldiers know my truth be ill
Now with these visions and these bad thoughts
Runnin' through my mind
Stop the clock, see I'm runnin' out of time
And as I, tell myself, I'm a changed man
Dressed in black out to jack me a game plan
Situation critical, it's called creepy physical
Hella cold, I'm a gonna be off in hell old

Plus it's hard to focus, when you crooked and hopeless
I ain't home, but my mama don't notice
Nationwide with thugs, locked out it's just us
With the Feds and the police out to bust us
The most prominent, see we stay dominate
And stay wicked, and plus we keep it explicit
Abducted by the streets see it's hard to manage
End up on my block saying we the savage

So you made a little money, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you roll on 24's, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you pimped a few hoes, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you earned a few stripes, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?

I hear you rappin' 'bout the streets, talkin' bout pushin' deal
When most of y'all never seen a triple beam scale
Runnin' from weed smell, runnin' from dank smoke
Then you get on the mic, talkin' bout you been chokin'
Ya lame as mark, buy some heart with your chump change
Don't make me start, cold hearted droppin' punk names
You run thangs? Maybe, in your back yard
You act hard round here you gonna get smacked hard

With savage dreams on my mind so repetative
Let it live, let it go, player do or die
'Cause fools on my side will tell the other fool to ride
Down to do what I gotta do, to satisfy the man in me
I pull illicit things, my family ain't understandin' me
So while I have kids beatin' up on the door
I'm gonna crack up and smoke with a corona

So you got a platinum grill, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you got a record deal, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you pack a few gats, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
You fell in love with your bitch, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?

The day I wake up, blaze up, lace my J's up
Try to make a couple stacks for' the days up
Hustle hard nigga, that's how I live
Only fuckin' with fans, my niggas and relatives
And I dress fly, all clean and keep a fat knot
For supplying all the beats to the have nots

Won't kill what you don't bitch or watch your grill hoe
I'll have you iced out, you beat grills

Slidin' on a slab and all she wanna do was rape me
But payin' for some puss, girl, you must be mistaken greatly
You say you wanna taste me, blow and decapitate me
What you need ain't give me gravy, paid me, my dick ain't lazy
Trickin' is dead, holmes, she givin' me head phones
She thick in the red thong, I refuse to be led on
Cause I'm a leader, not a follower
She gon' be a squirter and a swallower

Big maniac, she a brainiac, just like she go to Princeton
In a Cadillac, fuck a battle rap, motherfucker, keep it pimpin'

And to inspire, she opened wide, and swimmin' in my denim (You, you, you, you, you bitch)

I don't want no pussy ass, long as you open in your mind
No pussy could, but tell her put that throat up in your life
Got me a drug dealer ride, put liq' with coke up in her eye
Tryin' to charge me for that trash ass, pussy, she out of mind
Same thang I can get out her pussy, I'm a get out her mind
Money in my pocket, good, but it ain't comin' out of mine
If you pay for sexual favors, your trick ass out of line
And with every time I call her phone number (Number)
My neighbor is what she lay her head under (Under)
Ain't no fillin' child support on me unless a nig get pregnant
Bitch, suck it while I'm behind the wheel, that's why I'm drivin' reckless
She a head hunter

[Chorus]

I don't love her, I don't want her, you can have her, I got another
Did it however which way I could've, then I kicked her up out the Hummer
Nothin' but a head hunter, and she wanna taste me
Bitch, pay me, this dick ain't free
I said on how she bring it back, so how the hell could I pay for that
Choose me, she know the scope, it's pimpin', no love for a hoe
Lucky, yeah, they love me, and they wanted me to hit it
If I put that dick up on her, she gon' get out there and get it

[Chorus]",Head Hunta
Baby Bash,"[Chorus]
She's in love with a hustla 
She don't be messing with them suckas 
Looking so good, little tight jeans on and G-string on 
And I know that she be feeling me 

She in love with a hustla', someone she could trust uh 
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas 
Sleep all day, and grind all night 
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite 
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging 
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing 
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps 
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts 
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block 
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks 
And even though sometime, it might seem strange 
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs 

[Chorus] 

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice 
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice 
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance 
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance 
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh 
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh 
Now that's living like, who's the boss 
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce 
Even though she approached by them big time ballas 
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa 
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with, 
But she don't give a damn 

[Chorus] 

One day we gone get it together 
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together

You love to get on top of me, while I get you wet and watery

Floss and flash, cop and blow a zip wit Bash

Since everything is big in Texas then where's the zag's?
I'm across the finish line, tell me where's the flags?
Brought my rag top, should have brought the Jag
On the beach me and Beesh, look at all this ass

I could tell you stories but can show you cash
Give you game and secrets that I know you'll pass
To the next playa hater and he'll break like glass
Now I got a bunch of people digging' through my pads

So I choose to floss 'cause who's the boss, let's ink it
It's Richie Rich for those who thought re-think it
Some yell it and tell it, I blow it and smoke it and smell it
Let's spend tokens wit my people who sell it, what?

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya

I could bend the block and make it hotter than a Forman grill
I got the keys to the Chevy Caprice
I could show you mother fuckin' snitches straight to Belize

Now that's low, fa sho', conspiracy and parole
I could show you real cats doin' time over a ho
I could show you poor and happy, or rich one's that lose they mind
I could show you dime pieces in school fashion design

I could show you streetlights and heart beak hotels
I could show you young cats gettin' popped wit yayo
Down to do what I gotta do to satisfy the man in me
And from the looks of thangs the popo's ain't understandin' me

I could show you boss stuntin' so fuckin' disgustin'
I could show you rapper's frontin' but mayne it's really nothin'

I can show you better than I can tell ya

I could show you, I could reach you and teach you
I know you and where you comin' from, I understand it
This been goin' on forever dog, it's no end
Life is like a bullet in your back from a close friend

Disappointed to the point where I'm runnin' by myself
Never knowin' where I'm goin' start to wonder myself, yeah
Money was a necessity, my greed got the best of me
You think you smokin' Uncle be, who got the recipe?

I'm sayin' it's nothin', I say it sincerely, and speakin' clearly
I'd rather you respect me than fear me
I came a long way and still I got a while to go
You probably thinkin' to yourself, ""What's he smilin' for?""

My dog Bash about to be platinum doin' his thang
So if you hate him for it, boy you fakin' and know it

My stles so cold
Holla for the gold
Some say I'm to drunk
Some say I'm to blowed
And rollin kilos I'm stackin these C notes
Watchin my cheeses grow and blowin on trees though
And I really can't help it I'm addicted to time gorilla grind
And no time for groupies or free stylin
Want it green as a getco I'm respectful to some of you'll
But some of you'll be frontin I don't owe shit to none of you'll
I got bills to comprehend po-pos be poppin in
Waitin and watchin when they could take my block in
I'm in and outta traffic supplyin they bad habbit
The game is gettin graphic but main I gotta have it
Son of a drug addict but that ain't no excuse I got these
Money makin skills I mma put em to use
And I ain't doin to much you'll just ain't doin enough
And I refuse to let a so called ruin my stuff

Ain't got nothin to say
Cause 24 hours ain't enough time in the day
So time doesn't exist ain't no watch on my wrist
If a peck on the cheek means death
Watch for the kiss
I stay calm under pressure
By any means or measure
Remember ones trash is another mans treasure
Business before pleasure I'm disciplined and I'm forced
While you rap cats battle to see who dopest
I'm in the trenches face down in the game bra
And can't nobody no my real name bra
Livin in the seasons they killin for no reason
If I make it pass 30 then I'm over achivin
Belivin in the truth belivin in the way
The life that I follow might bring me a brighter day
In the truth in the way
The life that the life that I follow

I just wanna freak that, ain't got no shame

I'ma blast off like a damn Houston Rocket
Roll around town with some dank in my pocket
Grandma say, ""Ronnie Ray, you need to stop it""
Punk bootleggers man they fuckin' off my profit
Dip up in the club and she eye ballin' me
Remind me of the breezy from Terminator III
Thinkin' nasty, she the whole extravaganza
Gloss when I floss I'm the boss like Tony Danza

Puttin' hands on muthafuckas actin' up
Give me fifty feet, betta back tha fuck up
Me and Juan Gotti smashin' outta T-town
Lookin' low G gotta fool beat down

Step in the club like it ain't no thang

Downtown Super Bowl 38
In the clutch city ya know filfthy movin' weight
In case it get to state keep me in a G manner
All my homies roll like Tony Montana
Listen to the law, jappa jaw on the scanner
Sippin' purple hawk started bangin' David Banner
Money in the Benz but I'm layin' in the Lac
Stomach so swole throwin' up in the back

She was fine, yes sir, she was trill
Plus she had a pocket full of colorful pills
Puttin' heat through yo whole crew flannel
Cookin' them chickens put me on tha Food Channel
Roll with tha pimps, oh nah I'm not a balla
Sell up on those cities like a blue night crawler
Call her on the celly, work my jelly meet the mami at the telly
Roll a fatty, jump in tha ride and disappear like Makaveli, say what

Step in the club like it ain't no thang

Man I step in tha club like it ain't no thang
I'm valet parked been drankin' all day
Paparazzi takin' pictures and tha haters lookin' mad
But the boppers showin' love and I'm signin' autographs
Bartender know me and he know I do tha fool
E'ry body in my ear and I'm like who is you?
Give me fifty Hennessy's on tha rocks for these boys
Can't stand male groupies move around with that noise

I'm tryin' to sit down and roll up and get blowed
Find somethin' I can take back to tha mo-mo
Like that right there you lookin' good no doubt
What you got under that skirt, girl whatchu talkin' 'bout?
I'm waitin' for my boys downstairs to get done
They wouldn't let me on stage they said I was too drunk
But it's about to be two girl, tell me if you're ready
Let's sip champenge in my jacuzzi at the telly

My cup got syrup in my soda
I don't give a fuck don't tip my shit ova
Six bad bitches sittin' in a Range Rova
Paul got 'em all lookin' ova they shouldas
Chuggin' on dro got smoke in my windpipe
Always wanna know bout my hoes and my pimp life
Nigga what it is what it was what it been like
Can I get a chickenhead shake and some french fries?

Pants so skin tight man so freak like
Notch after notch in tha club on tha weeknight
Now she wanna go home, go to bed and sleep tight
Grab this Hennessey by the hair and make her speak right

Straight out of Arizona, I told her that I'm a loner
I'm offerin' crystal, but she prefer lime and Corona
Super saucy, Sergio Rossi sandals
And when she in the Jacuzzi ooh, she lightin' candles

To tour Jamaica, maybe meet a couple Jamaicans

For you it's education, for me is to rock the nation

Crunchin' on Greek salad under some conversation

She said one time at band camp she was a rat
And sold girl scout cookies lyin flat on her back
One day I was in the middle of some sucka duckin
Got tired of throwin my hood up at this trick
Bust up like it was nothin
I met her out the blue sky, I truly neva knew why
But kept it pimpin in that ora she love me 'cause I'm to fly

CHORUS:

As days go by
I'm missing you baby
Patiently waiting
For you
To hold you
To thrill you
To feel you
Tender kisses
Give you the love you've been missing
Boy I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone(As days go by)

Now I done came a long way
But ain't gone too far
And hope this love letter don't
Leave a big scar
So baby just hold on
Lil' momma just be strong
Cause no one knew the war
Would last us so long
The rockets the red glare
The bombs up in the air
I'm just doing my duty
But missin' it right there
So as days go by
I'm counting every minute
Wishing I was home
For sure with you in it
But the soldiers that
I'm runnin' with
Are ready to blitz
This ain't no video
This is just as real as it gets
I made some lifelong friends
Holdin' down the front line
And girl I can't wait
To get back in your sunshine

Patiently waiting
For you

To thrill you
To feel you
Tender kisses
Give you the love you've been missing
Boy I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone (As days go by)

Now as days go by
My time is spent reflecting
On all the lil' things
You said I was neglecting
They say you never know
What you have until it's gone
Didn't know back then
But I will from now on
When I try to channel out
All the fear and the stress
I picture me and you rollin'
Looking dressed to impress
And to know you'll be there
When I'm back from Iraq
And feel good to know
A real chica I have on my back

Give everybody huggs
And tell em' I really miss em '
And your boy be back
When I'm through with my mission

Give everybody huggs
And tell em' I really miss em'
And your boy be back
When I'm through with my mission

Patiently waiting
For you
To hold you
To thrill you
To feel you

To have you all alone(As days go by)

I'm missing you baby
Patiently waiting

Baby Bash,"I wish it could be like it used to, used to, used to
I wish it could be like it used to, used to, used to
Baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
Things ain't like they used to be, baby girl, you're losing me

I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to
Baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
What would you do?

Well, now the thrill is long gone, the feelin' is all wrong
Got me feelin' uncomfortable all in my own home
And your ring tone song deleted from my phone
And damn, I use to love that song when it came on

And no this ain't 'bout no new company
It's just time for you to do you and me to do me
And you know, and you know that I know, that I know
That we don't belong together no more, no more

And even though the memories still make me wanna believe
The facts I gotta face em, it's over, it's history
'Cause you know, we gotta breath and I don't wanna deceive
A lie or get it twisted so, baby, I gotta leave

I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to
Now, baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
Things ain't like they use to be, baby girl, you're losing me

I wish it could be like it used to, used to, used to
Baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
What would you do?

The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone

Well, now I wish there was a way I could turn back the clock
When the lovin' was so hot, good to the last drop
And I wish there was a way I could rewind the time
Wait before the tears and the years on the grind

Now you lookin' at me crazy every time you hear my phone ring
Use to get along better back when we was homies
Use to keep it low key, now we fight in public
Argue about anything and every single subject

So now I think it's better if we just keep it movin'
I won't trip off you and you won't trip off what I'm doin'
'Cause baby, this ain't crackin' like it use to be
I think you just got a little use to me

I wish it could be like it used to, used to, used to
Baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
Things ain't like they used to be, baby girl, you're losing me

I wish it could be like it used to, used to, used to
Baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
What would you do?

The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone

Well, now I wish there was a way I could turn back the clock
When the lovin' was so hot, good to the last drop
And I wish there was a way I could rewind the time
Wait before the tears and the years on the grind

I don't wanna say it but you know what I'm thinking
And we should be apart, now it's over like a holiday
I don't wanna say it but you know what I'm thinking
And we should be apart, now it's over

I wish it could be like it used to, used to, used to
Now, baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
Things ain't like they used to be, baby girl, you're losing me

I wish it could be like it used to, used to, used to
Now, baby, after all of that I don't think I'm coming back
Tell me what would you do, you do, you do?
What would you do?

The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone

I'm a holla back when I pop my collar back
Girl I see that dunka dun dunk I want all of dat
Follow dat train mane follow that caboosie
Ain't nothin in the world like some thick and some juicy
She goin downtown cuz her favorite DJ's spinnin
I'm all up in the door so I'm already winnin
I got a lotta women but I'm way too choosy
And man I love my cake like that Ricky love Lucy
On some peanutbutter leather with the wood so grainy
It must be rainin dollars cuz she's lookin so gravy
Sophisticated lady poppin till the end what it do what it is
Baby girl tell me what's hannenin

The kinda chica that you really ain't used to
Dame lo dame lo momma shoot through
In my ear talkin bout Imma do you
Everyone top notchin, everybody watchin
Ain't no punk when she pop lock and drop it
Straight show stoppin watchin me perform

And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

My lifestyle so cold, holla for the gold
Some say I'm too drunk, some say I'm too blowed
Hold the kilos, and watch the weeds grow
And stacking see-note, on top of see-note
And ooh, my mama love me but found a new man
Took all that she should take, five years I'm still praying
Damn it's out of hand, balling out of control
I love the fame and the fortune, but I sold my soul
Bring it back Lord, help me bring it back, help me
Straighten out my act, all I know is making money slanging yack
On the track, and smoking fat sacks with my mistress
What is this, my life as a misfit

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

I got too many things, going on

Now I don't know what you done heard
Anywhere you go, one do love herb
Like two little birds, kissing in the trees
An angel up above, been whispering to me
Said I'm living in a dream, and it isn't what it seems

Once wanted fame, now I wish it wasn't me
You know, I got a fly groove, so many time zones
Quick to get my rhyme on, listen to it when I'm gone
I was born, to put the boogie in your shoes
Hit the doobie when you through, pass it to me on the cool
I'm a fool for the flipping, spit for those who love me
Thought I knew the game, but it ain't so funny

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

Come on now, help me get up out of the rain
I'm blessed with the joy, but cursed with the pain
Come on now, everybody knowing my name
Ask Little Ronny, can you spare some change
See I'm tired of the game, tired of the lies
Now all I wanna do is keep my eyes on the prize
Rise to the occasion, interrogation is my persuasion
To do the thangs I do, keep the average head aching
Waking up at noon, listen to the tune
I'm dedicated to my first love, back in high school
Went from close pin to kingpin, every weekend
Shining like a star, but far from what I'm seeking

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

Don't harass me, after I finish beatin' the chassis

In the mornin', on the floor, take a shower, back for me

Do it with a player's stance, I'm a savage in the sheets
Been bustin' freaks, since, gettin' cabbage in them streets

Cause ain't no time for waitin', my clock is always tickin'

And when I hook it to the left, it's like I'm bendin' corners
Get up in ya, get up on ya, hot, as Arizona
Here come the splash down, welcome to Bashtown
Ankles up, ass down, blowin' out your back now

Beated repeatedly, constantly make you move 'round
You know what it do, girl, I'm a make them toes curl
Findin' all the right spots, got it locked, on the pearl
It's not the Macanera, it's not the same ol'

Talk to me, baby, you ain't got no man yet
Weekend in the Bahamas, you got plans yet
I'll tell you anythang if I could see that coochie rang
Lay-lay it down like Ballin G {Up on that California cage}

Ass vibrate the room like an earthquake
Slow-slow motion, her body screwed up
It must be some purple in the cup
Cause she movin' so slow {Slow, slow}

I kept sippin' on Jemima, sippin' on that molasses

Can slow mo through {3D with no glasses}
Slower than a turtle, a tortoise, harder than rigor mortis {No}

Too fast, baby, slow it (Slow it)
I need the T for it (For it)

Get you over the hotel balcony, rip out the ?

Bringin' out the beast in me, I'm a mess up your hairdo

[Chorus]

I got chicks like Pamela, from H to Canada
The only game I ever played good was Gallahger
Cold like Alas-a-ka, flip 'em like spatula
People be trying to bite my flows like Dracula's
Spectacular, my rappin' doesn't seem to have a replica
Angel, I saw a dude go from Jesse to Jessica
Dope fiend blessed, I'm a money making maniac
Born in the gutter like a little cute baby rat
My lady's tat got SPM in faded black
People say you look like Carlos Coy, but, ain't he fat
Just like a janie sack, I'm been gettin' Slim Fast
Prison life turn my cell block into a gym class
Pull-ups off my top bunk, bench press my mattress
Curlin' pillow cases full of books and a atlas
Can you understand this or has a G lost touch
Walkin' in my con chucks, livin' out long months

[Chorus]

It's that Dope House Records, jammin' out of Texas
Mayne, I'm so powerful with quick reflexes
With the SP Mex's, South Park on hollow
Happy P., got the beats on steroids like (??)
If I'm Italian, I'm a Capo, yeah, fully made
Retire from the game, and still get fully paid
Yeah
It's the Dope House prophet
Thirty-five and forty-five in the state, keep it poppin'
Boy, what you slangin'
Boy, what you slangin'
Ridin' big body, playboy, what you sangin'
Smashing down ten with a farm in my woodgrain
Hit San Anton', and you know it's all good, mayne

I'm wet (Wet)
So I'm drippin' like a faucet
Leaky through the track with stunt-tastics, I don't floss it (Wow)
Proceed with caution, slow your role
But I can't see that option, it's all I know
Say I'm, Pollo Loco, but I'm crazy for the chicken
Tryin' to get my hands on you, and the beef get to kickin' (Ha)
Yeah, I'm tryin' to stay out, the mix though
Cause every once in a while, they get to get low
Kick those, hun, tryin' to get dough
Whoever dead, is gettin' laid out, fa' sho
The final callin', here we go, yes y'all'in
I'm tryin' to stay high while them niggas steady ballin'
Two times for my G's that never come back
Hopin' I can see you one time, when I touch back

Now if they ask about me, tell them, ""Real cochino""
I'm from the L.V.C., real Latino
I'm in the hood (Hood)
Just tryin' to feed my family
But I ain't doin' good (Uh)
I hope you understand me
I'm in it, real thick (Thick)
What should I do, fool
Big Ronnie sick (Sick)
I'm hopin' he gon' pull through
I'm 'bout to take a ride (Ride)
And jump real deep in the game
Since my grandma died, I swear we just ain't been the same
I bought a one-way ticket, with alcohol flowin'
Not even knowin' where I'm goin'
Just out here tryin' to make it (Make it)
Do every thing but fake it (Fake it)
Stress on my mind (Mind)
It's so hard to take it
I'm back on the grind (Grind)
Just look for the guero [whistling]

I hear my kids cry (Cries)

Should I put on my math and start the trick-o-treatin'
Hell naw
My primo told me, ""Shut that down""
They got a pound of the grape, get off, by the ounce
On the G.O., my P.O. is a dickhead twerp
Yeah, he a jerk and love to cock block work
And my next door neighbor, yeah, he got that way
In the trunk of his Cadillac, 24 K's
And I'm tryin' to get that gwhop like twenty-four days
Need a solid gold bitch like 24K
And I ain't got a job, can I catch me a break
Ain't got no shrimp, and ain't got to steak
From the AM to the PM, rockin' the colloseum
Then smokin' with B-Legit, in the what, Head Museum

You think you're so damn cold, you could play me at your game
While you wasting my time, girl, you so lame
Maybe you misunderstood, that's the way it go
Sayanora, adios, we finito
New number, new phone, new contact
All your pictures, I deleted all that
New whip, new clothes, new condo
You better break white and gold, kid, pronto

That means bounce, dip, grab your (shit) and get out
Cause I ain't even tryin' to hear another word out your mouth
I'm remixin', changin' your position
And no more fightin', no fussin', no more friction
Your shopping addiction, tossed out the window
This is my house, I guess you stayin' with your kinfolk
Cause you outclassed, I need you out fast
Used to be about me, now you all about trash
Baby, please don't harass, or even tryin' to stock me
I got restraining orders, baby, come and get your copy
Your game is so sloppy, messy, girl, when you text me
I don't even read it, I delete it so sexy
Ha ha
And I know it don't sound right
But you can't turn a (hoe) into a housewife
And I know it don't sound right
But you can't turn a (hoe) to a housewife

And my wrist on bling with a fresh so lean
Three hundred dolla jeans and my grill on bean
With my bundle in my jeans and it's real, homie

Naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen? Gentleman

I step up in the club lookin' freshin' than them other
Ice so bright make ya eyes Stevie Wonder
Way down under at the bottom of the boot
I just gotta keep it real, I just gotta speak the truth, speak the truth

I'll floss on you bitchez doin' 90 on the free
Gettin' lost on you bitchez
See, if you less than 500, I'ma boss on you bitchez
Hustle, hustle real hard, Rick Ross on you bitchez

If ya carrots ain't high, I don't wanna see ya jewelry
'Cuz my shit shinny, y'all be all blurry
I had to get up on ya, I had to do my thing
'Cuz I's so fresh and I's so clean

Homie, I'm so fresh and I'm so clean
And my wrist on bling with a fresh so lean
Three hundred dolla jeans and my grill on bean

Naw meen, you naw meen?

You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?

I'm back up in the spot, cleaner than a whistle
Count my diamonds on my neck, homeboy, not no crystals
Nigga, I'm the shit, better pass me the tissue
Red Monkey's on my ass, Baby Boy, it's official, it's official

I'll rock on you bitchez and my sickas don't stop
I'ma watch on you bitchez
Big rims, big truck will go knock on you bitchez
Goin' down right now, Yung Joc on you bitchez

If you ain't countin' stacks, you ain't fly like me
If you ain't roll in the deck, you can't ride with me
Niggaz spit to spare clean, neva eva trifflin'
Holla at my nigga soul 'cuz the nigga on bling

Homie, I'm so fresh and I'm so clean
And my wrist on bling with a fresh so lean
Three hundred dolla jeans and my grill on bean
With my bundle in my jeans and it's real, homie

Naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?
You naw meen, you naw meen?

Walkin' everywhere, dustin' off myself
Time to flawn on you bitchez, time to show my wealth
Got a loft that I bought, got a condo in New York
Spendin' boo cool money but I gotta play it smart, play it smart

I maintain on you bitchez, in a different kind of whip
Switchin' lanes on you bitchez
And I know you niggaz hear I do my thang on you bitchez
I like my beat down low like the King on you bitchez

If ya cars don't cost about 80, 90 thousand
'Cuz my whips cost more than some of y'all houses
I got my grill and high bean with a fresh white tee
And I'm still so fresh, naw meen?

This year I gotta hustle, this year I'm gon' blow
No purp stain on my lips I stay out of trouble
Cause niggaz be provokin' me to put 'em in a tussle

But now I can't do it, I got a positive mind frame
I'm somethin' like spike, I can only do right things
God blessed me with a talent now it's time to show off
6 years in the game now it's time to go off

The rapper that I'm bein', I'm tight with no flaws
If you don't hustle hard then you dog with no claws
Hard work straight grindin' now I'm almost the boss
Really nuttin' changed just my ice and my cars

Gettin' rich y'all, and I'm blowin' real fast
'Cause I really hustle hard for my cash

Cause finally I got my own damn money
I can't get cut short 'cause I got my own shit
I can't get set back 'cause I own my own shit

I done made it to the start and now I gotta finish
I'm talkin' getting' lil' money but now I'm getting' plenty
Grey Goose, Belvedere, I done bagged off some Henny
And I'm still from the block but don't call me Jenny

Call me baby boy, I'm a Prince of the game
I'm stuck on my money like a pimp with his cane
Take another peek at, my neck and my wrist boy
Bank account sky high, 'cause I'm getting' rich boy

Ooh, what you do to me

Baby DC,"Are you feelin' me cause I'm feelin' you?
I was just going to tell you now
You know I want to talk to you  gotta dig me know what I'm sayin?
O.K. you already know that. Ya dig

[Verse 1]
Since the 5th grade, I've been watching you
Even though your friends know I got the hots for you
I know you got boyfriend I'm not knocking yo
But y'all breaking up ain't it possible?
Ever since old days, ya can't give me the time
But when we do hang you always try to give me the rhyme
We used to talk on the phone a lot
I was working on my album that was why I wasn't home a lot
But you never understood when I told you that
It's a shame that me and you had to go threw that
I'm not down for the non-since or the convince 
I'm knowing that you probably have guilty continence
Forget it we can start all over again
I'm mature now and a little older than him
When I bother you
It was only a sign
I'm really feelin you and it's not only a rhyme

Chorus: repeat 2X
I'm feelin you can't you see (Can't you see)
If you want to be down with me 
(That's why I bother you if you like me 
let me know say yes and I'm ready to go) 
oh girl what's it gonna be 
you can work it out with ""Baby DC""

[Verse 2]
All your friends think they older cause they all kissen
But if we were together, it'll be way more different
We could go to Six Flags on a Saturday
Your momma cool but I  don't know what your daddy sa.
I hope he let you go cause he kinda strict
Transportation come on that's a minor lick
Let him know we ain't gonna ride the bus
Matter fact tell him Too $hort driven' us
I'm a win stuffed animals just for you
I'm a ride that ride just for you
I'm a buy cotton candy just for you
Theirs so many things for us to do
We can take a lot if pictures while we there
Just say the word girl and I'll be there
It's not a card game that I'm dealing you
I hope it's real to you cause I'm feelin' you

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Well it's back to reality the point of it all
If you going to stay with him what's the point of it all
I got money and my album to think about
But on the real girl you might want to think it out
Cause I would hate to see you sad if I'm not around
And I would hate to get the word that you got around
And if we never hook up and he still with you
At least you know that I'm feelin you

I'm feelin you can't you see
Can you get with me?
Come and get with D.

A thrill I'd never known

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man

Well you can improve that by me

A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in

Baby Jane Dexter,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening

It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony

About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony

Si fa male da solo, Edward mani di forbici
Giudica il mondo dal suo piccolo soggiorno
E prende corsi accelerati di amore dai porno (Ou)
E vede l'alba giusto due volte al dì'
Dice no, prima di si, e non parla se non tramite i click
Si fa più viaggi dei film di David Lynch
Si fa più viaggi intesso come i trip LSD
E lui fa il raper autoerotismo e sa già tutto
Per farlo darebbe una costola come d'Annunzio
E sai che l'odio e il suo viagra personale
Le ragazze non le tocca ma sa che sono tutte puttane
Salta la scuola e non lavora ""che sarà, sarà""

Molto macho, testosterone in pastiglia

Ne ho conosciuti vari casi più o meno rari
Il sogno di un Ferrari, le donne da calendari
Mi sono detta: ""Beh, guarda che belle ambizioni""
Ma non vogliono mica studiare
Da grandi vogliono fare i famosi
Conosco altrettante cose, con un ego in overdose
Che sono talmente acidi sembrano me quando ho le mie cose
E forse alle donne non piacciono
Allora poi fanno gli snob
E sembrano quelle fighette con le borsette di Louis Vuitton

Baby K,"Chiudo gli occhi e salto fidandomi di un battito oh oh
Anche se non guardo so che mi prenderai

Quando mio padre venne a darmi la notizia
Ormai nulla di speciale è difficile spiegare
La paura non si annuncia mai prima di bussare
Ma tutti quei traslochi da bambina fanno male

E se ci penso non ho avuto mai paura
Ma ciò che vuol dire casa va oltre quattro mura
E ad ogni trasloco salutavo una parte di me
Gli oggetti, gli affetti, un cuore non si crea da se

A scuola sempre quella nuova con l’accento strano
Senza bussola invece il mondo aveva un piano e i ricordi
Come amici e i parenti più lontano seduta al banco immaginando
Mio fratello lì al mio fianco
Ora esito se chiedono chi sono, una vita frammentata in cento mila foto
Chiudere e aprire porte, ricominciare troppe volte
Solo un paracadute e mi sarei sentita forte

Chiudo gli occhi e salto fidandomi di un battito oh oh
Anche se non guardo so che mi prenderai in volo
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

Siamo sopra un filo, noi siamo funamboli
Un filo teso stretto nelle mani degli angeli
E camminiamo sopra a punti interrogativi pregando
Che da questa vita ne usciremo vivi
E il segreto è non guardare giù, ma è guardare in basso
Contare il passo ma non pensarci affatto

Trattengo il fiato e poi mi affiderò al tatto
Trattengo il fiato ancora ad ogni tuo abbraccio
Il tempo tiene il tempo, ballo sul ticchettio
Il problema è che ho dovuto dire troppe volte addio
Paura di abbracciarti poi non sentirti mio
Doverti salutare poi finire nell'oblio

Ciao Ciao
Come ho fatto ai giocattoli e poi le case
Come fanno i lampioni al giorno sulle strade
Non è colpa di mio padre se ho detto ciao a troppi amici
Ricordami come son fatte le radici

Anche se non guardo so che mi prenderai in volo

All'improvviso tutto il mondo cambia pagina
Innamorarsi con la luna nel mare
Partire e tornare
Senza sapere quando
Andata senza ritorno

That I'll never be all right.",The Last Song
Baby Lemonade,"I wanna float like a halo
The heavy air has kept me on the ground
In other days we did so much
When pleasure was a canvas you could brush
When every whisper seemed to say so much
I'm in a role - I'm a player
And all the other stars are almost gone
And all the friends - you miss the most
Where London Bridges fall or so it goes
The cloudy lanes where Eden was 2 close
In the summer we explore
It makes me sad the advance we never had
Tonight I think the show is over
Somebody please clap your hands
Lights are shining somewhere
Life is going nowhere
Lights are shining somewhere
Life is going nowhere
It's a long drive out to happiness
It's all hills when the tank is filled
With rock & roll
And all that we ever found
We could never really leave the ground
And things you want don't stay around
In the summer we made love
It makes me sad - the chance we never had
Tonight - I think the story's over
Somebody please clap your hands
I think the show is over
Oh yeah",Clap Your Hands

Don't want to settle down

Perhaps, we'll meet once again
Trigger happy singers drawing straws
Artist and repetoire
America we gave you all our best
Best regards, no cigar
Perhaps we'll meet once again
You're on your own
You're almost home
All alone

And sleep away the days
And traitors are forgiven
The stars align and all the time is gone
And they say its not worth sleeping
After dawn
(I was stuck in a space and time)
If you give me time
Then I'd know what to do
(Loving a heart that was so unkind)
If you were in my shoes
I would wait for you
So long
In the morning we rub our eyes
And see the world outside the sun is just a reminder of all the times
You'd wish that it would fall
We find we're only sleeping after all
I just wanted to give myself
A gift that 1 could use
Then you start your contemplating
It's not a very complicated song
In the darkness we find out
What we hate about ourselves
I try to sleep with the light on
And fade away in the haze of a dying spark
I never know I miss you until its dark",So Long
Baby Lores,"Lo que sentí, fue como un rayo en mi interior
Que me sorprende el corazón
Todo se rompe, todo estalla
Y algo acaba de morir

Para sentir otra manera de ser feliz
Otra de manera de sufrir
Otra manera de vivir
Lo que hasta ayer era reír

Qué pasara, adónde irán mis juegos a parar
Y mi inocencia a terminar
Qué nuevo amor será
Qué tal si me querrá

Qué voy a hacer si dice no
Ya yo no mando al corazón
Qué confusión, qué dicha, qué dolor

Siento al mirar que todo acaba de cambiar
Y veo las cosas para amar
Adiós infancia, ojalá que te recuerde
En mi vejez, con amor

Turn in seven hundred hours
Turn in circles again

Life in the pen
My brain is mangled,sanity too
Countin' the days
I won't do any listenin'

Keep knocking on the walls
And I'll blow off your balls
Knock on the door
You're asking for more
Come in the room
Gettin' sent your doom

As the waves roll in
My five senses wearin' prim
Waves of tiny people
Trapped in a russian tin
People all over the world are screamin'
For the love of a young child will be fadin'
A taste of water and corruption
While faith and religions all over the world
Self-destruction
Many controllin' the place of a dollar
Or it's a creator on the streets flippin' collars

A bomb with a snake
In both of your fists
While a hurricane was blowin'
Breathing,just around the corner from you

In both of your fists
While a hurricane was blowin'
Breathing,just around the corner from you

Party's empty
While I'm havin' to shave
It doesn't smell good
Beginning to fade

Some positive feed
It's time to create,don't anticipate
Put this all behind
Try to look through
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do

Keep knockin' on the walls

While my dj plays the house decks
See I like the hard age underground
But we're looking for our own sound
Exclude us from the street
We're against what they usually beat
I think it's just a load of drivel
That keeps me hungry and living
Keeping up with a fast pace
Is like some crazy race

I take pistols in the snow
He thinks he's gonna take me
I don't think so

Train passes where they prosecute
So be careful where you tread
It's a land mine baby
Don't go losing your head

Just remember our love
So you won't give up
If you remember our love
So you won't give up

Long gone are the proper sleeves
To walk by our side
Long killed are the visionary souls
Now we're walking blind

The lies are meant to hypnotize
And put you in a spell
Wake up you sleepy heads

Release yourselves from hell
You won't give up
You can't give up

They made us drink salt water
Then sell us liberty
Tell me how can you sell somebody
What's supposed to be free
You know the non-contender for the derelict mind

You starved us baby
And you're gonna shine
You starved us baby
And you're gonna shine
You starved us baby

Fuck creation, fuck creation
Fuck creation, there is no relevance with my life
All I mean is how to fight
Producing the goods I'm fit to make sense

Built with more right
Especially a thing, self-defense
A wasted office in my mind
All the time I've been blind

Race an objective difficult at times
Don't know what to do
Name your Baby Namboo
Mine's far and away the rest is up to you

Politicians are destroying
The dreams of the many
One can inform our country
So they don't spend a penny

Less than our future
On some posh adventure
Driving along Concord Lane
They're looking for adventure

Pick out the homes and count the best bids
Pick out the homes and count the best bids
There's only so much to go around
And they took the life

It's not what you're savin'
It's how much you got
Pick out the homes and count the best bids
Hunt the homes and pick out the best bids

You're on his high and you won't give up
Your tongue is torn and you won't give up
Your back is broke and you won't give up
You're all alone but you're so tough

You won't give up, you won't give up
You starved us baby and you cannot shine
You starved us, baby
",Provoked
Baby Namboos,"You're like the missing piece
Of a day's old puzzle
Try to shut me up
I won't wear your muzzle
Nobody's got my back
I keep it our visual
It's the only way, seems you wanna ridicule
Trials and tribulations
Cross the border through the nations
With your juvenile intentions
Things like our idle expectations
Could you blame us like the famous
We just wanna live like you too
Do what you did to get you through

Devious intentions but its a money making habit
Just a hand to hand transaction
So you might as well just grab it
Station to station 'cause the city never sleeps
Your rhythm driven hard, skips a beat

The weekend's like some kind of Mecca
Slow to come round those lips so wait quicker
48 hours there ain't nothin' much better to do
Than to mess up and get back together
You drink your poison for personal pleasure
Anticipation to arouse your own pleasure
But my force remains the same
Over a billion in making change

Well introducing myself well I'm just too much
The MC on the mic with the magical touch
Can turn silver into gold, fat into grass
When I rock the microphone
I'm bound to pass
I got no oral levels, but massive degrees
The reason for that is plain and easy
'Cause when I went to school
They said I was the weapon
They stand up in the place with the D on my cap
Yes sir
Right about now you're shaking out the original-

It goes

Don't wanna be a hit or part of your clique
About the present situation
Seems that some are in a mission
Tricky you got
You gotta drink to drive
You gotta go a lot
Don't wanna drink from your trough
To the top, but nothing less
While you'd be bidding in your staple nest
You're just bugging so why don't you give it a rest

Tanto dolor por tanta soledad
Que me hare tanto mal (que me hare tanto mal)

Esto que siento yo es mas allá que un gran amor
Pero todo se derrumbó why ya no hay más que tu dolor
Hoy te pido perdón, me estoy muriendo
Porque se va el amor

Baby Rockstar,"When the rain
Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you
Haven't made
Your mind up yet
But I would never
Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change
Are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing
Like me yet

I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you

Baby Rockstar,"Hit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left

I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later and returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload

Babybird,"I hold you closely you push me away
I want forever you just want today
Give me your fingers wash out your mouth
Bite off my tongue on this bloody couch
But I don't blame you
You're always right
I'm like a bad day
On your good good night
I hear the tick of a bomb
All your hair in a fuse
You ask me for a light
To blow away these blues
Run me a bath, then plug me in
I'm like a T.V. learning to swim
But I don't blame you
You're always right
I'm like a bad day
On your good good night
I hold you closely you push me away
I want forever you just want today
Give me your fingers wash out your mouth
Bite off my tongue on this bloody couch
But I don't blame you
You're always right
I'm like a bad day
On your good good good good night
",Goodnight
Babybird,"You asked me not to speak
Then kissed me on the cheek
You said that I was wrong
You said that I was weak
I tried to think awhile
You said I was too long
And when I tried to smile
You sung this pretty song
Drink this baby, it's atomic soda
It'll blow your mind back to how it was
Standing in the snow, icicles on your nose
I felt what once was through your frozen clothes
Standing on the shore, looking at the lake
My arm around you won't stop you shake
In the Wintertime when the leaves are gone
I look at you & wonder what's wrong
You were so strong, I was so weak
Now I can't even get you to speak
",Atomic Soda
Babybird,"It's time to come down from your spire
Jesus come back, you're a liar
I've covered the church in fish wire
I'll know you're here, like hellfire
Hell fire
If we hear a trip in the aisle
Turn on the lights with a big smile
There's no beautiful child
It's tealeaves with the roof tiles
Tealeaves with the roof tiles
We go on home with the radio on
Tune into paradise on the long wave
For a millionth time a born again song
Rings out like a bad shave
",Bad Shave
Babybird,"What is this beautiful thing we've found
It's so shiny, bright & round
So I went into town
And bought a little patch of ground
And I put a shop on top
And bought myself some stock
Oh, my little cornershop
Oh, my little cornershop
Oh I'm so happy I could scream
In my little store on the green
Where everything is fine
Where everything is fine
So fine
I found some corrugated steel
And banged it to the window with my heel
And now nobody's going to get in
After half past ten in the evening
In the evening...
Oh my 2nd little
Oh my 3rd little
Oh my 4th little...cornershop
Oh my 5th little
Oh my 6th little
Oh my 7th little..cornershop
Oh I'm so happy I could scream
In my 8th little store on the green
Where everything is fine
",Cornershop
Babybird,"Take me in your arms again
Wash me in your eyes
Tie me to the house again
Love me 'till love dies
Blame me for everything
Not just the bad times
Whispering sweet nothings in your ear
Just like a dead bird sings
Look into my face again
Between us there's a mile
I can see a hole in the sky
As wide as your smile
As wide as your smile
It's not that you've gone away
It's that I've never met you
But I wish you'd come back to me
Just like the night turns blue
Just like the night turns blue
Just like a dead bird sings
Love me 'till love dies
",Dead Bird Sings
Babybird,"Look at my hands
They're all over you
My rusty nails stuck to you like glue
My arms around you like audio tape
Got a little red horn underneath this cape
It's not dirty
It's not rude
I'll go to Kuwait if I wanna get, wanna get,
Wanna get crude
It's not filthy
It's not lewd
I wanna get famous just so I can get sued
Guess who's my girlfriend, yeah, ten out of ten
Yeah it's Jesus, she's my girlfriend
Want to know who my boyfriend is,
No, nought out of ten
Jesus ain't a man, she's my girlfriend
Jesus is my girlfriend
It's not drink, It's not food
It's a man in a shuttle with a tube
I can't fly, so what, I can't cook
Can't even catch a tune with a hook
I've been to Hong Kong & South Dakota
In a little wood plane without a motor
Got a girl in bed, when I took it further
Where Jamaica? No I coaxed her. Ha! Ha!
I love her
My girlfriend
I love her
My girlfriend
",Jesus Is My Girlfriend
Babybird,"Way up in the clouds
Angels don't fly
Big silver birds
Re-writing the sky
Taxi & take off now
I close your eyes
Look out of the window
Watch the ground die
I live all day-to vacate the place-I love-uh huh
I work all day-to leave the way I live-behind
Way down on the ground
People don't fly
But here we at the airport
Like ladybirds in July
Just like back home
I wish that you were here
If I had a cellular phone
I'd drown it in my beer
I was once like you
Dreaming you were me
Locked inside your pretty head
Wishing I was free
But I was so different then
And you were roughly the same
Love was in your pretty head
And sex was on my brain
",July
