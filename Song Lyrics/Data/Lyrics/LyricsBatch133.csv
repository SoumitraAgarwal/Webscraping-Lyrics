Game,"[Intro/Chorus - sample]
-- Don't cry [5X] don't..
-- Don't cry [5X] don't..

[The Game]
Amayah wake up baby
I know you're sleepin, but daddy's home now
Pictures gettin old, my lil' girl lookin grown now
Your moms said you're talkin on your own, walkin on your own now
Run across the kitchen floor in them baby drawers
I sent you from off tour and I miss you when I was tourin
Smilin at them baby pictures, so happy, tears pourin
God how can somethin so beautiful come from me?
After the gunshots thought you was done with me
But I know I'm livin now, why you made me put the guns down
Pick up the mic, start rappin for a living now
My sun, my moon, my starts, my earth
My wind, my fire, my life, my bay-bay
Tryin to make your moms life ya must be crazy, fussin and fightin
I know she love me cause ya look just like me
Day you came into this world I was so excited
Eleven twenty-one double-zero, my baby girl is here

[Chorus]

[Blue Chip]
Yo, yo, you see this rap shit I do it for you
And the first time I heard your voice I prayed to God it had to be true
Got a son now, cuttin the game, stoppin the bullshit
Remember eyein your enemy, can you pull quick
Dipped out Cali, came back, snatched my son
my girl moms and I moved out Maui
Yeah your pops gone bananas, seen wild went hard
Bigger house, wider yard, nappy with the crash bar
Off that hersh', shit you stupid, you ain't no dad nigga
Takin your black ass to court for all you have nigga
You see me and your moms, that's another topic
Ain't no whip in this world with a price you can't cop it
Stop it, press rewind, you didn't hear me right
It's a lesson to the song, I'm tryin to steer you right
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home
Never sing that sad song, don't cry

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Huh daddy ain't gon' preach to you, I'ma let your moms school you
Don't let the streets fool you, streets'll do you, that's why I'm talkin to you

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, you see these niggaz out here, have you stressin by the hour
Never turn your back on your foes, them dudes cowards

[The Game]
Some days sweet, and some sour - but we gon' make it together
The world is ours, and you're my flower

[Blue Chip]
If it's ice you can get that, model chicks hit that
Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback

[The Game]
And I ain't sayin sex is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on
And never, ever do it in your mother's home

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar
Ain't nothin free, scrape and lock every dollar

[The Game]
And I will leave you with this, my lil' angel, daddy loves you
How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, switchin handles like you breakin a zone, candy paint Impala
On the Golden Bridge, bouncin on chrome

[Chorus]",Don't Cry
Game,"Father you give us power to speak the word father
You say
We have but to ask with a sincere heart and it will be
So we thank you for this spoken word father
You say that when one or more come together 
In your name your presents will be felt
So we now only ask to feel your presents 
We need to feel your presents father
We thank you for the blessings you have given us this day
Things that people don't even realize that are blessings
The food you have given us to eat

The cars you have given us to drive
The cloths you have given us to wear
The money you have given us to spend
The lives you have allowed us to touch
And the lives that have touched our own 
We thank you for all these things father in the name of Jesus
We thank you again for the power of the spoken word
I pray that by the end of this day this word 
Which is your word coming through my mouth
Will touch someone
And save someone's life
In Jesus mighty name I pray
Amen amen",Outro
Game,"You can catch five or catch me in the C.L.5
Whatever way dog, the game get live
Keepin' it gangsta in a P.D. city velor
Late night, I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four

The hood love me, hood rats gotta hug me
Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly
Rock the mic anywhere and I ain't talkin' 'bout a concert dog
Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in converse dog

Get it crackin' like we out in the yard and the warden's watchin'
Only difference is the whores is watchin'
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like

I'm a gangsta bay-bee, from the C.P.T.
Run with the pound like I'm from D.P.G.
If it's beef, you see-Murder like it ain't no limit
And I represent the P like Russell Simmons

I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the black socks and get low we get dough
In the yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'

I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the black socks and get low we get dough
In the yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'

I'm a shinin' star
And I gotta hit the boulevard in that new jaguar
Why he move through traffic like that, Purple Haze
Ralways, The Ojays, the gangsta lean so

Please believe that I keep two G's in my jeans
Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my beam'
X-5, mami let's ride
Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy

It's the kid from the far west I, oh, shit
He know how to do more than flip pies
Get money like them stick up guys
Them ""Ocean 11"" licks got the young kid rich for life

And I talkin' 'bout a movie or George Clooney
I'm talkin' 'bout, runnin' in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi
Dude me? Naw truly, might lose your lives
They say, ""I've, got 2K2 covered like A.I.""

I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the black socks and get low we get dough
In the yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'

I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the black socks and get low we get dough
In the yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'

I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin' rocky
The trey with the Broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki
Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes
A.D. jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels

In my neighborhood, I'm young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face and run up in the place
I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang
80 karats on my pinky and rang

Crews buzz when you speakin' my name, 'cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes
I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones
You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home

In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high
Now we soarin' through the spacious skies
Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up
Switchin' gears with the pedal and ride

I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the black socks and get low we get dough
In the yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'

I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right

Game,"Sometimes I wonder
Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come up
Man, we strugglin', it's hard sometimes
But tomorrow's better than yesterday

I was born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction
Darker complexion made it hard to live

Dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life
Left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shh, I'm still hearin' my mother's cries, nigga

No father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz
From what I saw in the picture

Now your son is bigger, thirteen, looks just like you
Mom said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister, she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me, just like you

Gunnin' for riches, runnin', hoppin' project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin' till my coffee diminish
Why pray for the after life when mines just beginnin', huh

Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one, I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before The Game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times again

Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father bear the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rollin' over in his coffin'

I'm left with often thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man, you oughta be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage

High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you were scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker",Just Beginning (Where I'm From)
Game,"I woke up out that coma 2001
'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin, wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

This song is dedicated to Yetunde Price
The sister of Venus and Serena Williams
Who was slain during a gang shootout in Compton

Olivia, let's go 
What's up ladies, I'm back baby 
The boy wonder got the club goin' crazy 
I'm two-steppin' in my armor, in my 80 
But I ain't in the VIP unless they pay me 
It's like I practice stuntin' 
Ma, I have ya mattress jumpin' 
And I know it sounds like I'm frontin' but I ain't 
Jerk, jerk ya body and work, work 'em proudly 
Go and hurt somebody if I don't hit that 
If you don't see 'em with me don't ask 'bout 50 
'Cause if he was here he'd be standing right here 
And if you don't care so much about my fame 
Then why you keep starin' at my chain 
I'm doin' my thing 
From the club to the telly on a late night 
Box of Magnums, sippin' Henn, finna get right 
Checkout time ain't 'til daylight 
From the club to the telly on a late night 

{Olivia} 
Ooh babe, you know I like it when you feel on me 
Pullin' on my waste, I'm feelin' energy 
Gettin' kinda hard to keep ya hands off me{Yeah, right there} 
So slide a little lower, put ya hands on my thigh 
Maybe I know you like it if that's right 
I'ma show you how to make it last all night 
Now let me see you shake it 

{Chorus}: 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 
Work that body, gettin' so crazy 
Don't hurt nobody up in this party 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 
Work that body, gettin' butt-naked 
Don't hurt nobody up in this party 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 

Mix a little hypno with some Hennessey 
Like the way this jig goes when it goes through me 
Think I need to stop because I'm feelin' tipsy 
{One more drink} 
Baby now I can't stop 'cause I'm in the zone 
Shorty keep it comin' boy, I'm grown 
I don't want to finish this dance alone 
Ooh I want to see ya

Row, row, row down low, shake it fast for me 
Work your body, don't hurt nobody up in this party

Game,"Ya, let's take em back
Uh huh

Coming up I was confused my momma kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I want to live good, so should I sell dope for a fo-finger ring
Money and them gold ropes
Santa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep at night
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop
Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't going nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop
Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't going nowhere so you can get to know me

On the grill of my low rider
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires
I'll four-five 'em
Kill a nigga on my song but really do it
That's the true meaning of a ~ghostwriter~
10 G's will take ya daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homie I know all bout losses
I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been banging since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's
That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die rather homicide
I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop
Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP

From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fucking with ~5-0~ it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brendas still throwing babies in the garbage
I want to know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No school books they use that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion
I love ya Ma'

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top

Who don't love us, every hood throwin' they dubs up
Who the fuck why'all thought was comin' after Young Buck
Hip hops worst nightmare, Mr. Gangsta Rap is back in black Nike Airs
You want war, we can settle it right here
I got a squad, E-V-E and Busta Rhymes yeah
Or you could give me ya bitch, her with the light hair
Sit her next to these yellow bottles, tea right there
Matter fact I'll take you in the back
You in the hat, and you in the blue and the black

Like Dre did, I created a buzz without a single like N.W.A. did
From the hood -liquor- store to the state pen
This is gin and juice
The doc made the club R.O.C. without Timbaland boots
First nigga to put drolex on a Bentley coupe
You want to pimp? I perm my shit up like snoop (Westside)
Chronic 2005 motherfucker, put the purple in the dutch
""Let it Burn"" like Usher girl
Drop down, do the eagle, fuck that
Real niggaz just pull up they pants and lean back girl
Make 50 spill his cris, he'll call you a bitch
I'ma call you and hit , you can ya girlfriend, we can make it a flick
I got the lollipop if you want to lick
Or you can take a ride on the magic stick

[Chorus:]

Put 25's on the hummer, why not
I'ma be here for the next 10 summers
Drop me in the 4th quarter I'm fuckin' up they money
I don't need sound scan I'm doin' my own numbers
When that impala bounce you can see the chrome under
I got em' in every color yea I'm a known stunner
When I hit a switch I get higher than long jumpers
Low ridin' with a hood rat or a grown woman
And I'll do anything but I won't fuck Mariah
Even if she had Ashanti butt naked in bed
'Cause she got a forehead just like Tyra
I can say what the fuck I want, you thought Dre retired
Left me in 6-4 his Dayton wires
These niggaz is a waste of rhymin', Doc got something to say be quiet

Look out for Detox

This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

Fresh like, unhh; Impala, unnh
Chrome hydraulics, 808 drums
You don't want none, Nigga betta run
When beef is on I'll pop that trunk
Come get some, Pistol grip pump
If a nigga step on my white Air Ones
It's red rum, Ready here I come
Compton unh, Dre found me in the slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin rocks when Master P was sayin ""Unnnh""
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have fun
Coke and rum, Got weed on the ton
I'm bangin with my hand up her dress like, unh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front, in case a nigga wanna stunt

I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-ca-lade
Low pro so look like I'm riding on blades
In one year mane, a nigga 's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (Ah!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it girl
You know I'm rockin with the best Tré pound on my hip
Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good, cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around

Game,"Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running

With 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car
Blowing horns like Miles Davis
At the pearly gate, God let me in
Give me a room by Aaliyah with ESPN
I know I got more sins than two lesbians
Been back and forth across the border like Mexicans
But I'm running like New York pedestrians
Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again
It's funny how niggas be the best of friends
And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
One of my niggas in the grave the other one in the pen
She fucking my enemies inside my homeboys Benz
Now she begging God's mercy cause she ain't listen to Nas
And never heard about Ike and the Iverson jersey
He got a cousin named Jayceon that rock the Gary Payton
Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient, true story

Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running

If I get knocked with my gun nigga I'm running
If I catch a murder one nigga I'm running
Homicide come around and they keep on coming
That's why I'm out of state and I keep on running
I ain't Nelly but my Desert Eagle's on girl
Just dropped bail traveling the world
When I sign my deal I said fuck jail
I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil
This shit real fuck an appeal
D's want my head like that bitch in Kill Bill
Sling dope sling crack and them E pills
That's why I'm on the low like a damn navy seal, I'm running

Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running

Cause I gotta pack them shows
And Dre told me ain't no coming back from gold
So I gotta get my album in place
My G-Unit features, my Eminem sixteens, my Dr. Dre beats
And it was two years from today when I started rhyming
And took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me
Niggas threatening my life like it's hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head, I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggas they own shoes
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot
I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggas trying to gun me down in the rim shop
Cause I just want the same recognition that the Crips got
They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot
Then I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop
Make your chest move, Sylvia Rome and Kevin Lyle slept cool
Jimmy Iovine was the best move

Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny

Game,"Sometimes I wonder
Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come out
Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but
Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uhh

[The Game]
I was, born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion
Made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?

Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shhhh, I'm still here, my mother's cries
Nigga no father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz from what I saw in the picture

Now your son is bigger, 13, but just like you
Moms said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you

Gunnin for riches, runnin hoppin project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin 'til my coffee diminish
Why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin, huh

[The Game]
Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before the game, everything came with pain

Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father, that have the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree

I can see him rollin over in his coffin
I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man you ought of, be dead in a grave

But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Would of been dead in an hour
Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker

[The Game]
All my niggaz listen, huh
I stay a step ahead of the rest of y'all
Why I gotta keep a vest for y'all
Though I made it dog I still stress for y'all
Funny how my folks think rap money stretch so far

Pray to God my niggaz see through all the checks and the cars
I'm tryin to invest in what's ours, gimme a couple of years dog
I'll turn your tears stress and your scars
Into lawn chairs and green grass in your yard

I'm tryin to watch my kids wrestlin yours
Not have to get 'em ready for school and strap a vest on 'em all
I know sometimes it get hard
Keep your head up mami, reach for the stars

Havin a child is like a blessing from God
You just gotta work hard, can't let your youngest star strip in that bar
I feel your pain, this shit is rippin my heart
But where and when do we start, listen to the voice in back of my mind

Can't reach all my women so I attack it in rhyme

My tool spit, metal to your side, watch you lose hips
And I ain't want to take it there but fuck it we can bang
My Cali headbusters'll show you how to throw them things
I'm too connected like John Gotti and Nino
For a small fee they find your body wreakin out in Reno
I know the niggaz that sell weight, and niggaz that stick the niggaz
That sell weight, hammer close behind me like when you tailgate
I know you a snitch, I can see it in your eyes

I'm runnin you out of office you're softer than Bush and Cheney
Go 'head, and try to play me I do you like I was Amy Fisher
Smokin a Swisher like I wish a bitch would
Listen and use your vision cause livin in this - hood
And sinnin in your division you think it's all - good
Got niggaz on (Death Row) and it ain't about Suge
Niggaz that stay home they scared to come out shook
Mothers with five kids and all of 'em got took
It's right in these niggaz face, but they just will not look
I'm tired, of the B.S. I'm cheatin {?} some rejects
Even though we make the best of what little respect, we get
This is the life, that was given to me
A rich-ass bitch that's what I'm fittin to be
Brooklyn to Bangkok I'm beggin to be
And don't nobody write, what I'm spittin but me

Put yo' knuckles up, catch you slippin dawg
That's how we do it independent now we 'bout to ball

For years niggaz sold me dreams that got me gassed
Made me want to get revenge or get the hockey mask
Got beef? Yo the burner's in the lobby stashed
Get your crew if you want, all them niggaz is probably ass
I take the long way, fuck takin the shortcut
Now we got corporate sponsorships wrappin our tour bus
A quick 32, yo them shits is like warmups
It ain't coincidental in the hood we was born tough
You chump or get chumped, punk or get punked
Save your lil' craps homey, fuck it get drunk
Was one at the top, but now I'm back at the bottom
Most 'em hate to spit with me cause when I rap I surprise 'em
Shit is real, that's why I stay strapped with a condom
I keep 31 flavors just like Baskin & Robbins
I'm here now, y'all supposed to be stressed, scared to death
That you gonna be next, record labels, promote the rejects
While starvin artists is closest to sets
And certain niggaz duckin me because they owe me a check
I spit more heat, than a bowl of chili, y'all niggaz know the deally
So turn the music up and roll a Philly

[Verse Four: JT]
Yeah, roll the Philly or Swisher Sweet
And I ain't trippin while you niggaz just stand on your feet
Figgaro done walked in the building, it's time to expand
Comin with hundreds of grands and hundreds of plans
You see this Black Wall Street is for the po' broke and hongry
None of my niggaz on the corner never be lonely
Stuck in the gutter mayne, coke packs like Tony
Bricks and pounds of weed half the city owe me
My shipment too big, frontin out the homies

If it's gon' get me the pussy I'ma play that shit
If she bite too hard, I'ma say that shit
But don't bite me bitch, I don't play that shit
Marques Houston, I don't play that shit
By the time we got halfway through watchin' ""Ray"" I hit
I laid it down beat it up, let her go clean it up
Take a five minute nap, wake up and eat it, what
The it's part two, in the sauna

I told you the bitch sex was wack

You know what they say, more money more problems more drama
Means more marijuana and less baby mama
You know I love you like I love my shoes
But even white Air Force Ones come in twos
Yeah, I like her, and I like you too
What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo
She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley Coupe
She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school
I gave you your Burkin' bags, so I made a mistake
And Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway
I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through
But I ain't goin' nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu
Why we always gotta argue about Superheads book?
She sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook
And when she start talkin' 'bout buyin' a ring
I just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing

C'mon nigga, let's take ya ass to your crib, man, 
You're tired, nigga, and put your drink down, nigga, we got to go, nigga

I didn't mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank
Like (la la la)
Now I'm sittin' in this goddamn cage
Reminiscin' about my day
With your blood all over my Slate
As the devil sings (la la la)

[The Game]
Dre, I ain't mean to turn my back on you
But I'm a man, and sometimes a man do, what he gotta do
Remember, I'm from Compton too
I saw you and Eazy in 'em, so I started wearin' khaki suits
I was 12 smokin' chronic, in '92
I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you
I made a choice, now its be Crip or be Piru
Whatever I was, I was bangin' 'Gin & Juice'
Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop
Now I gotta keep it gangster, cause its in my roots
So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you
I tried to think of what the fuck Eminem might do
If every nigga hated him, for the 'Black Bitch' track
And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after T-Boz got slapped
When Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I never said 'Thank You', and I took for granted
You let me in your house, and made me a part of your family
Now I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes
I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed
And even though sometimes I run loose
You still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you
I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef
But you told me it was OK to say ""Fuck The Police""
Now its my turn to carry the torch
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source
Remember when we got drunk, to do ""Start From Scratch""?
I told you you was like a father to me I meant that
Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plaques
Thinkin' what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track
When Doc say its a rap - its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
See when the world is on your shoulder and the stress grows bigger
The fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga
Most of the time I let 'em know I don't agree wit' what he do
But he a hard-head Dre thats why I'm talkin' to you
See when I first met my nigga son was layin' in the cut
Tight, reserve, homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck
And as the time went on, now he was workin' with the finest
I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave 'em additional guidance
You gave him something that can make or break a nigga you should face it
So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
The only problem was our little nigga wouldn't listen
But when Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer - I know when to pop
Wait till Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I have the number one billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top

I watched my uncle Greg put D's on his six-fo'
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Shopped crack and watched ""Colors"" and I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40-ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my pops flashed the 'Vette
Till one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Block they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga wit' a Black Panther tat
Kill a nigga cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older I would understand that
It's blood in blood out and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13 that's when I had my first

I was the first nigga wit' a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and let the motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40-ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard so I stole my brother's glock
And that's the day my life changed 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that Chronic from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40-ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my adidas
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society
But I never left fingerprints on my

This is life stop watchin' that ""Boyz N The Hood"" shit
You see this red rag hangin' out of my jeans?
I went to twenty funerals by the age of nineteen
Then I went to college basketball was my dream
Quit the team 'cause I rather shoot rock wit' the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac thought I was rich bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin' till I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in

[Chorus]

[Repeated: x4]
Ol' English",Ol' English
Game,"[Chorus]
I only fuck with you on two occasions
When I'm drunk, when I'm high
I will be broke, if I would be with you
That is why it's for one night (one one one one)

I'm a motherfuckin' gang bangin' nightmare
Wake up motherfuckers, I traded in my white Nike Airs
For a red pair of converse, Back to the hood
My own niggas actin' like I turned my back on the hood
I used my rap money to put crack in the hood
Even brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood
I show niggas the Bentley, then let you drive it
Gone for 2 days and I didn't even check the mileage
When we was fighting with Crips it wasn't bout no dollars
It was about selling dope to put our kids through college
I'm sittin' on the block reminiscing for hours
Whipping my tears cause now half of my niggas is cowards
And I was still fuckin' with niggas
After I got shot and didn't get one hospital visit
My homie Snoop told me it be days like this
It hurt my heart to say this shit

[Chorus]

Red bandanna in my back pocket I'm for real
This ain't no pastel color khaki suit and I ain't Pharrell
I don't front bout shit, I pull my gun bout shit
And let everything fly to keep my son up out of this
I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap
Remember, the bullet holes in my son's car seat
My baby momma found four shells
I ain't get one keep your head up
All I got was keep it real, Keep it real my niggas?
Last year alone I spent 1.5 mil on my niggas
After the bullshit I stayed right there
Took you to award shows there go Jay right there
""Where?"" ""Right there""
I had you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs
I'm suppose to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear
The last 12 months been a fuckin' nightmare

[Chorus]

This shit is worst then arguing with my bitch
I done been through more up and downs then an Impala switch
Get your hand out of my pocket nigga, go fish
I was born by myself so I don't owe yall shit
Nigga you tell me, what you want me to do
Drop my son off at home and come bang with you?
Oh now it's fuck Game, Naw Nigga fuck you
I put that on my life, matter of fact that's on Piru
And really is I can die too
And end up in the cemetery, right beside you
We can both ride, Angels flying over my head stone
But the devils inside your box
You wanted my shine so I gave you ice
Then I gave you a second change and you played me twice
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save your life
I should of took Dr.Dre's advise

[Chorus]",One Night
Game,"As my, Daytons spin, lowrider sittin low
Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims
Rag top six-fo', Henny in the passenger side
Smokin chronic just let me ride
You would do it if my name was Dre, second comin motherfucker
Throw it up for the king of L.A
I'm known for makin bitches take they clothes off
Long as I'm from Compton, California I could never go soft
I'm hard as a motherfuckin ounce of raw
Dribble rock like Kobe Bryant bounce the ball
Fuck the law!! Feedin my son is a must
Whip it soft, whip it hard, in crack we trust
Why Andrew Jackson look high as fuck on the 20, G answer
Cocaine been around for centuries
Since I'm young, black and rich, I'm the public enemy
Ridin the bass drum, Just Blaze got the remedy

I got the remedy
Aftermath got the remedy
Nigga back up (back up) back up (back up)
'Fore you get your punk-ass smoked

I ain't no joke G, so don't provoke me
I'm from the city of angels where that Jacob watch is a trophy
And starin at that Hollywood sign'll get you straight jacked
(Where you from fool?) Better say you pro-black
Causin walkin in Roscoe's wit'cha chain hangin
Is like Giuliani tryin to get rid of the gangbaners
Now that 'Pac passed, tryin to put us on Death Row
Get ready for the Aftermath
I run through the city like Godzilla
Doin mo' damage than Ice-T when he dropped Cop Killa
Pull a shotty out the trunk of the Chevy
There go another victim of a one-eight-seven
Who's the grim reaper wit'cha life in his hand
Even the toughest niggas run when my gun go... blam
So kick back and watch the bitches dance
N.W.A. is back, now let me see your motherfuckin hands

I got the remedy
Aftermath got the remedy
Nigga back up (back up) back up (back up)
'Fore you get your punk-ass smoked

I'm back by popular demand and so
All black interior on the cherry red six-fo'
Niggas endin they careers tryin to shut me up
Actin like I traded in my khakis for a button up
The West Coast still dippin
Game still Bloodin, and Snoop still Crippin
So what you sayin loc? Red and blue bandana
Tied in a knot, as I creep through the chronic smoke
They say it ain't good weed if you don't choke
Shit got my head spinnin like the hundred spokes
Three wheelin through the neighborhood
System on blast, as the motherfuckin one-time pass
The key to drivebys is aim steady
Turn that Bape hoody into motherfuckin confetti
When you cross that enemy line
Close your eyes, parental discretion is advised",Remedy

More beef and more straps

I was the Aftermath remedy 'til friends turned enemies

One man show, still sell a motherfucker out...
With no Dre still sell the motherfucker out
Cause everybody here from the (Streets of Compton)
We got Crip niggas, Blood niggas, ese's, asians
Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces
I kept you niggas waitin', had to take you back to the basics
Switch the Impala from gold to chrome Dayton's
Everytime your bitch hear my voice she masturbatin'

Every nigga in the industry done fucked Super Head
(Shit) And I just might fuck her too
If I ever catch her slidin' or ridin' through the (Streets of Compton)
Rollin' down Green Leaf, smokin' on that green leaf
With a Mack 10 like was born on Queens St
Murder MC's like I was born in Queensbridge
That's how I show you pawn niggas where the king is
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock

Game,"[Swizz Beatz]
Yeah, y'all really want this to happen? (Game time!)
C'mon!

[The Game]
Homey it's hard not to kill niggas, it's like a full time job
Not to pull out the steel and shove it in your grill
Young California got that mass appeal
I summons the hood, they get up in yo' ass for real
Knockout flow, Winky Wright jab for real
And all you niggas pussy, need Massengil
See I'm the gun-cocker, one-shotter, lift 'em off the ground
Chop 'em down, like a cantaloupe, my flow the antidote
Sick flow, it's so, motherfuckin' six-four
Your bitch know, hop in the back when you see Swizz hoe
This that, all you niggas get up off my dick so
I can cook crack on the track and watch it mix slow
Cocaine, my flow fire, call it propane
Every nigga know Game, five shots no pain
And that's the reason why I'm shittin' on you niggas
Shut me in the looney bin, I'm sicker than you niggas

[Chorus: x2]
This is that disrespectful, motherfuckin' West coast
Hip-hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go!

[The Game]
Where I'm from, I seen the most stand up niggaz lay down
Where skinny niggas make buff niggas victims of that trey-pound
And gang-bangers is the sharpshooters, we don't need no rooftops
Just knock his ass down and take the money out his tube socks
West coast niggas is back on the map
If only for now until the next time I body a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back, and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggas, make money with the smartest niggas
I ain't got time for you fuckin' artist niggas
Better shut your trap before you become a target nigga
Y'all army brats I'm the motherfuckin' sergeant nigga
Beauty pageant-ass niggas on the runway
(Boyz N The Hood) till they see the nigga in that red Hyundai
Blow his fuckin' back out, cause I'm the rap Stack-house
Black Wall Street bitch, the hip-hop crack-house, what?

[Chorus: x2]

[The Game]
My flow opposite of handsome, it's ugly
Hip hop tantrum, sick, call the shit cancer
One man show cause I fucked all the dancers
Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer
These niggas let the rumors sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back, to toothbrush on the Pumas
Clean, mean, rappin' machine
Red rag hangin low in the back of my jeans
I black out like February, back out what's necessary
Oh-seven Bugatti with Jimmy Iovine's secretary
I'm runnin' the buildin', don't make me run in the buildin'
No this ain't the first time I had my gun in the buildin'
Walkin' past offices I see my son in the buildin'
Last album on the wall I'm number one in the buildin'
They should build me an office up under the buildin'
My elevator goin' down, I am done in the buildin' nigga

You ain't got your motherfuckin' mind right?
You gon' get your mind blown out your motherfuckin' mind right nigga
It is what the fuck it is man
How y'all wanna cut the cake?
You touch this you get your hands cut off, nigga
Swizz Beatz the motherfuckin' monster

We could turn this whole motherfuckin' world red nigga
Bitch!",Scream on Em
Game,"I'm from the old hood, somethin' like yo' hood
Where niggas don't know good, or know Suge, but the blow good
So we rock it like Tracy McGrady
Send it to Houston in a gray Mercedes
I'm a product of my environment, grew up in the 80's
So that mean, me Kanyeezy and Young Jeezy all crack babies
And it's evident my flow is heaven-sent
First LP, on the same shelf as the veterans
Nigga I can't be fucked, like a lesbian
I'm to hip-hop what Cartoon is to Mexicans
I'm an artist, never claimed to be the hardest
Just number one since B.I.G. and Pac departed
Nate ridin' with me, Snoop ridin' with me
All you other niggas used to be good like Ken Griffey
I'm on fire like the tip of a blunt
On fire like a nigga that let it drip for a month
I'm a Blood, you can Crip if you want, just let it bump
Like you got Scott Storch tied up in the trunk
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin' her by the arm, cause she stared
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

I thought I told y'all
I'm done with the beef, clown, my son three now
And I've been watchin' Dre so long I'm makin' beats now
Game on the rebound like Ben Wallace in the D-Town
I mean Chi-Town, fuck it, it can go down
Nigga I spit the whole round, fo' plus fo' pounds
Nigga this the wild wild West, call it a showdown
And I'm Billy the Kid 'til they split my wig
I come back from the dead, tell 'em kill me again
Put my head on a barrel, dare a nigga to shoot me
I'm gangsta, took more shots than Tookie
I'm alive, so I'mma take a Patron shot for Tookie
Roll a California blunt and keep watchin' a movie
Inspired by this gangbangin' shit since I was two
I brought the West coast back, what the fuck you do?
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin' her by the arm, cause she stared
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

Drive fast, both hands on the dash
Close both of your eyes and hope that you don't crash
It's lyrical homicide, both airbags out
Roll the fuckin' windows down, let the bass out
Niggas, drop the top on whatever you in
Bitches, let your ponytail blow in the wind
Inhale the chronic, blow out dollar signs
Nigga you can drive a Bentley if only in your mind
Four doors, leather and wood
Ride like I got a horse stable under my hood
And I keep a chrome fo'five under my hood
So if I die, nigga bury me under my hood
Who had the hottest bitch in the game, wearin' they chain
Mr. H to the Izzo, Nas and Hurricane
Long as my family straight, read this at my wake
I gave 'em The Documentary and they scraped the plate
Twenty magazine covers, nigga look at his face
I can not, will not ever be replaced
Cause I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin' her by the arm, cause she stared
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

He wolfin' a lot of shit, he look scared
You can't find your girl, she right here
I'm not a bad dream, I'm a nightmare

And Cam got shot inside his Lambo it's ample
Life is a gamble, 15 years old red rag around my head
My sisters used to laugh and call me Rambo
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindle the flame Dre created The Game
Nigga Wit a Attitude from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown clown I rock a L.A. Dodger fitted

Back when Proof was in the booth and I recited his lines
And I still think about my nigga from time to time
Make me wanna call 50 and let him know what's on my mind

Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

Not to brag but, if it add up

Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team

Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo

I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow

And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel
Checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same bitch, that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina

Run up on 'em like these rap niggas, I ain't gotta clap niggas
End your career with one line, like that nigga
Hit the switch (front and back), make it bounce (let it jump)
Killaforn-I-A is where I'm from 
Three-wheelin' with the ass out
Smoke chronic 'til I pass out
Holdin' weight at my nigga Daz house
He always got a thick bad bitch from Long Beach
She a known freak and she got a long reach
She gon' touch it, suck it, fuck it
Never back down, especially when Al Green in the background
Now bitch, hit the weed and turn that ass 'round
It's time to bring back ""Chronic"" and the ""Doggystyle""
West Coast niggas still holdin' shit down

I'm back on the cover of The Source and the XXL
Floatin' all through the (Streets of Compton)
I got more bitches, more plaques
More beef and more straps
That's what the fuck I call gangsta rap
I was the Aftermath remedy 'til friends turned enemies
Streets kept me laced like blunts dipped in Hennessy
You niggas act like The Game can't roll 'em out
One man show, still sell a motherfucker out 
With no Dre still sell the motherfucker out
'Cause everybody here from the (Streets of Compton)
We got Crip niggas, Blood niggas, ese's, Asians
Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces
I kept you niggas waitin', had to take you back to the basics
Switch the Impala from gold to chrome Dayton's
Everytime your bitch hear my voice she masturbatin'
I run through hoes like Walter Payton, on the daily
I got your main bitch swallowin' my babies

I'm a G, you can't see, me
That must be, why you're talkin'

Glasshouse parked sideways on the stock rims
New-school, old-school mentality
Translation fours pumps and twelve batteries
Hydraulics make the world go round, your girl go down
Chronic make your girl slow down
Before she end up like Superhead (uh), givin' super head (uh)
Every nigga in the industry done fucked Super Head
(Shit) And I just might fuck her too
If I ever catch her slidin' or ridin' through the (Streets of Compton)
Rollin' down Green Leaf, smokin' on that green leaf
With a Mack 10 like was born on Queens St
Murder MC's like I was born in Queensbridge
That's how I show you pa niggas what a king is
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock
I'm in the Hall of Fame, next to Snoop behind Pac
I got the whole motherfuckin' world locked

Im a gangbanger don’t get it fucked up you aint never bang, you aint never laces chucks up
So how the fuck you gon criticize me, I aint the reason niggas is bangin the nyc
Makin bullshit threats on the m.i.c. I don’t wake up in cold sweats when I sleep
I live comfortably with a red rag tied around the 45 in case nigga try to come for me
Mad cause I started my own company I don’t know what the fuck niggas want from me
Except something for free before the documentary dropped, you bitch niggas wasn’t bumpin me
And to some degree, I gotta keep that 4-5th under me, I don’t run from beef
It’s either cock back, squeeze, or be underneath, cause im from the streets of (compton)
And my grandmother died before I was multi, wasn’t raised right cause my parents was both high
High off cocaine, my introduction to the dope game came in 85 watchin soul train
Mama told me I was the future, and one day I’d be high like soul plane
Just don’t bang, but back then, I’d do anything for a Jerri-curl and a gold chain
Niggas always got something to say, like they aint never bumped N.W.A.
Punk niggas talk shit, but when they need hits they come runnin to Dre
Niggas come to LA when they need to talk, cause kanye told everybody Jesus walks
Bush killed more niggas in the towers then gangbanging ever did, that’s why they need new york

Nigga hating on me cause I'm doin my own thang
I ain't Lloyd Banks, bitch. I don't share your brain
I was in the fast lane before the G-Unit chain
You was hatin on Ja cause him and Irv went pop
now your ass run around singing the Candy Shop
After 'Westside Story' I took your fans
I sing it for myself that bitch Olivia's a man.
I got word from the wise nigga you dead wrong
stole the real 50's name and wouldn't pay for his headstone
Nigga got mad when 'How We Do' start climbin
acting like a bitch cause he Got Rich and Stop Tryin'
Got niggas locked up you a snitch in Queens
Told them Touch shot Pac then ratted out Supreme
But on the rizeal I'm talkin about you and me

The life of your story is fuckin' Vivica
But your baby mama left you cause you couldn't get it up, bitch

Banks sold a mil
then Buck sold a mil

Yeah Yeah

All the jewelry on your whole crew that's my tax money
That Pablo Escobar crack money
That Lebron first nike contract money
That make it rain all my niggas throw a stack money
Stack it to the ceiling then call it Shaq money
That walk in the club, straight to the back money
Flavor of love delicious sittin' on my lap money
That rat money niggas get clapped money
Air force ones don't bend when I track money
Oh I'm rich like porter,
Havin' Alpo nightmares whippin' that border
Like McDonald's I was flippin' them orders
In that '02 Porsche truck weavin' through borders
I was through flippin' quarters When I made my first mil
I'm about a dollar 50 cent ain't real

Ooh Somebody tell snoop to pop open them briefcases
Order that patron tell em we want 3 cases
Fuck a black card you see these green faces
Look at my chest, now you've seen Vegas
Treat my money like the Crystal that we wastin'
Cause I'm a money machine I can re-make it
You a fool thinkin' that Freddy can see Jason
I been iced out like who the fuck need Jacob
The doc told me to be patient but I walked
Money like the white Howard next time he a free agent
I'm tryin' to make enough money so I can feed Asia
Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V aprons
Word to Martha Stewart if I can park a Buick
Then I can flip a breech truck I got the heart to do it
Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it
Speak no englis but Dinero I talk it fluent

JUST BLAZE!
(""No more fun and games!"")

Gangsta gangsta, that's already evident
Nigga Witta Attitude, check check my residence
Whether I'm Crip or Blood, homey that's irrelevant
I with the D.O.C., there's nobody better than
The West coast felon when he on that lowrider bike pedallin
Somebody tell Eazy they still yellin it
I'm wit'cha homey Doc Dre on the television
While these niggas movin peanuts like a elephant
I move cars like spinnin rims
I'm in a class all by myself like the brown Eminem
Not to down Eminem, I fuck black bitches
Fuck white bitches, nigga I like bitches
Them half-and-half Alicia Keys dyke bitches
If the head right I might Air Nike bitches
Or put 'em on the track like Just Blaze
I look down on hoes and look up to Dre
Cause ain't (""No more fun and games!"")

(""Leroy!"") ("".. now pay attention"")

I'm like Dre, Eazy, Cube, King Tee and Ren rolled in one
Used to move birdies 'til I put a hole in one
Nigga that thought I wasn't holdin a gun
And tried to ride up on me like Afeni Shakur's only son
Dre told me he ain't doin Detox, this his only run
Mase comin back, and Hov, he done
I'm surrounded by legends, sittin at the round table
I am The Game, and still niggas tryin to play dude
I'm ruthless, I ain't talkin 'bout the label
I'll hook niggas up, and I don't mean free cable
I mean I'll hook niggas up to them IV's
The same way Dre hooked me up to Iovine
I'm from the gutter, grew up in public housing
On the same block with a shack like Yao Ming
So if a nigga ever try to Jerry Heller me
Tell Dre put up a mill, cause that's what my bail'll be

Gangsta, gangsta! (""That's what they're yellin"")
(""It's not about a salary, it's all about reality"")

(""Nigga what you know about time?"")

I've been rappin for one year, one month, 17 days
13 hours, 28 minutes, then I met Dre
30 minutes after I bought the new Em
That was November 18th, 3:09 PM
Around the same time, ""Wanksta"" got it's first spin
That was 32 weeks before they signed Rakim
Eight months, 13 days before I knew where Mike lived
And three years after Mason Betha turned his mic in
I started writin 22 months and 20 weeks prior
To LeBron shakin Adidas for Nikes
I'm right here, six years after Randy Moss
Caught his first touchdown for them Vikings
Just one day, seven hours, 14 minutes
21 seconds before SoundScan got printed
Two platinum records 'fore I'm classified with Biggie
And two seconds before the song finish, yeah",No More Fun and Games

Been on songs with S-N-double-O-P
Inside a Ferrari with the D-R-E
Run up I let it sing like Nate D-O-double-G
Walk through 8 Mile, G-Unit's on my feet
Got a cherry lowrider in the N-Y-C
Eve took me to Philly, never been to the pen
Been to Uptown with 50, seen niggas in Timbs
I done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force Ones
In Cashville, but Compton is {where I'm from}
Where it's just me, my son, and my bitch
She graduated when Notorious BIG dropped ""Me & My Bitch""
She get them birds past, I put her in first class
And tell her to carry on that Dooney & Burke bag
She from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag
And only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags
Cause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin
I lay niggas out like creased khakis
In that G-wagon, lean like the 23's draggin
I got the whole N-Y-C saggin

You can C-walk to this, homey it's still love
Nigga I've been bangin since Mary J did ""Real Love""
(If you don't know) I painted the Rover black
The West coast is back, I can smoke to that
Moms got the CL-6, that's a fact
I bought the house, I'm just waitin on the platinum plaques

Game,"I spent my day so, first I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods
Thinking whats good, things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right, to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavours they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel

I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

Th-th-the way that I rhyme, blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance, and she took Big down
I should've knew it, Shock G and Pac told me ""She get around"", an angel

I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin, ""Didilly whoooa!""
I got love for the streets, peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots
I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (Angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car, and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track

I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene, L.A. and the Chi is a team
Yeah, angel supreme
Yeah, keep on
Yeah, it's for the world boy, we do it forever, yeah",Angel

California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time

Last year, Jazze Phe got stuck up inside the grand Lux,
Most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up,
Any rapper could touched, any bitch could get fucked,
Under the California sun, impalas and big trucks,
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap,
Cause you're body might wash up by the courts at Venice Beach,
Ain't shit sweet but my Swisher, ain't shit buzzin' but my liquor,
Cali chickens got to the 80's strip and come back a little thicker,
With more ass then Delicious, that's my flavor of love,
We make it rain like Rain-man, when he play with the glove,
I'm the king to you pawn niggas, punisher, spawn, niggas,
Playin' in green, Paul Pierce to you Lebron niggas,
We them barbecue, front and back lawn niggas,
Summer Jam, throw your ass offstage Akon niggas,
We drink Kool-Aid with the ice on your arm nigga,
Take that Champion hoody off in the California sunshine

[Chorus]

I'm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire boulevard,
We can't find Biggies killers so we gave Diddy a star,
And I'm by far, Hollywood boulevard,
But I'm from a boulevard that taught yall to shoot out of moving cars,
Remember, New Jersey driver's like a East Coast menace,
And Belly was like the sequel without O-Dogg in it,
Give me a New York minute,
To show you Cali got more dead bodies then the Yankees got New York pennants,
Cause we Dodgers and Impalas with the windows tinted,
I duck shots where Venus and Sarena used to play tennis,
And they never came back, like throwin' a boomerang flat,
See me, I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat,
It's like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black,
Niggas roll up on you, Now you stuck in that Harold and Cane trap,
If you slippin' in Hollywood, and you get your chain snatched,
I know some niggas that know some niggas, I'll get your chain back.

[Chorus]

Niggas already know who had the marijuana first,
We birthed haze and sour diesel, I was there when the water burst,
Hell nah we don't surf, We half way go to church,
Tell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in the fuckin' hearse,
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse,
It'll be another ten years before you see an MC Ren here,
Where he been, I been there, that Lambo, I'm in there,
Hotter then the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there,
Top off the Murcialago like Victoria's Secret swim swear,
So listen, I'm so sincere, bout to work out like gym wear,
Murder MTV's top ten, and tat my face with 10 tears,
That's 10 funerals, 10 caskets,
10 3-piece Ralph Lauren suits, 10 motorbikes stopping traffic,
And 10 reasons why I got California hotter than acid,
Don't you ever, ever leave me out of the top 10 you fuckin' bastards

Maybe it's how I write shit when I'm in the zone,

I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah

I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'ma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
""Juicy"" had us feeling like we was from New York
And that's real shit blazed the Philly
It's summertime shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks?
My nigga Nas told me money make the world go round
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for Love LA
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

Public Enemy and N.W.A is on my boom box, had to say
Today was a good day, had the hood buzzin'
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothin'
Everybody's first bootleg was Boyz 'n the Hood
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood
When the cars ride by with the boomin' system
Two door Mustang and the roof was missing
Every girl at ya school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin' all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with OPP, then bring Naughty in
They say it never rain in southern California, Tony Toni lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

[Verse 3]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the honey's
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say whoa!
Every thing full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky 'cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name,
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talking 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

Fuck this old nigga whistlin' for?
Outside my door apartment 5B
While I learn to cook my first ounce of raw
Use to whistle while I work
She whistle while she twirk
Bitch bounce that ass while you roll that blunt it can't hurt
While you wet come out of that skirt
Bend over make it squirt
You can be my Superhead maybe we should try that first
Let me whistle while you jerk
Run my hand up ya shirt
If you wit it say you wit it let me hear my birdies chirp (we like it!)
Back shots make a bitch go berserk
The game will make it hurt
T-Pain know I'ma flirt (and we love it!)
Get ya ass up and fuck me then
I know you brought your girls

Matter of fact I wanna fuck ya friends
Nah I ain't mean it like that, shit

Gentleman life
She likes the way that everything
I do it so fresh and so clean
My tone is free no need to scream
Bounce like demeanor firmly

Can't be about C-notes
She know my pockets deep enough to see a deep throat
But she won't see a dividend like 3 times ?
And that's triple X rated you know
My bitches only want the weed some X and some blow
Know not ask for the keys or no extra dough
I give em dick no dough
She give me shit she go
All she got was a baby and a Game logo
That was then this is now
Lift it up break it down
I go in she come out
That's when the pussy make the sound
It will never be the same
Every time when you fuck wit Game

Like I ain't never ran from no pussy and I damn sure bout to pick a day to start runnin'

I see the corner, puttin' chalk around the snitch, 
We be shootin' like free throws, flying them desert Eagles, 
Sell dope to the pope, while we eatin' chilli freetos
From a gang-banger, to a CEO, 
Everything I do is big like the nigga Ceaser-leo, 
Wont stop till I'm dead, 
Ain't gotta watch for the feds, 
They ain't watchin' me so here's a dome shot to the head
As I take a Patron shot to the head, 
And reminisce about the shit the DOC said, 
""Get money, Get cars, get mine, get yours,
And keep your head up, like the Lambo doors""

A real blood will put you out of your mind
So stay the fuck up out of my hood

Red and curly and she wake me up early
Cause hustlers hit the block when police change shifts
New York, California different toilet, same shit
In Brooklyn I rock Timberlands
Still toast cinnamon
Been gangster way before he dropped many men
Liquor in my system, voice raspy who I sound like?
Don't ask me that's my nigga we classy
Him and Montega Jada our style superior to haters
You can catch me in the latest Marvin Gaters
Ralph Lauren suit tape it up fly cause I'm papered up
Why these niggas keep hating on my Phantom

Niggas stunt more than Jackie Chan
What the fuck them faggots saying?
Nothing when I walk in the club with the gat in hand
Take 'em back to '94 shooing out a Astro van
Banging was the blueprint money was the master plan
Duffel bag full of Grants and Franklins
Rob niggas take they money shoot straight to the bank then
Head to the barbershop to get chopped up
Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up
Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up
Fuck niggas in Black Wall Street I trust
Black hoodies and black Asics standing on the pavement
Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift
Fuck that long money nigga get paid quick

Lord knows that status is badder

Put it on my face to remind me
Of all the shit I been through my physical presence, my pen too nice
My first album sent you life
I should of put down the mic when Rakim left Dre
No cleanup hitter so I was stranded on second base
I had to steal third motherfucker that's my word
There's some Queens niggas try to put me back on the curb

And our days in the past

So my mind free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can
And do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a king
I do the math
Coincidentally on ya birthdays
I ditched the Class
Cause the younger me, dumber me
Was chasin' the cash
Chasin' the ass

Ridin' home from school

How she stayed behind bars
And she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars

But I'm a street dude

But hate killed em

Till your world awoken me
First I thought you was passive
Soft one to ass kiss

You were more than talk

Take me away from the hood like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood in the casket or a Bentley
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide (suicide, suicide)
I'm from a Windy City, like ""Do or Die""
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus
Shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
Cause that's Jesus people
And The Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, ""The Passion of Christ"" need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation, so I can leave my people
They askin' ""Why?"" Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question before this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

And I ain't no preacher but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his momma proud
And since you helped me sell my +Dream+ we can share my momma now
And like M.J.B.: ""No More Drama"" now
Living the ""Good Life"", me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mind state, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds

Walk through the gates of Hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the Devil share chronic blunts
Listening to the ""Chronic"" album, playing backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my grandmother pray for good
And never made her happy, when I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood

But it's real niggas like me, that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should

Even if they brought the nigga 'Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

Jumped in the impala then smashed through the light

[The Game]
See I come from the bottom and they call me the game
But I'm just happy that Beyonce know my name
I took that Dr. Dre money
And I bought me a chain
Then I bought me a house
Then I bought me a range
Then I bought me some pussy
Then I bought me some brains.
But I ain't buyin' that the best rappers is Kanye and Wayne.
See both of them niggas spit but yall act like yall ain't hear me spit
Like sellin' 7 million records ain't the shit
I don't win no grammy's nigga I'm too gangsta
And poppin' crystal with erv don't make me a wangsta
See I'm California certified
My niggas make the murder rise
Read my fan mail in jail
Buck told Curtis bye
So I'ma break it down for the niggas in the south
Slow it down put this rose phantom cream in my mouth
Throwin' prada slippers on when I walk in my house
P. Diddy and Tommy Lee know what I'm talkin' about
See I'm fresh outta jail I know you heard I was back
So turn up the radio it's a wrap",Ya Heard

L.A.X niggas, yeah

Y'all know who the fuck I am

I'm free as a motherfucking bird I swear,
Disappear in thin air, there go Game, nigga where?
Posted on the block in them black Airs,
In that all black Phantom, hug the block like a bear,
Yeah, that V12 is roaring,
Flying through the city with the pedal to the floor then,
I put them 26 inches on the curb, tell the hood I'm back,
Give me a corner, let me serve,
Swerve, I'm still dope that's my word,
All I did was the switch the kitchens,
Did some tracks on the birds,
Irv, Gotti know I'm a murderer,
Half these niggas beefin' with me,
I never heard of them,
If I was the old me I would murder them
Matter fact, if I was the old me, I would Curtis them,
Courtesy of my Smith & Wesson,
I kill tracks like aids, nigga get infected,

The whole world been waiting on him,
Here I come, drop top Phantom,
I'm skating on 'em, look around,
All the bitch niggas hating on him,
Mad cause I'm Chronic 2008tin' on them,
Big cars, big wheels, big chains,
Big pimpin', big money,
Big Dreams, dreams, dreams,
Big Dreams, dreams, dreams,
Big Dreams, dreams

I get money like Junior Mafia used to,
On my way to school 10.000 in my FUBU,
Lunchtime I was sellin' behind the bungalows,
Baggin' up rocks the size of melons,
That's when the fiends start tellin' you can
Catch 'em on the couch everyday at 4 o'clock,
Like Ellen!
Prime-time nigga, it's my time nigga,
Jacob ain't got shit to do with my shine nigga!
Cause when the sun come up - from behind the sea,
Niggas see me behind the B,
Ent. don't stand for entertainment,
Stands for 0 to 60, anybody see where Game went?
To the hood, parked crooked behind that chained fence,
And I'm going down behind my dogs, but I ain't Vick!
Tell me one album I put out that ain't sick?
No I'm not the Doctor, but I produce the same shit!

Yo Jay what it do nigga?
I done rocked enough fellas to be you nigga,
I got the 40/40 made by two jiggas,
I make you ""Holla, Holla"", I Ja Rule niggas!
The lion's in the room, what up Fat Joe?
I'm Curtis' kryptonite and the nigga Joey Crack know,
Whoever said ""Game Over"" must of had a hangover,
Get money, my driveway sponsored by Range Rover,
I got blood diamonds straight outta Angola,
Wave my red rag in the air, signal Lil' Wayne over,
Yeah, that's when the Crys start poppin',
The pills start droppin' and the haters start watchin',
The DJ starts spinnin', the panties get the droppin'
For album number three, it goin' platinum's not an option,

Riding with the top back.
Banging Ne-Yo, my neck free yo,
My SOX hat,
Tilted to the side
Like you know I get my grind on.
Get my shine on.
Jewelry Black in all rhinestones.
Rims spinning like a globe,
On these low pros.
Do it big cause I'm supposed to floss,
And that's the reason she break me off.
Cause I'm gangsta,
And I'm riding with

Ne-Yo, it's a thug and a gentleman.
Rollin like a boss through,
No matter the cost too,
Kept trying to brag, what?
Money not a issue.
Don't let your girl see us.
That might make her diss you.
Cause if she roll wit us,
She wont even miss you.

Pop rubber bands when I throw a stack,
Before it hit the ground she throw it back.
When I make it rain that's chump change,
That pay for the 26
On my range range range drive drive,
Take the wheel while I roll and slide,
Climb over to the passenger side and freeze.

And once again it's on,
You should take a picture
With your camera phone.
Player she not coming home,
And if I'm on her screen saver,
That, that mean later we gone.
If I let her take a picture,
She gonna roll wit me.
If I let her take a picture,
She gonna roll wit me.
If I let her take a picture
She gonna roll wit me,
Gonna roll wit me,
Gonna roll wit me.

Look at my waist then look at my scars.
Look out da window see where we are.

She ain't never rolled in a car with the suicide,
Girl when it's you and I, they committing suicide.
All of them want, my girl.
Cause she pretty and thick in the thighs.
Homie don't mastermind,
Do a song wit suicide.

She call me Jay, I call her B,
We getting married, to the streets.
I'm chasing money, she chasing me.
I'm right where I wanna be,
With the B on my Bentley,
The horse on my Lambo,
Crown on my Cadillac,
Checks on my air max.
Haters, better fall back,
Before I put something in your ball cap.
That's my chick,
I got her back like a bra strap.
Cause she fine and she cute,
She think she all that, and she all that.
That's my girl that's my world,

We've been waiting all night,
Just to take a picture wit you.

Grab the wheel take control,
And let your hair blow inside my Lambo.
Pull out ya phone, picture that.
Take it home let ya man know I'm hitting that.
While I'm hitting that,

She a 34 D, I'm so pleased.
I'm so so def, she so Janet,
I'm JD and she full of me.
In the H2 we fold
Deep through the NYC off no sleep.
I hate to drive but I break it wide,
When I'm riding with my shorty.
I'd kidnap her and never take her home,
Riding off banging Ne-yo sitting on chrome,
In that Maserati, see the paparazzi,
They... She gone.

That the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer.

They must got a death wish
They was on the road to the riches back in the day they got off on the exit
Trill disrespect shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment
It's hard to digest it
Young niggas don't want to get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on, to catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they livin' in the '80s
The shawties they knew since they were babies turn crazy
The bitches still holla at anybody
Lookin' like they have a couple dollars
Fuck suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winnin' but everybody can't lose
Dirts still there funeral home ain't move
Going in coming out gang affiliated
Rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood you can't escape it
Dust smokin' niggas walk around in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick up kids come around, when they sense that you rich
Cans of lizzle get lit, when you get hit with a fifth
Niggas they used to hoop dreamin' is now sellin' the piff
And they still rattin' but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the tek spit, fuck around get your head and your neck hit
Lookin' for a death wish, walk

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Talkin' out your mouth
All wreckless to a nigga that you know
That'll let it off
That's a death wish
When your heart stops and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time
That's a death wish
When you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from
That's a death wish
When you know a nigga whole style's on select shit
(young money)when you violate 'em, fwah
That's a death wish

[Lil Wayne]
On that way left shit
Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left, hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch
It's Weezy F. Bitch
I'm the best, bitch
Motherfuck your guest list
I'll be like let's just kill 'em
And get breakfast
Neck slit, next shit expect this
Every time you check this
I'm exit I mean excited to be your death wish
Bitch I wear this G-shit on my heart not my necklace
And I keep the hypno' for the hecklers
And I'm from the mecca of the wreckless
With a record-breaking debt list
The wreckers and neglectors think all that shit won't affect us
I'm high above you above law above average
Niggas snitching putting niggas in the can like a beverage
Damn
I pop out your head fuck up your memories
I'll put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yea
You still don't remember shit
You gon' remember this
I'm knockin' niggas down this year
I'm on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggas on that simba shit
I be on that fuck yo clique I kill every member shit
Cool as December shit
Bang in any weather shit

Game,"Throw your muthafucking Cincinnati hats in the sky
Nigga don't ask why
Red laces in and out of them Air Max nine fives I,
Walk on the moon, flow hotter than June
Any nigga want drama I kick up a sand dune
Peace to my man 'Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin' switches to the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it, nah forget it, soo woo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don't live in Judah's eyes
Half of these rappers weren't trappin' when I was choppin' the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma ""won't you decide""
She chose Doc, first day I pulled Jude aside like its Aftermath for life
And all I do is ride
Before I turn on him I kill Satan
And stick my red flag in the ground it's red nation!

Now blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts
I can't tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what
And that's, B's up, hoes down
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm no where to be found
Blood, I'm a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin' blood in the air, leave blood on the ground

Niggas'll trade they soul to be Drake or J. Cole
Live and die for this shit, word to Tupac Shakur's halo
One blood, plural, nigga I'm spendin' Euro's
Ferrari got an ice cream paint job, Dorrough
I'm up out the hood, where they pull guns on you like
Come up out ya hood, it ain't never all good
We roll up in backwoods, nigga get to actin' stupid
Get thrown in the back woods
Los Angeles, home of the scandalous
Pimp, hoes and gamblers
Ninety eight degree's on Christmas
Nigga we rollin' cannibus
Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I'm Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panites down, stain it
That's my Chi-lingo, yeah I'm bi-lingual
Ball by myself nigga Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars, bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God

Now blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts
I can't tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what
And that's, B's up, hoes down
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm no where to be found
Blood, I'm a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin' blood in the air, leave blood on the ground

Russia got a Red Flag
US got Red Stripes
Last train to Paris, round the world in these red Nikes
Che Guevara of the new era, test me
Louisville slugger, you'll get buried in my New Era
Got that natty on tighter than a magnum
Walk in the club saggin' with a thirty eight magnum
Red Ralph Laurens, the double R sittin' on a hill like Lauren
Her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at?
Roll up the weed son, so many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I'm out here, I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch I got her some red bottoms
And all these hatin' ass niggas want me dead
Cause I'm Malcolm X before he turned Muslim, red!

Now blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts
I can't tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what

Mars
Baby you're the one
Oh 
Let it rock, yeah yeah 

She leave her hair in the sink
She leave her hair on the floor
Her hair all over the bed, that make me love her more
She wear a scarf, Louis V to be exact
It's a wrap, messing up her wrap, blowing out her back
Never let another rap nigga hit it from the back or the front
On my mama nigga, I be gone for months, come back

And it's still tight, I like when it's real tight
I'mma lick in circles now
Tell me what that feel like

Feels like when you try them red bottoms on
It feels like the song 'cause we all the way gone
Between me and you, do anything for old girl
Like hit it in the morning, yeah, cold world

[Chorus]
Baby you're the one
You ain't gotta hit the club no more
'Cause we done did that
Tryin' to find the one
But you been looking for love in all the wrong places
Every day's a movie, girl, you make the scene
They gon' keep on watching, give 'em something to see
We gonna be all the way gone
We gonna be all the way gone

She call me all the time, I ain't no regular Joe
I be staying at the Roosevelt more than Marilyn goes
I'm messing bitches with Chuck, but I was wearing some foams
Shorty been fly forever, these bitch's parachutes broke
TC's is on her person I'm aware that you know
And you know the flow, they jack it, I'm apparently cold, you know
Life's lemons is bitter, I need another fruit
She know we can't elope, look at what honey do
Straight G thing, double M G thing
Weed they can't fuck with, I'm puffin A.C. Green
When I peep in the public, bet I'm leaving with something
And I'm so fly I make some homebodies leave the luggage
Shout out Donny Sublime
Shout out Bobby on Hundreds
Not too many is touching, double M G this summer
The Red album, lil' red shorty, you can't touch her
I know Mario's on the hook, but I was playing Duck Hunt

[Chorus]

Yeah, he blowing up your cell phone
Send him the voice mail cause we all the way gone
And you ain't doing nothing wrong
But killing the competition in that Cosabella thong
Turn to the side, let me see them thighs
Profile, damn I'm digging your style, we can start slow now
Then speed it up, this playing in the background
While I beat it up, I beat it up

Baby soon as we get home, it won't take us too long
We gon' make it to the bedroom, I like the guest room
You can pick the next room
Put the camera on the tripod, got me playing on your iPod
I know you feeling me on my job, director

Game,"I was born in the cross hairs without a pot to piss in
Where niggas get smoked over Jordans and their Pippens
Welcome to California, nah, it ain't cold as New York
But life is a bitch out here, word to Too Short
Whack was a shooter so we called him Tony Kukoc
Gang banging had us addicted like it was new ports
Whoever thought that it would spread like petroleum
Now BP connect got us praying to them holy men
Just had a daughter homie, named her Katrina
If I raise her right, then maybe she can take over FEMA
Spike Lee in New Orleans shooting documentaries
And Game still in Cali eating off the documentary
Take em to the symmetry I mean the cemetery
Where everybody boxed in, refrigerator Perry

And everybody little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
'Cause he's just like T.I. born in the trap
And everybody little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
'Cause he's just like Gucci, born in the trap
And everybody little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
'Cause he's just like Jeezy, born in the trap
And every little fuck up, my gun she go, ""crack""
'Cause I'm just like Outkast, born in the trap

So what's going on with you faggots?
And what you gonna do when your swagger no longer matters?
And your bitch ain't the baddest 'cause she in her mid-40s
And your phantom played out so you hating on the shorties
'Cause they running around like they was your age and you was your age
Fucking bitches raw 'cause now the world ain't got no AIDS
Yeah, 2050 all you niggas gold diggers
Sucked you dry left them hickeys on you niggas
I used to run around like you, run the town like you
Walk my red nose and clown like you, but it got old like Betty White
This rap shit real deep like Barry White
Reminiscing on the days I used to carry white
Walking though them Crip hoods in the Cherry Nikes
Now I lead a married life, walking in the house, to them home-cooked meals
Joint American Express accounts and less dollar bills

Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
Just like Goodie Mob, I was born in the trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But just like Luda, I was born in the trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But like Soulja Boy, I was born in the trap
Broke ass niggas still begging for a stack
Take 'em to Shawty Lo, nigga, learn how to trap

Shit deeper than The Roots band
Fifteens drumming, questlove in the coupe fam
Riding through Pittsburgh, Wiz got the Steelers
Born by the jungle so I came with gorillas
Since niggas dropping more dimes than we fuckin'
We out the hood, tryna get money like Pete Touchin
Splitting backboards just to get our weed stuffed in
The crack we cookin, we don't need ovens
We need something to put in the mouth of our kids
Instead of copping chains, lets fly to Chile and dig
Go to Haiti and feed to the Bahamas and breathe
On the way back, to my nigga Sean from Belize, you know
Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven sent
Then I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant
So I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president
I'm 'bout to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president
Told you I was gonna kill this shit, Primo

Game,"I'm at the house bout to roll this kush up
I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups
Waiting on what seems to be forever
I burned a hole in my Polo sweater 'cause I was nervous
But hat's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
'Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
So it's whatever, whenever whatever

You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
First thing I'ma tell her, daddy's your umbrella
Give her the glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name
Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
Who gon' be the Godfather? Swizz? Lil Wayne?
Hey y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
And I just got a text from your mama
Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma 

You walk through the door, she on the ground crying
She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
I ain't cleaning that shit up
I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
She screaming, her left the car seat, but I'ma tell her later
Forget the car seat, man, I'm hella-faded
She like ""I know you ain't high!"" 
Shit, ""I'm celebrating"" 

Now we in the car, she won't put on her seat belt
Screaming at the top of her lungs,""God, I need help!""
Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
Imagine she pulling on me ""Stop I'm about to crash, shit!""
Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair
Them butterflies still here, am I happy? Hell yeah

I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
Think, think damn one of the nurses stuck their head out
They gave her an epidural so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out
Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
""Breathe, one, two, three, four, one more, two, three, four

""Push, c'mon T, push! God damn it, just push!""
Nurse Linda coaching her, Doctor Umbar pulling on shoulders
Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical cord
She out, eight pounds four ounces, Sam stop the beat
Hold up, I'm about to make an announcement, 
""See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world
So I thank the woman who gave her life for my baby girl""

""Hey mars turn the beat down a little so I can share my experience""",California Dream
Game,"See any angels in the city

Tell them muthafuckas I'm forever paid, California king
Wrestle gators in the Everglades, drive up out that muthafuckin swamp
In the Escalade so before you put that Red rag
In your pocket I wanna see your fuckin resume
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole: I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate
I'mma give em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweights, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was selling weight
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performing in front of millions, nigga every race
64 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
4th album, no 5 mics? Then let 'em hate
But I'm not stopping 'til I'm the fucking king in every state

Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me

I'm sick of motherfuckers talking about ""the West died""
Can't you hear my heart beating?
That's the motherfuckin West side, you test me, you test God
I'm his son, it say in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun, you won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov, prolly Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mil that I slaughter
Serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly when I'm the nigga
Sold 5 mil out the gate and numbers do not lie

Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me

I gave you the Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waiting for
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for? I love you cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor, walk up on you
Like ""what's going on baby boy?"" Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin

Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops

Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac
In his prime, thug life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back

Pull up in that Enzo then I do donuts
I'm that cool, cashews, make 'em all go nuts

Lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your Prada bag)
That's right, she's got something that I wanna see
That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me
That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something
She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming
They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something
Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something
Club filled with dead bodies
If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry
You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted
Do what you wanna do, drug test on you

Lotta money when I talk
Big mills, big deals 'bout a hundred in a vault
Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt
They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel
I fear she just might just pop that pill
And feel on me all night till the tip spill
Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bass line
She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time

Blow right, hoes fight over my name
I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
It's forty days, forty nights if I'm making it rain
I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed and we good

If you got drugs in this motherfucker
Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something
High of something, high of something
'til your mothafucking brain don't function
High of something, high of something

Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape
Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss
Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded
X-rated that's what I like glad that you made it
To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and

May I, kick a little something for G's and
Make a few ends as I breeze through?
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to

If you got drugs in this motherfucker
Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us

Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There's missing women out there, we should focus on 'em

I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)

With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with

I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl

Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours

Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date

I was in the living room feeling on this bitch
Heard my car alarm goin' off on my six
So my dogs start barkin' and some niggas hit the fence
So I took my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window
Pull the blinds down and took one hit of the Endo
You niggas ain't doin' shit, but stealin' my neighbors rims so
Walked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over
That's what I'm rolling with

Nah I ain't saying shit and I ain't snitching on nobody
Yeah that's my .45, but it ain't got no bodies
And two dead niggas, them is nobody
They should've torched 'em, then you wouldn't had no bodies
I mean look at these pictures, just so sloppy
Couldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti
Feed the nigga to the sharks after dark
Man fuck this shit I thought I told y'all

There was money on the table by the bricks
I was at the kitchen table choppin up some shit
Listenin' to Jeezy and I heard a little
So I turned the radio down and cocked my 4 fifth, oh shit
Am I hit? Nah just a hole in my Jordan fitted
So I turn down all the lights and cock my 4 fifth
Seen some niggas jump in they Escalade and that was it
How much longer I gotta stay in this muthafucka?
Let me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke 
But shit y'all got a nigga stressed
I gotta stay in this muthafucka until I confess?

Shit, y'all bitches better get some rest
'Cause it'll be a cold day in Miami
Before I snitch on myself or the hood, you understand me?
Ya I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy

They should get a Grammy
Hey you two muthafuckas should get an Oscar
With this good-cop-bad cop shit, take me to process
'Cause I don't eat breakfast with no pigs
I watched First 48 so fuck your twenty-five years
No evidence, no big
I don't know who split them niggas' wigs

Already told y'all, there was money on the table with the bricks
I was walkin' to the bathroom to take a shit
Then I heard my dogs barkin', there's some noise by the fence
So I ran to my room and reached for the 4 fifth
Then I seen three niggas by my back door
Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more
So I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer

A nigga with a gun in his hand who won't bust it?
Like a bitch with a dick in her hand who won't suck it
This is the art of war, you niggas just drawing
Anything I target on is dearly departed, gone
Drive by or walk up on, I just stop, breathe, aim cock squeeze
Silencer on the Glock, infrared beam
So your block up on machines while the pussies run and scream

Game,"You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, 'cause that's where we go go
You know I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello

Come on let's ride

She used to wake up to The View
Now she wake up with a view
Used to wake up to a kiss
Now she wake up to a shoe
Used to dream about millions
Now she workin' with a few
Used to know one Porsche, now she know two
Chanel handbags stuck to her like glue
Minks and chinchillas, whole closet like a zoo
Agent Provocateur, Louis and lots of Dior
All her friends wearing Gucci so she don't rock it no more
Every time we in Jimmy Choo, they gotta lock up the store
Walk out with boxes galore, next week she cop her some more
Alexander McQueen 'cause she my queen
Spent an Aston Martin on the ring, so you ain't gotta,

You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, 'cause that's where we go go
You know I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello

Come on girl, let's ride

Soon as them butterfly doors go up on that Ferrari
She step outside the car on there, stumble into Bulgari
Fall in that Y-cell, try it on, you fly as hell
Don't really like it, but I'm buying it, might as well
Have her own reality show, no drama
Grab your girl, we're shooting real housewives in the Bahamas
2-piece Hermes, Bottega Veneta flats
I heard Diddy out here so you know where the party at
(We on)and I ain't even gotta ask twice
'Cause when we hit the room she up and down like the gas price, damn
Got chills thinking of last night
I swear you was a goddess in your past life so,

You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, 'cause that's where we go go
You know I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello

Come on girl let's ride
Girl I know you wanna get away
This hotel room, that's where it goes down
And I know we never get away
Just give me a couple minutes and I'm in it
We all over the table, ain't no problem with you sweating on me
And I ain't pulling out, I'm tryna have fun
I know you tryna have fun

You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
And you ain't gotta front for your friends
You know I have your hat
And the Louis Vuitton I got for your birthday
That was hello
And them bottles that we popped last Thursday
That was hello",Hello

Game,"Mama told me to stay away from them niggas
Mama told me she had a K for them niggas
Mama told me she go to pay for them niggas
But my grandmother told me that she would pray for them niggas
They just young black and ignorant lusting over models and them Benjamins

Got the game twisted (like what?) licorice
When I was rocking lottos moving packs up on McDonalds
She was looking for me, pulled up in that old El Dorado
I was running around with Chase, chasing new black wheels
Why would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed
But I use that still 'cause I won't do that deal
Screw the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill
What did I learn? Nothing, my papa smoking sure and bluffin'
Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion
Tat-tat my four five knocking on your window
She said there would be days like this
Pharrell, drop the instrumental

Yes sir

[Chorus: x2]
I know I must go and I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up where we all came from
(From my mama's womb)

Crack a Swisher, crack the fifther 
Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls
Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball
Mom's working late night, to get a plate right
Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight
Wish I could go back to them days 'cause streets don't play right
Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid 'N' Play type
But that didn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky
Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me

Pick and choose, stick and move
So many dudes ended up with sleeping bags on late-night news
But not my mama's son, going around the hood for serving customers
She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler
What I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her
Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up
Like, ""Here hug em ma, one last time""
Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine

[Chorus]

Put your block down, recognize a king 'cause it's my town
Word to my mother you can throw up your rock now
Got off the beef shit 'cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black
Right there, crying over hard facts
Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back
Never, she carried me for nine months so she can have whatever
Clever, she taught me how to shoot Berettas, told me that I'd be a king
So R.I.P. to Coretta, if you don't understand that
Then refer to my letter, while I sprinkle
Niggas with platinum, from my last album
Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm
Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like, ""How come?""
That niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum
Either way, playboy, check it, this is the outcome
You might not like it, but my mama psychic
Why you niggas twisted like the top of a sidekick?

Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train
Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil' B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook
And just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians versus goblins, goons versus the crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis

He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you
Fuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu
I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too
And Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
So I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too

Blood of a slave, heart of a giant
Had to leave Aftermath, Dre said I was too defiant
That was five years ago, look how fast it go
Destroyin' Interscope, shot myself like Plaxico
But fuck that, blaze one, where the matches yo?
Hit the freeway and see how fast the Aston go
Roll the window down, clip off the ashes so
You can see all my diamonds and how much cash I blow
How many bitches I fuck, how many cars I drive
How many goons I got, count 'em and they all outside
Niggas try to shut me up like Malcom
But standin' in the window caine smoking was the outcome

Sometimes I get a little stressed and pop a Valium
Hit Hollywood late night and knock down a stallion
So niggas think twice about my medallion or
You'll hear Cuba Gooding yelling ""Ricky!""
My nostalgia is one hundred percent Compton and zero percent snitch
Park a Bentley and the Phantom on blocks while I use the pitch
Made the Cincinnati fitted more famous than Griffey did
And just to think, several years ago they tried to split his wig
Two to the chest, struck his heart, one hit his rib
Then I blacked out, like a movie, all I could hear

Feelin' all fucked up, woke up to a doctor
All I could think about, was that the cops took my weed and my choppers
They want me to sing, like Sinatra, I told the detective
Get this clear like Belvedere vodka
Them five shots, they created a monster
Hell's Kitchen comin' straight out of Compton
I seen Boyz in the Hood, Morris Chestnut was a actor
2Pac was the real life ""Ricky!""
Then they shot down the nigga that shot him, I swear to God
If I'm lying then Compton is New York and I'm Rakim
I'm from where niggas get murdered over stock rims
And punched in the jaw just for a cocked brim

Nobody mama let the cops in, we ain't got no options
Wanted to be a boxer, but I was boxed in
Then my grandmother house went up for auction
And that's what killed 'em, I'm goin' back to buy the block then
Too many niggas locked in, dig up Cochran and defend all my niggas
With they faith under stockings, rather face
God then twenty-five with no options
If Compton ain't the murder capital, we in the top ten
Drive by with our face painted, like a clown
With a tre-pound, forty shells bouncin' off the ground
This how my living room sound, when my brother got shot down",Ricky

Why can't a motherfucker chill in the car
Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill
They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill
Camouflage by the armor all while it's sparkling off my wheels

Not them throwback rats they be on showin' on college hill
For real, I think my first album sold five mil'

And you say to yourself that he is broke 
Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding
I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling
Can't get to the phone right now because my boss is all in this bitch mouth
When did we start taking these tricks out?
Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend

'Cause I run the plantation and I'm whooping niggas asses
If they disrespect the presentation, below the Mason-Dixon,

You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation
My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform
Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone

Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter
I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler
You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers

Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards

Rocks in my ears something Titanic
This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it
God says everything happens for a reason

Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowing the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like
At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like
He paid for my sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, raw Stacy delight
Can't deny my Jesus piece that's so Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A combo she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel

Niggas saying I'm underrated
Like a younger Jay with heat, but not the ones the Thunder play with
So Los Angeles King is sort of an understatement

Tell 'em they rent's due, pay up or get cement shoes
All this dope be around, you act like I ain't lean on that fence too
But now you up here and bitches and cars is what I'm into
You wanna send me to God, I wear 45 in that French shoe
I fuck with Wale, Ross, and my nigga French too
And me and Face just slashed the last beat up like a Ginsu

Money getting long, pussy rate keep rising
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses, did it from the weak hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour

Hit you right above navel, now you swimming in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settling for less, I call 'em bottom shelf

This the voice of ghetto intelligence, if you got work
Go to work the work at your residence
For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Riding through the jungles in that mothafuckin'' elephant
That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it
Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the muthafuckas in, made another mill'

Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into

When you hop on top, girl, that’s what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain’t feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that’s just real life
Cause it’s hard when you ain’t on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain’t on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me ‘bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don’t fuck her on her period, ain’t into horror stories
I take her to my favourite restaurant she order for me, cause she know me

But I don't wanna do that, I came to take the service in
And stare at all the women who brought they Louis purses in
Bad bitches in here, forgive me for my sins
I ain't meant to walk inside the church cursing again
I wanna live righteous and you know I love Jesus

And your outfit clean but your nose ain't
And I suppose ain't nobody a liar in here
If that was true, the whole church would be on fire in here

Roll up that purp (I remember)
Pour up that syrup (I don’t remember)

Quarters now half zones (I remember)
Yeah it’s the middle of June, and it’s snowing like December

Baking soda inside of her bowl, hey yo, watch me blow
Promethazine mixed with a Sprite, poor it foo’
Been sippin’ syrup all night, and I get higher than a plane
Yeah I remember your pussy girl, but I don’t know your name
I got diamonds hanging off, they can talk of the insane
Ever since I gave her that molly, man that girl ain’t been the same
Better pop pussy for a real nigga
That’s on the way, I’mma deal with ya

Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name me king

I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name me king

Brick by brick I built my fortress
My queen beautiful, Lamborghini is gorgeous
Phantom in the courtyard, 400 horses
Growl made the towers fall, 911 Porsches
Number 9 Jordan's pause the Air Forces
Kush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches
Gold bars melted and what returned Rolexes
Niggas got Breitlings to burn
Loyalty to earn
Royalty to who it may concern this is Los Angeles King Snapback
Sipping 'tron out the Stanley cup, I don't give a fuck
Drown them in the moat and let the bridge up
My son, my heir in Nike Airs, named my little nigga King
Meaning you should bow at his feet before God intervene
Even when I was in front of triple beams
Stack paper to the ceiling, to the fiends I was king

Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name me king

I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses

Raise your glass for the last of the kingpins
The crown in the Maserati grill is mingling
Rollies cross oceans like Frank out in England
The Gay Pride bezel rainbow like it's spring again
Haah crack rock, crack rock nigga
My SC430 was a drop nigga
Go figure, this nigga play Go Fish
My only pet was fish scale not a goldfish
My young baby sitter now my old bitch
Blowjobs cause what I sold made her nose itch
(Yughck!) it's the king being crowned
Watch my predecessor fall like the sun going down (God!)
It's sunset, this is Sun Tzu (War!)
He paved the way I brought a ton through (Whooo!)
Been on his heels like a gum shoe
He took the throne so I could run through (Yughck!)

Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name me king

I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses

Rose petals at my feet when I'm stepping out the Rolls
The royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold
Sweatin' like a slave where them pies get sold
Accompanied by fourteen karats stold
Adjust the temperature let the heat rise up
Like Jesus Shuttlesworth in that glass jar
Blue flame glowing like a Avatar
Five more minutes says the solid gold hand going 'round on my Audemar
Angels in the wing, ass naked do your thing
Show me what that baking soda bring, do it for your king
Every time I look up, they cook up
I be the master of them P's I got the hook up
From New Orleans to Virginia
I told her stuff them pies in her Virginia
Never been caught, can't be bought, she's a winner
Fly 'em south for the winter make it back home for dinner

I told her, ""Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent""
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev in there
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick the door in the room and told her to put the knife away

Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle

And I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him
She a ride-or-die, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it

Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me

Wanna talk money, yeah, just counted ten milli
Free my nigga Meek Milly, bad bitch out of Philly
Sold that white girl so I guess I sold Iggy
Who you think I give a fuck about, an enemy?
Think I give a fuck about the industry?
Pussy ass nigga better Google me
Boy, I really made a million out the fuckin' streets
Boy, I had a white car back in '04
Back in runnin' wood days and ride low
When bein' a street nigga really meant something
Now niggas sell his soul for a follow
If you wanna talk streets, what it mean to you, nigga?
Take pictures with guns so that make you a killer
Nah, LA Reid gave me that check today
Took that shit to the jacks, empower the hittas
I'm Crenshaw at Fatburger, fuckin' with Nipsey
And I bet you I'm rockin' my chains
Or I'm in the Watts with Jay Rock or slidin' through Compton with Game
Cause real niggas livin' the same

My auntie did 20 years, my pop did like 16
My partner did a decade so what the fuck you really mean?
Really, ho, Billie Jean jackets in my video
Causin' all this racket, on a tennis court
Really made a million in a kitchen fork
Skirt, skirt, skirt, skirt, dinner fork
Often offended, I told that bitch to get out when she finished
Need me a bitch that gon' suck me and fuck me
And freak me and pass me to all of her friends, that's what it is
Verbal telekinesis
Korrupt mixed with Jesus
Big Meech mixed with Yeezus
Keep playin' them games and get shot from them bleachers
I still got my stripes when I'm not wearing Adidas
Got a fresh hairline from Peter
Got me a hockey mask, choppers, started talking fast
Give it to 'em direct just like Jeter
Niggas ain't killing shit, niggas they playing
They saying they killing shit
Got me an A and a K and a 220 trey
And the shit hit, might burn a little bit
I'm like, ""Really, little bitches, say really""

Fuck these niggas
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me

Brand new Benz with the top down
In my old neighborhood, all the cop 'round
I don't give a fuck, motherfucker, act up
Let him and the police hear how the Glock sound
Comin' with the bullshit, get shot down
Sucker free, no fly zone in my town
And there ain't no discussion
It's simple, you try me we gon' get to bustin'
I promise, my nigga, you want it, my nigga?
My young niggas ready, they goin' on God
They act like they know ain't no God
We so official, for sure, no facade
Trap a nigga shine like I glow in the dark
Still got my .44 in the door
I'n not finna play with you, homie get laid with you
Cement your feet, then it's off in the lake with you
Underestimate you, that mistake I couldn't make with you
I hit you with the K, myself and show you what the paper do
And can't nobody handle you the way I do
Give your boy a K or two, kill you in a day or two
And no disrespect, boy, you violate me, we gon' handle that
Blow your ass off the map
And you still reachin' your hand out for no dap
My demonstration in exchange for your hatin'
I put this flame all in your face, boy you fakin'
We come through in Mercedes and shoot you
You'd think Call of Duty would make it
Bacon, I get my moolah off top
He don't give me my moolah, off top
Give a damn what the naysayers say
And we waitin' a day in the A with the K and I'm gone

It's a whole heck of y'all and a whole deck of cards
This shit right here you can't deal with
Two ice cubes and some cognac
Spent some time in twin towers, I ain't goin' back
Spent my commissary on some M&M's thinkin' I was Eminem
Runnin' Aftermath in all black
I'll slaughter your house with 5 9's
Leave all of you niggas with crooked eyes
Got the Louisville Slugger, Big Papi Ortiz
Knockin' every button off your buttoned up sleeves
Please that's Jeezy the Snowman
Comin' straight to your window like Bruh Man
Said I ain't killin' your dog but stealin' my hog and fuck my conscience
Puttin' bullets in your doberman, don't fuck with Compton
Don't you fuck with Kendrick, don't fuck with Problem
Don't fuck with YG, I'm Mr. Miyagi, Daniel San, I handle them
My handle's dumb, I had no gun
Fuck around, stomp you out in these Durant's or somethin'
I bear arms like Durantula
This rocket launcher'll blow your whole fuckin' mansion up
And everybody gotta die, put them candles up
How you get caught up in the web with tarantulas?
And for you fuckin' dumb niggas, let me slow it down
I can screw you like Pimp and Big Boi around
And when a nigga say ""Timber"", you don't need Ricky Rubio
To let a nigga know it's goin' down
Fuck you clowns, yeah I put the word on you niggas
Don't A$AP Ferg on you niggas
Been all through New York with Diddy
My verse'll Schmurda you niggas
And that's not a shot at T.I.P. or a shot at Gotti
Take shots of Ciroc in a black Bugatti
Got a shotty in a backpack, napsack
Shawty got a black MAC 11, I will catch that body
Like Nasir and Hov when I'm 40 years old
I will still be the pilot that light up the stove
And be cookin' that crack 'til the Doctor come back
And tell niggas that Detox come out this October
Like Ol' Dirty Bastard, I'm finally sober
And verses like this'll get me a new Rover
Get you a new home and a casket
Your funeral boring, I'm glad that it's over
Soulja!

Pistol close, even cops killing folks
Give their ass the whole magazine, fuck a centerfold
Sixteen with it, ho, one in the chamber
Mask on my face so I remain a stranger
Death round the corner run inside when we pull up
Learn the negotiations, how you talking to a bulldog?
Blap, blap, blap - what you hear when them shots go off
Devil on my shoulders told me squeeze my Glocks on y'all
Only the angel that I seen was the logo on the fitted

Game,"Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there

My father left me when I was 7, at a home
Left me but took his chrome, I looked up and blood was gone
Man, fuck it, guess in the world I'm all alone
My mother was too naive so when he left she followed along
And while you're listenin' to this song, askin' yourself why
It's really none of your business but I was there, I bear witness
To a grow fuckin' man with a bid
Unzipped his pants and I can't tell you what a pig
Me and my sister had different fathers, but I cared, and I loved her
And I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't scared, when he rubbed her
Tip of his penis on her, she was only 11
How could you ever get a boner?
Even thinkin' about it make me hot as a sauna
Make me wanna pop him like the top on Coronas
But I was scared, ran back to my room, prayed to God
That I was dreamin', can't believe I'm this nigga's semen
Livin' with demons and it'd been that way

Never been so hurt

I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100, yeah, 100

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg 'cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me

You gotta watch these hoes, they get your ass splattered homie
Never trust a bitch if she got the hood tattered on her
Brother ,he a gunner, got an uncle from the hunters
Two baby daddies, one from the 60s and one from the Jumpers
Make it even worse, her whole family's full of killers
After the funeral she right back to the followers and filters
She got a Range and a Benz
Doin' credit card schemes with her ratchet ass friends

Yellin' at her kids while Joseline and Stevie be arguin'
She blocked from Drizzy's page now she all on my dick

You done bought me enough jewelry
Tired of your shit my nigga you hitting

Nigga you lying, who you trying to run that game on?
Who you think I am? I'm not one of these thots you met at Playhouse

Jayceon stop lying you fucking think I'm stupid

You ain't complain when I bought that Maybach
Put you in Chanel, your friend Chanelle can't even say that
You wanted to see Rihanna I put you and your friends at the concert
Closet full of Giuseppe[?] you came a long way from Converse
Took you out that concord[?], put you in that Tom Ford
All this arguing I ain't got no time for it
You call my phone like fifty times
Don't do no shit like that
I was just fucking them girls
I was gon' get right back

What yo dumbass ruining the house for?And what time you get home anyway?
Shit, about four
And that's what the fuck you sleeping on the couch for
I don't give a fuck, thug life I'm an outlaw
And the next bitch ain't nothing but a house call
Scrolling through my iPhone looking for my sidechick
This bitch always flipping pushing buttons like a sidekick
That's when I hop in my Jeep and pull it out the toxic
And while you gone, guess what?
I'll be bouncing on that sidedick, nigga

I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
Shit, they stop making them, they stop making them
Guess she thought they stopped making real bitches when they made you
Shit, there's a few in the room and a couple in the Wraith too

Now she's explaining to you
That she's the baddest bitch to ever grace to pair of shoes
And if you are unable to find better you lose
And all this loud chirping that you consider rude
But when food is on the table
We may be arguing like the Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl I cut the cord from her navel

You gotta be there for me through the casualties
You see my trials and my tribulations
You can tell them demons tryna capture me
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
I know these niggas gonna ride, yeah, squeeze triggers
You gotta put in some time for this

I put the chrome to his neck like a pull up
You know a nigga bang Cedar block
You was bool with it, wasn't you?
Talkin' 'bout when a nigga gonna leave the block alone
But you never say this shit when I'm fucking you
We was the Huxtables, everything was perfect
Everything was working
We had some beautiful kids together
Had a nigga feeling like everything was worth it
Closet full of Birkins
How you make a nigga spend a million dollars on purses?
Then have an attitude
Like you in the studio helping a nigga write verses
Had a nigga focused on the future, now a nigga feeling like Future
We both dealing with a new nigga 'round our kids
And we ain't kill 'em yet, nigga, I salute you
And I still bang like I used to, red Impala, gold things like I used to
Pick up my kids, they don't see none of that
But when I'm back in the hood I'm yelling soo woo!
And it was all good just a week ago
Shit, we was Nicki and Meek a week ago
Gave you everything, the watch, the house, the cards
Tatted your passport, and now you wanna see me low
Wanna take my pussy, give it to the next nigga free

Compton ain’t the same
Where all these bitch niggas come from?
Can’t even take a fade or ride through the hood
Without niggas hands out like they want some
But where you at when I need you?
See most of these niggas see through
You throw up a P, I throw up a P too
You pulling out heat, I draw the heat too
Compton made me like this, nigga
Fuck all these bitches, get money and die
Hundred niggas in my section, hundred Rollies in the sky
There's a hundred little niggas that will bang on a nigga
Put the flame on a nigga, take chains from a nigga
That will go BG, Turk and Wayne on a nigga
When the club get cloudy let it rain on a nigga
We are with the shit, let us redefine lit
That’s in the club smoking on extendos, extendo with the clip
Standing on the couch like wah
Backwood hanging out my mouth like wah
Who the fuck want a problem?
Once you’re shot, leave a nigga dead on an island
Creep out the back door with my side bitch, aye

Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas

Don't you know there's no better time than when I'm with you?
But I can't control these temptations when a nigga not with you
You wanna be done with me, but your heart won't let it
Standing at the front door but you just can't exit
You wanna be with me
You wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me

Still hop in the freestyle, kick it like two Bruce Lee's

This the new West, nigga, respect that
It’s Top Dawg, all I’m missing is the red hat

Hopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide
Went from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise
Now tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5
On a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized
They ask me how I did it, how I got it
Say I'm king you looking brolic
I put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise
Tell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line
They got me babbling ghost cause I'm the illest one alive
That's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city
It's wise to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me
Ever since I saved my coast, it's been born again
If I ain't shit then who the king of California then?
Who could out-rap me?

I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes

But a cracker shoot a whole church up and it's ""oh well""
Oh well, oh well
Hang him with a confederate flag in his cell
Let him sit there and rot 'til his body turns to bones
Just remember who casted the first stone

No hesitation like steph, shoot it right in your face

Some shit just never make sense like bashin' the gays

Hotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial
Remedial thoughts, never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck
To dishraggin' bitches that was hard to fuck

Just left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK
What a day, what a day

Yeah, well dig. I heard you been over there in that studio with Dr.Dre landing down them cold YA DIG'S!
Yeah man, we been over there gettin' it in
Well, you know. Just let 'em know one thing",Uncle (Skit)
Game,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Crenshaw/80s and Cocaine
Game,"Here we go again
Ten years later
You know what man? Uhm
(I wanna know)
Fuck it
Ayo C
Give me that Jamison and that pickle juice
Thank you
I got some shit on my mind
(I wanna know)

My little nigga Frog dead, dog
They shot my little nigga in his head, dog
You heard what the fuck I just said, dog?
Walk inside my closet like fuck everything red, dog
If you seen your best friend stiff, you would cry too
Sometimes I don't even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like, fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin' brother?
(I wanna know)
Who killed G man too? The shit I seen men do
If I told you, I'd have me floating in cement shoes
See Compton ain't shit really
And I’ve been at the bottom of the pits, feel me?
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot, had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac, I’m like birdie at the troops
I can’t lie, every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I don’t know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak
Wilmington and Brazil, nigga them my cross streets
And who gon’ take it from me?

They think they know me
But they do not know me
'Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ain’t nothing gon' change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest, it's kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night, I'm like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
I'm cool with taking mine, but I took other niggas' gunshots
Chest wide open, I'm tryna fight, but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a Kumquat
I know who shot me cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but
(I wanna know)

They think they know me
But they do not know me
'Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ain’t nothing gonna change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
Shit, he ain't always have a nigga back
When I met him, he was standing behind Suge
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Gave him ten thousand, couldn't even finish his fuckin' sentence
I ain't owe him shit, but real recognize real
Now we like two red-nosed Pits
Cross him, you gotta cross me
And don't forget about where my nigga AR be
He be in the cut, that niggas nuts, don't give a fuck
Love his nigga Game to death, and he mean it from the guts
Blood, what's up? Which one of you dumb mothafuckas wanna try us?
(I wanna know)",From Adam
Game,"Um, yeah palms sweating guess it's time for the murder
My nigga my nerve, I swerve left you dead on the curb
Tell his family get them black clothes
Any witness gets a 9 cold, could do this with a blindfold
I'm that player on the corner looking dry when it rains
Pimp a dollar out a pussy, I ain't trying to change
Far from average, I'm smoking this cabbage
Bottled teeth, joint karats, say cheese, make the cops freeze
Big cribs, four bars, living pipe dreams
You only gangsta through your bop screen
Might set the reason for the crime scene
Fill up the city with madness
We the reason the hearses left your hood and holding up traffic
Let the riddles do the scrapping, keep the gun in my fabric
Better pistol than them badges, you get dealt with the maggots
Heard drive-bys everyday
Seen homies die early age, though we still gang bang anyway
Uh, yeah, Figg side

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh

B's and them h's, tats on faces, Glocks with extendos
Chucking up the hood then throw like 80 out that window
The chopper make you limbo
Gotta keep them antennas up, moving down Central
Young niggas with skinnies, moving with them semis
Catch your ass leaving the club, murk you at Denny’s
Squeeze till it’s empty, it seems so unreal
'Til the gunfire got you using tables as a shield
East side, west side, niggas getting chastised
Dropping like fruit flies, we all know who die
We all go on Insta and get the whole rundown
A 15 second clip until he put the gun down
Know OG’s who took more shots like diabetics
Had that MAC paint on your face like cosmetics
Chucking up big ass B’s is my fetish
Type of shit that make you go brazy if I let it
Niggas got zippers, wheelchairs and prosthetics

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh

Hundred days, hundred nights, nigga
Let the K'ss scream 'til we see the red and blue lights, nigga
From the hoovers to the hundreds, nigga
From Kelly Park to Bounty hunters, nigga
(Watch out for the shooters)
Same age as the kids in Iraq now
LA Chiraq now, funerals is packed now
Preachers at the pulpit, Jesus is the background
Grandmother get shot walking out the church
How that sound?
Niggas don't really like it but we grew up in it
City of angels, belly of the beast get chewed up in it
Started as Black Panthers, everything power, everything pro black
Started off unified the FBI know that
A little coke sprinkled on tables but wasn't no crack
False imprisonment, huey P, Geronimo Pratt
Now close your eyes, listen to me, your mind'll go back
Picture us chained together under the boat, that's a Kodak
And since today is Thursday, let me hit you with a throwback
Stolen identities, God left us here without lowjack
Forced to find ourselves, forced to break up outta chains
Got tired of getting hanged so we started our own gangs
Tookie Williams (Crip), Sylvester Scott (Blood)
Seventy two Lil' Country caught a slug
And that was the first time a crip ever killed a blood
Now the shit is worldwide cause it is what it was
We know the history and we know the shit could end any day

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh",Gang Bang Anyway
Game,"I remember days like this, my nigga
We was tripping cause we hated Crips, my nigga
Shooting out of six trays and shit, my nigga
He was slipping so we sprayed his six, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
A kid shot cause he raised his fist, my nigga
Fiends stealing cause they can't get a fix, my nigga
Sharing needles, passing AIDS and shit, my nigga
It's fucked up but I was raised in this, my nigga
Been smoking purple haze since six, my nigga
And my moms wasn't no lazy bitch, my nigga
I seen her hustle that's what made me rich, my nigga
But all this shit is overrated that's why I don't give a fuck no more
I don't want this Benz or this truck no more
I started off doing this shit cause I love this shit, Blood
Seeing the homie slap box, I love this shit, Blood
Sitting in my Impala like I love this shit, Blood
Weren't never 'bout a dollar, I just love this shit, Blood
Scrapping after school, Compton high wasn't bool
Could have went to Centennial but I love this shit, Blood
Used to bang quick, yeah I love this shit, Blood
Mossberg was sick and I love this shit, Blood
Then I gave Whack my demo outside of Food 4 Less
He came back in ten minutes like ""I love this shit, Blood""
West side Piru, I love this shit Blood
Elm street to the Fruits yeah I love this shit, Blood
Crip neighborhoods too, even though they blue
Compton is where we grew and I love this shit, Blood

My own homies did some shady shit, my nigga
But that's the shit that made my this, my nigga

All my life's been so complicated
But I will never turn my back on Compton
Our shit is so overrated
But I will never change who I am
So I'm riding for Compton
I ride, I ride, I ride, I ride for Compton

I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done took some fades with Crips, my nigga
My own homies did some shady shit, my nigga
Got a voicemail from Braze, what's this, my nigga

I know who killed Pac, nigga
The police know who killed Pac, nigga
Suge Knight know who killed Pac, nigga
He died at the carwash, the world heard the shots, nigga
Then they killed Biggie, he just came through to visit
Rampart divison, Pirus ain't had nothing to do with it
So many niggas in caskets, then turned ashes
Some get shot, some Hussein Fatal in car crashes
I think it's a conspiracy theory, Illuminati
How Pac died and two months later they killed Kadafi
Then they killed Buntry, [L?] and Heron, they getting sloppy
LAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis
And Pac was only 25, thuggin' as a youngin'
Sitting shotgun, I wonder if he seen them shots coming
Guess it don't matter, all the niggas buried, though
Wouldn't have never happened if Suge kept it real with Harry-O

Late night down Sunset, liking the scene
On a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win
Don't know how it begin, every day was a new
When he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth
And if crack had took a part of the homie's family tree
Lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me
And him to know my life story and we not even meet
When we did, it was like we'd known each other for demon
When the last time I seen him, he was playing his tape
And he would lay the title Makaveli the Great
Smile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas

Right on time with mine thanks to them old Doc prescriptions
West side flourishing again, this what 2Pac envisioned
Obama freeing lifers, that was locked in prison
El Chapo said he ran the world, and they forgot to listen
Not me, nigga, one split second, I say ""Fuck rap""
And if I ran into El Chapo, he had work as one his captains
And gave me 100 bricks and said ""Migo, get it bracking""
I walk into a Mexican Mafia meeting like

What's happening? Pac's gone, Brenda's still got a baby
What's happening? Lost ones in the land of the crazy
What's happening? You can have a bad bitch in a Mercedes
But that don't make your basic ass Beyonce or Jay-Z
What's happening? Obama 'bout to move out the White House
What's happening? Couple hood niggas 'bout to roll them dice out
What's happening? Is you gon' let me use your EBT card (yeah)
I wonder if I could slide it for commissary, yah

Ain't it a shame?
Another lost one running again
(You know I bust my thang for you)
You do the same old thing that your brothers did before you
Planning your whole life under concrete in the soil
Just a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from
If I know anything it's that my old head taught me all alone
And it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man
It's a chess game full of kings and pawns

Black and white squares, just depends what side you on
(What side is you on?)
I want a red '64 Impala with them things on it

Black out inside an abandoned crack house
Only thing from last night was dead bodies and glass pipes
That was the age 4, and by the age 10
They opened up the caged doors and let the fucking beast out
Fuck my auntie couch, I'm 'bout to take the street route
And get my shit the gangsta way, cause I can't be no Steve Stoute
I'm too Nas for these niggas, I got a surprise for these niggas
Potato cooking on the barrel, I bring the fries to these niggas
Funeral hall, casket fit to the size of you niggas
Chrome 45, no lie, come say goodbye to you niggas
Sway got all the answers, Kanye lied to you niggas
I don't even wanna be in no top 5 with you niggas
I break ties with you niggas, then pay tithes for you niggas
Los Angeles king, I will no fly zone you niggas
Take a caravan and Impalas and drive to you niggas
Close one and aim, Fetty Wap's eye to you niggas

Ain't it a shame?
Another lost one running again

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair

Maybe there's a God above

Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

Fucking faster than grand national regals
I'm in it in the pussy doing kegals
I'm so Fred Segal right now, she so spread eagle right now
Ain't nothing but the clothes going down

I talked to all the homies, yeah, all the homies
Swear that day we wish that we was with you
I remember when I first rolled up
Seen you laid out there on Rosecrans
It was Cedar Block and if you read about us
We was throwing that shit up with both hands
Make me wanna hop back in that old van
Take an Olde E and sip the whole can
But I'm out here, with your brother and your pops
All night, my nigga, I ain't got no plans
Your mom's out here having a fit
Big Frogg and the truck niggas sick
All the homies on the block getting lit
Putting everything they can into a clip
Yeah, to the street, it wasn't even Crips
Some of the homies trying to blame a bitch
Cause he was riding on sky today, he died
Wrong place, wrong time, nigga fucked up shit
But your funeral ain't nothing but love
Look around, it ain't nothing but Bloods
And let me tell you what a bitch nigga did
Took a good daddy away from seven kids

Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I

Still riding around through the city looking for an enemy
Still riding around through the city thinkin' 'bout all the memories
Thinking back like God damn
All them niggas really really livin me
Wishing I knew what I knew now
Half them niggas wouldn't have been next to me
Nowadays, ain't too many niggas next to me
None of these bitches getting next me
I seen what it did to a good friend
That was God trying to lecture me
That was God trying open me
That's when God got close to me
I went through the fire, went through the pain
Now it's all hope for me
Now it's designer, in the ghost that they chauffeur me
My haters is mad, oh you know, they didn't go for me
They wish I was gone, they wish in the song somebody wrote for me
But I got the goat in me, I got the truth in me

Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Traveling in his time machine a dream that had come true
Fly my friend, you will see, something called reality
I feel good, I'm alright, doing what I please - I travel time

Far beyond the rising sun I ride the winds of fate
Prepared to go where my heart belongs - back to past again

I just want to save the universe for all mankind
He wants to save the future of the Earth
Step by step surroundings change as years go passing by
He only stops to gaze a little while
I push the button further on, I just can't get enough
I know I will return again but still I'm movin' on

Far beyond the rising sun...

As I'm movin' on I see things to come, I see tears and I hear laughter
Curiosity, comin' over me, what is next and what will happen
And I see the lies and I hear the cries and the marchin' of the people
As they go to war, Heaven knows what for - God I think I've had enough now

Too late, too late - I can't go back no more! I lost control of the engine
No light, no light - can't see where I have gone! Can't see where I have now gone to
Where am I now - stranded in time


So many years have passed since I had gone and I have seen what's gonna be
But now I know it is useless to travel on
And I will return to the time and place I belong to

Have stopped to see

There's a way out, from here

Goodbye my friend
It's time to leave you on your own
Get going to find out your own way
Believe in what you're doing,
'cause I'm in your head
You can't hesistate anymore

Don't think about existence
Just move your ass - be yourself

Now realize - not criticize
Now move yourself - take your chance

Really I don't care
I have seen the future, rising everywhere
Look into the mirror, tell me what you see
Piece by piece you'll vanish,
Until you disappear!

Now, I'm doing, what I say
No more fooling, anyway
Beyond this hell, there is a better life to lead
You're all undone, emotionless,
It's not the way for me

Now I know, there's a better way
Let my heart ride out for a brighter day
Now it's time to breathe in the open air,
With a mind so free, anyway
It's time for a change,...
It's time to break free!

Had enough of fooling, had enough of lies,
Hypocrisy, intriguing, right before my eyes
Had enough of hound dogs, barking all the time
I agree with Elvis, you ain't no friend of mine

Apart from this, there is a better life, I know
You're all undone, emotionless,
It's time for me to go

Now I know, there's a better way
Let my heart ride out for a brighter day
Now it's time to breathe in the open air,
With a mind so free, anyway

Now I know, there's a better way
Let my heart fly free towards a better day
Now it's time to breathe, it's the only way,
Let my mind ride out, anyway...

From the sunlight of my home
And I have seen it's the only way
Now my sun is dead and gone

I raise my head in silent anger
Seems there is no place for me

Where no one's gone before

Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time

And I can't wait until tomorrow

There was a trigger, for my decision
It's right behind my eyes
Into the darkness of my vision
I let my spirit rise

I want to see the black hole, into the dark
I want to dive into the black hole, down into the dark

Into the black hole, into the dark
Into the spiral, into the dark, the dark, the dark

If there's a possible chance for something that can be
Called future behind the spiral
The only way to find out, is to leave the final frontier
To eternity and fly

I will fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
I leave the universe behind
And I can't wait until tomorrow

Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time

All gods creation is finally dead and gone
Our revelation, the day of judgement comes
Forevermore I stand alone
The final fury has begun,
when the day has come
Guardians of the monsters of the earth
Take our lives away
and you forever will be cursed
Keepers of the darkness in this world
We will not surrnder to the evil of your birth
Hope will never die,
And the clear blue sunny sky
will ease the pain,
Guardians of the monsters of the earth
Lead us not into temptation
Save us from the revelations
I stand alone, I stand alone,
I stand alone, Inside my head
no one can hear, no one can hear,
no one can hear, My little word
Holy father, take me on your wings of love
I wish that I could be forever free, oh yeah
It's the end of the world as we know it

I never wanted to believe

Bury me and let me rest in peace
Now the time of truth has come for everyone

it opened up the gates
For the dark avengers,
their anger kills the light and then ...

His curse brought endless desease
And as the wind carried the deadly seed
to the minds of the doomed,
They were gone for the stage of hell

Take me down and let me rest in peace

Gamma Ray,"I was born in the rotten part of the town
The biggest trap I had seen
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to
Evil is all around

My mother's a bitch, my father's a killer
Gettin' paid for murder
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day
The only way to survive

Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war

Fly high, touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate

I had to kill people to save my own life
I don't wanna go to hell
I started at the bottom
I'm headin' for the top

I'll never return, I'll never go back
To that goddamn part of the town
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid
But this ain't the life I dreamt of

Wanted from law but they'll never catch me
I'd much rather die in this bloody war

Fly high, touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate

What now lonely man who's standing
In the shadows of the streets
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you
You hide from the daylight living in darkness

You got no friends you can trust nobody
Except for yourself
The only shade that's beside you
Is the shade of Lucifer

Laughing with a satanic smile
And his friend Death sharpens his sickle
You don't wanna die, do you? But you will
You will burn in hell

Fly high, touch the sky
Never know the reason why it ends
Victim of fate

Fly high, touch the sky, you will die

The time has come to rise, my name is Doom.
Ask no questions
There will be an answer soon.""

And we fall through the dark of the underworld
And we`re leaving the light of the day
And I know we will go to the other side

To the one who will never betray

Yeah, bite me!

There was a time when hell was divine
The holy man was nailed to the cross
A fire on ice, burning inside
All my hope and loving was lost

Now hell is my home, the sadness is gone
But don`t you think my soul it is lost
If you really care just hold out your hand
And I will free you all from the cross

Shouting out in agony: ""Fear the cross""
I`m digging my claws into his neck and raise him to the ceiling
Gritting my teeth I smell the blood
You are lost!

I want blood red vengeance

Weeks turning to months,
Changing colours from an underdog,
Into a god

Unchain yourself from the temporal power,
And you will finally be free

My future was somber,
And so were my eyes,
But when the lights turned on,
It marked the start of a new life,

The lust for a new generation,
Is filling my mind,
Something new borns,
When something old dies

Unchain yourself from the temporal power,
And you will finally be free,
Free from your mental slavery,
From serving time,
To have all the time you need.",End of Time
Gandalf,"Now the ghouls are back on the streets, 
Capturing new victims and starting to feast, 
The lost souls haunted eyes show shame and guilt, 
Soon fresh blood is set to spill, 
Dressed in disguise, 
They offer their friendship and trust, 
But what they really want, 
Is to suck you dry in lust, 
Have your spirits, 
Disappearing in vain, 
Your shadow fading away, 
In emotional pain, 
Your heart is being torn apart, 
When you try to dig yourself, 
Out of the dark, 
You fear of losing your rests in pain, 
But take a chance to see what you have to gain, 
Don't think that this is your destiny, 
Living under the spell of a charming enemy, 
You fear of losing your rests in pain, 
But take a chance to see what you have to gain, 
Don't let your mind make you a shadow, 
To have your heart and soul - fade away.",Fade Away
Gandalf,"A vision of mortality - all spirits reign supreme
Watched and controlled - these emotions are crucifying me

Who can you trust
When you are lost
Who'll show the way
When you're astray
Who tells the truth
To the world and the youth
Don't need an answer to this
''cause I'm in a sacred bliss

When you're a marionette
Locked by your lost emotions, dancing to images of clowns
When you're a puppet
Looking through the eyes of the dead, on your lost, burning soul

Who is the fool
Is it me or you
Do you know the way
When you are astray
Try to find out
What life is about
Don't hesitate
Before it's too late

You hail to the king
You know that he will win
But in the mirror you see
A puppet with a face of grief",Marionette
Gandalf,"Emotions lost in oblivion, 
Getting open the gates of hell, 
With an open mind and open to die, 
Shivering creatures start their ride,

Lives on and on and on, 
The ride for new dimensions of life, 
Go on until they are gone, 
The decay of man is true, 
When I watch me in the future, 
When I see the look in your face, 
I feel like a creature, 
Never I will tear your soul apart, 
Never I will make your heart bleed, 
Never - Again, 
Never I will leave you alone again, 
Never I will make you go insane, 
The painful memories of a forgotten world, 
Makes me cry, 
Locked up in a cell, 
With the horrors I created for myself, 
I take what's mine, 
And break it to pieces, 
Just believe my word, 
Never Again, 
Just make a prayer and wait for a miracle, 
From the sky,

With new heights to find.",Never Again

Nothing in there but sunshades for the blind
Only yesterday I said to myself
The things I'm doing are not good
For my health

""Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about,
cos most groups make most of their songs about falling in love
or how happy they are to be in love,
you occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time -
it's because these groups think there's something very special about it
either that or else it's because everybody else sings about it and always has,
you know to burst into song you have to be inspired
and nothing inspires quite like love.

These groups and singers think that they appeal to everyone
by singing about love because apparently everyone has or can love
or so they would have you believe anyway
but these groups seem to go along with what, the belief
that love is deep in everyone's personality.
I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love,
we just don't think that what goes on between two people
should be shrouded with mystery.""

Other writers are outclassed
Surpassed by the words and the wit
Rhymes fit and hit cause that's how we designed it
Page for page, we are the new age
Dope in the videos and dope when we're on stage
Commanding respect with my ink pen while suckers are sinking
As I'm keeping them thinking
Narrating phrases of value, and I can see now you
Relate to what I create
From back in the days of my youth, I've looked for the truth
And yo my rhymes are the real proof
New heights and new realms have been reached
By use of my speech along with one of Premier's beats
So listen and we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A

Worshipful words giving insight, so just be observant
So you can get this right
My oratory gift is abundant, so dazzling to minds
That you should come get
A glimpse of the one who puts wimps out of work
The script is a mess and they dress like they're jerks
Beyond them, is where I'll be dwellin

Placin my fingers on the tool, I runaway all fools
When I'm dispersin a verse
Think of an enjoyable moment, then boogie your body
Cause this party I own it
The origin of this is on paper
Vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
I go with the flow as I show expertise
The powers increase as my voice hits the streets
Then gripping your soul with authority
I pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
And then I might bring another round
Watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
And keep aware, cause we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A",As I Read My S-A

Ours is a better gift, not to be bragging nor lolligagging
I can see dimensions of sound and light around my mic
Transmitting lyrics like teletype
Reacting to a beat in a whisper
And like a transistor, I'm sounding dope when I'm crisper
The shortest length between two points is a straight line
I've gotta take mine, I heard it through the grapevine
That some can't find hype lines (hype lines...)
And so I'm smothering, over my prey I am hovering
Suckers I'm shoving at the same time covering
You with the blanket of some language that's distinguished
How swift can I get? You ask and I'll tell
For I can excel real well like a gazelle
Past your head, I'm grabbin abstract thought
Like some gain glory, while others get no part
I feel for the hurt ones, the victims of wrong deeds
Awareness is key, our people have strong needs
Science, math, history theology
Philosophy psychology english and biology
Et cetera, and all of these have a purpose
But genocide makes me nervous
So many questions, many opinions to mention
And damn (damn) this jam's beyond comprehension

Like planets in orbit, we ride the life cycle
Some take a rifle on the street cause it seems neat
Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season
I'll do my show then I'm leavin
I'd rather be blastin dope sounds on the other side of town
Than be there when they close the place down
But anyway, everyday, there's another way
For a person to just flip, so a brother may
Simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad
I know the struggle my father had
Poetry it comes from within, and will always win
Hold captive bodies from end to end
And at a party, I'll survey then slay with the quickness
Displaying the fitness
Easing the mind and relieving the tension
And singing my own song that's beyond comprehension",Beyond Comprehension

Sticking you and frickin you, just a teenie bit
I`m clever, with science, but never relyin
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin
Insistin they come off, I let `em get some off
Then come back wit drum tracks, their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin, like makin love, i`ll never stop thrustin
Into your system, so just listen
I`m like a neurosurgeon, operatin wit a purer version
I write prescriptions, of words that fit in
The thought gets prescribed, as I kick it live
Cause it`s more that a style, it`s conceptual genius
My effect on the scene is, to project that I mean this
You deadbeat, wait until you see my next feat
I get respect for the rep when I speak

I`m rushin you like a defensive end as I recommend
That you comprehend, I could stomp you in
A battle, contest, or war, what will occur
Will be the forfeiture, of your immature
Insecure for sure, meek, weak visions of grandeur
To rudely awaken you, and then`ll be breakin you
Taxin without askin and trackin and snakin you
Makin you succumb to the drums of gangstarr
By far we are, truly gifted ones son
But if you were to speculate or estimate us losin
You`ll be dyin, tryin to face the fate of your delusions
Cause miscalculation, is all you`re statin
So i`m chumpin, puntin punks just like footballs

To clean up the slop, and stop all the bullcrap

Dance your ass off hobbes, check the technique

Your ass gets busted doodoo mustard, you tried to work me
You irked me - because you copy and falsify
And I don`t care how many step up, cause you all can try
To wish and fish for a style, here`s a fishin rod
These rhymes are hittin hard, constantly i`m gettin large
Inevitably, I readily kick a slew
Of lyrics so deep, so don`t sleep, but just peep me
Puttin methods on records and spinning for each millisecond
33 rpm`s displays the art of men
And as my rhymin builds you see my time it`s chill
And then I look upon weak ones
I`m teachin each one so they become redone
Essays are relayed to twist you up like french braids
Or tied up like corn braids, cause I got a strong way
Force like police raids to never be delayed
I once was the least paid but I made the grade
Cause this ain`t a slave sale and I ain`t the same stale
Rapper, no, i`m not a phony microphonist wit no blaster
No type of real appeal or real - talent
And it makes me violent man
To see all of these peewee bee mc wannabees
Makin g`s for some dumb companies
And lots of money but no idea what is rap and what is dope
So check out what the guru wrote
Cause I will prevail, give you tales as I unveil
Have enough braincells so I can stay paid well

I had to cut homeboy off for even tryin that
His game was mad weak, know what I'm sayin black?
Stepped to him quietly, he copped a plea
Told him to fix it or I'd have to catch a body
In this society, there's many snakes
Don't be too eager when you're seeking a break
Cause chumps will exploit, use you to benefit
So just be keen and, learn all the ins of it
I've had my share, of dealing with fake men
I left them squealing, ""It was I who did the taking""
Proceeding exactly, according to plan
I foiled the scheme cause it seemed I was that man
And if you step up like the kid who did front
You will bear witness, the execution of a chump

Now, now, let's get the purpose of it
I'm snatchin hearts out of chumps, cause I deserve to love it
Observin acts of a snake, while I evaluate
Eliminate the nucleus, I'm doin this
Pissed usin fists usin force of any sort
My conscience says it's nonsense, if I put up with it
It meaning sleazy, sorry-type slick types
I'll drive em all to danger, and make em hitchike
Cause if you step up like the kid who did front
You will bear witness, the execution of a chump

Call me the Guru, known as a spiritual teacher
I'll reach you deftly, directly, correctly so select me
Elect me as your prophet and we'll praise him as I drop it
Pursue this, review this, I knowledge more than buddhist monks, punk
I'll wreck the set and grab a big chunk
Known to be a wise one, known to be a seeker
Following my calling in life, so I can keep the
Minds in line to find devine designs of rhyme
Rewind this on your box one time
But if you step up like the kid who did front
You will bear witness, the execution of a chump",Execution of a Chump (No More Mr. Nice Guy)
Gang Starr,"Tell me, do you have a clue of what to do
Can you groove to this smooth tune, you must presume
It's important, for you to follow this creation
And hey Son, life is more than having fun
So run and get some help with the problems that you face
Take a taste of the bass put your perspective in place
Get real, deep, so you can keep involved
Revolve and solve, so you can make the calls
Like a supervisor he who is wiser than the others
'Cause they need someone to advise them to discover
Things that they don't know so the papers I will check
Then they'll start to grow to this form of intellect

When the road is too steep, do you have the stamina
First album took us two weeks, since then we have been plannin'
An exclusive attraction, produce it to your satisfaction
Those of you lackin, we will put you back in your slime
So you can think and get a grip of
Yourself by yourself, and then you'll get a sip of
A gift that's equipped with the script that shocks
You can take a walk ?on God?
With your mouth wide open, hoping you can find a
Way to display similar actions in a kind of mockery
'Cause you don't realize the cost to be
Creative genius please, I'm too clean to play
Glance per chance, watch GangStarr perfect
And dance your pants like champs, to this form of intellect

Valuable solutions, we invent here
Break and remake the cupcakes to show we've been sent here
To serve you, so swallow this and bite it
And why bring, ignorance when we're inviting
You to get advancement, while you're on the dance tip
And don't you know the transcript will make you shake hips
Or chill at will, and with skill, you'll learn some etiquette
Better get the subject or be last at the predicate
And get a set, of headphones and speakers
As lyrical lessons manifest, I will keep you
Abrest of the best, in this rap mess
Over-saturated market, full of wackness
I'm Gifted Unlimited, Rhymes Universal
The Guru, nursing you with a verse spilled
Don't choke, and don't turn blue in a frenzy
Premier's severe, on the steel wheels he lends me
Spontaneous cuts, but not mainly just that
It's the scratching format, exact with maddening accuracy
Craftily, on the side or in back of me
Nastily, as if his name was Dick Dastardly
Original so get it yo the Gang gets respect

Gang Starr,"Many MC`s are mislead
Mislead by the lies that they pump in their heads
The money and the fame that they`re hoping to find
Will never come close to the scope of my rhyme
Now some have been successful but really
And yo, these MC`s are clearly not nearly
Up to this level or should I say caliber
Because I`m hype that the company`s selling me
Because they`ll take a dud, talk some crud and then push him
But in the next year, someone new will just squoosh him
Because when you sell out to appeal to the masses
You have to go back and enroll in some classes
So cash in your check `cause it`s the last one you get
The tables have turn and now you ain`t in effect
So jet to the rear and you better just follow
`Cause what`s here today maybe gone tomorrow

Here and gone in a flash, some made cash
While other suckers go broke real fast
Some never make any money but still they act funny
LIke they`re thinking they`re running
Things, wearing rings and medallions
Then listen to their rhymes when we rather take valiums
`Cause swiftness and skills they are lacking
So I send them packing, they should have know not to tax in
And smashing all of the vocals to smithereens
Watching them collecting themselves `cause they ?(bitter seen)?
But some find happiness while others find sorrow
And what`s here today, maybe gone tomorrow","Here Today, Gone Tomorrow"
Gang Starr,"Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes

Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
'Cause in the night, you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a 4-5th, I guess you just might
Want to do a dance or two
'Cause they could maybe bust you for self or wit a crew
No matter is you or your brother's a star
He could pop you in check without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame
From the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain
That the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck
Claimin' respect, just to get a rep

Ten brothers in a circle
Had the kid trapped, the one wit the hood, he said, ""we'll hurt you""
If you don't run out your dues and pay
Give up the rolex watch or you won't see another day
See, they were on the attack
And one said, ""yo, you want to make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""now"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep",Just to Get a Rep
Gang Starr,"The meaning of the name GangStarr, well I'll tell ya
It means How far my mind can excel to
A greater type of thought, brought by the things that I've been taught
In relation to things that I rebel to divine and combine
With a sense of confidence
Accomplishments, are achieved on floppy disc
But slopiness, I could never tolerate it
Not the Guru nor Premier you don't know how long we've waited
While other groups have faded, just like haircuts
We use sheer guts to open the earducts of your brain
To expose every vain
Cause you sound plain, insane, and mundane, it's a shame
You've got no beats, so you get no seats
At this table, you ain't stable with the mic cable
Cain and Abel, jealous brothers
And I knew some girls who were overzealous lovers
But back to the act of developing the GangStarr track
It means that nothing can be wack
The music is picked right, the mic is gripped tight
The lyrics I kick right to a beat like Kryptonite power
Not withstood by any mortal or immortal
To make you get on the floor til
Another dope jam we slam with precision
Bringing beams of light, like the colors in a prism
Or reflections, through a spectrum
And all the soft silly suckers I'mma wet them
In other words destroy boy, and then claim my fame...
This is the meaning of the name

GangStarr, it means a lot to me
It means I'm free to bust rhymes sporadically
Gang represents my boys or a posse
So just back up off me
And the Starr symbolizes the power
Making the suckers and weak brothers cower
We got strong, intelligent minds with a street sense
Crazy offense, and stupid defense
Now, have I made myself clear?
Or do I have to call on DJ Premier?
For he and I make up the songs that you long for
Meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door
Waiting for a call or for the doors to open
Cause they're hoping, that they'll get chosen
But to be chosen is indeed our gift
You better get a job quick
See you can't rhyme and all your beats are weak
You oughta take a peak and check out the technique
Seek, and you shall find
GangStarr stands for mastermind

And since I`m inclined, I`ll kick precisely the right rhymes

Listen listen listen I`ll tell ya
My rhymes are like shelter, or rather like an umbrella
Protecting you from the weak stuff you heard from those creampuffs
About the schemes that they dreamed of

About the way they slayed this one or that one
But won`t step to me, cause they know the last one
Who tried to match the panache of the Guru
Received a curse that was much worse than voodoo

'Cause the effect of my voice is immense
It would make more sense if suckers hide in the basement

I got much flavor and class too

Gang Starr,"So many things will happen that one can`t explain
You find yourself saying ""who me"", time and again
They say what goes around, comes around
Ahun, so think about it while you`re messing up clown
A mother`s love and a father`s concern
Here is the reason you should listen and learn
`Cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
`Cause after all the highs, you`re gonna feel all the lows
This is why knowledge of self is essential
`Cause if you don`t have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit
`Cause every second, another dream is destroyed wit
The systematic plan devised to erase us
And straight to hell is where they`re trying to take us
But never fold and hold back your fears
Have a strong mind and try to say your prayers",Say Your Prayers
Gang Starr,"Once you step in the arena, cheater, you`re gonna be a-
Mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
Fully clad and glad to find a cause, I won`t pause
Fear is a joke, slowpoke, I`m like claws
That`ll rip `cause your gift, is merely flesh
Superficial and I wish you, would give it a rest
But if you don`t, I`ll unsheath my Excalibur
Like a noble knight, so meet ya challenger
A true hero, while you`re a through zero
Gettin beat to a pulp so that you can`t run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat, cause you hope that I`ll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check out how I mellowed into it
Face to feet to defeat, you can tell I`m into it
As I`m pullin out my lance, to kill you and advance to
The winner`s throne, cause I own you once you step in the arena

In the arenak, or rather coliseum
There`s people gatherin by multitudes to see one
Perpetrator fall to the dust after the other
Quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
Born wit the art in his heart that is Spartacus
And one-to-one combat Jack, just a thought of this
Match-up, makes GangStarr want to snatch up
One or two phrases from the new book with new pages
Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it, to the battle set
If a beat was a princess, I would marry it
But now I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud
Victorius, glorious, understand now
Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, cause you`d rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed or
Struck by a blow, from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
Cause rhymin is serious, I`m strong, I`m like Hercules
You`ll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
And suckers can jet cause I wreck once you step in the arena

In the arena or forum, weak MC`s I will floor `em
Causin' mayhem, I`ll slay them, and the blood`ll be pourin'
Furthermore I implore, that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs cause I dump all the sly chumps
Never choosin' to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I fear
Is foolish utterly, I mean but none`ll be
Tryin' to toy wit a destroyer of many
You shitted your pants cause you can`t figure any
Foe that can step to this concept so
You better sit again citizen, weak MC`s I get rid of them
Watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
In the worst positions, cause they didn`t listen
And tried goin' up against a hungry killer who`s itchin
To maim and murder, those who claimed that they were the
Toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena",Step in the Arena
Gang Starr,"Presenting you with alternative music
'Cause, yo, the struggle is tough, and we must learn to live through it
Pleasure and pain, pain and pleasure
We gotta maintain a balance to obtain the treasure

Not really preaching or teaching but just reaching
Out to a brother or sister who is keeping
The faith and trying hard to get straight
The time is crucial so I think we must congregate

Let's have a meeting of the minds
Before we all fall and get left far behind
Finding a way is important
Map out a plan, take a stand, you can work it

The future's all in your hands and
So of yourself, yea, you should be demanding
We're all responsible for whatever outcome

Knowledge is key and if you ask what it is, G

Gang Starr,"Well goodness gracious, let me just take this
Time out to pull a rhyme out, and update this
For you and yours, simply because
Some MC's have luck but suck
So I pluck em like feathers on the back of a chicken
Cause I'm mad like a pit when my man says, ""sick 'em""
Positive is the mindstate, but it could still mean that
I will kick a ill, malicious like mean rap
Suckers they forced me, to knock em all out and
They think they know things, like what I'm about and
They try to analyze criticize scandalize
The outcome is death, don't ask me to sympathize
Realize, that I'm not to be played with
I'll flip so fast, you won't know I'm the same kid
I'm tired and fed, with all the weak stuff said
All the phony-baloney, that went out like Pro-Keds
You've got no leads, so you shoot blanks
It's me the crowd thanks as I step to the top ranks
Bankin my money, and investin it wisely
Snatchin up chumps when they try to sneak by me
I'm the dominant one, call me the prominent one
And as I'm speakin I'll be bombin the dumb
Deaf and blind cause I was born with a sharp mind
Eatin MC's with ease like it's lunchtime
Or crunchtime, when they get done without warning
I'll bust that butt from nighttime til morning
Your song's boring, and so I'm scoring
Much points cause when it's time to throw joints
I cause havoc, the mic I grab is like savage
I invade the stage, and make you get off
The force is like a three-eight, blowin your head off
And that's just in case you might be wearin a vest
Cause you're simply a pest in this mess I suggest you

Don't ever sleep son, peep one or two of these lines here
Arranged by a great brain, delivering rhymes clear
And concise with a nice dope voice and
Killin the fakes like a taste of some poison
Punks are thinkin they're alla that, their voices are all flat
They're findin their names, in a Wack Rapper's Almanac
Me follow that hollow crap, no way Jose
I'll seek out a better sound, to somethin Premier plays
Days will go by, and soon you'll know why
MC's like me will rise like the Enterprise
Starship, headin straight for the target
Destination, a place where no perpetration
Is permitted, the Guru is with it to explain
How some MC's are scared to ride on a Four train
Or any other train in the city, for that matter
Playin a role that they stole like a batter
But I know they ain't so I'll paint the real picture
My vocals go solo and like a bolo I'll hitcha
Square in your face I'll crack your ribs and your chest
Cause you thought your off-brand jam was the best
You fessed cause you guessed people would be impressed
I'm gonna bust that bubble on the double ""take a rest""

Sit back and reflect, ponder and chill out
Rhymes like daggers make blood spill out
But you can't blame me, for bringin disaster
With all these ducks, claimin that they're the masters
Only thing they mastered, is how to get wacker
As I roll uphill, they roll downhill faster
Now they're wondering how they lost their touch
Wanna buy my rhymes but mine cost too much
I'm the innovative one, call me the creative one
And I won't stop til the job is done
All the slobs just run when I come to get some
Cause they know better, than to challenge this go-getter
They get bust you can trust cause I won't let a
Booty-ass rapper get wins against me?
I guarantee that I won't act friendly
Cause crabs have a nerve and deserve to get whipped on
Their girls get kissed on, while they get flipped on
I slaughter and slay, or slap em up quick
Cause the lyrics they kick make me seriously sick
No substance, no value, but nevertheless
They're gettin daytime play but I still say they should ""take a rest""",Take a Rest

And, if I had a girl, why would I front?
You're only gonna get your feelings hurt, miss
And truthfully I really don't wanna have to diss

How does she know where we live, I didn't tell her
And word is bond, duke, I'm not the fella
No matter what I say this young lady's persistent
For instance, she watches me from a distance
And if I walk by and I forget to say hi
She pushes up on me and rubs me with her thigh
I told her I was taken, but she doesn't care
A-yo, do me a favour, tell her I'm not here
Forget it, I think she heard my voice already

Gang Starr,"I was raised like a Muslim
Prayin' to the East
Nature of my life relates rhymes I release
Like a cannon
Cuz I been plannin' to be rammin' what I wrote
Straight on a plate down your throat
So digest as I suggest we take a good look
At who's who while I'm readin' from my good book
And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
Set your mind free as I slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes pow
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin'
'Cause things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy
There's many people frontin'
And many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but I still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so I break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
Guru with the mic and Premier raise the anchor
Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions I made, cuz now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there I got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?

The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind I find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less travelled
So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the Nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far I can take ya
Original invincible
That's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?",Who's Gonna Take the Weight?
Gang Starr,"I'm 2 deep and yes much too complicated
My lines when stated are quite often underrated
So consider it a privilege to hear this
Those weak-minded opinions could never come near this
For my outlook on life is a profound view
Whil the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
Only a few sound true
Me and the crew know who
'Cause you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
Giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down
You punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
Knowing that hard is something you can`t be
So you front but you could never call my bluff
'Cause you`ll catch hell you`ll get dealt with

I never sleep
I always peep
Rhymes creep
I`m 2 Deep
I`m 2 Deep....

I forgive you sike I`m takin` your life
'Cause you continue to disrespect so I`ma get trife
But then again I think I`ll spare ya
'Cause I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
See I`m the holder of the key 
Don`t ask me if I`m Muslim don`t say nothin` to me 
I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins 
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn`t
Gonna make it and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted I almost missed it
The chance yes the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I`m me
And the nation of Islam has my support 
'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
And the 5 percent nation takes other steps
To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prison they give the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
Of a total different scene I dress clean, stand lean 
Say what I mean and I`m out
Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout

[Chorus]

For right now yo my religion is rhyming
Perfect timing test the flow and climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Sheite, Jihad
All must regard the times are hard
Unite or perish
Is the message I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we`re all black why have so many divisions
Superficial factors are drawing us apart 
Don`t let it happen
Let`s put some respect back in
So before I act I think 'cause it`s the brink of destruction
Word corruption what`s up son your gun is just one
And I just might have one 
Or two or maybe even three or four
And plus an army of 100 or more
But violence is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice

Make sure she puts attention mr. guru
Brothers know the flow is unique
I got 100 wild styles in my black valise
Mc's wanna be me so they keep askin
For me to teach 'em methods both slow and fast
And others wanna act as if they're better
But they only got one style which ain't all that clever
I'm cooler than wind, harder than cold steel
I get the ladies with more than just sex appeal
A mystic psychic scanning all your thoughts
I'll touch your soul and make your brain feel caught
When my rapture traps ya and makes you mine
You'll submit to the gift and to the lyrical lines
So suckers realize that the size is too large
When I come through I'm pullin' whole crews cards
I be wreckin' correct and on the gangster tip

I wonder do you love it enough
I'm steppin' rugged and tough, never to front or to bluff
I got the fresh cut baldy, the brothers call me

Heyo check it that's dead that's it
'cause all you phony ass rappers imma' bust your shit

Step off unless you wanna get torn up
Your raps worn out burned out fucked up
You lucked up or maybe you lucked out
'cause at the battle last time you snuck out
But now I'm rolling over you full blast
I'm here to let you know no longer will the bull last
Mc's telling lies and poppin' all those myths
Keep on fakin' moves and imma'",B.Y.S.
Gang Starr,"You can't tell me life was meant to be like this
A black man in a world dominated by whiteness
Ever since the declaration of independence
We've been easily brainwashed by just one sentence
It goes: all men are created equal
That's why corrupt governments kill innocent people
With chemical warfare they created crack and aids
Got the public thinking these were things that black folks made
And every time there's violence shown in the media
Usually it's a black thing so where are they leading ya
To a world full of ignorance, hatred, and prejudice
Tv and the news for years they have fed you this
Foolish notion that blacks are all criminals
Violent, low lifes, and then even animals
I'm telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me
But I must do my part to combat the conspiracy

The S.A.T. is not geared for the lower class
So why waste time even trying to pass
The educational system presumes you to fail
The next place is the corner then after that jail
You've got to understand that this has all been conspired
To put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired
It even exists when you go to your church
'Cause up on the wall a white jesus lurks
They use your subconscious to control your will
They've done it for a while and developed the skill
To make you want to kill your own brother man
Black against black you see it's part of their plan
They want to send us to war and they want to ban rap
What they really want to do is get rid of us blacks
Genocide is for real and I hope that you're hearing me
You must be aware to combat the conspiracy

Even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold
Now that rap is big business the snakes got bold
They give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop
'Cause they have no regard for real hip-hop
They'll compare you to others and say: ""but yo, he sells""
And you know in your heart that he's weak as hell
So you say: ""I ain't doing that corny stuff""
But they tell ya that your chart positions will go up
Sometimes they front big time and make you many promises
And when they break 'em then your mama says
""son you're making records but that guy seems shady""
It could be too late and your career could be played gee
I hope you listen to the things that I'm sharing see
We all have a job to combat the conspiracy",Conspiracy
Gang Starr,"You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelects
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my beema goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Bow I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field cuz I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with a grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm on with the next girl

She had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near cuz of my svoir faire
The time we shared was brief cuz I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad
Yo but she'd tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec cuz the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm straight with the next girl

You saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how's my sister then asked how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father cuz you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darlin' was fly and this was the problem
Cuz back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and me I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
Went home to see mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? nah I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl & I'm out with the next girl out",Ex Girl to Next Girl
Gang Starr,"Brave is the knave who steps up to be slayed
By the one who forgave him for his first mistakes
He'd best behave, or I`ma send him a wave
Of some shocking volts, he doesn`t know what he`s talkin about
He's kickin a bunch of crap so I`ll be the judge of that
The boy lacks artistry but still he tries hard to be
An entertainer, but instead he`s a waste of
My time and your time so I`ll kick the pure rhymes
Whenever you`re looking for rap that`s exceptional
And credible, straight to the G`s you better go
Cause GangStarr`s known to be prone to be
Masters of streetwise poetry and turntable wizardry
But still be a cold day in Hell when you hear that
Guru or Premier ever tell suckers get sales
But they fail in the long run that kid who went gold yo
That was the wrong one but tonight the spotlight is all on me
I`m the Guru, of the G-A-N-G
Taking out scrubs cause they rub me the wrong way
And I`ll say, that they`ve still got a long way to go
To show they can flow like a real pro
So gimme that loot catch the boot from my steel toe
I`m changing the scenery as I make em uncomfortable
Cause most MC`s ain`t really got no pull
Watch me stifle em quick with the gift and the wit
Make em quit all that riff as I flip the script

[Chorus]

Fool listen, I know that you`ve been missing
All this and so my rhymes are gonna gleem and glisten
Like a gem, and if you are the fake MC type
I`ll shine so bright I`ll be blinding your eyesight
Your capabilities fall short so I`ma treat you like a dwarf
On a basketball court still you try to rap
And even claim you got new styles but
Rolling your tongue`s been playe dout for a while
And you don`t sound fly so why are you doing that?
You had a dope track but you`re wack so you ruined that
I couldn`t make out what you were saying your diction
Is jumbled where as me I`m conveying clear thoughts
To a crowd that`s most critical
Booty duck rappers like you are just pitiful
I bet you couldn`t name more than one pioneer
Cause you didn`t pay dues and you got on on outta nowhere
But that`s OK cause I`m peeping your card
If rap was my house you`d be sweeping the yard
As I recline I`ll find more chores to give ya
Like moppin the floors or maybe fetchin my slippers
So don`t even trip or run off with the lip
Cause as soon as you slip you know I`ll flip the script

[Chorus]

So as I kick a bit flip with script without a skip
Butter roll MC`s get dissed like this
You`ll never got none son because I`ll become troublesome
You rap like a simpleton
And I hate scum yo I can easily deflect your threats
Cause they`re idle my recital will break you down
Just a fight til the end cause I can take ten at a time
Give em all a fair shot to see if any can rhyme
And even if one is decent, I`ll still get props
I`ll kick the slick lines til the last one drops
As my powerful skills are unveiled I`m tippin the scales
And weighing much more than your tall tales
Stop the exaggeration perpetration observe
And make simple notation
Nobody no where no way no how
Is taking me out cause I can throw so you know now
Can you feel it, I bust raps so lay off
Before I steal that so called title that you gave yourself
But you really ain`t jack so yo you played yourself
And now you look from a distance as you sweat my tip
You know I`ll whip you swift when I flip the script",Flip the Script
Gang Starr,"Now I got you looking stiff you numbskull, you`re at a stand still
Still faking that you`re hard with your rhymes and got no hand skills
So I`ll easily drop you and stop you from rhyming
Send you home to moms all bruised up and crying
Then if you want you can go call your people
You`re gonna need a mob against me cause I`m lethal
Not that I`m a violent brother to the contrary
My vocals carry, and then I bury
MC`s in holes that they dug for themselves
Couldn`t be themselves so they sold themselves
To a company exec who doesn`t have respect
For real rap music so he wants to get an MC
That starts out street to crossover
But not me, cause I`m the hardcore composer

You ain`t a writer nor a fighter you`re just a biter
I think you need to save all that because in spite
Of the reputation that you think you have
The crew already knows that you`re really a crab
So I`ll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
And back to trace my flow but don`t waste your time bro
It only takes a minute a second for me to switch
And rearrange real quick cause I can kick plenty styles
Rhymes stretch many miles
I`m the authentic yes the lyric unloader
The truth exposer, the hardcore composer

All you delirious curious suckers
You better act like you`ve been known I mack
And hold my own with a mike just to stagger
A bragger, retire a lair and very easily
I`m pass by ya cause you didn`t want to give the credit
Where it was due, yeah it was you, uh huh it was you
And your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost and plus you oughta
Find another type of life and yes another source of income
And here`s some advice you can`t rap this nice
I broke ya over and over I told ya
I would mold ya why? Because I`m bound
To give original sound and as your ears pound
Bringing pleasure and pain
As brains start to gain from musical measures
Forming mystical questions never typical inventions
Developed by my Gifted Unlimited mind
Suckers want to rhyme cause they`re eager to find
The secret behind the way that I stomp all comp
Just like a Timberland it`s the Guru and Premier
It`s them again droppin the fly tracks
And taking things over and never selling out
Cause I`m the hardcore composer",Hardcore Composer
Gang Starr,"I say people people come on and check it out now
You see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
[what's your name?] call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back?
Slander the name and with-hold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many they'll go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going no where
'Cause my strret style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
Mc's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggaz better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm bout to blow the fuck up because I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
Yeah me and the crew think its about that time
But on the DL you know that Gangstarr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My nautica, asking for a hookup
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate
Before I get irate
And I'll kick your can
From here to Japan
With force you can't withstand
'Cause I'm the muthafuckin' man

Yo right now I got my man Lil' Dap from the Group home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, muthafucka just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip
Lil' Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick
So all you punks hear this
Everytime you riff
The more fame that we get
Muthafuckas act hard
Thinking that they are God
Niggaz just don't understand
Let me be my own man
Did everything on my own
And everyplace wasn't home
Everywhere that I'd rest
I had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind
Brothers doin' mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime
As we're rippin' the lines
Brothers just don't know
How shit got to go
'Cause I was told
To never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto
Dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound
Then I walk with a frown
Another minute
Another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close that's why the Group Home is thick
So everytime you riff the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next
Because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said
Yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around
Tryin' to get down
Niggaz just don't understand
I'm the mutha fuckin' man

And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo tell them why you're the man

I'll tap your jaw
You probably heard it before
Step to the bedlamite I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore with more
Dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef
The chief ambassador
Niggaz get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot
Don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before
I tap jaws
Snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars
Vic a style you said was yours
Money grip want to flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us
When we rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lot's of friends, lot's of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, kreeno so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper no tears for fears
I'm a get mines 'cause the crew'll get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands
You know the program I'm the mutha fuckin' man",I'm the Man
Gang Starr,"[Chorus:]
Gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it`s time to get wreck
Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check

I`m one of the illest brothers known to man
But if you don`t understand, see I`m a grown man
And I stand 5`8"" and 3 quarters
Giving orders to my sqaudron 'cause I`m like the sergeant 
Or general but let me keep this minimal
I used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
Cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
And like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so I gave it some thought
Remembering the brothers who are gone now
I will make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall
Flat to the ground as I astound come around
I`ll put you down about the brothers who think they`re the boss
Think they`re getting large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain`t the way to go out
Even take their boys with `em cause they know their boys will go out
But when it comes to facing some time
They`re like crying like weeping, want to call mom Dukes
But mom Dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did
She knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids
But who`s to judge when you`re trying to survive
The one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
So when you think you`re hard and dominating the set
Just remember the illest brother claims respect!

Like I said I`m an ill kid, so never dare test me
They want to arrest me 'cause i`m causing a frenzy
Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
Real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay but Imma` tell it anyway
Yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression
An example of hard times
'cause to make it out the trap in your mind it`s a hard climb
But even if you change and come right and exact
There`s another brother scheming so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a down fall
He`d pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn`t give a damn if he killed somebody
'cause if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
There`d be no hesitation he`d just shoot
It`s like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
Except it`s reality and you don`t see it on TV
Brothers keep dying in the streets 'cause the streets are designed 
To keep you from having peace of mind
I know an old man, he`s got a rifle to stifle 
Any young punk, he hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who`s been to jail
And he told me that the system had failed him
So now he`s out the joint and he`s like flippin` on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin` their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there`s a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I`m meaning
'cause rather than being the herb, vic, or chump
You can be just like my man cold holding the pump
But living like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life, sometimes will make you uptight
I`m like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
All fakes, all snakes
And ones who try to break the rules and regulations
Stipulations made by the GangStarr
You try to flex muscle but you know you can`t hang ha
You`re making me vexed but yeah you can go next
Just remember the illest brother claims respect

[Chorus:]  repeat
Yo money don`t front you know you blew your chance
And now it`s my turn so Imma` take command
'cause I`m like the one who`s got all the juice
I always get loose I got the balls to reduce your crew
Very easily I got more ammo
I`m like the ill kid the psycho man yo
'cause now I`m past the point and I ain`t gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain`t really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I`m living day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways.
I get my attitude from living and I never forget
You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect!",The Illest Brother
Gang Starr,"Other MCs in the place know I'm much too much
And I'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
All wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
Gang Starr's in the house and we're crushing
So suckers better be up on their p's and q's and
Competition come against me and you're losing
I'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed cuz you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cashflow comin'
And never had no problems getting women
I'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist ad now the main attractionn
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That's why the people say that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Check the G-U-R-U yes the brother who's progressing
If beats are cake I'm frosting, if salad I'm dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
And kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I'm due and it's true cuz you know
A rapper this nice oughtta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
Cuz I'm like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn't matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape cuz I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

I walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I've rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
Cuz the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I'm swift like the breeze
I'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That's the type of crap you know I'm not buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
That's why I've come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I'm controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That's why everybody knows that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Gang Starr,"As I deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
I`m dead up serious so don`t be getting too curious
Motherfuckers always want to know what makes me tick
I`ll pull a phrase out quick 'cause I`m dipped and I`m slick
You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinking forty`s
It shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
Well say what you want 'cause all of mine is in tact
In fact I`ll have you open like a hookers gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more
MC`s are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
Save the talk 'cause you know I walk that walk
Hitting city to city but I make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru I`ll diss you if you`re pressing the issue
Not my style to be sweatin` all the stupid ass rumors
I take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you`re scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
Don`t even think about it 'cause ain`t no shame in my game

No shame in my game
Stick to the subject I ain`t afraid to be real
A lot of MC`s fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don`t like the prankster crap
So I get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
There ain`t no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don`t use it than you may catch grief
Toolies and techs ain`t toys but kids got `em today
And if they`re ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
I try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I`ll climb
But what the hell`s success if the mess ain`t changing
50`s still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin`
Stick up kids still stickin` nasty hookers still trickin`
All the pimps still pimpin` and all the crackheads trippin`
While the dealers still sellin` so I`ll refrain from the yellin`
And the preachin` 'cause who the fuck would I reach man
Niggaz don`t want to stop that, they want to live fat
Who`d want to clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
They live for the minute and they`re all wrapped up in it
It`s an unfortunate state for many it`s too late
Now death stalks the streets and it`s right at your gate
So bug, lose your mind but I ain`t goin` insane
I`ll kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain`t no shame in my game

No shame in my game
Life`s a bitch so who are we to judge each other
I know I got faults I ain`t the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn`t too cool you know
Like how you smoke wools and that your girl`s a ho
But I don`t listen to shit unless the story`s legit
Knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be riding the dilsnick
But I`ll be taking care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhyming you know I`m hitting hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you`ll feel pain
You little sucker, there ain`t no shame in my game",No Shame in My Game

New York, New york is where we live and we`re thorough
Never taking shorts 'cause Brooklyn`s the borough
Peace to Uptown, to queens and the Bronx
Long Island and Jersey get as fly as they want
Where we rest is no joke
So let me break it down to sections for you slowpokes
Fort Green, Bedsty, Flatbush, Brownsville
Crown Heights and East New York will be down till
Medina takes respect for the style`s we bring
'cause in Brooklyn, we be into our own thing
Alantic terminals, Redhook Bushwick
Come to Brooklyn frontin, and you`ll get mushed quick
We ain`t just know for flipping and turning out parties
But also for the take no bullshit hotties
On the subject of blackness, well let me share this
Brooklyn is the home for cultural awareness
So in all fairness, you can never compare this
Some good, some bad. little hope for the weak
Dangerous streets and Coney Island Beach
All this included when you go for a tour
Some can get scandolous and outright raw
When you step, step correct and watch where you move
We pay dues so we ain`t trying to lose
Here in Brooklyn
The home of the black and the beautiful
For a ruffrap sound, ain`t a place more suitable
Other cities claim this, and others claim that
But let me give some props to the place where we be at
be	-are-double O- K-l-why-N
I came in for a visit and ever since then
I`ve been incorporated with select personnel
Right here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell

Peace to Boston, Philly, Connecticut, DC
All the east coast cities are fly to me
Peace to everybody down south and out west

Although you may run in to some wild ass kids
Take the j train, the d or the a if you dare
And the 2,3,4,5 also comes here
There`s so much to see 'cause Brooklyn`s historic
Fools act jealous but you have to ignore it
So I just lounge wit the fat clientel
Out here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell

Way down in Brooklyn
You know the place...",The Place Where We Dwell
Gang Starr,"5 carloads deep, time to go do a show
Got a massive crew and we`re ready to roll
So I grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
Premier he`s got the fly dope system inside
But my shit cranks too and we`ve got mad tapes
Of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
Off into the New York night we go
Dre large got the camera biggest, Gord`s got three rolls of film
So we can take the macked out photos
Tommy Hill, The Damaja and my man Gunsmoke
Corey and Smurf and Lil Dap`s got a forty
My man Gary and Shiz and the nutcracker Shorty
Mike Rhone, chillin` like Capone
Robinhood, Known as Mel with the clientelle
Mo, JT, Mega, can`t forget black
They`re rockin` sincere, yes the posse`s fat
Out loud pulls up plus there`s Sid and OC
Big Mel from strong island H.L. the one and only
O. Delicious, Ely, Bazz and Eon
And the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
And to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strong
And you know who`s who, so let me not prolong
For this was a night to remember
I had on the beige Tims with the two tone leather
So we get to the jam, the gig, the venue
Then we circled around and then drove in through
The front the place was packed the line was long
I was bobbing my head 'cause the music was on
I turned it down then I peeped to my right
I saw this kid and his girl having a fight
Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
And then the kid pulled out and bust and laid him to waist
A riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
Started buck wiling tryna` snatch kids jewels
After that 50 came and turned the party out
And then the ambulance came to take the body out
And we didn`t even get all the equipment out
And we didn`t even get to turn the place out
This can happen often and it`s really fucked up
So I`ll ask you to your face homeboy what`s up
Did you come to see my show or the stupid nigga playoffs
Killing you and killing me it`s the soliloquy of chaos

And if you live in the cities where streets reek warfare
People getting nowhere bot you go for yours there
You`ll find it doesn`t pay to front or play the role
You could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
Then you`ll want to retaliate, regroup and come back
So you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
Whether you die or kill them, it`s another brother dead
But I know you`ll never get that through your head
'Cause we`re mislead and misfed facts, we`re way off
Killing you and killing me, it`s the soliloquy of chaos",Soliloquy of Chaos
Gang Starr,"Get with this get with this 
Get with this 'cause you got no choice
Rappers sometimes you`ll find make dough 
But yo you know they`ve got no voice
Get him off the podium he ain`t no speaker
Yes he`s just a phony and look at his sneakers
Played out of style out of rhymes
He`s out his mind
Lost his way lost his pay
I`m takin` his props so call the cops
You can call `em but I know `em
Sweet MCs I think I`ll ho `em
'Cause they front so very hard and big or small
I`ll break `em all
Ain`t gotta say that I`m the best
My skills will show I passed the test
When it comes to beats and rhymes
We come correctly everytime
And stay tuned

[Chorus]
Stay tuned...

With information like the CNN
I can take you there and then
The rest is up to you to choose
The bottom line is win or lose
Suckers suckers suckers don`t be listening
So I can`t be waitin` on `em
I ain`t got no time to play, do you?
Look at the state of things and tell me true
In the city any city life`s a paradox of good and evil
Many fall into the vicious cycle
Living by the gun or by the rifle
Think they got a reason that ain`t really sure
The death toll rises more
It`s trife the way some live life
I love rap, I like the city
But for a fool I have no pity
There`stoo much suffering too much struggle
Too much injustice and don`t it bug you
Enough for you to press on harder
Against the odds the wayn our forefathers
Made away but foolishly we go astray
Think about it and stay tuned

[Chorus]

What you really oughta do is lay back smooth
As my vocals compliment the slow fat groove
Just for you to blast around the way
Play it nice and loud and hear me say
Gang Starr is hitting `92 and on
Showing how to make a dope rap song
Doing this while some disperse
Then dissolve like specs of dirt
Our music pertains to those who remain
Down with the real not wealth or the fame
Peace out, we`ll be back, stay tuned...

[Outro]
Please stay tuned",Stay Tuned
Gang Starr,"I never thought that you would crab me
Undermine me, and backstab me
But I can see clearly now the rain is gone
The pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
There was a few times I needed your support
But you tried to play me like an indoor sport
Like racquetball, tennis, fool, whatever
All I know is you attempted to be clever
Nevertheless, cleverness can`t impress
Cause now you`ve been expose like a person undressed
Cause I see through you, I`m the Guru
Now what you gonna do when I step to you
And when I pay you back I`ll be hurting you
This ain`t no threat so take it personal

Rap is an art you can`t own no loops
It`s how you hook em up and the rhyme style troop
So don`t even think you could say someone bit
Off your weak beat come on you need to quit
I flip lines and kick rhymes that never sound like yours
There oughtta be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows from in me
And the truth is, that you wish you could live the
Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can`t think as quick
So Premier drops a beat, for me to say verses to
And if I sound doper then take it personal

Don`t be mad cause I don`t come around the way
Like I used to, I don`t have time these days
I`m keeping busy making power moves
Don`t try to say I don`t remember you
You shouldn`t let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by, cause of the way you act
Telling my business to kids I don`t even know
You`re like a daytime talk show, and that`s low
So you can tell everyone, that I`m jerking you
And if you don`t like it kid, take it personal",Take It Personal
Gang Starr,"Take two and pass
Take two and pass
Take two and pass
So the blunt will last

Take two and pass so we can all get blunted
Don't smoke ciggarettes so my growth ain't stunted
We got at least five head so I rolled a white owl
It's the break of dawn and we're awake like night owls
Phillies are cool but they burn much quicker...
Hey yo come on pass that shit nigga
We lounge to the sounds as we leave from uptown
It's time to go downtown and make some more rounds
This city never sleeps that what sinatra sang
For that fat fat blunt you know I got this thing
So hand it over cause I want to get charred
I'm in love with mary jane she keeps me large
So don't hog it let's get it moving real fast
Everybody just chill and take like two pulls and pass

Take two and pass
Take two and pass
Take two and pass
So the blunt will last

The club is crowded everyone's up in here
Heyo premier what's that you got there?
It looks like a nice plump blunt in your hand
I just know you're gonna share it with me cause I'm your man
So bust it, I got one too and if you spark up yours
I'll light up mine when it's through
Oh shit, there goes my man the fat mack
We used to get blazed I know he's got a fat sack
Let's go upstairs grab a chair and unwind
So the la la can enhance our minds
The system booming let the bass increase
I find me a seat so I can peep the chic
Ladies and maybe get my homeboys some ass
All you gotta do is take two pulls and pass

Take two and pass
Take two and pass
Take two and pass
So the blunt will last

Even in the morning like the flavor of juice
A blunt adds spice and a blunt can spruce
Up your day but I'm not advertising just telling
Of aspect a part of our lives
And around the way there ain't no shame in our game
Cause the fame is no thing we get together and hang
And since you know I got dash and class
Then I'm after you so take two pulls and pass",Take Two and Pass

Comin straight out of Brooklyn, baldhead from the old school
Born to rule with more class than Billy Dee
To a pussy emcee, you know a wuss emcee
I'm like his worst nightmare when I'm on my killin spree

Who'll be, herb of the day?

It takes at least, two to tango, so you can get strangled

Cause in the life they're living, you can't half step
It starts with the young ones doing crime for fun
And if you ain't down, you'll get played out son
So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent, pull a screwdriver, and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo

They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's open
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace

They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time I say ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target, for destruction?
What about the system, and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S and clocking dollars, troop
Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know
When you're dealing with the code of the streets

Nine times out of ten I win, with the skills I be weilding
Got the tec one dealing, let me express my feelings
Guru has never been one to play a big shot
It's just the styles I got that keep my mic hot
Anf fuck turning my back to the street scene
It gives me energy, so Imma keep fiends
Coming, just to get what I'm selling
Maybe criminal or felon dropping gems on your melon

You're soon to break, you're strawberry like shortcake
I'm in that ass with my Timbs all day
You couldn't tarnish my rep, so you crept away
Just behave and be a good son -- or else
I'm bringin the noise cause most emcees are puns
I used to chill in Roxbury now I'm comin outta Brooklyn
Herb niggas are assed out, y'all get tooken
Or taken, and that's word to all rude bwoy Jamaican

And ain't no stopping like McFadden and Whitehead

Pursue the knowledge that's available
Before your chump-style game and your punk friends fail you

Look at your puny ass world and what's in it
Nothin, that's how long you've been frontin
I figured by now that you've come up with somethin
But you're still the same snake with my name on your mouth
Wanna know what I'm doin, wanna know why I shine?
Cause I'm the rebirth, so now you gotta see me first
I kick more facts than paperbacks for research
And knees hurt, next you feel em bucklin
The huge pussy look on your face reveals the sucker
Inside of ya, because I checked the way you're ridin the
Jimsome, better sing more than a hymn son
Never sustain the true pain of my wisdom
Never be able to touch GangStarr

Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, neva have ta run

I left my Phillie at home
Do you have another?
I wanna get blunted my brother
Now may I make a mark
Then make a spark over this phat track
Or should I say dope beat
Subtract, delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's comin from way way back
Hey yo Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You hear we quit?
No way, bullshit
I told ya before we come back wit more hits
I provide bright flava, so you could sketch me
Do me a favor, dont try and catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same he knows my name
Smooth, I drop jewels like, paraphenalia
I'm infallable, not into failure
Like a rhinocerus, my speed is prosperous
And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write here tonite to bring truth to the light
My dialogue is my own cause Smooth B will neva bite",DWYCK

Gang Starr,"No way you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I break kids
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
Their noses, I hate those motherfuckin posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills nag you can't compare me
And no we don't make wack tracks
and all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin real facts
I represent set up shit like a tent boy
You're paranoid cause you're my son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

Oh yes I'm greater than all MC's when I breeeze give me room please
I be like fascinatin when I be updatin
Cuttin off wack kids, pullin their trump cards
I thump hard, and mak eem say that I'm God
Niggaz be pretendin they hardcore
Never know the meaning of [real hardcore]
But I get props like a slogan and no man
Could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connecting complete mic wrecking
No double checking vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to I go all out with no mic
Yeah that's right cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
Cause suckers be like playin themselves to have mass appeal

I know I'm dope but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks but now I'm makin greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop
of pure bomb, just like the seashore I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond I go on and on
For you it's tragic I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I betcha
Those who kick dirt and do time I'm gonna get cha
Cause I be kickin the real

Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggaz like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits
You better change your behavior, battling Gangstarr

So when you think you know the whole you don't even know the half
You're not a threat to myself, and neither to my staff
Not the type to really dance too much, although I used to
Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to
The blunted ill types of beats Premier makes
Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight

But if you took that shit out
and you took all the music out
What would remain?  The voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control
when in pimp mode
My bank roll expands
I invest in my man
I plan, to keep rap real
so if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
what about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to em
So you and, the niggaz right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More Vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know Gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice
Cause I got crazy styles, still

You'll never have the skills like mine
I write the ill type rhymes
Now I'm reaching my prime
360 dunk in your face
You can't compete, you're just a basket case
Let's separate the men from the boys
And put your money where your mouth is
No time for toys
Your game is weak, get it, so don't sleep
'cause I'll be checking and wrecking ya
When I start to creep
Through the backdoor
I know I caught you out there
You got no clout here
And I doubt there
Is anyway that you can stop the beat down
You better play the background
And sit back down
Chumps like you, I gotta keep'em in line
So prepare to suffer boy, 'cause now you're mine

I'll fake you left and go right
Straight down the lane
Here's one in your eye
You feel pain, you strain
To put together some strategy
But you're raggedy, and I'll be glad to see
The frown on your grill when i drill and thrill
Set out my offense, commence to kill
I'll be leading from beginning to end
And after I guard ya
You're gonna want to make friends
And make amends for the silly trash you were talking
Take a walk and your shots I'm swatting
With ease, and the ladies are swooning
Clocking my swiftness, why you drooling?
You ought ta practice up and get your game with mine
I been waiting to guard you, and now you're mine

Hurry up, sucker
Go ahead and pick your squad
Try to play hard, but I'ma rob
You of your crazy notions to defeat me
Your weak see
I rock all courts
And even get down to give you a rematch
After I wax and tax that butt
When I slam the alley oop
You can rally troops
But I play the awesome defense
I'll pick your pocket
And send you to the bench
With tears in your eyes as you realize
The prize is for me
Yes all the money
Son, my flow is too nice
My handle's precise
I'll fake you right and go left
Because my game's so def, and now you're mine",Now You're Mine
Gang Starr,"Boom bash dash, I had to break, I had to getaway
Packed my bags, to leave for good, it was a Monday
Kissed my mother, gave my pops a pound
Then he hugged me, and then he turned around
I threw the duffelbag over my shoulder
It was time to get props kid, cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself jack
So I'ma go for mine, and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move Troop
But I ain't even tryin to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent
So fuck the bullshit I'm audi
I'm on a mission, cause if I stay I'll go crazy
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
They never fake it just slam it
Out in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet

Crash boom bang I used to hang at Four Corners
And all the spots in Beantown where niggaz carry burners
But I was more turned on by the micraphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin blunts on ?
Or workin in a mail room Uptown, feelin sick and
tired, of payin all these fucked up dues
I wasn't tryin to lose -- I refused
Had a chick Uptown, one in Queens and one in Jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by, is a girlie
But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East New York is no joke kid
And peace to my man Hass doin his bad
I went to Flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
and like the sayin goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But fuckit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin
See I'ma make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I'll never fake it just slam it
There in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet

And you can, walk the walk talk the talk but don't flaunt
Cause little shorty's scheamin on your rings and fronts
but don't sweat it, cause that's the life out here
A lot of niggaz, be livin real trife out here
I got my own place in Bed-Stuy
Known to many others, as Do or Die
Malcolm X Boulevard and Gates Avenue
Smokin up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggaz Troy and Squeaky
Used to twist Dutch Masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to Fort Greene
on Myrtle Ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to Fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go Uptown
and check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to Red and Marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40's with Tommy, Hill and Gunsmoke
And Lil' Dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a L cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night
But I'ma be aight still
Cause I'ma keep writin shit and perfectin my skills
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Here in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I never fake it just slam it

Gang Starr,"Last year record companies were chumpin me
But now like chicks they all be up on me
and me so horny, I hit em like a groupie
Snatch off my hat wash my dick and keep it movin
Showing and proving on a day to day basis
I rip New York and a million different places
State to state country to country
My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game word to mother
Peace New York hops it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since eighty-five
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
achieved mad props though niggaz roll around in jeeps
I ride the A-Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks glocks
And I mean it it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking bout my clout
So Lil Dap snatch the mic and show the motherfucker out

Yo you can't hide from jail and you can't hide from the street
Flavors do get deep when you're walking the east
A unit down from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slappin pounds and pounds with real niggaz aight
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain storms or whatever
You poured a forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it til the shit hits the fan
Last year I was The Man ripping up every jam
So what's your hobby nothing serious when things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
A Lil Dap what's that?  Fuck around you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'aow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggaz tend to live trife, so I react with the mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Aiyyo 'ru, what's your function meet me at Broadway junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet i just kick it
Aiyyo son, if you're ready Guru starts to flip it

Earl, with my three-eight-five shot I bust a bumba claat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the ghetto I let go, shit to make you petrol
Watching fly niggaz show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
and all the honies be loving me
My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa fuck your girl and I'll drop her
cause she be working on my nerves
and yo I got more gang than the bitch got curves
I'm like gambino, the slick head honcho
Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
and I know, I break your back with my rap like smack
because I'm all that
And so the next time when you're wishing for my downfall
I'm a come back to drown y'all

And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write in the night to bring truth to the light

Gang Starr,"""It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is LOOSE..
somewhere in outer space.""

""The mysteries of creation are there.""

""Up in the sky?""
""Up in the sky.""

""The moon and the planets are there.
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.
And therefore as we set sail; we ask God's blessing --
on the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure
of which man has ever embarked.""

""Prepared for liftoff.""

I self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
and watch another C-Cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combine, over the frontline
The ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down

Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred -- triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome; I span the universe
and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down
Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original

Son you're supposed to be my man, but you ain't wise enough to realize
this is B.I., see I wanna taste the whole cake
Some things in this industry, shit be so fake
Make no mistake, if you're my man you'd understand
about the plan, to stack hundreds of grands (That's right!)
And how to stand, on much more acres of land
And to expand from the days of goin hand to hand
So like I was CEO I do my thing son
and turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom
Release a fistful, of rhymes for the fiscal year
MC's are wishful fuckin with this here
They stuck with the tear, for fear they foresake a brother's love
it's clear -- I'd have to be the better man I'm thinkin
The 7th Letter Man ain't got no time for petty speakin (uhh)
So we go our seperate ways I see the fork in the road
I know I blessed you with a portion of gold
and some good fortune to hold, so KEEP THAT
while I keep it movin, just like truckloads
of interstate cargo, taxin niggaz like U.S. embargoes
You my man like I said so all the best
You shoulda known we do shit differently than all of the rest
Can't afford to let a link be, loose in the chain
It's time for us to get mad more, juice in the game
You're buggin son (that's right) that's word to Billy and Fame
So I'ma stay the game, that we play to win (Yeah!)
So I don't care what you say to her or say to him
The object son, is to excel and lead
And niggaz be bluffin fallin for nothin but greed

So don't fool yourself, clown ass nigga!
I always been the type of cat that'll put it on ya
since back in the days when Laze snatched me off the corner
And every since then, the whole game changed
Everybody's against, Lil' ass Fame
They wanna see me stretched out with my back smokin
Left for dead in the street with my back opened
So I don't keep friends I just roll with
niggaz I was RAISED WITH, went out in a BLAZE WITH
In the penile, to B.ville, down to Grayson
And we thick together, in these last days kid
So I don't have what you call friends
cause when it's on then they gone in the end!
But I'ma handle my business indeed

See my business is my friendship and my friendship is my business
Can I get a witness?!  (Preach on nigga!)
Hey yo we went through all out wars, half-assed tours
Travelled 'cross this land with heavy contraband

Check the horror scene
The kid was like twelve or thirteen
Never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
Watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
Nothin"" but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
They spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister Jean
Of course over some drug shit
Hi spops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
Didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him doe
and taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle,fam and all that
He could tell it was him 'cause he wore the same slacks, he wore when
he took him to Meadowlands racetrack
Why did he flip and go out like that?
It's called betrayal

Punk ass niggas
It's called betrayal

He on a mission to become a ball player
Flip big Benz's, flossin all gators
Had it all mapped out,6-8,12th grader
Fresh outta school, he fin' to go lay paper
He had abrother who was hustlin collectin his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under naighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumpin
So now he's sittin on the sidewalk bleedin
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin in the world ain't goin to bring him back
his brother, sittin at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin the price
while he's starin at the shell
his brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail
and you, wouldn't pay the boys mail, and sacrificed the fuckin family

Upset the set up, the element of surprise
IT'Z A SET UP
It's time to upset the set up

Though they conspire, fake us to make us retire
With the burning desire we make it out of the crossfire
Thoughts are higher, elevating and focused
while the path is narrow, for those like us
Primo beats provoke us to meditate like Zen
With the will and the strength, of a million men
While they introspect, where nothing is met
It's been that way for a while so much has come and then went
But I'm confident, a few, are due to redeem
their respective kingdoms, with an abundance of cream
So if I were to scheme, it would be on a realer dream
Like formin effective teams to filter the smokescreens
You totin in jeans, don't even know the true envy
The man I'm pickin apart, and plus they both were friends to me
Past trivial pursuits like East and West coast feuds
Come against me on the mic, many and most will lose
Like most dudes, I love this hip-hop, and this rap stuff
But I don't like the shows, where the ignorant act up
While some'll be rippin it, they be in the crowd wildin
Flippin on kids, for the chains and medallions
Or the kid they don't like, from a beef from way back
And decide that's the night, perfect time for payback
It's wack for the group, plus the others who came

Follow through lay down the law, cause it's probable and overdue
All systems overdue, my guns know me
I only hold a few my nigga for only a few hold me
Never forget the ones before me, my momma told me
sacrifice for the ones behind me leadin the seeds
Blind leads, black on black, crime to me
Inclined to refine my creed I eat thinkin lead
Conceive to make the beast bleed, enhance thoughts
like tossed trees 'cross the Earth three-fourths
Let my offspring feed all three, corpus delectis cost me
Lost and found on enemy ground, quoted although
they don't know how we get down at sound speed we breed
Mo more confined to blind greed and self destructive deeds

Somethin' about a gun

Please approach the bench."" 

Yo they got me handcuffed  I'm down in central booking 
Things are fucked up  the way my future's looking 
But I'm too fly, I'ma change this scenario 
Make some power moves and tighten up my bankroll 
Chumps are leary though, they see me as a threat 
I'm like the black Dutch Schultz when you get me upset 
Five-oh makes me want to flip, Larry Davis style 
Got a nigga depressed, while he's awaitin' trial 
It's OK though, cause from grey skies comes blue 
Through darkness comes light and I be known as the Guru 
And this I certify we all should be alerted by 
the traps within the system, our youth is gettin' murdered by 
the D.A. says they got me on a felony 
I'm tryin' to live my life, so what the fuck is you tellin' me? 
The streets are war, that's what brothers carry weapons for 
And I take the weight as I did before 
The next thing you know, they got me on the radio 
A rapper arrested, suckers showin' me on video 
Of course I know, that I'm a role model 
But yo this rap life is real life sometimes it's full throttle 
Right now I gotta think about me fuck the industry 
You gets no love, except those who support me 
What's the story, what happened when I went to L.A.? 
Mixin' shit up, no not there I got family 
Nothin' happened, mind your business yo step 
You know we connect, JFK 2 LAX 

They want to lock us all up, and throw away the key 
Don't want to see us come up, don't want to see us makin' G's 
Long as we know this is the key to our destruction 
Let's make moves no discussion 

Peace to my man Hass, and Orange Man payin the cost 
All the twenty-five to lifers all my brothers gettin' tossed 
into the system, supposed to rehabilitate 
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate 
Read, study lessons and build your inner power 
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards 
For example, I know this rich Nigerian 
Powerful American that's proud to be an African 
He asked me why do all us brothers be gettin' trapped 
I told him I'd explain it broke it down in a rap 
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair 
Without esteem for yourself nigga, you goin' nowhere 
And you can swagger like you rule this; Josey Wales 
unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails 
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers 
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more 
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best 
Our rhyme as live as it gets, JFK 2 LAX 
They're always makin' trouble yo, against the righteous 
Killin' us in cold blood, those beats those vipers 
And as I sit feelin' the pain in my wrist 
I vow to myself that I'ma change this shit 
Or at least I gotta try, or part of me will die 
And only by action will any ideas solidify 
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder 
This grown man will make mistakes no longer 
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim 
to their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em 
And so I rip facts to dope tracks I caress

When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven, twenty-one, eighteen, twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone

Steppin' up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial, like saccarhin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lackin' in
Concepts you bite, 'cause your identity ain't tight
Tryin' to be somethin' you're not, like pullin' a knife at a gunfight
I'm troopin' on night air, like flight number 1-0-6,
And gettin' all up in your fuckin' mix
You get me upset, and I got you uptight
'Cause my committee's in your city tonight, a'ight?
We got seventeen million of us, plus two million Indians
That makes nineteen mil, lightin' shit up, like Wild Bill
I be the supreme father, plus the ill kid, with drama
My karma, creates the teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit, before you walk to me, or talk to me
Steppin' to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearin' tracks out the frame
You know my fuckin' name, I rule all game
I'm universal, on all planes, what's your claim?

Yo, I be your highness, in slickness, you chumps bear witness
Tremendous tropper, verbal nigga, with the fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer, then I blast ya
Slice precise, like Benihanas, when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the God
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep, in my backyard,
I laugh hard, while your mental, I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror, to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks want to enter this rap scene
Kickin' Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion; the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief, plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fuckin' barber
So what, you made some dough, you best keep on scramblin'
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handlin'
Demandin' that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday

I see myself as the black Rap Messiah
Colossal, spreadin' my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom, Dick, and Jerry, slippin' like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Somethin' ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love but few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal, like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut, I got to stay Noyd-ed
'Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black, talkin' 'bout how much his Mac spit
But this year, Gang Starr got changes bein' made
No wack shit bein' played, no fake macks gettin' paid
No Versace MC's, with a mouth full of Mo'
Soundin' like a ho, spittin' that old-fashioned show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap, through a Maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Goin' deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with interpretive robe and sandals, like Moses
Travellin' high sands and Eastern lands, for the answers
Ignorance is spreadin' through the streets, like it was cancer
Too many drinkin' not thinkin', when behind that trigger
A thirty-eight escalate the murder rate, for us niggaz

And purchase some kicks by Kenneth Cole

The definition of jiggy so you best to recognize
At the mall, I'm bagging up, much more than gear
Victoria, be whispering mad Secrets in my ear
She wanted me to knock her in the back of Foot Locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer
Others try to copy, I see em when they mock me
Baseball cap bent, the fresh scent is ?seemiyaka?
All the way from Green Acre's to the Beverly Center
Heads turn, and I'm the main concern when I enter
At Albee Square, niggas wouldn't even dare
With that fake thuggish ruggish when them Brooklyn kids be in there

And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools
It's the Militia
",The Militia
Gang Starr,"No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth baby

They say it's lonely at the top, in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

The same sheisty cats that you hang with, and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up, nigga peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although mc's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize, what I have done up to this point
So I'mma get more guys, to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate, or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shining, some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish jealous punks, will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
Cause they love it, to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is coming to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth

Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

Sometimes you gotta dig deep, when problems come near
Don't fear things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen, to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin, is mad amazin
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin in my bedroom pacin
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin
Suicide? nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinking, or even gettin high
Cause all that's gonna do really, is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit, before
So I oughta be able, to withstand some more
But I'm sweating though, my eyes are turning red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife, and take the bullets out my nine
My only crime, was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect, that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, remembering the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth

""You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!""

Yo I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one, is pointed at your weak ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger, on these fully loaded lines
You're gonna wish I woulda pulled a black nine, I mack dimes
Crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin triflin niggas, and the studio pranksters
Yo lookin at the situation plainly: will you remain g?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator, with the greater data
Revolvin on the tascam much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle, tricky metaphors
I explore more, to expose the core
A lot of emcees, act stupid to me
And we have yet to see, if they can match our longevity
But anyway it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Styles, smooth but rugged -- you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin your hideout, blockin out your sunlight
Your image and your business, were truly not done right
Throw up your he-allah-i now, divine saviors
You got no hand skills there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop, to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
Cause you must meet your moment of truth

They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth",Moment of Truth
Gang Starr,"Yo, yo, gu-rizzi, yo
Yo, whassup, son?
Yo, man, you know what I mean? I need this money, man
Get up, out in these, in these streets, man
Yo, so what's the deal, god?
I'm sayin', what you need though?
Yo, let me have like, two or three, three g's, man
I'm sayin', I'm sayin' son, man
You know what happened last time, though?
I gotta do what I gotta do, man.  I gotta eat, man
Whassup man? Oh, your baby momma stressin' you?
Way past the days of the deuce, me and you stays a crew
Only a few percent knew what me and you went through
We've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates
And set this crooked rap shit straight, from Crenshaw to Castlegate
Like Pete and C.L., I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York, and all the ways
For certain niggaz to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
'Cause some nights I got so wild, yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't tryin' to hear it, 'cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga, Havoc, said, sometimes you gott
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
'Cause no matter the weather, niggaz be needin' cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond, to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man, Baby Pop, you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you
You remember what happened last time, when you got knocked
Doin' your thing, sewin' shit up on the block?
You need to stop, 'fore you get caught, again
Or you get shot, and I lose another friend
""Any man with the plan, is precise with his life
Think twice""
My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lightin' a fuse, whether it's sneakers or shoes
'Cause somebody always want to step up, to start a feud
It's like settin' it off, but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women, forget floozies and the groupies
'Cause they spell mad problems, from Watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop, 'long as the world's revolvin'
And I recall when niggaz knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry-ass was gettin' kicked out
And they was seein' if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple, and double, with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear 'em in my heart, like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be bigtime sellin' dope, coke, or dust
It's killin us; let's take our people, and make a exodus
Annhilation, inhilation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams, and drug schemes of mad cream

""From New York straight talk, America's best""

Yo, it doesn't make sense, for you to compete against
This New York vibe that gets your whole body tense
Calm down, listen to a brother who knows
Cause the rappers out here come up with mad different types of flows
Switch-up, change-up, yo pull the range up
So we can build on this shit, for real that's how we came up
Used to ride the subway trains back and forth
Now I push an E-Class, four-two-zero of course
Still material gains, make one more aware
Of all the madness and the civil unrest that's out here
I doubt there, is anyplace more complex
You can get lost in the sauce, New York'll have you vexed
Who's next to get served, herbs'll get knocked off
Burning flammable rappers, is how I get my rocks off
I pop your top off as if you were the bottle
Then I'll drain all your fluid, you're better off playing lotto
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday

""From New York straight talk, America's best""
""Yo I'm not new to this I'm true to this"" ""Word up!""
""From New York straight talk, America's best""

True if you can make it out here, you can make it anywhere
That means a lot of rappers, they should stay away from here
Cause we still care, about the total artform
Niggaz could sell more records but they still can't flip a live forum
Plus everybody out here ain't talkin true shit either
Mad niggaz is fakin jacks, I don't like them neither
But the competition keeps me on point
That's why I lamp in the studio composin fresh new joints
From the streets, Medina, Manhattan, Staten, P-Lawn
The struggle continues, everybody wants to be on
The rat race, makes this lifestyle fast paced
I've loved it since the days of fat shoelace
Screwface me all you want, but I'm used to it
I'll never give up rep in New York, I'm true to it
From forty-deuce to Queens, back to East New Yi
We takin no shorts, and plus we showin no pity
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York, we get the money all day everyday

You get bent up, sent up creek, without a paddle
You want to battle? Well I live in New York
So think twice blink twice now your Roley and Lincoln's gone
Don't come into this rap game if you don't belong
You won't be on but for a minute anyway
You're just a scavenger, you don't live this life everyday
Rap is regional, so you can check the demographics
Everybody represent where they live, cause shit is drastic
Confusion, while I'm givin rappers contusions
And people don't realize that real hip-hop is losing
They want to shut us down, and I say, ""Shut up clown!""
Cause New York is too corrupt and too tough to lay down
And just quit, cause MC's out here kick serious lyrics
And I come to you, with my infinite spirit
Not takin nothin from your hood or your set
But GangStarr could be a threat, in New York we rep
That's where it comes from, that's why you're feelin it
So why suppress it, I'd rather be revealin it
Bright lights, big city and dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday

Gang Starr,"Word is bond, these cats been on the mic fantasizing a LOT
So called MC's, wannabe rappers and all that, whatever
You get your knot rocked kid, yo

You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time
You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time

So just perhaps, you wanna challenge my style of rap
Talkin bout you bust caps, we know that's just a pile of crap
The underground is where I dwell at
It's where I find my heaven, and where you find your hell at
You're in my clutches now, you get slit up and lit up
just like some Dutches now, see I'm hard to define
My mind travels far, from ghettoes to galaxies
representin GangStarr -- The street life
The reason why my mic ignites, I bring more ruckus
than a nightclub fight, or bar brawl
I'm swingin lyrics like broken glass palm to skull y'all
Hold your head, cause all that weak shit is dead
See the times are changin, and me and my peeps is gettin crazy fed
So remember when you writing your rhymes
Stop fantasizing, and bring some real shit next time
Yeah, bring some real shit, yo

I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time

Until you recognize, what my rapture can do
You thought I wouldn't step up, to keep my rep up
I ain't them other kids, I don't need to play no catchup
I got too much pride for this, I know some niggaz
that'll ride for this, with me it's do or die for this

My survival package, as I deal with reality
I'm like Fishburne in Hoodlum when I come to do em
Chew em up, spit em out, the most respected no doubt
You seen me in action so act you been knowin
The G-U-R-U, of the Gang, I've been flowing
just like the river Niger all the way to the Hudson
Had so many lyrics stashed, and I couldn't wait to bust some
Lately, I've watched this game evolve and elevate
So now I push my music like drug dealers push weight
Straight like that, straight out the gate
Cause it's never too late, to set this fuckin record straight
But it is too late, for you and your crew son
You had the audacity to come against me, the gifted one?
And Primo with the tracks, to inspire my next line
You've got no wins here, so better luck next time

Yeah yeah
Better luck next time

You never talk too much to get your spot blown
Now you`re no longer just a face in the crowd
You`re gettin so much respect that niggaz might as well bow
And movin up with your hustle like you planned it
Rakin dough like the world`s greatest bandit
Always got one eye open, for the stick-up kids postin
So much cream chumps they can`t understand it
Ladies flock to your jock like it`s golden
Curious, to test the weight you be holdin
but you ain`t got no time, to be chasin felines
If she`s the chick that you pick then she gets chosen
People treat you like you`re ghetto royalty
And all your staff shows you utmost loyalty
You paid your dues, refuse to lose in this scenario
The rep grows bigga, you`re a legend and a hero

Your fame has gotten larger than your life
You`ve got a harem of bitches and killer niggaz that`s hype
They got your back, but you so fly you don`t need em
You shit what you`re eatin so you don`t peep the proceedings
They start schemeing, feeling that you`re too swollen
and that`s the reason why your cash and stash gets stolen
You start perspiring, because you`re paranoid
Still another confrontation that you couldn`t avoid
Prepare for drama, as if you were a stunt man
Back in the days you was a forty and a blunt man
Today you`re a Willie, now the weather`s too chilly
New York City ain`t the place to be frontin
Over your shoulders day and night`s where you look
Your so-called fam ran a scam, and you got shook
Go back to square one, better go talk to your son
See reps grow bigga in the life of a crook

Years ago, we were new jacks to this scene
Showed some effort, made fat records, but still saw no green
Know what I mean? They tried to stifle us
Nigga you could not believe how really ill and trife it was
Fed up so we headed on a serious mission
Wishin, that we could better our position
Two businessmen, Guru and Prim`, we enterprised
Too strong to be stepped on, creatively wise
The dedicated ministers of underground sound
When we`re doin our thing, you know we don`t fuck around
No matter how bizarre and different you think you are
your team wouldn`t dream of competeing with GangStarr
Premier in the rear with the beats and cuts
And Guru with the mic ready to tear shit up

And to the sweethearts out there breaking hearts
While we're takin part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me

She knows what she wants
Yeah, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants

She knows what she wants, she's bold so she flaunts
Her hourglass jewels to mad clientele
Rejected oh well, she ain't goin to no hotel
Not the frantic freak type, but if you speak right
You get to take her out and dig her out on a weeknight
Weekends, she wants to spend your ends
Her shopping spree is colossal, attitude semi-hostile

Her looks are a lullaby, to pass us by, she's too fly
Never gunshy, hair is blown dry
She craves a wiseguy to help her gain amplify

Cause prior to this, he put rocks on her neck and wrist
Plus a fat joint on her finger

Two: She said she didn't like my crew
Three: She never ever cooked for me
Four: She was my cheri amore -- YEAH RIGHT
It was all hype, I needed more insight
In retrospect, I know I slept from the first night
She did a split and that was it
Gave up my pimp license, and flipped my whole friggin script
But now I'm back like the Isley's moving wisely
Sizing up the situation, keeping honies waiting

I take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
I'm type crashin', down like a meteorite
I'm Bogart-ing, mics and whole stages
Destroying MC's dreams, from words to whole pages
Their rapbooks, look more like scrapbooks
With their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin'
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin'
There's been mad signs, for this brother to heed
And while some choose greed, I choose to plant seeds
For your mental, spirit and physical temple
Bob your head to it, there's the water you've been lead to it
Bathe in it, a long time you've been cravin' it
Prance to it, use your third eye and glance through it
Your state of being, becoming advanced through it
While others rhyme with no reason I be breezin
Their mics I seize them, then I try em for treason
I used to always like to hang out
Now I lounge in the rest writin' bombs while tracks bang out
I know you peeped me in the club then

As in the Jihad, most humble, most merciful
That's because I be God, I trog through fogs, puffing logs
MC's muttering menial madness, they get mobbed
Scarred and barred, and then, banished from my fuckin' kingdom
You got a fly one bring one, or else I come to fling some
Exquisite exotic exciting type shit
Enough to make the real heads wake up and get hype quick
I'm type slick, known as the God Universal
Kick rhymes without rehearsal, I cross the burnin' sands
Now I stand here with virtue, of course I could hurt you
Simply with my point of view, and I knew
That many would come, that's why I've chosen
To cut off pathways, and there's no runways or doorways open
For the jokers who ain't focused
And all the fake mercenaries get buried by the tongue of terrifying fury
Nothing's blurry, fuck it I got no worries
Hearts and minds, shine bright light with insight
Yeah sense my birthright to set up cyphers with power
Cause mad shit ain't right, like punks in the spotlight
Who can't freestyle, sometimes I make my peeps smile
By sayin' somethin' crazy wild
Like some shit off my dome, that be soundin'
Better than the next man's whole album",What I'm Here 4
Gang Starr,"""The real, hip-hop""
""MCing, and DJing from your own mind, ya know?""
""I, I guess right now we should start the show""

Who's the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones, and all you knuckleheads
Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
Cause I'm like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack, over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whup ass
Droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin, on it's axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this; so many people
searching for false lift, I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez

""You know my steez""
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""
""Keep it live""
""To the beat y'all""

The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin the wax
I be bringin salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo they must wanna fry, they can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
(""You know my steez"")
You know my steez

""Let em know, do your thing y'all""
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez""
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""
""Keep it live""

""The mic...""
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez""
""The mic...""
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""
""Keep it live""
""You know my steez""
""The mic""

On the microphone you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks, ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin to be fly, ridin high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn he flipped""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder, than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo
Them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's, pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on
Word is bond you know my steez",You Know My Steez
Gang Starr,"""Take the money never have to run"" [Repeat: x 3]
""Here's how it goes..""

[Guru]
All for the cash man, niggaz'll be ready to blast man
Mad hoes, 'll be quick, to give up the ass man
Traitors, they'll be robbing your stash man
Don't want to end up like the last man

If the price is right, niggaz can get trife awright
They plot and they scheme, all day and all night
And they might even get elaborate enough
To plan the illest kind of crime, fuck the average stuff

Like this chick who was kickin' it, with this baller
Pretendin' that she loved him, only really loved dollars
Holla'd at his man so they could, rendezvous
Said to his man, ""Forget him, I'm fond of you""

So after the screw, she put him down with her plan
The utmost betrayal, this nigga's down with her man
But the sex changed everything, they conspired to snake him
Talked about the best time, and best way, they could take him
While in bed, she told him just where her man kept his dough

She said, ""Yo, tonight he's bout to cop some blow
And I know, there's at least, 50 grand to show
Bring a gat, wear a mask, and come through the window
I'll leave it open for you, he won't never know

So run in, grab the money, later on, you and I can flow
If we do this shit right, he won't fight
Break out with the cash and stay your ass out of sight""
So the nigga sat back, but little did he know

He was about to ruin his life over a silly hoe
And really though, the whole shit went wrong
'Cause when he came through the window and pulled out it was on
Money they was gon' rob was high, on some shit

Dukes with the mask, told him, ""Run your shit""
He said, ""Fuck that shit!"" So they tussled n shit
Then blow, the burner spit, a",All 4 tha Cash
Gang Starr,"You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker,
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin` me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
She used to say I`d better quit hanging with those derelects
Romancing is my thing but I can`t swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my beema goes you know that I`m driving
Surviving in the 90`s is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she`s busted let`s discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Bow I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I`m still gettin` crazy calls, my ex-girl`s got balls
Don`t want to play the field 'cause I get lovin` at home base
Don`t gimme no long face just exit with a grace
You and I are the past, c`est la vie, much respect girl
But now you`re my ex-girl 'cause I`m on with the next girl

[Chorus]

She had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near 'cause of my svoir faire
The time we shared was brief 'cause I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she`s crying wolf and I like don`t want to hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad
Yo but she`d tried to buy me 
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec 'cause the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I 
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c`est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you`re my ex-girl 'cause I`m straight with the next girl

[Chorus]

You saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how`s my sister then asked how`s my brother
Didn`t ask about my father 'cause you know he ain`t like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he`d really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can`t believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I want to live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin`
Yes darlin` was fly and this was the problem
'cause back in the day she had me scheming and robbin`
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and me I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
I`ve seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin` me hon
 went home to see mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? nah I think not
You and I are the past c`est la vie, much respect girl
But now you`re my ex-girl & I`m out with the next girl
Out...

Gang Starr,"I was raised like a Muslim
Prayin' to the east
Nature of my life relates rhymes i release
Like a cannon
'Cause i been plannin' to be rammin' what i wrote
Straight on a plate down your throat
So digest as i suggest we take a good look
At who's who while i'm readin' from my good book
And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
Set your mind free as i slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes pow
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin'
'Cause things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy
There's many people frontin'
And many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but i still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so i break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
Guru with the mic and premier raise the anchor
Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions i made, 'cause now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there i got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?

The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind i find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less traveled
So i can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far i can take ya
Original invincible
That's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?",Who's Gonna Take the Weight

Now I'm about to get funky... to somethin' that Premier plays
Funky... we gonna do it this way
I'm gettin' funky... to somethin' that Premier plays

Give the credit y'all... where it's due
Now give the credit... where it is due
Give the credit y'all... where it's due
I'm heated up, cause I'm seein' folks that are so phony
They didn't know me when I was broke and I was lonely
Only a few came to check me, so they come first...
... And yo our people come next G
We'd go to a club, the Milky Way or the Payday
The outlaw spots, where the music was real hot
And you wasn't there, when the underrated, real MC's
Came equipped... and used to kick slick lyrics
All live, without no lip sync
To a dope crate, building skills from instinct
I'm tired of people, gettin' all excited
I'm not trippin' on just a thing, but I'm delighted
To let you know, that some others be flim-flammin'
I'll let you know, that all this time, we been jammin'
So give up the props Hobbes, jealousy's a flaw
If the next man deserves it, earns it, it should be law
So let him pass right through

Some of the dopest MC's don't really get enough light
Cause their record companies don't really market them right
Most of the people signin' acts, they ain't from the street
Cause yo they come from the sweet...
... Soft section of town
While they be sweatin' and pretendin' that they know a real rap sound
But I know some guys, and some ladies, that can fill those spots mate
To promote the real greats
And educate, and get it straight
And mobilizin' the imitators, exposin' the explosive core
I hope to explore
Galaxies of remedies for your wack rap sickness
As I convey relay, mack rap quickness
In this business, I witness trickiness
Some MC's are into stickiness
But I'm sayin' this, from experience, I'm furious
I didn't get this far overnight, and there's nothin' like
The real thing, the real swing right? (real swing right?)
(""On and on..."") I'm takin' things that are true
So won't you give the credit y'all where it is due

So yo I'm fed, cause people like to talk too much
They're misled, and yo they like to squawk too much
But let me tell you baby you can't front on this
Twenty-for track mix, with the deep-ass kick
The objective, is to surely demolish
The chances of the wack takin' all the dollars
Support the brothers who are truly gifted
This way, the odds, could never be shifted
Like my man, you know he works real hard
He's good at what he does and now he lives real large
So why envy him, or anyone in his crew
Just sit back and give the credit y'all where it is due
Give the credit... Where it's due
Give the credit y'all... where it is due

Who the hell is this stranger, starin all in my face?""
Now you wishin you hadn't positioned yourself, in that place
Think just in case you shoulda took more precaution
A good time can become a nightmare so often
Like this nigga I know, that met these chicks on tour
They rocked him to sleep, robbed his ass for cash galore
Skated off in the night, without a trace or a hint
Scheamin tantalizin him, dressed up in lace and shit
Caught that kid out there, all high and dumbfounded
Made him think he was gettin some pussy
He just knew he was gonna pound it
Situations like this, will make you think twice

Now he's not to be messed with, makes the girls get undressed quick
He's on some big muscled chest shit, posted by the exit
That's my man, he's the owner, yeah he be on some next shit
Said we'll make a few million by the next millenium
Told me to keep droppin jewels like a triggerman, puttin lead in him
Like Flavor said, I tell these hoes to, kill the noise
You know your Pops told you, watch them New York boys
All night, the ladies be like up in my mug
Tranquilin and trance dancin up in my drug
Fly honies, they hold me down like always
The same cat that used to get blunted down in the hallways
I love the cutie pies, never the zootie pies
I got discipline, I want the crew to rise
Situations like this'll make you think twice
Instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life

Ladies, here's somethin that we should be considerin
Things could get bitter when, you don't use discipline
Imaginin yourself livin lavish and plush
Hangin with the cat who be spendin cabbage and buyin stuff
However, don't be too clever with your endeavor
And don't let too many men, receive your treasure
Most cats, be thinkin with they bozack
I admit in the past I was tryin to break these hoes backs
Escape, without givin up a dime
You know them fly ladies had a good fuckin time
Coppin me some Timberland with a jacket to match it
Girls nowadays wanna pigeon for chickenscratch
And I ain't givin up nathan
long as my game expands, it's my discipline to hate 'em

The more lies you sell, and by surprise you fell

I've suffered, just so I could return harder
Wanna be the shit starter, fuck around, make you a martyr
I make ya famous, turn around and make ya nameless
Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is
Save it and hold that, you catch a hot one
Rhymes chase a fake nigga down soon as I spot one

So if you stand in my way, I'm gonna have to spray
Learn that if you come against me son you're gonna have to pray
Since back in the day I held the weight and kept my head up
They wanna see the God catch an L it's all a set up
I give no man or thing power over me
Why these niggas so jealous and looking sour, over me?
I'm bolder G, I'm like impossible to stop

Blowing back your wig piece just for the way you're looking at me
Cock back, blaow, I hit you up right now
I don't know why so many of y'all wanna be thugs anyhow
Face the consequence of your childish nonsense
I could make your head explode just by my lyrical content
Get you in my scope and metaphorically snipe ya
I never liked ya, I gas that ass and then ignite ya
The flame thrower, make your peeps afraid to know ya
How many times I told ya, play your position small soldier
My heart is colder, makes me wanna resort to violence
Stop beating me in the head son, nah, I'm not buying it

The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin the wax
I be bringin salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo they must wanna fry, they can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort

On the microphone you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks, ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin to be fly, ridin high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn he flipped""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick -- why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder, than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo
Them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon

Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on

Got a nigga sweatin pacin, not ready to fall the fuck up
But ready to pull out, and back 'em all the fuck out
And my guardian angel, is always there to protect
And my supreme nature, keeps all them savages in check
How the hell did everything get so twisted
They say be careful what you pray for, so I guess now it's this shit

They will never know - what I do to get by
And them many times I almost died
They will never know - all the reasons why I flip
And now I gotta keep an extra clip
They will never know - what this stress is like
And why I'm on point, ready to fight
They will never know - all the pressure and pain

The emotions that one goes thourgh, over a loss of a loved one
Or friend then, knowing the cost of rebuilding and carrying on
It gets so damn hard in this modern day Babylon
And disease runs rampant, so many men carry arm
So many have a lonely painful road to travel on
Mothers losing sons, improper use of guns
Children go astray because their parents were abusive ones
I used to run with the illest guys
Thourgh the realest eyes
I seen the realest and the illest die
The cycle continues, so many times the good ones
The young ones
So many misunderstood ones
Remembering their faces and voices
And when the wise man said
Life is full of choices

Some get caught up, others are innocent victims
All I know is they were close to us, and that we miss them

Demographics make the street life hell or drastic

In the hood we see oppressive genocide
'Cause if it's on it's on, you know at least 10 men'll ride
But on the other side, corruption runs deep
I'm aware of the conspiricies, discussion is brief

They're building more prisons, spendin less on schools

While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort

I show love cause it's a terrible thing to hate
Of course I want money, but I won't compromise
Y'all don't realize, think I won't bomb you guys?
With the truth nigga, stop misleadin the youth nigga
Too many wakes and funerals, that's the proof nigga
Our hood's in danger, kids need guidance
You keep lyin, still the young keep dyin
As I walk through the valley I fear none, yes I'm the chairman
Here with my nigga premier son

We represent the pain that's real talk, what's y'all claim to fame?
Rappers simply tracin flows and chasin hoes
Frontin mad hard, that shit's amazin yo
Producers makin tinkerbell beats for them to rhyme on
Their ass if they get on the same stage that I'm on

Make the wrong move stupid then you lose your seat
Cats be buyin up SoundScans to beef up sales
Niggas wanna crossover, wanna be upscale
Fuck that, that ain't hip-hop, that's somethin else
You're better off back on the ave doin somethin else
All you suckers claimin that you are, thug or gangsta
You disrespect the game by dry-snitchin you prankster
I thank y'all for makin more room for us, uhh
Ashes to dust you wonder who's to trust
My sense of self, and my mental health
Is much more powerful, than any hint of wealth
A lot of niggas get cash, and collect Mercedes
But neglect their ladies, and forget their babies
Then the chicks turn and act like dudes
Cause they reflect our light, so yo act right fool
And this is just a piece of my mind, a thesis of mine
I'mma make moves and I'mma leave you behind
At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in

I flip lines and kick rhymes that never sound like yours
There oughtta be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows from in me
And the truth is, that you wish you could live the

Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can`t think as quick
So Premier drops a beat, for me to say verses to
And if I sound doper then take it personal

Don`t be mad cause I don`t come around the way
Like I used to, I don`t have time these days
I`m keeping busy making power moves
Don`t try to say I don`t remember you

You shouldn`t let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by, cause of the way you act
Telling my business to kids I don`t even know
You`re like a daytime talk show, and that`s low

So you can tell everyone, that I`m jerking you

He'd waited on every corner
But now forsaken he explains
It wasn't the temptation of a woman

It was American money

""So where has my family gone to?""

But maybe it's in different ways

Why he'd met it on every corner

Mow the lawn and read the papers, the afternoon game will be on the set
Sunday breakfast and an hour at church, I think I'll have a beer with the boys at lunch
Colourful shirts and colourful trousers, just the shot for a spot on the set
They don't worry about tomorrow, today's what counts and they're here today

Well I don't give a damn anyway, new gadgets and fashions of distraction
You know it was different in my day, quiet evenings at home with the family
The bigger they are the bigger they get.

Read the story now lots of adventure, follow the plot and it will take you away
Flashy fights and royal blue murder, anything to take your mind of today
I think I understand just what Sam said, when he said he's gonna live inside his head
Well, interesting facts and fascinating figures, the science of tomorrow is the pulp of today
And I don't find it all so amazing, loud and noisy and totally useless

Well I don't give a damn anyway, new gadgets and fashions of distraction
You know it was different in my day, quiet evenings at home with the family

Well it's a pressure situation

Uneasy feelings of uncertainty.
Back by the bywash, out in the open,
Floating down and around and through
A breath of air, the sound of light
Uplifting moments of emotion

The Giver of Life,
You are the Giver of Life.

For what you give now, for what you get
Well it's an endless spinning circle
There is no reason no right or wrong
Just a chord answering a call
Out on the inroads, back on the backtracks
Floating down and around and through
The cry of fire, the sway of soul
Uplifting moments of emotion

The Giver of Life,
You are the Giver of Life.

For what you count on for what you trust
Well it's a precious situation
Out in the cities, sold in the cellars
On the floor into the heart of clubland
The king of beat under the flashing lights

GANGgajang,"We knew when we began, it wouldn't last forever
But we always thought, somehow it would get better.
There should be love and affection, not rejection,
Love is the key I'm sure, to open every door.
But when love goes away, there's no foundation,
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above
Just another crazy scene, just another nightmare dream,

And it all falls down like a house of cards
And it all falls down like a house of cards

So stop those angry words, they don't prove a thing.
Just look around, and see the mess we're in
Every single day, you know I need you
I need the kind of love I can believe in
But when love goes astray, there's no foundation
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above
Just another crazy scene, just another nightmare dream


When it all falls down like a House of Cards.
And it all falls down like a House of Cards in the wind
It all falls down like a House of Cards falls down.

So stop! those angry words, they don't prove a thing.
Just look around, and see the mess we're in

I need the kind of love I can believe in
But when love goes astray, there's no foundation
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above

GANGgajang,"(G.Stapleton)

I keep a picture of you on my wall
Exactly why it's there I can't recall
I think I keep it to remind myself

That what we had was never very clear
I often wondered what it was I feared
But now I hardly think of you at all

Oh no but I climbed the walls
And kept alive
In spite of love
There was no reflection
The sun it was hidden
Behind the belief
That the world had stopped turning

And when the lovers meet as lovers do
These days I rarely even think of you
I turn the TV off and go to bed

Oh no but I climbed the walls
And kept alive
In spite of love
The summer was colder
By half than the winter
And only the calendar
Called it a liar

Oh no but I climbed the walls
And kept alive
In spite of love
There was no reflection
The sun it was hidden
Behind the belief
That the world had stopped turning



",In Spite of Love
GANGgajang,"The luck of the Irish borne of ages past
Has spawned a cruel history, lets hope that luck don't last
It came with the longships and from across the Irish sea
The endless tides of fighting men bought the Ard ris to their knees
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

Then came the English with their reforming ways
The luck of the Irish bore ample fruit in those days
The land was replanted with the winners of English wars
And the only crops harvested were famine and plague and the odd lost cause
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

One day things will change and then you know you will see
Just how lucky they can all really be
When the orange and the green meet on the white in between
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

The luck of the Irish still hangs around their heels
As bombers stop the cities hearts and blood is spilt in the greenest fields
And the orangemen remember, the old horse is yearly shod
To ride again with long dead men and kill or be killed for the one same god.
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

One day things will change and then you know you will see
Just how lucky they can all really be
When the orange and the green meet on the white in between

When I hear you, when I hear the things you say

Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind

Is it history repeating itself?
Is it science, biology or something else?
That leads me down familiar streets
Ignoring warnings and the danger signs that I see
Maybe I'm intentionally blind
Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind

You tell me you're good for me
And believe me there's no other place I'd rather be
When I'm down and need someone to hold me tight

And then the fires come, and burn the water
It's a sight to be seen

The men in slouch hats reap the harvest
Brown sticks they place in cages

And then the trains hiss, they carry bounty
From the furnace to the mill

Stick men silhouettes bend against the flame,
Shout above the crackle crunch.

Watch as the ground spits at the sky
A yellow-orange spit from a mouth that will never die

Every night you can find me there with sweating palms and matted hair
And drops of blood dot the sand everywhere under the tree of love

And you can hear them whispering under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every saint and every sinner
As they paw the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Some nights there are many there and murmurs fill the desert air
Odd and evens trying to make a pair under the tree of love
On and on as the darkness falls the wistful sound of the searchers calls
Are heard within and without the walls around the tree of love

And you can hear them talking under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every heel and every hero
As they scour the desert sands for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Last night, before the end, I found myself under the tree again
The branches break as the bones they bend under the tree of love

And you can hear them shouting under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every saint and every sinner
As they search the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Still hanging on her apron strings she spins us all around
So high, so low sometimes so twisted we can't see

And the future keeps on looming regardless of what we've found

With long diagonals, sloping too. 
And in the distance, through the heat haze, 
In convoys of silence the cattle graze.

No more of thinkin' my talents gone be insured for a mil
'cause if it was, my 'cause, came up and do it for real
No more of dealin' with hoes, I'd rather have me a bitch
'Cause she ain't shit from the start, just keep her slick with the dick

No more of hard-head grindin' that shit round the trunk
Too used to gettin' what I want, so I'm gone keep this shit blunt
No more of layin' in the road, for you to walk over mud
And disrespectin' big Chug, and weigh you lazy in mud
Keep it away from me please, no suckas stoppin' E-ski
And we ain't takin' no more, so Fly you tell 'em the D
Nigga!!!

Flizy just can't take no more
Overboard I'm bout to go
Funk and drank and dank you under the table like I did before
Seven, nine of ninety-eight
Playa Fly gone hit'cha straight
With somethin' you don't want to feel the funk so you ain't gotta wait

Trait like I'm flaugin' 'cause I'm mobbin' over broken hearts
Movin' all my mini-Minnie Mae Mafia to hit the charts
How you gonna stop us now? With all this, Funkytown we bound
S.P.V. I'm bound, until I die then Playa Flizy down
First the A and four and one
Who's the one be wantin' some?
Not the suckas stink, but get'cha straight when all their body numb
Can't compact the garbage that you start producin' orally
I roll my windows tightly 'fore it really start annoyin' me

As much as I'm enjoyin' this, and all the weak B.S. you spit
My windows already rolled, so you know this dizays over with

And you haters out to hate
Wave your guns up in the air
And cock 'em back if it's a must
If you don't give a fuck
Pull the trigger and let it bust (fool)

Unfadeable to any motherfucker who cross my path

Get to schemin, play a role, like I'm in a soap opera
Findin' bitches number in yo' wallet, and how I'mma stop it
(what should I do?) go bother the niggas that is down wit yo' crew
From me to you, this gangsta boo, and I'm just tellin' the truth
You hurt me bad, feelin' strange, wit revenge on my mind
Call my baby from the 8 and say ""it's been a long time""
How are ya doin'? (doin' great)

Prepared to kill for you, I fold, make sure pistol that pin 'em
Though you be wit it, this affair is too good to be true
It must be blessed
Besides, yo' man is too posessive & over-protective
You want him deceased, I'll be da trigga man on the piece
After it's over, you & I can have an intimate feast
Let me know the time & location plus how to do it
You told me 12 at yo' house, sliced & least dilluted
So I'm creepin' to the doorstep of your 30 million mansion
It's time fo' havoc, ???, he'll be evicted on the fuckin' minute
You been takin' shovin' & orders
He bust & you're a torch
Sliced him to death, threw his carcus over the river water

I'm cookin', makin' him feel good after it's all planned
I'm havin' second thoughts but now I got me a new man
(his last meal)
Like his ass locked up hell tight
I sexed him down once he ate his food, this was like right
After the clock struck 9, 12 on midnight, he finished
'cause my baby paco want to blow his brains on the ceiling
Hope his folks don't be mad
Fuck it! I just might flee
Because he left a lot of money in the s-a-f-e
Too good to be true
Gangsta boo love somebody
But you nobody until yo' ass kill somebody
I'm thinkin' quick, my hands are wet, maybe it's from my sweat
11:45 is here, I guess the stash it 'tected

I'm a lady who be keepin it real, you don't care
Take time out, see how I feel
When I be riding in the SUV, I'm thinking of you
When I be rolling up a fat one, boy I'm thinking of you
You got me going like uh
I'm feelin the rush, I like to fuck
Let's get buck in the back of the truck, so boy what's up?
It's whatever when it comes down to you
Well it was, until you made it clear that I ain't for you
You just abandoned me, you left me strandedly
Heart broke, constantly
Hearing love songs on the radio, that remind me of you
They say a gangsta ain't 'posed to cry
But I'm shedding tears and I'm a gangsta until I die
I'm telling you boy, they say no pain then no gain
Now they call me player because you teaching me all yo game
I say I ain't change, but then again just peep me out

Hey yo, I don't think this shit is gonna work...
I'm ready to leave you, get out

Why you out here cheating on me, I'm getting my own creeping on
Hey girl, why you ain't answer that god damn phone?
Uhh why nigga, I was gone
Nigga bout my ? hes, pay my own light bill
I don't need you, got my own fingers for my sex thrill
Shit, I'm a mack, player you ain't heard my real name?
Mrs. Pimping Thing, pussy power to the fucking brain
If you want to play, get in the shower stroke yourself
I ain't the one to be messed with, pimping to my death
Slip in and slip out, remember how that used to be?
I would get so wet when you put yo' love inside of me
But that's the past now, no more freaky tail nights
No more popping X, or sex asshole tight

[Verse 3]
I ain't trying get caught up in yo games
Personally, I think that shit is lame
What you doing err' now and then when you want to hit
I ain't giving yo ass shit, you'll be just another trick
On my list of busta's, diamond clusters
Rings, old game used to be so not told
With yo' frozen heart, boy you tore my soul apart
My XX plot, about a nigga from the ?
With yo' seven inch cock, give it to me don't you stop
I keep falling for you, hypnotized doubt you get my props
But now I'm single, pussy bad tight
I ain't fucking with no giggalos, niggas ain't right
They want to cut now, they want to cut later
They ain't call yo ass then, they ain't call yo ass later
That's how it goes, I'm out the door, holla back
Hit me on my 2 Way when you ready
That's that on that

Gangsta Pat,"[Verse 1]
Put me off in any hood, I bet chu' I'ma survive
365 reasons to stay alive
In this jungle, lies be the king of these streets
But even the lies be runnin' from the crooked police
It ain't no peace cause they got the hood split up in sections
Violate the wronge set and they comin' with techs
There ain't no questions be asked, no bullies gettin' mad
Just killers on a task, and units bein' blast
With no remorse, I done seen it plenty of times
So I take it to my room and write plenty of rhymes
About the dirty game, thangs ain't the same no mo'
They try to stick together, just ain't what they claim no mo'
So hit the floor when they hit the door, give up them sacks
Everybody's got a posse so they robbin' in packs
On the attack and they keep gun runnin' like wood
And respect is something that chu' gotta earn in the hood

[Hook]
It's all good in my neighborhood
We out hustlin' doin' thangs y'all wish y'all could
We in this game, gettin' money and we livin' good
Stayin' real to the end like we know we should
It's all good

[Verse 2]
It's all about the money, gettin' paid is an every day job
And we connected, makin' moves like a heavyweight mob
And well respected, the hood is gonna make you or break you
And livin' and learnin' through all the drama that it'll take you
Keep you focused on reality, deep in the thoughts
Tryin' to count for every penny that you keep in the vault
So keep your yoks and still watch ya back
Cause in the hood your own friends will be the one to jack
Knowin' crosses is comin' throughout my whole nature
Takin' losses and dealin' with all this play hation
Steady chasin' that cheese and hangin' out with G's
Fuck what cha' sayin' bout gankin' and doin' robberies
I'm just tryin' to survive and keep myself alive
See I'm all about hustlin' can't work no 9 to 5
I'm stay thuggish not ruggish off in that hood
Steady tryin' to maintain and keep the paper good

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
You gotta watch ya back cause them killers be havin' jacks
They travel in packs and they quick to pull them gats
Ain't no time for negotiatin'
Just give up for good, look at the occupation
I run in numbers before the drama even kicks off
Duckin' and dodgin' from all them shots they done let off
I see it all the time in my neighborhood
Robbin' murder and madness but still the paper's good
I keep my mind on money and block out the pain
Ya see depression, deprivin' can drive ya mind insane
I'm trapped in this game and it ain't one way out
I strugglin' and strivin' to keep my pockets stout
See I'm tryin' to stay Southern, ain't no love for cowards
On the block steady hustlin' and don't cha' doubt us
I'm always down for my hood like I know I should
Gettin' plenty of money like I knew I could

Cooked it and we split it

Sick in the head, bloodshed in a ant bed

So I can sew you one - 'cause I'm in it to win it

Fuck with a psycho, you end up dead
Those who didn't live, drowned in a turtle's head
A twelve gauge is my only protection
Every bullet shot has a different infection
Woke up this morning with a dead dog on me
So I thought, ""Huh - baloney!""
If a nigga run up I don't care if he pushes
Fuck around and find his ass somewhere dead in some sticker bushes
Mess with N-I-P you must be tired of livin
Cut off your head - mmm, Thanksgiving
If you want to live, your ass better beg

Kill a nigga for a measly-ass nickel
Frozen blood on a stick, equals strawberry popsicles
Fuck up and watch your Black neck bend
Dead men, making rounds cutting throats with a violin
I ain't gon' lie I feel like killin' my niece
A bird's leg woke up dead with his head in some fish grease
Ten died yesterday, ten just died
Ten died today - now this football's on layaway
You said I was weak, yeah, point blank told me
Tied a needle to my dick then my grandmother rode me
It ain't another nigga in this world can match this
I feel like swimmin' in rat piss
Fuck with N-I-P - I ain't no actor
My twelve daughters died from talking shit to a tractor
I'm getting pissed from the blood I threw up
Barely snapped my fingers and Jupiter blew up!
Hoes, they love me, they say I'm a pleaser
I woke up dead in a cat's leg screaming ""Caesar!""
Quick to break your motherfuckin' spine
A dead goat got pregnant and said it was mine
Ganksta N-I-P - I'm down with the Mob
Cuttin' off heads was my last year's Summer job
Blame it on TV - then put it on the map
This is a horror movie rap

A tisket, a tasket, you ain't gon' believe me
It ain't N-I-P's fault that he got crazy thoughts

So wet them motherfuckers 'cause they do talk shit
We been gettin' slaughtered, so Rodney King whaddant new bitch
Devil, watch the Psych get nifty
Make no mistake it was a reflection of the sixties
That when niggas got beat down in the slavery days
But now in '96 we call it bravery days, check it out
So many motherfuckin' murders and jacks and
So many motherfuckin' burglars with gats man

You got some money 'cause I just don't close my Audi y'all
Yellow tape wasn't enough for the red line
Nigga hide that banana clip to the AK you know it's fed time
If you shoot a devil, would you keep steppin?
They couldn't convit you if they couldn't find the murder weapon
A stolen car, plus the music is gone
Dark black 'Lac tight white interior, car phone
Drop top bumper kid plus fifth wheel grill
Surround by sound wasn't handy Randy sing a song his ass got killed
So make the devil respect us
The same thing that happened in L.A. is gonna happen in Texas
Punk nigga let me start this shit
Flip the script, psycho NIP, conjur Moses here to part this bitch
Against the psych situation is no win
Peter Jennings, have you ever had a nigga kick yo door in
Schools in white hoods, are so so big
But schools in the black hoods, man look what they did

I heard the cops been actin' a fool around the way
Jump out boys hit seven houses in one day
In South Park we keep they ass in suspense
Time you see 5-O you time another nigga hittin' the fence
Back in the days she gave the busta' spark
Stupid motherfucker didn't know he robbed Rosa Parks
Check game devil, what is you hawkin' about
Harriet Tubman freed the slaves so what the fuck is you talkin' 'bout
Psychotic rapper let me show you how to be
It's beats like this that bring the psych shit outta me
Shit, peep ya boy as I come from the heart
David Copperfield could not perform the bullshit tricks in South Park
Then you know about the Psych Ward, the sinister legion

They say he was weird, but the bodies he killed
He always scratched off the names of the people he killed
Real slow, Pysch torture style, pass me the scissors
And cut off microscopic pieces like a mirror
Terror screams, let me know the spinal was crumbled
By the gestures they made and the words that they mumbled
Maybe I can slice a throat when I'm ready

You should yell when it clicks, 'cause blood finna seep

When I die you think I'm dead, but I really switched bodies
I'm standing there, watchin', they put him in the ground
Blow a sweet when it's over, I'll go kill downtown
Cops don't understand, they thought he was bluffin'
They say the officer went crazy when he murdered a dozen
Other cops and didn't ? 'cause life ain't fair
They put his body in the chair, but his mind wasn't there
Soul snatcher, got cha, hit him with a heavy right

Mood swings, lyrics over hard-core beats
It's kinda like a german shepherd hit on the streets
By a big muthafuckin truck, speeding and shit
And poor little german shepherd bleeding and shit
See I'ma born psychopath, I shed no fear
And I'm the hardest muthafuckin nigga rappin out here

They're getting harder
I'll free your mind and your androgyny

No sweeter a taste that you could find
Than fruit hanging ripe upon the vine

A river deep that never runs dry

The birds and bees they hum along
Like treasures they twinkle in the sun

Walk away cause you're breaking up the girl
It's a drag
I know it's hard
But you're tearing her apart
Walk away cause you're breaking up the girl

I am afraid that there's much to be afraid of
Here today and gone tomorrow

No one can follow us.
We were gone before we came, alone, eternal
Dark and damned

don't ever try to understand
No consolation
And when we reach what we came for
It won't be a victory,

it's just the beginning of another end

You have given back hell to me
And I will keep it now and forever
My mechanism masochism

as long as you sit calm and small
You'll never feel the chains
And then we'll create ourselves a god
Without whom we cannot live.
At night like a big black beast
With scars and blood dark floods

there's the beginning of another end

the mechanism masochism
You have given hell back to me
And I will keep it now and forever

Now that we've left Eden.

Come, dark angel, strengthen me.

ablaze my rage, come, dark angel,
Tear open my wounds, let me bleed.
Keep me free of indifference,
Drink my sorrows, gorge my grief.

help me to shine in godlike anger,
Help me never to forget,
Let me hate and let me live,
Let me remember that we've met

and that you've cast your spell on me.
Far off lies the universe,
Sunk in ashes, mud and tears,
Far off lies reality.

and yes, we are vulnerable,
Vulnerable and earth tied.
But it doesn't matter any more.
Come, dark angel, be my guide.

before I slip into the damnation
Of obedience and apathy
In a cloud of dust and blood
Come, dark anger, rescue me.

There is something from inside
That is huge, that is cruel

That you'll never understand

Somewhere beyond the far horizon
The Gods of gloom and gore arise
Where from an everlasting wound
Bleeding are the western skies

The darkness talks if you do listen
The silence will dance at times
If you don't live within this world
You'll never know about the fight

That's fought within myself so often
You'll never know what demons dream
How wolves became a part of me
How crows and ravens rule the night

Watch me rise
As I celebrate your decay
Watch me grow
As I fall and pray

And in oceans of blood

All my troubles seemed so far away 
Now it looks as though they're here to stay 
Oh I believe in yesterday 

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I use to be 
There's a shadow hanging over me 
Oh yesterday came suddenly 

Why she had to go, I don't know 
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday 

Yesterday... 
Love was such an easy game to play 
Now I need a place to hide away 
Oh I believe in yesterday 

Why she had to go, I don't know 
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday

C'mon sing wit me 
See, when I get the strength to leave you
Always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that may be
You can learn to appreciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change

Talking to me, lip thinking
I think I know what you thinking
Am I wrong?

That look in your eyes
Shows me what could be mine
Oohooh girl I feel it the beat inside
Tonight we'll dance like star crossed lovers

When the party's jumpin' and the music's pumpin'
Make me want to freak my baby
When the groove is hot, I don't want to stop
I just want to drive you crazy

I swear that I could be dreaming
I never thought we could dance in perfect time

Gareth Gates,"Everybody knows that you're a star
Gucci shoes, the look of Caviar
They all know exactly who you are
And they all wanna get next to you

See your face in every magazine
Staring out from every movie screen
Your body is as best there's ever been
But they'll never get next to you

And I got your pictures all over my wall
But I've got the greatest secret of all

Because you're absolutely mine
That's why I'm lying here next to you
Absolutely fine
That's why they fall in love with you

No one knows the danger you do to me
What they dream about I get for free
I'm living everybody's fantasy
And they all wanna get next to you

And the reason for their breaking hearts
Is that you don't even know who they are
Everybody knows that you're a star
And they all wanna get next to you

And I've got your pictures all over my wall
But I've got the greatest secret of all

Because you're absolutely mine
That's why I'm lying here next to you

That's why they fall in love with you

Gareth Gates,"Tear drops in my eyes
Came every day with the sunrise
It's been that way as long as you've been gone
I thought the day would start
Same as the others falling apart
I thought I barely would be hanging on

Something has changed, feel so strange
Swimming through a notion of games
Then suddenly is the sun

[Chorus]
Maybe I had enough of you,
Maybe I been tired to dream of you
Maybe I gotta know your goodbye bye now
Baby I couldn't live without you
Now when I think about you
My eyes are dried somehow
Baby I'm all cried out
All cried out

I don't know what it is
Why I'm not longer missing your kiss
It feels mysterious and so damn good

Something is changed, feel so strange
Swimming true a notion of games
Then suddenly is the sun

My heart has finally walked away
It's gone from the scene of the crime
It's finally found the perfect place
Leaving it far behind
Baby maybe I

I hear a silly love song in my heart

It happens every time when I see you
It happens every time when I think of you
It happens every time, always magic when we meet
Baby, down on Dream Street

Let me take you by the hand and
Walk you down my hometown streets, girl
You make me feel I'm so alive

I don't complain about the life I live
And I appreciate the lovin' that your showin' me
I believe what you give is what you get

Every time they wanna bring the heat
I flash a smile at the paparazzi
All my life I always dreamt of this
So you know I'm embracing it

Oh yeah, everybody wants a piece of me
To get a glimpse of the life I lead
If you wanna see, if I'm down
There's enough of me, to go around

You might see me as a superstar
But I don't even drive a fancy car
Keepin' both feet, on the ground
There's enough of me to go around

I never hesitate if you want an autograph
I'll go and sign my name across your heart
So quote me wrong all day the only thing I'll do is laugh
You write the script you know I'll play the part

Every time they wanna bring the heat
I flash a smile at the paparazzi
All my life I always dreamt of this

There's enough of me to go around

I got more than enough to give
What's the use in holding back I've only got one life to live
I'm gonna make the best of all I have
And share myself in every way that I can

Everybody wants a piece of me
To get a glimpse of the life I lead
If you wanna see, if I'm down

You gotta show me what I'm trying to see
You gotta give me some kind of sign

That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest

Go to the place that's the best 
Go to the place that's the best

I'm the first to complain about the rain
'Cause I don't like it like that
But when I see the sunshine
Breakin' through the clouds, I'm lovin' 
The rest of the day

Come take a walk with me
We'll take our time as we
Watch our cares float away (ooh yeah)
This is the time when I, don't even have to try
Hope this happens today (eeh eeh)

What ya gon' do about it
What ya gon' say when I say
Baby it's just one of those days
What ya gon' do today
You can see that I'm smilin?
Baby there's no denying

What ya gon' do today (aah aah)

Gareth Gates,"So many times
I've played around 
Moving from one to another
I've been a fool
I've been unkind
But being with you made me discover
That trust and honestly
Is all I need 
And I should never let it slip away
'Cause girl

Seeing you shine by the candle-light
Got me hooked, and it feels so right
So good that baby I dun want tis night to be over
Stay right here oh please don't leave 
Let's star in our own love scene
Then chill and spread the night
It's too soon to say goodbye
It's too soon to say goodbye

Darlin' I know
You're the type who goes slow
And trust when I say
I don't mean to rush you
But give it some thought
If you're all alone

You're just gonna wish
That I was there too imagine you and me
As close as two can be 
We can let it flow for eternity girl

We come in the best fly over here

We can fly
Fly away

Oh, we can fly! Oh

If you coming closer, take my hand
There's no limit around me, understand
We going far
We are everything all you have to do
Is think of me, as in to you
We deliver messages of ""put me up""

I heard you making patterns rhyme

This is planet Earth you're looking at planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop this is planet Earth
My head is stuck on something precious
Let me know if you're coming down to land
Is there anybody out there trying to get through?

Where you been so long?
Sit right down
And let me sing you a song.
I seen you on a movie in my room.

Oh Lon Chaney,
With the velvet touch,
A silver dagger and a black man's crutch.
Now's the time to come out from your tomb.
You look so sad,
With a face of stone,
With a hunchback's eye you live.

Oh Lon Chaney,
With the velvet touch,
A gypsy woman that you love so much.
Say goodbye,
You're cured,
You're free at last.

Oh Lon Chaney,
What's to hold you back?
The Wolfman's dead
And the old black cat is gone,
Like a memory faded from your past.
You look so sad,
With a face of stone,
Just skin and bone.
You're all alone,
With a hunchback's eye you live.

I soon found out
It was more than fascination
I soon found out
It was much more than just a cheap imitation
I held her hand
Slowly we got closer
Felt like a man
And not some kind of poseur
Yes it's true she just came in from Paris
Her French perfume I got to know it better
We talked of love and poetry and marriage
Then I discovered that mysterious love letter

Bed henne dricka all sorg you're sitt sinn

Där drack hon you're vinet och tömde I vann`

And teach them to keep their honour from harm

""It`s I am the messenger you seek.""

You must ride to her ere the close of day.

And she is blacker than the blackest clay."" 
 
""Then give to her these bottles of wine 
To drink all sorrow away from her mind. 
 
""Tell her no more to grieve or sorrow, 
And I will ride to her tomorrow."" 
 
Then the wine from the bottles this false maid drank 
And filled them with water by the riverbank. 
 
""This water is a token Herr Holkin sent 
That he never will ride to you again.""

And heard every word that this maiden did say.

But it doesn't look like me

A foreign look behind my stare
I feel frantic, almost desperate
He acts as if he doesn't care
A smile cracks his face, a tear comes to my eye
His laughter fills the room ,words echo in my mind
Look away- (Don't look at me)
Look away- (You won't like what you see)
Look away- (Fear what's inside me)
But I can't look away
Fell the lock of tension closing
As I slowly turn the key
I sense joints lock into place
Like cement setting in my veins
Like an attic stored with memories,the contents are so rarely seen
Look away- (Don't look at me)
Look away- (You won't like what you see)
Look away- (Fear what's inside me)
But I can't look away
A complex creature,I labor to see through the haze
I strive to know myself,but I'm lost within the maze
It's painful learning the truth about myself
So I always look away

So,tomorrow like today, I'll stare again,doing nothing",Look Away

Garnet Rogers,"Every night she sleeps alone
And by her bed she puts the phone
And every morning after that
She takes the phone and puts it back

He's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown
But these are things that go unsaid
He might call her from the road just in time to say hello
And goodbye again

She keeps his picture tucked away
She thinks she'll have it framed one day
And maybe he'll come see it there
Hanging by her rocking chair

In a corner of her room on a Sunday afternoon
When all the world is dull and gray
She might close her eyes and sit, rocking gently for a bit
Till all the bad thoughts go away

Back when children played their games
London Bridge and Jesse James
She captured flags, she bounced the ball
And every time, she beat them all

And now she comes home to a cat in a three-room walk-up flat
And plays a game of solitaire
Well she made a fist last night, and she broke the hallway light
And the pieces scattered everywhere

You see, he's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown
But these are things that go unsaid

A lesson he learned, it was a long time ago

You're gonna have to learn to let go

You got to dance like nobody's watchin'

Garnet Rogers,"This shirt is old and faded
All the color's washed away
I've had it now for more damn years
Than I can count anyway
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

This shirt's got silver buttons
And a place upon the sleeve
Where I used to set my heart up
Right there anyone could see
This shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance
Where the boys ignored the girls
And we all pretended to like the band

This shirt was a pillow for my head
On a train through Italy
This shirt was a blanket beneath the love
We made in Argeles
This shirt was lost for three whole days
In a town near Buffalo
'Till I found the locker key
In a downtown Trailways bus depot

This shirt was the one I lent you
And when you gave it back
There was a rip inside the sleeve
Where you rolled your cigarettes
It was the place I put my heart
Now look at where you put a tear
I forgave your thoughtlessness
But not the boy who put it there

This shirt was the place your cat
Decided to give birth to five
And we stayed up all night watching
And we wept when the last one died
This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton
Shining like the memories
Inside those silver buttons

This shirt is a grand old relic
With a grand old history
I wear it now for Sunday chores
Cleaning house and raking leaves
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

Lose your heart and never call it lost
May your love be your shelter to the ending of your days

May your hearts grow forever more entwined

Mama don't wanna say goodbye
She said wipe those tears from your eyes
Mama I don't wanna say goodbye
It was written in the heavens and the skies above
Son I gave you birth showed you all my love
I can't think of this life without you it's hard to try
Mama I'm afraid to say goodbye

Now kids I've been hangin' on a long time
I hate to leave this world before your grown
Remember everything that I've taught you
Remember all the good times when I'm gone

[Chorus]

She whispered in my ear before she passed away
Son it's time to be a man ain't nothin' left to say
Jesus walked on water I know it's true
When it comes time he'll call you home
I hope your ready too

Garnett Silk,"Let it flow
Let it flow, yeah, yeah
There's a reason, for the sunshine sky
And there's a reason, why I am feeling so high
It must be the season
When the love light shines, all around us
So let the feeling, rock you deep inside
Instead your reeling, where your love can't hide
And than you go steeling
For the morning lights, with you lover, with your lover
Let your love flow, like a mountain stream
Let your love grow, with the smallest of dreams
Let your love show, and you know what I mean
It's the season, it's the season
Let your love fly, like a bird on the winds
Let your love find you, through all little things
Let you love show, and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

There's a reason, for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason, for the candle lights
It must be the season
When those love lights shines, all around us
So let the wonder, take you into space
When there you're under, it's lovely ambrass
Just feel the thunder, as it wants you face
You can't hold back no more, no baby 
Let your love flow, like a mountain stream
Let your love grow, with the smallest of dreams
Let your love show, and you know what I mean
It's the season, it's the season
Let your love fly, like a bird on the winds
Let your love find you, through all little things
Let you love show, and you'll know what I mean

Garnett Silk,"Name your price
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here any more
And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a short cut I'd have found it
But there is no easy way around it

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard
It's such a lonely world
People turn their heads
And walk on by
Tell me is it worth just another try

Are we alive
Or just a dying planet
What are the chances
Ask the man in your heart for the answers
And when you feel afraid

Love one another
When you've lost your way
Love one another
And when you're all alone
Love one another
And when you're far from home
Love one another
And when you're down and out
Love one another
And when your hopes run out
Love one another
And when you need a friend
Love one another
We got to love one another",Harder

Even if you call the father's name it's the same

There's lights of hope still shining

Lift up the name of Jah in abundance 
Every single thing we do, we are liable 
To get a sentence 
But we won't be like a flea just like how the more we see 
The less you hear we speak 
My brother don't you be like a stubborn sheep 

Blessed are he when men shall revile you 
And persecute you, say all manner of evil 
Against you falsely, for Jah sake 
Rejoice I say and be exceedingly glad 
For great is your reward 
For so persecute they the prophets before you and me

De vivre libre comme un gitan

Je voyais des plages
De sable noir
Où couraient des chevaux sauvages

Et je dessinais dans mes cahiers
Les sentiers secrets
Des montagnes d'Espagne

Gitan
Quand plus tard
J'apprenais mes premiers accords de guitare

Sur la route je partais sans bagages
En rêvant
D'autres paysages

Où je suivais les gens du voyage
Dans leurs caravanes
Au son des violons tziganes

Vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Avoir la musique dans le sang
Et pour l'amour n'avoir dans la peau
Qu'une seule femme à la fois

Vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Vivre ma vie comme je l'entends
Avoir la liberté pour drapeau
« Sans foi ni loi » pour credo

Gitan
Je le suis et le resterai
Le temps de mon vivant

Mes guitares sont d'Amérique
Et mes paysages
De grands espaces blancs

Où je roule seul dans ma caravane
En éternel exil
Dans la jungle des villes

Oh vivre ma vie comme un gitan
Avoir la musique dans le sang
Et pour l'amour n'avoir dans la peau
Qu'une seule femme à la fois

Garou,"Quand j'ai croisé son regard
Il était déjà trop tard
Elle avait le sourire étrange
Que les peintres donnent aux anges

J'avais l'impression bizarre
De l'avoir vue quelque part
Par quel appeal, quel appel

M'a-t-elle attirée vers elle
Je l'ai suivie comme une ombre
Dans ses nuits d'entre deux mondes

Pour l'amour d'une femme
Je tombe à genoux
Je vendrais mon âme, j'irais jusqu'au bout
Ainsi je suis né, je suis condamné

Condamné à vie, a payer le prix
Que devra payer
Un homme qui se damne
Pour l'amour d'une femme

Autre part une autre histoire
Au hasard d'un cruising bar
Encore une qui me séduit

Et m'invite dans son lit
C'est dans une chambre d'hôtel
Que je m'éveille avec elle

Pour l'amour d'une femme
Je tombe à genoux, je vendrais mon âme
J'irais jusqu'au bout
Pour l'amour d'une femme, pour l'amour d'une femme

Longs couloirs de ma mémoire
Vous ne menez plus nulle part
Vrais diamants et faux miroirs
Vous m'avez mis sur le trottoir

Pour l'amour d'une femme
Je tombe à genoux
Je vendrais mon âme, j'irais jusqu'au bout
Ainsi je suis né, je suis condamné

Condamné à vie, a payer le prix
Que devra payer
Un homme qui se damne
Pour l'amour d'une femme

Marqué à jamais, d'une place pour toi

Trying to find different ways to get through
Till it's time to come back
And I can't slow it down

And I'm climbing the walls
And I feel like I'm under attack
There's too many people that get in my way
And there's never a right time that I get to say

When you and I touch hands when you and I stop
Still in the moment it's you and I
Not running for something that's already gone
When it's just you and I that's when I'm home

That's when I'm home
There's always the question what's holding me down

Show me an answer cause I haven't found
A way to escape to get out of it all
Somewhere that I am allowed to fall
With no bones to break I can be who I am

Cause you know me better than anyone
When you and I touch hands when you and I stop
Still in the moment it's you and I
Not running for something that's already gone

When it's just you and I that's when I'm home
That's when I'm home
Home's not a house with windows
And walls not a place to be shut in
There are no doors

And no matter where I come to rest
Your arms will be my safety net

Et demain matin, petit garçon
Tu trouveras dans tes chaussons
Tous les jouets dont tu as rêvé
Petit garçon il est l'heure d'aller se coucher
Petit garçon il est l'heure d'aller se coucher",Petit garçon
Garrett,"Consider this a sign.
This is a train in the night
And now it's time for you to go
You know you've had a healthy life, boy.

You walk this world like you're a ghost
Your hands are coming through the needles
Sick of your tragic and the evils
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith, but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone
How are you feeling?
Seem a little sick to me now

This is a coming of the times
You are a witness to the movement

If all you're seeing is your lies
You had your chance, but now you've blown it.
You want this world so you can own it
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith, but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone

How are you feeling?
You seem a little sick to me

From the light on high
A chance to change your fate
Forgiveness falling down
On those who chose to wait
Remember the time
Find yourself home again
Deep within your life
Find yourself a home again find yourself home again
It's a choice
You have chosen your own

In the old days
When the world was young and bright 
If you raise the mask, who will lead us home tonight

Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith, but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone
How are you feeling?
Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith, but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone
How are you feeling?
Seems a little sick
It seems a little sick
It seems a little sick to me now",Prophecy
