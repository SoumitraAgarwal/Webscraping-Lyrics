John Rich,"I'm a son of a preacher man
Everybody calls him Brother Jim
Seem like I spend my life
Trying to live up to him

Week he taught me wrong from right
But Lord knows I still sin
Hey I'm the son of a preacher man

Daddy said that the narrow road
Was the only road to take
But now I make my living on a tour bus
Rolling down interstates

All-nighters with cheaters and liars
Can sometimes test your faith
I'm still the son of a preacher man

Well the good books say that Jesus ran with a party crowd
So I believe and pray them Pearly Gates are still where I'm bound
And I don't know if the life I chose make my daddy proud
Of who I am
I'm just the son of a preacher man

Most Sunday mornings
I spend getting over Saturday nights
While he's down there preaching in the pulpit
Singing, ""I Saw The Light.""

And sometimes it's hard
To look my mirror in the eye
Knowing I'm the son of a preacher man

Well the good books say that Jesus ran with a party crowd
So I believe and pray them Pearly Gates are still where I'm bound
And I don't know if the life I chose make my daddy proud
Of who I am
I'm just the son of a preacher man

I'm just the son, I'm just the son
Hey I'm the son
Of a preacher man",Preacher Man
John Rich,"My daddy taught me in this country everyone's the same.
You work hard for your dollar and you never pass the blame,
When it don't go your way.
Now I see all these big shots whining on my evening news,
About how they're losing billions and it's up to me and you
To come running to the rescue.

Well pardon me if I don't shed a tear.
Their selling make believe and we don't buy that here.

Because in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down,
While the boss man takes his bonus paid jets on out of town.
DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground.
Yeah while they're living up on Wall Street in that New York City town,
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down.
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down.

Well that old man's been working in that plant most all his life,
Now his pension plan's been cut in half and he can't afford to die
And it's a crying shame, cus he ain't the one to Blame.
When I looked down to see his calloused hands,
Well let me tell you friend it gets me fightin' mad.

Cause in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down,
While the boss man takes his bonus paid jets on out of town.
DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground.
Yeah while they're living up on Wall Street in that New York City town,
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down.

Yeah while they're living up on Wall Street in that New York City town,
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down.
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down,
In the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down.
They're shuttin' Detroit down.",Shuttin' Detroit Down
John Rich,"He's got a sunburn on his left arms
From hangin' out a Peterbbilt window
Got a wife and three kids on the farm
Drivin' as fast as he can go, yeah

Minneapolis in his rear view
He's a dead headin' to tulsa
Got the hammer down on 82
With every mile marker getting closer
I said

[Chorus]
Hey he's a trucker man
Tryin' to get home just as fast as he can
Those red-eye runs are taking there torl
His eighteen-wheeler is a rollin' back home

Starin' a hole through the windshield
He's got nineteen on the CB
Well they call him the Bandit
'Cause he only brakes for the Smokies
I said

Hey he's a trucker man
Tryin' to get home just as fast as he can
Those red-eye runs are taking there torl
His eighteen-wheeler is a rollin' back home

He's got a Smith and Wesson in he glove box
And Mother Mary on the dashboard
He's a red-blooded blue-collar man
American right to the core

John Rich,"All you girls, readin' them rag magazines
Tryin' to figure out the male species
How to bring a boy down to his knees

Hey now girls, don't be believin' everythin' you read
It ain't as hard as they're makin' it seem
'Cause it don't matter if you're skinny or got meat on your bones
If you want to turn a country boy on

You got to jump up in his four wheel drive
Put them Wrangler jeans on and cut them off thigh high
Crank the Hank, find a football game and chug a beer ice cold
If you want to turn a country boy on

I don't know what's turnin' them city boys' heads
Probably high heels, short skirts and fishin' nets
All the ladies if you want to snag a down home man
I'll tell just how you can

You got to jump up in his four wheel drive
Put them Wrangler jeans on and cut them off thigh high
Crank the Hank, find a football game and chug a beer ice cold
If you want to turn a country boy on

First you got to jump up in his four wheel drive
Put them Wrangler jeans on and cut them off thigh high
Crank the Hank, find a football game, chug a beer ice cold

Hey, you got to jump up in his four wheel drive
Put them Wrangler jeans on and cut them off thigh high
Crank the Hank, find a football game and chug a beer ice cold
Hey, if you want to turn a country boy on
Turn a country boy on, turn a country boy on

You got to jump in his four wheel drive
You know what to do next
Put them Wrangler jeans on and cut them off thigh high

John Rich,"Mama said, ""Stay away from the train yard children
Don't be playin' on in the tracks
Those old big devils can sneak up on ya
And run you down just like that"", hey, hey

Well, little brother Jonah didn't heed her warnin'
Tried to chase a fast one down
I can still hear the words my mama was cryin'
As we laid him in the ground, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

She said, ""Why does somebody always have to die?
Before people listen and open up their eyes
There ain't no need for hurtin' or the bloody tears we cry
So why does somebody always have to die?""

Mr. White collar in an uptown high rise
Finishin' a twelve hour day
A double tall glass of tequila sunrise
Takes a little stress away, hey, yeah, hey, yeah

Well, he came around the corner doing 87
Swerving all over the place
He sent a five year old straight to Heaven
And never even touched his brakes, hey, yeah, hey, yeah

Why does somebody always have to die?
Before people listen and open up their eyes
There ain't no need for hurtin' or the bloody tears we cry
So why does somebody always have to die?

There once was a carpenter living in Nazareth
Said He was the Son of God
Said He came here to free the captive
And bring faith to the lost, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

Well, He tried to tell him all about life eternal
But they just wouldn't believe
And He said, ""Father, won't you please forgive them?""
As they nailed Him to the tree, hey, yeah, hey, yeah

Why does somebody always have to die?
Before people listen and open up their eyes
There ain't no need for hurtin' or the bloody tears we cry
So why does somebody, yeah why does somebody always have to die?
Always have to die

John Rich,"There’s a little girl
And she’s in for the fight of her life
Only six years old
Facing down the future, no fear in her eyes
Her mamma and daddy are praying down on their knees
For a miracle in Memphis
Lord won’t you help them please

For the kids, we’d trade all our tomorrows
And for the kids, we’d give our heart and souls
‘Cause they’re the heroes of our lives
Fighting to survive
So give all you can give
For the kids

And there’s a little boy
And he’s sittin’ in his daddy’s lap
He smiles and laughs
And covers his head in a St. Jude ballcap
It’s been a long battle but he’s gonna beat the odds
He’s gonna make it outta there ‘cause people care
And by the grace of God

For the kids, we’d trade all our tomorrows
And for the kids, we’d give our heart and souls
‘Cause they’re the heroes of our lives
Fighting to survive
So give all you can give
For the kids

And I sing for the ones
Whether far or near
We’ve got to lift
So we can give that all the world may hear
Music in their ears

For the kids, we’d trade all our tomorrows
And for the kids, we’d give our heart and souls
‘Cause they’re the heroes of our lives
Fighting to survive
So give all you can give
You gotta give all you can give
For the kids
Yeah, for the kids",For the Kids
John Rich,"What do you do when you're scared inside?
When all of your feelings just seem to collide
Emotions just seem to let go
All of your tears always follow
All of these things that you're feeling deep down
Then you realize that you're calling out loud

I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light, lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light, lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
Rescue me

What do you do when the path leads nowhere?
When you need someone to be there
Now you're afraid of what's gonna come
And now there's nowhere to run
All of these things that you're feeling deep down
Then you realize that you're calling out loud

I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light, lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love
I love Thee, rescue me
Shine Your light, lead me home
Lord, all I need is Your love

Lord, all I need is Your love
I love Thee, rescue me

John Rich,"She remembers when she first got her wings
And how she opened up the day she learned to sing
And then the colors came, erased the black and white
And her whole world changed, oh she realized

She's a butterfly, pretty as the crimson sky
Nothing's ever gonna bring her down
And everywhere she goes
Everybody knows, she's so glad to be alive
She's a butterfly

Like the purest light in a darkened world
So much hope inside such a lovely girl
You should see her fly, it's almost magical
It makes you wanna cry, she's so beautiful

She's a butterfly, pretty as the crimson sky
Nothing's ever gonna bring her down
And everywhere she goes
Everybody knows, she's so glad to be alive

God bless the butterfly,
Give her the strength to fly
Never let her wings touch the ground

John Rich,"Little boys and girls, livin' lost in the world
I guess their mommas and their papas just forgot how to love them
Sad people everywhere, thinkin' nobody cares
How we ever gonna reach, each and every one of them

Oh the complicated nature in the way this world revolves
Can trick us into thinkin' we've got problems we can't solve
We gotta get back to the basics, break it down to black and white
Take a little time to rewind and simplify

Open up your heart, just one little spark
Can ignite that fire that'll guide us to Heaven
Right here, right now, everybody sing loud
One by one, we can help them together

Oh the complicated nature in the way this world revolves
Can trick us into thinkin' we've got problems we can't solve
We gotta get back to the basics, break it down to black and white

John Rich,"If it weren't for kids have you ever thought
There wouldn't be no Santa Clause
Look what the store just brought
Thank God for kids

We'd all live in a quiet house
Without Big Bird or a Mickey Mouse
And Kool-aid on the couch
Thank God for kids

Thank God for kids there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Did you ever stop to think, or wonder why?
The dearest thing to Heaven is a child

A 'Daddy how does this thing fly?'
A hundred other where's and why's
I really don't know but I try
Thank God for kids

When I look down in those trustin' eyes
That look to me, I realize
It's love that I can't buy
Thank God for kids

Thank God for kids there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Did you ever stop to think, or wonder why?
The dearest thing to Heaven is a child

To thank the Lord for his guiding light
And pray they turn out right
Thank God for kids

John Rich,"A hundred miles out of Little Rock
Windshield full of rain
I-40 eastbound drivin' while I pray
She's asleep in the backseat
Holdin' tight to her teddy bear
She's got her daddy's smile and her momma's hair
And one word knocked our lives off track
Just one word keeps us comin' back

Across the Mississippi
A mile or two from Beale Street
Not too far from Graceland
Where the king of rock and roll sleeps
To a place for children
Where God sends his mercy rainin' down
In the heart of Memphis
Where angels hang around

All the deals that I made with God
The conversations that we've had
Tryin' to accept the things I could not understand
I wanna walk her down the aisle
While those church bells ring
See her get the chance
To live all her dreams
But one word knocked our lives off track
Just one word keeps us comin' back

Across the Mississippi
A mile or two from Beale Street
Not too far from Graceland
Where the king of rock and roll sleeps
To a place for children
Where God sends his mercy rainin' down
In the heart of Memphis
Where angels hang around

So sleep tight baby while these four wheels roll

When you get on the whiskey
Let somebody else drive 'cause I'm
Trying to sober up, sober up, sober up

In the six o'clock news

John Rocca,"My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on.
I need your strength, 
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
From this old world I try to hide my face,
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place.
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell,
in darkness with memories I know so well.
 
I need your love more than before,
I can hardly carry on anymore.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe, 
without you babe,without you babe,
My mind and soul have felt like this,
Since love between us no more exist.
And each time that darkness falls,
if finds me alone with these four walls.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.

John Roche,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
John Roche,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
John Roche,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel
John Rush,"Take a walk with me, let me show you things that no one else can see
Take a walk with me, where if you're willing anything can be
And then you'll realize you're not alone

Take a walk with me, feel The Mother's rhythm beating endlessly
Take a walk with me, hear her blood that's flowing gently to the see
And then you'll realize you're not alone

Take a walk with me, where there's no anger and no jealousy
Take a walk with me, if your mind is open then you will see
And then you'll realize you're not alone
And then you'll realize you're not alone

Just sit back now, let your mind be free
We'll take a trip somewhere inside, just you and me
Then we'll fly, we'll fly away
And then we'll fly, we'll fly away

John Ryder,"Once I believed that when love came to me
It would come with rockets, bells and poetry
But with me and you it just started quietly and grew
And believe it or not
Now there's something groovy and good
Bout whatever we got
And it's getting better
Growing stronger warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
I don't feel all turned on and starry eyed
I just feel a sweet contentment deep inside
Holding you at night just seems kind of natural and right
And it's not hard to see
That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be
Cause it's getting better
Growing stronger, warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
And just like a flower that takes time to bloom
This love of ours is taking time to grow
Ba da da da da da da da da da da da
And I don't mind waitin', don't mind waitin'
Cause no matter how long it takes
The two of us know
That it's getting better
Growing stronger, warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday.

And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call

He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

They never found her body, just her diary by the  bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'  she said, 'Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne?

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night
And if you go down by the water, you'll see her footprints in the sand

With a measure of faith that you need.

John Schneider,"I've been to California, where the ladies look so fine
They could take a long-haired country boy and softly bend his mind
Made love in New York City where they dress in silk and pearls
But Lord I swear there's nothing anywhere
That's better than a country girl

[Chorus]
'Cause country girls are sweeter'n a tube full of honey
And country girls are warmer than the Georgia sun
They know how to touch you, they know how to love you
Take you right out of this world
I'm so glad that God made country girls

There's women in Chicago in their high rise penthouse rooms
With fine champagne and other things you could drown in their perfume
But I'll take a night down in Mobile, just looking out across the bay
With a country girl lying next to me, taking my breath away

Yeah, I'm so glad that God made you country girls",Country Girls

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

I can tell by your eyes that the party is over,
You stood on the warf and you waved them goodbye;
Those neighbourhood boys, they took you for granted,
They took what they wanted and then they pushed you to one side;

There's a frozen moment in waving grain, food for a hungry world

At night I lie awake and worry and the debts go round and round
Furrows in my night time forehead,
And furrows on borrowed ground

There's and old galv shed with a laughing lean, it's kept the tractor dry
I remember the day when we knocked it up with stringy bark and fencing wire
The earthen floor's been beaten hard, where the rain hasn't cut a path
I'm frightened to look because I'm beaten too and the mice run through the chaff

And I lie on my bed, staring into the red 
And the overdraft won't come down
And it's hard work keeping your family together,
Living on borrowed ground

And I don't blame your brother, son, for moving into town

John Schumann,"The lady from the paper asked me would I write a song for you,
I didn't know you then but now I do.
And I'm stuck in this motel room with an empty aching heart,
And the miles roll out between us and they're tearing me apart…
All I've got are tunes and rhymes - this one's for you.

May you always feel the sunshine and take time to taste the rain,
May your friends be true and caring and I hope you are the same;
And in your fleeting passage, leave a little bit behind
For the children who will follow in your footsteps, along the sands of time.

I dreamed there was a world for you, without the rush of rockets
And the thump of khaki gunships in the sky…
But there were rows of eucalyptus and trains for little boys
And tadpoles in a still black creek and playgrounds full of noise;
In my vision, fear and greed and anger were the only things to die…

May the wind blow gently through your life, may your principles be strong;
May you stand up and be counted when they work out right from wrong…
May your nights be short and peaceful, may your days be warm and long;
May your music be a service…may they pause sometime and listen to your song

And here's this little voice, reaching down the phone,
""Dad you've been away so long, when are you coming home?""

May your eyes be filled with kindness, may the seeds of wisdom grow…
May you seek for truth and beauty and when you find it may you know…
May you help feed those who are hungry, and comfort those who hurt
May you always fright for justice for all of us who walk upon the earth",For the Children

And I won't go down in a firefight, with a red scarf around my head;
And I won't die a hero's death hanging from the gallow's arm;
I'll flicker out alone in an empty room with the needle hanging out of my arm.
And some day, somewhere, if there's justice, somewhere on this earth...

I met her in a rock and roll joint, where the carpet sticks to your shoes
The band was playing ""I'm Beginning to Lie: I've Been Here Too Long Blues"".
She said ""If we travel to together, there's got to be a highway code,""
She threw her Adidas bag in the back of the van and we scooted up Sydney Road

I guess I would have let it slide.

And they try to put the blame on you
You can only play with the cards that are in your hand…

A little out of Nelson Bay,

But things always happen in circles

Can you smile and say that you have been true?
Can you truthfully say with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet the angel of death?

When you'll be laid beneath the cold clay
The angel of death will come from the sky
And claim your first soul when the time comes to die

When your loved ones are gathered, gathered to weep

Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Mothers from Nashville
All their friends play music, and they ain't uptight
If one of the kids will
Because it's custom made for any mothers son
To be a guitar picker in Nashville
And I sure am glad I got a chance to say a word about
The music and the mothers from Nashville

John Sebastian,"I was down in Savannah
Eatin' cream and bannanas
When the heat just made me faint
I began to get crosseyed
I thought I was lost
I'd begun to see things as they ain't
As the relatives gathered to see what's the matter
The doctor came to see was I done
But the doctor said give him jug band music,
It seems to make him feel just fine

I was told a little tail about a skinny as a rail
L.A. put cowboy with a headache
He was hung up in the desert swappin' rats
And tryin' ta get a drink of water with his knees gettin' mud caked
And I'll tell you and exceptance how he stumbled into Memphis Tennessee
Hardly crawlin', lookin' dust baked
We gave 'im little water; a little bit of wine
He opened up his eyes but they didn't seem to shine
And the doctor said give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine

So if you ever get sickly
Get sister run quickly to the dusty closet shelf
And pull out a washboard; and play a guitar chord
And do a little do it yourself
Call on your neighbors to put down their labors
And come and play the hardware in time
'Cause the doctor said give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine

I was floatin' in the ocean
Greased with suntan lotion
When I got wiped out by a beach boy
He was surfin' when he hit me but jumped off his board to get me
And he dragged me by the armpit like a child's toy
As we staggerd into land with all the waitors eatin' sandwiches
We tried to mooch a towel from the hoi poloi
He emptied out his eardrums; I emptied out mine
And everybody knows that the very last line is
The doctor said give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine

And the doctor said give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine",Jug Band Music
John Sebastian,"You and me and rain on the roof
Caught up in a summer shower
Dryin' while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours
Waitin' out the sun

You and me were gabbin' away
Dreamy conversation sittin' in the hay
Honey, how long was I laughing in the rain with you
'Cause I didn't feel a drop 'til the thunder brought us to

You and me underneath the roof of tin
Pretty comfy feelin' how the rain ain't leakin' in
We can sit and dry just as long as it can pour
'Cause the way it makes you look makes me hope it rains some more

And the nameplate on the glass brought back twenty melodies 
And the scratches on the face 
Told of all the times he fell 
Singin' every story he could tell

Un final reñido ya no vuelvo a amar
Pero si domingo
Yo me juego entero ¿qué le voy a hacer? 

Por una cabeza todas las locuras
Su boca que besa borra la tristeza, cama la amargura

Por una cabeza si ella me olvida
Me importa perderme mil veces la vida
¿Para qué vivir?

John Skinner,"It's like a diamond ring
It's a precious thing
And we never want to lose it
It's like a favorite song that we love to sing
Ev'ry time we hear the music

And we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

It's like a rainy night and candlelight
And ooh, it's so romantic
We got the whole thing working out so right
And it's just the way we planned it

And we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

Don't you know we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
We got the kind that will last forever and evermore

John Skinner,"I was at the bar with my drinkin' team,
It was me Jack Daniels and my homey Jim Bean.
We were kinda blitzed and we were trying to behave Y'all
when in walked a soldier he was from the fuzzy naval.
We were fallin', stumbli'n, crawlin'
her come da police, Captain Tom Collins,
and the rapper said freeze
he said ""hands in the air and hand over your keys""
now we did, and that was kinda simple,
now here came Margarita and her friend Shirley Temple.
I asked my friend 'bout Margarita,
he said Shirley was a virgin and I wouldn't wanna meet her.
So I talked to Margarita, cause you, she was flyer
I took her to the coast cause I wanted to Screw Driver.
Now I'm not one for a speech,
but there was plenty of Tequila and Sex On The Beach, Y'all.

Here we go again and Im not fussin',
see I'm a French-Mexican but I can get with White Russians,
at the bar with a drink in my hand.
In walked Jose Cuervo what was margaritas man.
I talked to the wise man cause, yoh he's distinguished.
His name was St. Ives and he spoke in old English.
He said ""you'd better think fast,
cause Jose is kinda crazy and I heard he Shot Glas
He gave me some advice and it went like this:
""catch the night train and head up to 'cisco""
I didn't wanna stick around,
I caught the 1:51 to New York, the Grey Hound.
Now I'm at the Red Zone, everybody's stylin'.
Was sippin Ice Teas on Long Island.
I blacked out and the party came to a halt,
'Cause I was drinking the Tequila with the lemon assault Y'all

I woke up in the morning and felt like a Zombie,
the Tequila Gold Label had bombed me.
You see I woke up late and wasn't feelin' so great,
And Mike said there's a Bicardi party startin' at eight.
Yo we walked in the party and started playin our games,
we played tops, fuzzy quarters, with Bartles & James.
Here came Shirley Temple and they told me to chill,
because the Mickey Brothers took her up to strawberry hill.
They took her $1000 mink and she could barely think,
cause the Tequila that she drank had her tickled pink.
Now the music came on and I rocked the instrumental.
There's a groupie named Mai Tai, a fly oriental.
A groupie is a girl that jocks,
She wore the def Black Velvet and drank Scotch on the Rocks.
We had a fake marriage, now here's to honeymoon,
Ya zone vagabond and the Blue Lagoon.
Now everybody take a word from the wise,
A girly and a bottle, Tequila Sunrise.

You know it's always dark and dreary since I broke off, baby, with

I live on a lonely avenue,

I could die, I could die, I could die,

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Pull on over to the side of the road

And I can't hold my eyes
On the white line out before me
When your hand is on my collar
And you're talking in my ear

And I have been around
With a gypsy girl named Shannon
A daughter of the devil
It is strange that I should mention that to you
I haven't thought of her in years

For now the journey has begun
The soldiers marching one by one
With golden light and silver drums
For the battle they have come

Oh, and out of the sun
Come angels with guns
Oh, and out of the sun
Come angels with guns
Angels with guns

And there is thunder in the east
Mark the time that the wind released
The birds of prey that shadow Spain
Who stand a witness to the rain
And there is movement in the west
For they are gathering the blessed
Speaking as one

Oh, and out of the sun

John Stewart,"After the flames
When the fields are cold
And after the pain
When the heart is gold
You will find a brand new day
With the birds upon the wire
And all you really had to pay
Was the price of the fire

And in our younger days
You could say we were wild
In our hungry ways
The safety lines were filed
We were running on the rims
We were burning out the tires
And all we really had to pay
Was the price of the fire
Oh, all we really had to pay
Was the price of the fire

And the breakers of hearts
They don't escape pain
And you know when it starts
As you dive into the flames
And there's a voice that tells you run
But you call the voice a liar
For all you really had to pay
All you really had to pay
Was the price of the fire
Was the price of the fire",Price of the Fire

We were dreamers on the rise
We were the sun

For that kind of wind to blow
A long time ago
We were dreamers on the rise

And twice
We said we'd begin again
And we made a vow
That we'd remain as friends
And fallen down
We said we shall rise again

We were dreamers on the mend

Wishes came into my life

And we will hide for forty years if that's what's meant to be

And they'll let you hang a week or two 'fore they cut your body down

What I thought was real had not turned out to be
And I thought of giving up 
'Cause the pain was much to much
Tired of aching 

So I tried to close my eyes to the fear
Even tried to cry… was all out of tears
Then from somewhere up above
From a father made of love
To a lonely space in a breaking heart

You sent me an angel. Oh oh
Oh what an angel, yea yea
Someone to touch my very soul
Sing to my heart
So you sent me an angel oh oh
My very own angel, yea 
Just what I needed an angel

I can still recall the moment I first knew
That my heart had finally found a home in you
That my search was at an end 
And my only lover friend 
Was now here beside me
There was something in the smile on your face
Nothing in all the world could replace
When you held me in your arms
I was sure that all along

John Swana,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
John Swana,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

I'm thinking was I a boy when you wanted a man
There's been plenty of longing in this life
But none can compare to missing you

Your deep velvet kisses
Green translucent eyes
Shoulder length hair of a goddess
I want you
I want you
I want you near
Your lips gently parted
Frozen in time to mine
In visible stillness
Your love comes to mind
Just in time

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standing by

The lawyers dwell on small details

John Tesh,"Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our rice crispies
We can't hear anything at all

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today,
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street,
But all he ever thinks to do is watch,
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away there's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake

Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away

John Tesh,"Lay a whisper on my pillow,
leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows...",It Must Have Been Love

There's really nothin more to say

Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you
No, I never want to feel the pain
Of rememberin' how it used to be

Moonlight lady, hold my hands
And let me know you understand
When I say I need a friend
Stay here with me till the end

Deep in the heart of nowhere
I'm still on the lookout for a sign
That there's an answer in the cards

To guide me through the stars

John Travolta,"What would they say if we up and ran away
From the roaring crowd
And the worn out city faces
Would they carry on and on
When they found out we were gone
Or would they let us go
Would they tag along or would they just...

Leave us alone, wed live in the country
Leave us alone, wed make it just fine
Happy in a one-room shack
And wed not look back
Now would we

What would they do if they found out we were through
With the little lies and the downtown aggravations
That we traded them away for a quiet country day
That we had hoped to share
Would they try to find out where we were, or...

The real me that's inside hurtin'

The therapy, its just not workin'
And its only my imagination
Somethin' in mind
'Cause the only indication
Is I'm wastin' my time

An uphill climb without an ending
Although my life with you had ups and downs
Smiles and frowns, just pretending

Oh, you set my dreams to music
As you spend the whole night making them come true
And in my whole life
I have never had a dream as sweet as you

No-one else I ever knew
Touch me quite like you
Or say as much
Without a word now
Love, I'm hoping you can see a song's inside of me
That holds more love
Than any song you've heard, now

My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well Maybe just a half a drink more
Put some music on while I pour
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
C'mon baby

I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no

Gosh your lips look delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Never such a blizzard before

Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
Your eyes are like starlight now
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old out
Ah, but it's cold outside

Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way

They love me when I'm high
When they love me
I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me
I get money, I get money, I get money

I be gifted when I'm faded, faded all the time
Thought they loved me when I made it
Niggas hated all the time, it's a dirty game
Try to find a bitch, maybe get married
That's like pissin' in a freezer,
trying to make canaries
Hawk vision, LA heels right on Huff Terrace
Making wishes,
now I'm french kissing your bitch in Paris
Come and find me di Giannis that's from '92
Heard you spoil her ass
When I bought her a number two
Dipping and you know it,
I be pimpin like I owe it
Come and find me now, I got an army with me now
Turn your brains oodles and noodles
For thinking you got a screw loose
I tighten you up, them coroners will button you up

I'm gifted when I'm faded
I'm faded all the time
Because I know that's when they love me
They love me when I'm high
When they love me
I get money, I get money, I get money
When they love me
I get money, I get money, I get money

I'm gifted when I'm faded
I'm faded all the time

They love me when I'm high
When they love me

John Trones,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends

That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here

And you won't solve war with blood

John Van Deusen,"I've enclosed
The light in darkness
Enshrines the flower with a veil
Closes every hint beauty
Defends protect and steals
My attempts at communication
Every branch I try to reach
Simply cannot overtake it
Mobilize in my own distrust

I just want to understand her 
The way she moves
What makes her tick
The fog has momentarily blinded
Labyrinth walls have grown thick

All this work seems to be for nothing
But I know that is a lie
For her smile hints with a shade of twilight
Character screams with a breathless sigh

Quickly stumble into her conscious
Listen intently to all the words
Gently lowering my bridges
In hopes of touching her
And unclear the window
To her emotions
Feature of this crooked smile
Perfect in all its incompletion
Think can we crash into her now
Into her room

I am frantic
And limitations
Feverish intents all flamed
Impassioned by the glory in this
Angered in the knowledge that
In time this worldly love will fail me
Everything I grip will fall
But she defies all blank suspicion
Eye contact we make and she smiles
She smiles

Open the doors to my obsession
Built it of this painted picture
Judgement retires for the night
All I have left is this
Brilliant creature here beside me
Lovely in every single way

God was attentive when he made here
Guess I'll blame this all on him
All on him

I am frantic
And limitations
Feverish intents all flamed
Impassioned by the glory in this
Angered in the knowledge that
In time this worldly love will fail me
Everything I grip will fall
But she defies all blank suspicion
Eye contact we make and she smiles

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Beware my foolish heart

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
John Vanderslice,"My bed was floating in the ocean
A swarming jellyfish pulled us over the surface
The sun, the sun was crying diamonds
For every broken masthead
And scotch taped sail that passed us by

We hung on, hung on
Two orphan monkeys
And all we said and all that we did
Left me feeling like a little kid

Confuse, confusion boats bumping
Against, against slowly bleeding wanting eels
And if you dream of dolphins
Of tattooed fish in milky seas
And if you dream of levitating
There is a word you should be saying to me

",Confusion
John Vanderslice,"Do you remember the man?
Standing in front of the tanks that
Rolled on Tianamin Square
He just stood there

They found him hiding under the floorboards
They yanked him out
And shot him twice in the head

No he was never caught,
They smuggled him out to America
He doesn't want to talk about it
He's got a new name
He lives in Maclean, Virginia

Trying to talk sense to

For me everything changed

Understand I was very high,
I just quit my job, no I just got fired
The day she died for me everything changed

Could've been the blood in her matted hair,
Or how regrets of the dying are added to the air

They drop me off in a thicket of reeds

He stands in a thicket of reeds,
No food, cell, or GPS,

Next day you gotta set sail
In your 350 Ford

you were my fiji,
O believe me
Those hours with you they
Only expand
O you, you were my fiji
O believe me

Somebody else's sand
Somebody else's dry land

Took my shipmates into the sea.

Rain down bullets in flight, white light,
Barefoot boys run for your lives.”

John Vanderslice,"June July I went home to live with my mom
At night I sat out to watch cicadas on the lawn
June July, confusion tennessee
Here sherman's army leveled troops in 1863

now those battlefields are marked and paragraphed
And maintained by national park service trust

at night I walked through those fields
Looking for proof of death, echoes of wounded soldier appeals
Tonight the rain clouds are pressing down
Hovering low, warning me to go back home

I saw lightning flicker in the clouds
One and two thousand, better turn around

light was focused down on me
White spike cracked and threw me to the ground

when I awoke the sun was streaming over the fields
Warming the ground soaked with summer rain",June July

And split your head on the dock
I couldn't bear to see

Your husband donnie
Is pure fear
So I stay clear

With apocalyptic sound
On the charge of iron wheels
And the crash of horses heels

Rise like lions after a slumber in
In greatly unknowable numbers
Free the blood that must ensue
We are many and they are few

From the workhouse and the prison
Pale as corpses newly risen
Knives are drawn now let them see
Standing tall that say they're free

Your strong and simple words
Set to wound as sharpened swords
Wide as targets let them be
With their shade to cover me

A couple miles from here
My family rented me this house
So my family keeps me near

from 1909
My family's run the town
You step out of line, poor sap
Family council will sit you down

one day I fell in love
And of course we fucked around
The morning she threw up
My options were all laid out

I followed through
And now I got two sons
No peace even when you come
‘cause they won't let you run

I got dead drunk
And packed up the pickup truck
Got way out of town, I thought
But sheriff tracked me down

they dragged me home
And the family sat me down

“we'll never let you run.”",They Won't Let Me Run

Up above the sea
The streaming clouds
Tore into my tranquility

Out my window
I could see
A bird drop down
On the branches of my apple tree

Everyday the bluebird comes down
And stares at me for hours
Can't figure out if he brings me luck
Or if he's trying to tear me down

I bought a rifle
With a Bushnell scope
Knowing the answer would be
To see if he's calm or frightful

Over the sea
I staked out and waited
Like so many gunmen before me

And stares at me for hours

Ain't it just like Verlaine 
To be dancin' in the streets
I know what I need this time
Me and my girl together

John Waite,"Ain't it beautiful
Don't it make you feel complete
It comes into your life
Then sweeps you right off your feet

Time stands still for two lovers
And it's intangible
But it hits like steel
It stops me in my tracks

Makes my private world unsealed
A crashed car
A communication failsafe 
We could share this vision

In fact we've got no choice
Into the arena of love
Speaking with one voice 
Ain't it something else

Like skydiving into Shangri-la
And the clearest cool is the zeal-blue heaven
And you can't quite put your finger on it
And you could be anywhere

Anytime anyplace in your lover's arms
Could be paradise or walkin' on thin ice 
We can share this vision
We're on some one-way street

Exchanging cigarettes and glances
We both feel the heat 
It's a love collision
Love collision

There's no decision
It's a love collision 
If I close my eyes
Visualizing you and I somewhere in this city

And moments of desire
The steady the silent gaze of lovers transfixed 
We could share this vision
In fact we've got no choice

Into the arena of love
Speaking with one voice 
It's a love collision
Love collision

And there's no decision
It's a love collision 

Love collision
Love collision 
Love collision 
Love collision 
Love collision 
Love collision 

Oh no
Love collision 
Love collision

John Waite,"Three years come
I'm still alone and you're so lonely
I look in the mirror
I see those lines on my face
All of my dreams are gone
Flyin' with the starlings
But they were not stolen gems
Colored glass I can replace
You've got a restless heart
Restless change is blowing
Through your life
Tears in your eyes
Tears in the books that I've been reading
I don't understand you now
And I never did
But I still love your restless heart
Days into nights
Nights into days
Lights flicker 'round me
And down to the shore I walk
I'm haunted by your face
Ungracious moves I've made
Just like a broken dancer
If I could get you back
They are steps I would retrace
You've got a restless heart
Restless change is blowing through your life
Tears in your eyes
Tears in the books that I've been reading
I don't understand you now
And I never will
But I still love your restless heart
Three years come
You're still alone and I'm so alone
And I would give anything
To feel my heart beat again
I wouldn't say that I've been losin' time
I've been dreaming
And I'd give up anything to keep you as my friend
You've got a restless heart
Restless change is blowing through your life
Tears in your eyes
Tears in the books I've been reading
I don't understand you now
And I never did
But I love you
And I know you've got a restless heart
(Restless heart)
I know you've got a restless heart (in you)
(Restless heart)
I know (in you)
You got a restless heart (heart)

You got a restless heart (in you)
I know it (heart)

John Waite,"These days I feel I'm fightin'
Everything in sight
I'm fighting for my freedom
For my life 

Some bigshot with the money
Puts my back against the wall
The red brick's waiting
For another bullet hole 

There's a Blitzkrieg on the border
It's a sexual pleasure/pain
I'm staring down an empty glass
Til the violence starts again 

It's the big time for love
It's the big time
It's the right time for love
It's the big time for your love 

The queen is in the palace
But my sister's in the rain
Neon girls and gunshots
Tickin' through my brain 

They give you some detection
Bread and circus in your bed
A calculated showdown
It's very graphic bloodshed 

Better put your house in order
There's a fireball in the sky
Kiss the wife and kids so long
Kiss your ass goodbye 

It's the big time for love
It's the big time
It's the right time for love
It's the big time for love

This time it is
It's the big time
It's the right time for love
It's the big time for your love 

We feel overdue
'Cause we know what it feels like
There's no more 
No white flag

And communication too 
It's the big time for love
It's the right time
It's the time for love

It's the big time for love
This time it is
It's the big time
It's the right time for love

Call a truce or forget it
Big time for love",Big Time for Love

John Waite,"She's got everything I want
Got my world in a tight black dress
Keeps me on my feet and walking
Keeps my heart alive 

I look up at the moon
To see her looking down on me
And it's a magic carpet ride
To a place that fate decides 

And everytime we go around the world
We feel like we're millionaires
We get what we want
We know who we are

And these days we just don't care 
She's the one
She's the one in my heart
She's the one

And we are never apart
Oh 
It's got me on my knees
The sun is burning through our sky

Like quicksilver in my mind
Every time she fills my eyes 
My world's a pinball in a groove
And we're shooting for the highest score

My reason is desire
That this key could fit the door 
We go around the world
We feel like we're millionaires

We get what we want
We know who we are
And these days we just don't care 
She's the one

She's the one in my heart
She's the one
And we are never apart
She's the one

Queen of hearts
For a jack of spades
I'm the one
She could never betray

No 
She's all I want to see
Got my world inside her dress
Cut me to ribbons

Leaves me down
Love's life voids the rest
I'm still looking at the moon
And she's gazing down on me

Take me anywhere you want
It's all the same to me 
Everytime we go around the world
We feel like we're millionaires

We know who we are
We get what we want
And these days we just don't care

John Waite,"I remember when you whispered low
I will go with you wherever you go
Then I went and found someone new
No one ever made me feel the way that you do 

Sometimes you don't know
When to hold on or when to let go
Sometimes you don't know
Sometimes 

Then I came home one day
Your best friend told me you'd gone away
Had enough of my wild mispent youth
Now the tears in my eyes are the only truth

I made my choice
And when it all comes down
It all comes down on me

With my back against the wall
Won't you play me some Chuck Jackson
And watch those blue shadows fall

I'm free but I am alone

It's time to raise the roof
And shout it in the street
It's time to take command

It's time to make a stand
Yeah
Don't need a uniform
To know which side I'm on

Don't need a set of rules
To know what's right or wrong
I've been an outcast
In your eyes and to the law

The right hand takes away
The left hand asks for more
But we all know the score

They took me to the dentist
I had a toothache

Heard a hundred angels
flying past him
What a gas

Sitting there
The same little boy with a few more years
Took a sniff of this
A taste of that

What a drag
Nothing there

And heard you didn't talk

Saw the writing on the wall

Running off its reel inside my mind
As I try to fall asleep tonight
On prescription lullabies
In the darkness there's a doorway
That leads me back to you forever 
But these days there's only
You and I in photographs
Ambitions and dreams we've shared
Now I wonder who has got the last laugh 
Cause I know you're crying
And you know I'm cold inside
Got no expectations for my pride
And I reach for that glittering prize 
I remember on our wedding day
Looking back at you
Our eyes met and we said goodbye
As we both said ""I do""
Didn't I make a promise baby
I would stand by you forever 
But sometimes the best-laid plans
Flare up and blow away
And fairytale logic comes
Sweeps you heart 
Your soul' your world away 
Cause I know you're crying
And you know I'm cold inside
And I'm tired of living with that lie
And now time is flying
And you know I miss that fire
But I feel for you
I've got desire
So I reach for that glittering prize 
No doll's house dreams
Or valentines
Just the future at the door
Just leaving trains and empty rooms
A broken band of gold
Cause love don't live here anymore 
And some nights I'll come and see you
And I know you'll let me in
Two strangers in silence now
Cause you know in love
We could never win 
I know you're crying
And you know I'm cold inside
And I'm tired of living with this lie
These days
Cause now time is flying
And you know I miss that fire
Cause I feel for you
I've got desire
Baby baby 
In my world (in your world tonight)
Reach for that glittering prize (in my world)
That's all I ever seemed to do (in your world tonight)
Was reach for the glittering prize (in my world)
I lost myself when I lost you (in your world tonight)

And I hope that all your dreams come true (in your world tonight)

These rights we hold precious
Say it loud enough

And the hours go by so fast
And you find a lot of wisdom there

They all just slip away

John Waite,"You say there's nothing wrong
With the lessons that your learning
The school of the streets
You'll kick next year
Skateboarding hollywood and vine
Yeah
You're a spaced out face in a crowd
You're 17 and shooting
The cars slow down to check you out
And your tattered freak flag flies
For sale, your habit
Where to? let's go!
I know
Out on the internet tonight
Deals made
Between the strangers
In green lights
No names
No touch no feel humanity
You and your suicide life
In a cardboard mansion sleeping
Out there just beneath the freeway
On a broken bottle carpet
Snoring now
The lord of the universe

A burnt out acid tripper
Yeah yeah yeah
A symbol and a brush stroke
And a barstool for a throne

And poet cops alright alright
New names
And tie dyed blissed out humanity
You and your suicide life

Yeah baby
Have a nice day
At the heart of all this darkness
You got a crush on venus big time
Nodding out into a wet dream

It was then that you betrayed me

John Waite,"Everytime I think of you, I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
And I'm wonderin' why you left
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinkin' about you, and it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you, no matter what I might say

There's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight

[Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you, no matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sending out, like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance, stop this heartbreak overload

And spend some time alone, yeah
To a big house in the country
To a private yacht with wall street on the phone
And a million dollar paradise
Maybe I could sing a better song

I've found something different now
And I finally understand
That money gets you everywhere
It slips straight through your hands

Yes, it's love that makes the world go round
And it's nationwide, from town to town
It's got me coming up and going down
And it makes everything alright, yeah
I'd give you what I got and that's a start, oh yeah
To get next to you and the keys to your heart

There's something going on here
Something going on behind your eyes
You got me feeling kind of nervous
With that Mona Lisa smile

And maybe I could get a steady job
Bring home the bacon 9 to 5
See I'd do anything to win you
Anything at all, I've got my cards
Down on the table, baby, we could have a ball

Yes, it's love that makes the world go round
And it's nationwide, from town to town
It's got me coming up and going down
And it makes everything alright, yeah
I'd give you what I got and that's a start, oh yeah

To the same old house alone
And in the silence of these empty rooms
I take shelter from the storm
But I brought a paint box
And some brushes to pass the time
Since you've been gone
It's a portrait of a broken man
And the colors always run

A figure in a landscape
It's a work of art, you'll see
A figure in a landscape
It's a masterpiece of loneliness, that's me

Well I climb the stairs in this haunted house
To find your spirit everywhere
With the bright stars on the rooftops
And my old friend the moon is there
But I can't quite get the colors right
See I'm reaching for the deepest blue
It's a one man show, I'm free again
But still belong to you

And I stand there in the kitchen light
With your ghost and memories
Got what I wanted I got my freedom
But I miss you still

John Waite,"Thinking about old times
Thinking about the things we said
All the worthless games and lies
I'm looking at myself
And the mirror's unkind
You're inside my mind
And you're outside my eyes

And I'm looking for something
That's real in my life, something true, yeah!
And I'm looking for something to hold on to
But I guess it won't be you

Thinking about
Thinking about
Thinking about you all the time
You're on my mind
But this song is not for you

Of all the things I could've done
I walked right out the door
Left like a loaded gun
Into the street
And these new days drag on
Through the long afternoon
I'm smashed and Flintstones are on TV

Repeat

Yeah well sometimes I wake up round midnight
With you wreathed around my skull
Like a halo of lies most of the time
And I'm in denial coming down from the ceiling
I was just your stepping stone
You burned out all my feelings

Chorus out



",Thinking About You
John Waite,"We've seen a lifetime since we met
Through good and bad
And things we won't forget
Forgotten promises and broken vows
But we always made it through somehow
But the key to you is broken in the lock
And a simple band of gold is all we've got

It's in the things that I can't say
That tear us both apart
But if you keep listening
You'll hear inside my heart of hearts

Darling, the simple things are hard to say
And darling the words get in the way
The poet sees the world through rhymes
But only says so much
See darling, the words are in my touch
The meaning's in my touch

And maybe there's something I should say
To make everything that's wrong Ok
A simple phrase, a sonnet from a play
But a man can only say so much these days
And we're drifting to the deep end of the lake
Trying to make good on our past mistakes

And I know you're tired
But heaven's here and now
I've got no explanation
Words are worthless to me now

Darling... etc

Why do lies make my love stronger

John Waite,"If you're traveling to north country fair
Where the winds hits heavy on borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Hope you see her hairs hanging long
It flows and rolls all down her breast
Please see for me that if her hair is hanging long
Ohh that is the way I remember her best

If you go when the snowflakes fall
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
See for me she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

So if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hits heavy on the borderline
Remember me the one who loves that
She once was a true love, true love of mine

John Waite,"Jenny's sitting in the car
In the middle of some abandoned Shoney's parking lot
Ripping off the filters off her cigarettes
Crying, he loves me, loves me not

She checks her makeup in the rearview mirror and turns the radio on
It hasn't hit her yet
But all she's looking at is another lonely night coming on
Everybody learns the hard way

The hard way about love
It's easy to think that there's something better out there somewhere
But make no mistake
Everybody learns the hard way about love

Meanwhile across town Tommy's in a dark bar watching some blonde girl shaking all she's got
Out on the tiles, out on the edge
He's gonna give it his best shot
All that hard earned money ever got him was all alone

It's two in the morning and the only thing that's falling is the rain
And it's a long walk home
Everybody learns the hard way
The hard way, yeah

The hard way about love
It's easy to think that there's something better out there somewhere

As the dayshift turns to night
In the Empire diner dreaming
Hard rain, fluorescent lights
As the waitress fills my coffee cup
And the working girls go by
Drenched Irish Cops are dreaming sex
And peep show alibis

Everything underneath the skyline
From the east side to the west
I see the miracles in real time
And there's one I've loved the best
See there's an angel on the D train
As she's flying to my world
And I'm waiting for a New York City girl

Times Square looks like Avalon
In a Disney morphine dream
Dylan Thomas rides a white horse drunk
At the counter next to me
I wake up in the bed sometimes
And watch her as she sleeps
In the silence and the sirens
I pray her soul to keep

The Catherine wheel burns bright tonight
Down on the avenue
But nowhere near as bright, my love
As the fire that burns for you

And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute son""

And he said, ""Yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she says is much too white
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""
He says, ""Hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done""

But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now the Rovin' gambler he was very bored
He was tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor

Infinite Creator, the Truth, the Life, the Way
And it seems like such a shame
To find the name above all names in such a cold unholy place

Of all the places for the Lord of Lords
Of all the places for a King
Of all the places for deity to be
Who would imagine that He would come to this place for me?

Cruelly they mocked Him and they nailed Him to a beam
Father, forgive them was the whisper of Calvary
How could they just stand
And watch the Great I Am dying for man?

Of all the places for the Lord of Lords
Of all the places for a King
Of all the places for deity to be
Who would imagine that He would come to this place for me?

In the rubble of my life He found what was left of me
He entered in and bound up the wounds that tortured me
And I was so amazed to see Him face to face
Oh, amazing is His grace, yeah

Of all the places for the Lord of Lords
Of all the places for a King
Of all the places for deity to be
Who would imagine that He would come to this place for me?

John Wayne,"When Liberty Valance rode to town
The womenfolk would hide, they'd hide
When Liberty Valance walked around
The men would step aside

'Cause the point of a gun was the only law
That Liberty understood
When it came to shooting straight and fast
He was mighty good

From out of the East a stranger came
A law book in his hand, a man
The kind of a man the West would need
To tame a troubled land

'Cause the point of a gun was the only law
That Liberty understood
When it came to shooting straight and fast

Many a man would face his gun
And many a man would fall

When he should go, stay on
Just trying to build a peaceful life
Where love is free to grow

But the point of a gun was the only law
That Liberty understood
When the final showdown came at last
A law book was no good

Alone and afraid, she prayed that he'd
Return that fateful night, oh that night
When nothing she said could keep her man
From going out to fight

From the moment a girl gets to be full grown
The very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other
Only one returns

Everyone heard two shots ring out
The shot made Liberty fall

 And I wonder as I wander by the river 
 Where my love has flown 
 All the birds in the cottonwood above her 
 Know I love her 
 Know I care 
 But my dreams, like the songs, she sang in Spanish 
 Seem to vanish 
 In the air

 So I wonder as I wander

 Must I live ever after

He says 'I've never believed in you anyway'
He says 'Now what the hell do you want to lecture me for
To keep the approaching years at bay?'
And as the curtains opposite open slight
They see a front door slam
And God the Father to His chosen Son
Shouts 'Be saved or You'll be damned'
And the years go past
Nothing changes 'cept the date
This time, it's just the same as the last
It's always just too late
He smashed the car again last night
And he can't bang out the dent
He was trying to pull down the biggest monument

Wallpaper medals decorate the soldiers
But the memories have peeled away
Well people fight, they come and go like politicians
So proud to have nothing to say
Well there were moving pictures on the news at ten
Why they rioted, it's a mystery
Well let's play tin soldiers at Goose Green
I never said we learned from history
And the years go past
Nothing changes 'cept the date
This time, it's just the same as the last
It's always just too late

One of the soldiers was bent
He was trying to pull down the biggest monument

Eyes light in the twilight twilight
Dusk of a late-night bar, late-night bar
Well they both believe in love at first sight
Provided you can't see the scars
And mummy did it and his daddy too
Otherwise how could they be here
Will you have me in sickness and in health
Til death do us part and we'll get divorced next year
And the years go past
Nothing changes 'cept the date
This time, it's just the same as the last
It's always just too late
He got smashed again last night
His hard-earned money came and went
He just tried to pull down the biggest monument

Yesterday in tomorrow's world
They invented the wheel again
Someone died in Hollywood
And then he was proclaimed King of the Insane
And tomorrow it's in the papers
The next day it's on the news
And it all happened just like this before
You know I'm starting to get confused
Yeah and the years go past
Nothing changes 'cept the date
This time, it's just the same as the last
It's always just too late

We still can't afford the rent

You can buy the old showbills and frame them, they're nearly antiques
You can trip up on his big clown shoes as you're starting to speak

But there aren't any dances today, the pavilions have all been pulled down

John Wesley Harding,"I was standing on a corner kicking my heels
Had my coat buttoned up beneath my chin
And I saw in some girl's eyes, she thought I was making deals
There was just me and the clock struck out 
I was looking for something to scream and shout about
So I took a train and I went back home
There was no one to tell so I didn't telephone

The sea made angry faces, the waves were getting high
Saw them kicking down onto the front
And the cars dodged the water that was flooding on by

I saw kids smoking chain on their way back from school
A tramp got reckless in the center of town
He was talking about Jesus as the sun went down
A lifetime of sorrows, he was ready to drown
A lifetime of sorrows, I think he was going to drown

Well I hit this bar where I used to hang out
Talked to the guy behind the bar, then dropped a few names
He didn't know what I was talking about
So I put my money down and I shot some pool
Beat two punks, I was feeling cool
A couple of girls started to flirt 
And I felt really old as they tugged my shirt
And I walked outside as they hurled some dirt at me
I walked outside as they hurled dirt at me

Went to visit Helen by St. Helen's Park

Taken all the light bulbs and the decorative wheel clamps

You looked like death to the gathered throng

Lost and lonely, hurt and happy
With a singer's vanity

Now everything seems like a myth
The strength that I have performed with
Two thousand stairs and there's no lift
Gonna get to the top and there's no if
What's for me when I get there
Is it just wheelchairs and grey hair
And never was one letter sent
I told the truth but told it bent
That's the custom that's the law
But don't ask me the reason for
I'm just a boy in love with you
I'm rejected by the things you do

John Wesley Harding,"Bob Dylan is my father, Joan Baez is my mother
And I'm their bastard son
Though my roots show through I'm just twenty two
I don't belong to anyone
When the band was disbanded, I was disowned
I got a number you can ring me on but I ain't got no phone
Got a forwarding address, baby I ain't got no home
I got no direction home
That's the style of a bastard child
This is the song of a bastard son

Uncle Lenny used to make me laugh
Took away my nightmares, tore my daydreams in half
Showed them to me reflected upside down
In the mirror that Suzanne Vega found
Lenny's still doing his tricks today
Only goes to show that growing up might pay

Bruce and James were family friends
Took my mind to Carolina through the New Jersey bends
Gave me a harmonica when I was three
Nailed a banjo to my knees
Now Bruce is a foreman and James is a slave
Bruce gave in and James just gave up

My family didn't grow up too well with technology
And I think this is why they disowned me
But now I wanna get back into the fold
I don't wanna be a black sheep, I don't wanna grow old
Here's to Warren, Neil, T-Bone, Andy, Lou, Townes, Elliott
Tom, Steve, Elizabeth, Elvia, Dave
You're singing something good and it's gotta be saved
I think so!

I've only just started playing guitar and already they say
I'm a has-been
Say my songs are too long, words are too strong, shoes
Aren't clean
See the synthesizer's broken, the 12 inch does not exist
It's gonna take a blessed life to get on to the hit list
I'm gonna need a blessed life to get on to the hitlist
But I'm singing for the men, for the women and the kids
Who grew up like me with seven basic instincts hid

John Wesley Harding,"The streets are doing a wardance
As their sight is restored to the blind
And I'm sifting trash on the offchance
That there might be something to find
And mary lets her fingers do the walking
Her baby's nearly due
She's listening but no-one's talking
At the citizen's advice bureau
And joe is down on the dole-queue
He should have signed on yesterday
Even if he was a carpenter and she was his lady
He still wouldn't be able to make it pay
No

And he don't believe in angels
She's been seeing another man
Infidelity runs in the family
But that wasn't a part of the plan
And shepherds watch the flicks by night
At the king's cross all night show
Something's trying to catch their eyes
But they're too grossed out to know
And the three kings travel like three ships a-sailing
They've got some gifts he'll need
Cocaine for sniffing, money for corruption, and a whole load of videos of I love lucy

But the king of the country he's getting frightened
He doesn't want to be another man's pawn
And he crushes the beer can between his hands
He sees his fate, the clown yells checkmate
And another star is born

But the baby is killed in an instant
As though his whole life were a dream
Though his book sells well and he pulls out the stops
Everyone knows he's a hyped-up hasbeen

And the t-shirts just embarrass
And thought become memories after a while
He's looking so much older now
It's hard to belive that that was style
And he throws his cloak out to his fan
It's his last chance sacrifice
The girls are crawling a cut-glass sea
No-one even wants to look twice
Cos the circle's all but full now
But the stalls are empty for the latest son
Who just smiles and says
Give my regards to fleet street, I've gotta run

The streets are doing a wardance
As their sight is restored to the blind
And I'm sifting trash on the offchance
That there might be something to find... 
 

",Bridegroom Blues
John Wesley Harding,"There are so many sides to every story
And this is mine
A dirty pair of hands sometimes has to come clean
And now is the time
I just couldn't see love's great defection
Now it's flourishing in one dimension
Love went over the wall
Was it pushed or did it fall? 

The official story was a 60/40 split
Cut with a knife
But now that I'm ghostwriting your autobiography
This ought to be your life
You wouldn't have to be a great detective
To see the things you do to me are self-reflexive
They bounce right back from me
Cos I'm a human trampoline

Seem now, it's so hard to take
Heart to hearts that were heart for heart's sake
Now cupid only watches darts
Love is just the sum of it's parts

Together we were a perfect circle
I think that we should get back again
I'll hold you close and we'll roll all the way
Down to lover's lane
We're just two sides of a vulgar fraction
Waiting for a little love interaction
When the borderline will fall
Without you I mean half of nothing at all

Looking back it seems like fake
Heart to hearts that were heart for hearts sake
I should have known right from the start
I want you know, I want the fake
I learnt the laws and found it's just give and take
(you give and I take)
I've got the guts, I will restart
And love is only the sum of it's parts
Love is the sum of it's parts
Yes it is.
",Fifty Fifty Split
John Wesley Harding,"With half an eye on history
And half an ounce of hope
Sold his soul in the vestry
Money for old rope
Been this way a million times
But now his time is nigh
He steps into the spotlight
He wants to say 'hi
Hello, we're so glad you came
You've never seen me before'
He's so ambitious, he's so game
But yesterday he was dressed the same
Then he was so much easier to ignore
Here comes the groom
But the world's not an inn and there isn't any room for you
But here he comes

He married into money
Just to kiss and tell
He ripped the contract open
He's out of his shell
He looks into a mirror
Practising his poise
But it reflects so badly
The groom just gets annoyed
He gasps, he forgets his lines
He's never done that before
The scientists say he's doing fine
This fumbling frantic frankenstein
Soon he's gonna do the dinosaur
Here comes the groom

His fingers are on the cliff edge
His head is going under
Is that applause? 
No that's just thunder....
Why do you keep saying I do? 
What does the bride mean to you? 

Play me some puccini
Make it heavy on the strings
Walk me to the altar
The choir can't even sing
Right side for the photographs
Left side for the kids
God made me do it
So that's what I did
He coughs, loosens his bow-tie
You've never seen him before
He kisses the bride, oh you know why
Love's one more thing you can buy
He was unfaithful before he went outdoors
(and now he's in the graveyard)
Here comes the groom.....

",Here Comes the Groom
John Wesley Harding,"I can tell when you're telling lies
I can see it in your smiling eyes
I can't help when you're telling lies
I can see it in your lack of surprise
I can see just where the truth doesn't lie
Watching you cut through the bind that ties

Once upon a time a story with a happy end
But that's all in the past now, it's all around the bend
You can't appease me now, those hopeless things you send
And you can't please me now and we can't start again
There's too much history, and no clean sheets
When I get to hear his story, it puts my feet to sleep
It's all romantic nothing about a heart in a rage
Murdered by some cartoon villain who ripped out the last page

(chorus)

Happy ever after, a prince apparent and his bride
All his disarming charm and her unfaithful side
He's scouting for success and she's his girl guide
The day the die was cast, it was the day I died
And now your hips are up for grabs and now the chips are down
I could be jetting with the set instead of with this clown
You want it to be unabridged, all bridges should be burnt
Sometimes you must recross them, that's something you never learnt

(chorus)

There are some tricks you can't pull
I mean the wool that is
Over my eyes
That's what happens when lookng for love
Becomes a game of I spy

I know you're combing someone's hair, or someone's soothing you
A lie may well fool someone else but it tells the truth
About you to you

(chorus) 
 

",I Can Tell (When You're Telling Lies)
John Wesley Harding,"It's so easly to forgo, so hard to forget
So hard for to realise that I'm not dead yet
When everything that we wanted is beyond beyond
And all that I hoped for is long dead gone

So how can I sleep in this memory bed
Where I feel like a grave with a tomb for a bedhead
With your name and my name carved deep in the stone
Now faded away cos we're long dead gone

We're long dead gone, long dead gone
Now faded away because we're long dead gone

And love lies bewildered, checking its pulse
To see if it compares to anything else
And two things still beating, but never as one
And one thing lies choking cos it's long dead gone

So here rests in pieces
Whatever it was that we could admit to
Whatever it was that was me and you

So why won't I just let it die and get rid
Of the truth that we both would've rather kept hid
Better to live a lie than pretend that you're not
And to live out a love that is long dead gone

It's long dead gone, long dead gone
Don't live out a love which is long dead gone
Never live out a love that is long dead gone
Don't live out a love which is long dead gone 
 

",Long Dead Gone
John Wesley Harding,"In the movie of your life
They'll get some real jerk to be you
Edited so he can act
Cast because of his tvq
In the movie of your life
You'll be less famous than he is
That'll be a strange turn of events
You'll be a cameo amongst the rushes

And you're learning all the lines
Though it was you who said them in the first place
Since then someone wrote them down
To pay for his new beach space
There's all these things you can't recall
And things you know you didn't say
But in the move of your life
The truth just flirts and runs away

And it's so plain to me
You're happy with this parody
But in a glittering instant you hold the light so we can see
That your joke's become your reality

All your tricks so limp and tame
You said you were a stage magician
But it's only moths in light
Heaven burnt out in collision
It's only seats that they're booking
In the movie of your life
The truth won't get a look-in

(chorus)

Everyone knows that you're divine so we await your resurrection
And they say that you'll be just fine
After you dry out on the critical clothesline

And you know it's all made up
How come your face has ceased to be you?
All your doubts and greatest fears
They will be confirmed at the preview
Celluloid has shaped the day
And put the cat amongst the coughers
One business lunch on drugs
Now you're waiting for the next big offer

Give you the evil eye or verbal abuse

To fundamental truths that we hold as lies

John Wesley Harding,"Midweek and we reached scarlet town
I was almost dying of thirst
We parked the car in some old schoolyard
The windscreen caked in dirt
There was no water in the engine left
No tread upon the tyres
The electrics were broke 'cause you went mad
You ripped out all the wires
Across the road, a small cafe
In this state of disrepair
You went for papers and a shave
So I saved you a chair
I knew it wasn't the journey's end
And that your dream was incomplete
But I just could not stand anymore
I was dead upon my feet
I was dead upon my feet

There's nothing there in the market square
But the ghost of the scarlet town crier
I was dead upon my feet
I sing the red rose and the briar
I sing the red rose and the briar

The waitress told me her life story
She'd always meant to up and go
She wiped a cup on her red pinafore
As we waited for you to show
And I told her just a little of you
But left the picture incomplete
You still weren't there to paint it in person
So I skipped out on the street
I skipped out on the street
The newsagent grinned, he said yes you'd been in
You bought a local paper and some shades
The washroom attendant said that you'd freshened up
That you'd left but you hadn't paid
And I couldn't figure out where you were
So I went back just to look near the car
There was nothing there where it should have been
Just oil on dirt and tar
Just oil on dirt and tar

There's nothing there in the market square
But the ghost of the scarlet town crier
And there was nothing there where it should have been
I sing the red rose and the briar
I sing the red rose and the briar

I saw it parked way down the street
In a garage off on the right
And a man said 'get your hands off son'
I just traded that wreck for a motorbike
There was nothing left of mine inside
Not even the broken radio
And I couldn't figure out where that left me
So I went back to look for rose
The cafe rouge was a lunchtime rush
Of regulars yelling for food
The service in there left a lot to be desired
And all the regulars were getting rude
I saw an apron thrown over a chair
A note said 'hey john we're gone, we're gone'
And I just smiled 'cause I loved you both
So I put the apron on
I put the apron on

There's nothing there in the market square
But the ghost of the scarlet town crier
And I just put the apron on
I sing the red rose and the briar

John Wesley Harding,"It's been raining for a million years
And the weather just won't turn
Try to build a fire round your place
And the damned logs refuse to burn
The brain dead have been sitting on their sunbeds
Where's heaven for it's own sake
Lying dead or half-forgotten
At the bottom of a bottomless lake

But when the sun comes out

Everybody's gonna move their arms about
Cause what they believed is turned inside-out

And when you awake you won't believe your eyes

Butter melts if you leave it near the window
And it's time to try and use a deckchair again

But when the sun comes out

When the sun comes out

To find out his son was double-jointed
Some will flounder
Some will be anointed

Cats and dogs will shake themselves

When she's all sweetness and light
She doesn't lie through her teeth all day
She doesn't grind them in her dreams

When you hold her tight at night
How can you be so sick and suspicious
When she's health and goodness personified? 
That love you gave her, it's just a virus

That wants blood for dr.hyde
She's an angel and you're a clown
She'll be flying when you're six feet under the ground

How can you be so cool and distant
When she always does her best to be here
Right between your dreams and your nightmare desires
The hole in your wall has got so small

Her stockings are so sheer
How can you be so greedy and hopeless
She gives you everything but you still want more
If you could see the looks you give her

That's something you'd abhor
She's an angel and you're a joke
A shaggy dog shuffling in to give the punchline a poke
You're just dying to turn her into red riding hood
She's an angel and you're no good

She's a not a barbie doll
You can drag around on some dog collar
You can't wrap love up in clingflim
Keep it from getting older

She'll always be so artless
You're heartless, getting colder
Don't try to come from behind
'Cause I'll be right over your shoulder

How can you treat her dumb and stupid
When she knows that you're not the bee's knees
You'll have to let her turn the bedside light right off
Instead of you turning it down to mood by the three degrees

How can you be so limp and spineless
When she'd even help you to make your final stand
It's not enough for anyone
Just to lie back and think of iceland
She's not an angel, she's flesh and blood

You do the dirty and she's crawled around right in your mud
Now you're crying, I think that we knew that you would

The papers did penance, the whole town took sides
Oh, but it was your dancing and mischeivous mind
And then we were shot of you, but no-one's that blind
And there's flowers have bloomed down the side of your street
Where you and your demons did openly meet
And I hope it's wide open where you've got to
There's closed minds in this town that couldn't accept you

They're making excuses, the reasons the facts
They're reasoning how long you'll take to come back
But there's guilt in their prayers, maybe shame in their pride
They know it was no fault of yours down inside
They steps can't be retraced cos tracks disappear
And there'd be no welcome for you back here

By new reincarnation rules

To see if they would pin on her again
He threw his heart against the wall
To see if it would stick or fall
She put her arms around him
And said you are forgiven
He said well you're the only thing
That makes life worth living
When you live into the wind

He pushed the rock up to the top
Until it rolled back down the mountain
He did it once, now he can't top
But he'll never quit complaining
She tells him why he does it
It must be because he needs to
He takes his hands away
And the rock doesn not roll down
It sits firm into the wind

Why can't he see
He creates these situations
It's not to be or not to be
Nothing's that easy

He builds a home paper on sand
And awaits congratulations
The wind blows once, the house falls down
And he wails amidst the ruins
For all the time that he spent working
On this worthless enterprise
She stands him on a rock and says
A word to the wise
If you live into the wind...

He doesn't feel the cold today
He doesn't worry about tomorrow
He doesn't build a house of cards
Just so he can knock it down
He takes her in his arms
His overconfidence returning
And laughs with her when she says
We have love to burn
If it burns into the wind.

My luck it had been down so long but I could change it yet
Sat down and started talking with some guy sitting there
He bought me drinks all afternoon until I didn't care
He said was I in need of work, some money could be found
I said ""is it above the law? "" he said ""it's underground""
I said ""I need the paycheck now, I got debts here and there""

In this weekend of ordinary dreams
Everything was not just as it seems
Take a look around at the faces in the crowd
And you'll see where I've been

We met up on the Saturday, I thought it was us two
But I had not asked questions not knowing what to do
Twelve of them were in the van, thirteen including me
Twelve pairs of eyes were staring back at me, suspiciously
And so I just sat down and drove, took them to some track
And drove past the security guard while they hid in the back
They made me stop, and got out there, and I heard a couple of shots
I hoped they were in self-defense but I knew that they were not
They were not

Not in this weekend of ordinary dreams

I drummed my fingers on the wheel and waited for the boys
Had a smoke, I had a few, I got very paranoid
And still they hadn't come back there, so I just drove away
Deciding to play safe and get my share another day

On Sunday, he came round my place, I asked him where they'd been
He said they'd left another way and only I was seen
He said that we should cash the van and did I want my share
I didn't like the way they'd left but by now I didn't care
Didn't care

Didn't care for this weekend of ordinary dreams

He drove me to a back room with a single swinging light
Someone said ""the fish are starving, ain't it time they had a bite""
And I felt sick and stupid and damned my own brown hair
Forgetting that the price you pay must far exceed the share
Someone pulled a knife out and they stabbed me in the back
They tied my hands and bound my feet and threw me in a sack
They took me to a lakeside and they threw my body in
I could hear them laughing, they said you can sink or swim
Sink or swim

So hear you desperate women and hear you desperate men
Don't take your life for granted
Don't live your life in vain
But if you think that you can change it,
Hope you know you ain't go back
Just go down to the lakeside

John Wesley Harding,"""Hey you"" she said
""I think that I have something in my eye""
And she posed beneath the standard lamp
As her clothes waved goodbye

And she was
Naked as a new apology
For something she hadn't yet done
And he said ""did I ever tell you the one about
The original miss Jesus? ""

""born before
Her more famous little brother mister Christ
Sure, there were miracles
But out of the public eye

So they didn't

And only her family cried for her

And then he came

Whom she could do without (the sheik of do-without)""

John Wesley Harding,"I was arrested for disturbing the peace
But, hey, I was disturbing the war
I was waving a small white handkerchief
Singing ""please don't fight no more""
And I thought there'd be an army each side
But there were just two guys wearing very bad ties
So I shouted until my throat went hoarse
And they cut out my voicebox of course

I was taken to court in a city of gold
Where silence is a sure sign of guilt
And you can't speak out in your own defense
Or be heard over worlds being built
And the trial was a farce as befitted a place
Where comedy and tragedy share the same face
The judge read the verdict, a curtain was raised
An audience roared out its praise


And I said
""Where's the truth around here today?
Where do fact and fiction separate?
Who's the bug guy that we have to pay
To find the truth around here today?""


It all made the news but the story was wrong
And the photo wasn't even of me
And the great god I love, he intoned from above
You shouldn't sniff at free publicity
But it wasn't the voice I'd expected to hear
it was thin and unclear like Richard Gere
And somebody said ""God's had a bad fall
That's his manager taking his calls""


And I said
""Where's the truth around here today?
Where do fact and fiction go their separate ways?
I thought we were much too clever to pray
But where's the truth to find the truth?""


I was put in a cell for the whole afterlife
But my mind was just as free as can be
Somebody said, ""just your body's enchained""
And you can guess how that encouraged me
So I wandered and roamed for the rest of my days
I was clearing my name, I was apportioning days
And then I woke up, it was all a dream, all was well
But when I woke up, I woke up in my cell

And I said
""Where's the truth around here today?
Where do fact and fiction separate
No-one wants to be the one to say
Where's the truth around here today?""

John Wesley Harding,"somebody went and killed some people
And they know who
The evidence fits around the facts
Like a favourite shoe
But nobody knows where the corpses are
Their whereabouts unknown
The killer's in a frenzy
And he's getting on the phone
So they got their thinking hats on
And spread out in their cars
But only I know where the bodies are

You know they can i.d. someone
From one cell of skin
But they couldn't spot a crime scene
If the killer went and let 'em in
To genetic fingerprinting
We all take off our hats
To hide the little stains that spread
Across the welcome mat
You can put your best foot forward
And wish upon a star
But only I know where the bodies are

Depending on the bid
The question isn't if they're guilty
But if they'll get acquitted
Justice goes unjustfied
Beneath a police chief and an eagle
Pain's too difficult to prove
They're not going to make pain illegal
To think that we were once naive
To think we've come this far
To think that only I know where the bodies are


Some people don't wanna know
The facts behind the scam
Or see ""Who could I be?""
Peeking out behind ""The great I am""
But most of us got enough to think about
Husbands and wives
To notice pointless death's become
A brand new way of life
And this is just a sandwich board
That I wear out in the park
Saying only I know where the bodies are

",Build Me a Coffin
John Wesley Harding,"Not long ago I went through the gate of dreams
I came to the famous City of Destruction
Where now a shuttle runs to the Emerald City
With air miles and big group reductions
So I went to the ticket office where Evangelist sat
And reserved seats through credit card calls
I said ' How does it feel now they changed your job?'
He said 'Now I don't feel anything at all'

As we moved off I looked down on the Myre of Despair
From a bridge that passed a thousand miles above
Its legs were made of books that they'd thrown into the mud
And the books were of philosophy and love
As we reached the Hill of Difficulty, we waited for a climb
They'd dug a tunnel through the center of the stone
And with the excess rock, well the valley became landfill
Where once you'd had to walk down there alone

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For all those who seek the truth but don't have the time to get there
Don't have the time to get there

The train ride felt so smooth that I put my feet up
Barely noticing the motion of the carriage
The stewardess was Prudence with her sister Charity
For fifteen grand they'd sell their hands in marriage
And just as we were entering the Valley of Death
I expected to be plunged into the darkness
But the company had floodlit the underground gloom
Taken care not to make this place seem joyless

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For all those with the money, just tender up the fare
Just tender up the fare

It looked like we stopped at the mouth of Hell itself
But they said it was a now-extinct volcano
And if you'd seen the demons seemed to emanate from there
You'd have taken the guidebook at its say so
But some of my companions they would not get back in
They'd heard that heaven it was vastly over-rated
The weather here was warmer, and drinking was allowed
And they thought they'd see us come back here much later

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
You could be home by now, if you lived there
If you lived there

After boarding no new passengers we went upon our way
Past the place where Pope and Pagan ruled with terror
But now the giant Scientology had eaten them for breakfast
And bought all the property around her
At a city called Vanity we stayed for the night
Where one's every whim was catered for and sated
The shuttle brought prosperity and business in its wake
And an attitude that never gets outdated

So all aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For all those seeing double, just tender up the fare
Just tender up the fare

So Charming was the city with its profitable fair
The inhabitants claimed it was the only heaven
And said that only dreamers ever venture beyond its gates
And go to that land of Never-Never
And in this city an education came without a school
The shops sold one alongside praise and honor
Reputations and honour went on sale at the fair
And conscience could buy almost any of them

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
The most efficient way to go, it's the best way to get there
It's the best way to get there

And I stayed in the city, til I became like those
Who lived there and abandoned their old questions
Til I saw some pilgrims who'd walked the journey's length
Standing at the edge of its dimensions
'Friend let me tell you' said the Speaker to my ear
'The whole concept of the shuttle is a Bubble
You can pay the fare and travel for the rest of your life
You'll never get anywhere but trouble
'cause the train is only progress and it isn't a roundtrip
And just in case the whole thing should explode
The Lord of the Good City he will never let you in
And he grants no kind of permit to the railroad'

I got back on the train and my companions they were few
My hopes with the suburbs disappearing
We saw the Silver Mine and the Castle of Despair
And we saw our destination it was nearing
Saw the gates of that fair city, beyond a river lay
A blinding light shone from the other side
A ferry boat was waiting to carry us over
It was built of paper and everybody died

All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For a journey free of care, for a journey free of trouble
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
For all those who want the truth but have no time to get there
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
Just say what you've got, we'll sell you a fare
All aboard, all aboard the Celestial Shuttle
We'll look after you so good that you won't wanna get there
You won't wanna get there

John Wesley Harding,"They gave me doses of dioxide
Started coughing constantly
Nursed inside my wounded pride
Poisoned arrow in my knee
Then they stood around my bed
Said I was getting on famously
A faceless man in a TV van
Reprogrammed my naivety
I met you sparring in a corner
And you spat right in my face
People say it looks like tears
Because they'll have seen the trace
And they take it as their job of work
To put me right back in my place
And I pretend that I wanna be
A contender in the human race

Now when you hit me
I don't cry
The only thing that remains for me
Is to learn how I can say goodbye
'cause I'm ready, steady, dead on arrival
I'm ready, steady, dead on arrival
I'm ready, steady, dead on arrival

You know I thought that this was mist
But now I guess it is pollution
Caused by an economy of half-truths
And the resulting confusion
You sign a form the day you're born
That commits you to collusion
With society's special standards
And its optical illusions
Someone says you're still alive
Gives you great expectations
But now you know you're dead inside
'cause you feel no shock vibrations
Now you must control yourself
You can always cheat at patience
Soon I'll be right in the dog house
Food for FBI alsations

Now when you hit me
I don't cry
The only thing that remains for me
Is to learn how I can say goodbye
'cause I'm ready, steady, dead on arrival

So I killed you off, I tore your famous brown fur coat
I laughed at your cough, ignored your suicide note
But that was the devil in me

I blew up the bus, I started world war iii
Hijacked the plane with Qaddafi, blew the hostages free
That was the devil in me

I advertise their things for cash, that ain't deceiving
No, that's just the devil in me
It was the devil in me

I gave you acid rain
I polluted the sea
I covered your thoughts up
With graffiti
You can call me by my real name
Or you can call me humanity
Because it all seems just like human behavior
It all seems like human behavior to me

John Wesley Harding,"She flares up, they start to fight
A chemical reaction late into the night
Once they're out of love, now they're outta sight
That's alright
When silence reigns, it's strange weather
Why do you have to leave me for a man
Who couldn't tie his shoe-laces together?
He's had the last laugh but the joke's on him
He could've had a final bang but drags on with a whimper
When dogs bark
And when cats meow
Two humans are the animals they knew they could be now
Sniffing round each other's dirt
Fighting til it starts to hurt
And eating each other's babies

Paperback's get thrown, the story unfolds
Two lost sheep who couldn't find the fold
They got no common sense, couldn't catch the common cold
I've been told
She fights tooth and claw, he starts to abuse her
You show me someone who takes losing well
And I'll show you a loser
He's a very small man wearing very big clothes
There's no room for expansion but there's plenty of room for growth
When dogs bark
And when cats meow
Two humans fighting middleweight, instead of middlebrow
Picking on those little things
Tearing off each other's wings
And eating each other's babies

We're stuck here in this cage
Playing out this prison game
Committing all these war crimes
Time after time after time after time after time

Something clicks, time to get soft
She's getting on, he's getting off
On the way she splutters with her little cough
That's enough
They're so adept, he used to spoil her
Sometimes we get so see through
Think I'm living out some potboiler
Remember me forever in your gallery
When all your past is catalogued and filed alphabetically
When dogs bark
And when cats meow
We don't have to say anything final now
Let's kiss and make up
Put off the break up
Let's eat each other's babies
Let's eat each other's babies
Let's eat each other's babies

John Wesley Harding,"I met you on election night
As we cried over our beers
Nothing you could do would cheer me up
We broke up later that year
How come you and I aren't winners? 
Why weren't we born the other side? 
And it's raining
It's raining
On election night

You fight, you fight and nothing changes
And when it does the payback's worse
We arrived here in limo
We drove home in a hearse
And we are none the wiser
I guess that we're just not so bright
So I'll see you
Yes I'll see you
Next election night

The balloons look so deflated
As they burst and float on down
It's been four years that we've waited
For those balloons to hit the ground
Looks like you backed a real loser
Who thinks that life is black and white
But he'll be back again
We'll be back again
Next election night",Election Night
John Wesley Harding,"The world is turning upside-down, no-one's in the black
The king is on the balcony, the queen is in the sack
He's lying through his golden teeth, she's lying on her back
Beneath the handsome soldier and the family coat of arms
The lady she's affected by the soldier's obvious charms
And the king sweats quite profusely and says we should stay calm
I can see his brand new suit but I can't see the man
He's here to cover up his so-called economic plan
But his voice dwindles to nothing, he strikes up the royal band
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright tonight
It's all performed for the idiot's delight

The trains are almost empty since the crash of 89
They built a brand new station but forgot about the lines
They built a brand new human but forgot about the spine
Everything gets cut to bits, no-one sees it bleed
It's not the way you play the game but how you can succeed
Put the bastards in a new town and watch the rabbits breed
The king he's got a stepson in return for foolish pride
The queen had her mad moment's glory, then of course she dies
The soldier planned the revolution right from the inside
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright tonight
Because it's all performed for the idiot's delight

The soldier's executed, he's mistaken for the king
Who said he was from somewhere else and hadn't done a thing
And made off with the crown jewels but misplaced his wedding ring
Power's aphrodisiac, addicts die of thirst
The new El Presidente saw his bubble finally burst
And the king returned from exile, by request to break the curse
He fulfils election promises with temporary cures
And everything's worse than it once was without the same allure
And his stepson is on squad inspection making overtures
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright tonight
Because it's all performed for the idiot's delight
It's all performed for the idiot's delight
Because it's all performed for the idiot's delight

John Wesley Harding,"Yesterday he was walking through the park
On the way back from work it was getting dark
He saw autumn trees with their peeling bark
She was sitting on a bench
He didn't think she'd look twice you see
But she looked three times or so it would seem
The rain started up it began to teem
And she was getting drenched

She started to run but he caught up quickly
And he was wearing sunglasses it was hard to see
Then she hit him with a moving plea
Could I please share your umbrella
Well he just smiled and he let her in
And they walked through the rain like Siamese twins
He doesn't normally pick up girls he thinks it's a sin
He just not that sort of fella

She told him where she lived and she told him her name
And he tried her patience, she tried to play games
He wanted to be with her though his excuse was lame
I was going that way anyway
Her flat in a house it was three miles out
Right next to a train track and he had to shout
She said I'm a dancer, she twirled about
And asked him if he wanted to stay

His clothes were really wet he should have taken them off
But he was embarrassed 'cause he thought she'd laugh
But then she insisted when she heard him cough
She went to make some tea
And he was wearing just a towel to keep him warm
And he saw that she liked Somerset Maugham
She took the Guardian so she could be better informed
But she wasn't interested politically
She seemed rather nonchalant

Time went fast, time came to leave
But in that room he thought he was Adam, she was Eve
He wasn't lying and she wasn't deceived
And neither knew what to say
But everything seemed to be going down fine
Til she gave him a leaving sign
And he asked her 'Why?', he said 'Is the fault all mine?'
She just said 'No, I've had a bad day'

So he wandered back to town in the drizzling rain
And he wondered if he'd ever see her again
He wanted to walk with her down lover's lane
And it started to make him cry
'cause his life was turning cartwheels, all his cards were down
In the circus of existence, he always played a clown
He wanted a slice of forever as he turned into town
And he felt her memory die

But today he was walking through the park
On the way back from work it was still getting dark
He saw autumn trees with their peeling bark
And she was still sitting on that bench



",Peeling Bark
John Wesley Harding,"The time on the clock on the wall in the bedroom
Tells him it's time to leave
Last glass of wine drowns the changes
She wipes her eyes on her sleeve
She's not crying she tries to persuade him
No-one really believes
No-one really believes

He holds the gun hard to her forehead
He's given her his best shot
She cleaned the barrel while they made love
It was the bullets that he forgot
One day when he stopped lying next to her
That was when the lying stopped
That was when the lying stopped

And it's the long goodbye
It's the long goodbye
It's the long goodbye
But it's the wrong goodbye

The telephone rings for an alarm clock
Wakes her out of her latest nightmare
The light bulb goes as she gets turned on
Where the hell did she leave the spare
Make up in a mirror that's been cracked six years
One more left til she falls down the stairs
Falls down the stairs

It's the long goodbye
It's the long goodbye
It's the long goodbye
But it's the wrong goodbye

He's sitting on a windowsill looking out
Even the laundromat is shut
He'd write her a poem but he doesn't know how
He smokes the day down to the butt
One day they'll meet again in a rainstorm
But it's gonna take a lot of guts
It's gonna take a lot of guts

It's the long goodbye
It's the long goodbye
It's the long goodbye
It's the wrong goodbye

John Wesley Harding,"As I was out walking one night in the park
Cupid was out on the town in the dark
And I couldn't resist as I saw him walk by
So I asked him why he had a tear in his eye

He said I'm an outlaw but my hands are clean
And I love this girl who won't look twice at me
I've made love work for others and now it's my turn
But these arrows are useless, they just crash and burn
They're wide of the mark

Cupid and psycho, a couple much better apart
When cupid's in love
It's psycho left holding the darts
And it tears us apart

Psycho was sitting on her balcony
Framed on the wall by a heart made of ivy
Cupid said stay here with me and you'll see what I mean
And he climbed on the tree that led up to his dream
And she shook on the branch and he fell to my feet

Bruised but still breathing, his crestfallen love
Cupid he said throw your hair from above
She said just leave me alone, I'm bound for my bed
All the voices I'm hearing are just in my head
All the voices I'm hearing

Cupid and psycho, a couple much better apart
When cupid's in love
It's psycho left holding the darts
And it tears us apart

While cupid is crying, love waits to be born
Broken in pieces, alone on the floor
He'd let go of the reins and the ride was insane
If he doesn't get back on, will love live again
Could we be in love? would our hearts beat again? 
Could I love you? could you love me?

When cupid's in love

Impossible at night

And it's drink up, my hearties

And it's all gone according to plan
It's out in the open and now it's all over
Three cheers for every woman and man

Terry and Julie still stand on the bridge
But only in our memory
Don't look to them to draw a conclusion
Just love them and set them free

Julie hangs out by the banks of the river
Where the garbage all flows to the sea
Something's washed up, it's sacrifice to her
From the twentieth century

She sees the smokestacks and she sees the city
She sees the stadium's covered in snow
The streets have been cleaned except for the bedrooms
Of all the people with nowhere to go

Terry will clutch at threads where the rope was
As he's free falling fast to the floor
But nobody claps because nobody's watching
It's his lawyers who get all the applause

Time's on the move and I'm on the red-eye
Where I'm hoping to find one more song
But it's like looking for rain in the river
We'd better not leave it too long

Terry and Julie, they filled out the coupon
They won tickets tonight for the show
But it's the aisles in the new stores that beckon
As they shine a divine guiding glow

The bridge through the city, well it has just crumbled
And that link is what kept us all sane
The two of them tumble into the river
Forget to come up for air again
Forget to come up for air again

Oh yeah, and I was dumped down south
I was found by the richest man in the world
Oh yeah, who bought me up as a girl
My sheets are satin but my mind's a mess
But there are worse things I confess
Than drinking tea in a pretty dress
And I'm here to tell you that it's not all bad
Count your blessings and maybe you'll be glad

When he died, I inherited his wealth
Oh yeah and I revealed my self
I was snubbed by the friends he'd never had
Oh yeah, who sided with my dad
All my riches are beyond control
But it's the same old rigmarole
They say I've lost my very soul
Maybe I have
But I'm here to tell you that it's not all bad
Count your blessings and maybe you'll be glad

And as I grew so did my fame
So I gave it up and changed my name
It's catch as catch can and
You'll never know who I am

When I died, I hoped to hear the angel's song
Oh yeah, but was I wrong
They threw me back there in that lane
Oh yeah and they said ""start again""
So when you're turning out the bedside light
Consider me and my wretched plight

And I ate the wild pretzel and the nuts that fell
And the screech of brakes was all I knew for my schoolbell
And I know I've got the whole world at my feet

I learned to ease the pressure with free playing cards
Spent my teenage setting off all of the smoke alarms

As I wait around for upgrades that will never come

And show us all a thing or two about her charms

Then I'll dream that I am with you
Oh, to hide inside your hair
I'll be so quiet that
You won't know I'm there

And you know what it's for

John Wesley Harding,"Last night I was out driving
Coming home at the end of the working day
I was riding alone through the drizzling rain
On a deserted stretch of a county two-lane
When I came upon a wreck on the highway

There was blood and glass all over
And there was nobody there but me
As the rain tumbled down hard and cold
I seen a young man lying by the side of the road
He cried ""Mister, won't you help me please""

An ambulance finally came and took him to Riverside
I watched as they drove him away
And I thought of a girlfriend or a young wife
And a state trooper knocking in the middle of the night
To say your baby died in a wreck on the highway

Sometimes I sit up in the darkness
And I watch my baby as she sleeps
Then I climb in bed and I hold her tight
I just lay there awake in the middle of the night

In the places I left behind
All the townsons, barnes and staces
And some good old friends of mine

Because everyone is someone
That I seem to recognize
Must be the old familiar faces
In their eyes

I'm walking down these streets that have no signposts
In a language that I know
And I never will belong here
And it's clear that one day I'll go

But when I turn the corner
There's another memory
Why don't those old familiar faces
Let me be

I used to live a life without a present
And no need to go back when
But now I see the truth so clearly
And I want it her back again

She hosts the ghosts of people
In the shadows all around
Until the old familiar faces
Fill this town

Everyday I feel the sun shine stronger
On the dark side of my heart
And people look like strangers now
That I can't tell apart

So I smile and nod politely
Like they're friends that I once knew
I've found those old familiar faces
In you",$55

Protected by the ravens

On urgent matters of state
And it sits suspended in fluid
Attached to ten electrodes

The brain of Britain masterminds the nation
From this curious vantage point
It's an oracle, it's a magic eight-ball
That can give out just three answers

Of a prime piece of meat called

It knows no other existence
Its consciousness floats like an island
Communicating only by pulse
The queen swears allegiance to the brain
But the future king wants to kick it
Through the streets of London like a football
And that means trouble

One pleasant evening in the month of June
The pleasant singing blackbird
His charming notes to tune
Then I saw a woman
All in great grief and woe
Conversing with young Bonaparte
Concerning the bonny bunch of roses

And then up and spoke the young Napoleon
And he took hold of his mother's hand
Oh mother dear be patient
And soon I will take command
I'll raise a terrible army
And through tremendous danger go
And in spite of all of the universe
I'll conquer the bonny bunch of roses, oh

And when first you saw the great Napoleon
You fell down on your bended knee
And you asked your father's life of him
And he's granted it most manfully
Then he took an army
And over the frozen Alps did go
He said I'll conquer Moscow
I'll come back for the bonny bunch of roses, oh 

And so he's took three hundred thousand fighting men
And kings likewise for to join his throng
He was as well provided for
Enough to take the whole world on
But when he came to Moscow
All overpowered by driving snow
And Moscow was a-blazing
And he lost the bonny bunch of roses, oh

For England she has a heart of oak
And England, Ireland and Scotland
Their unity has never been broke

In St.Helena, his body it lies low
And you will follow after
Beware of the bonny bunch of roses, oh

And it's goodbye to my mother, forever
For I am on my dying bed
Had I lived, I might have been clever
But now I bow my youthful head
And while our bodies do molder
And weeping willows over us do grow
The deeds of brave Napoleon
Will sting the bonny bunch of roses, oh",The Bonny Bunch of Roses
John Wesley Harding,"There is a room that you just now walked out of
It has everything in it but you
There's a mirror that knew what you looked like
And a door that has ruined the view 
There's a carpet depressed by your footsteps
A hallway which echoes their sound
There's an arrow that points to the exit
And a lift that goes no further down, no further down

There's a stage play that shows every evening 
With no prompter, no plot and no lines
The actors don't know what they're doing
They improvise all of their lives
And the action's all happening offstage
Where the props meet the actual things 
Someone saw you with a gun in your hand 
I heard the report from the wings

You say you're leaving
When I know that you're gone
After the fact, you'll be back 
But long after the song

If ever I try to run after
The ceiling reveals the sky
The carpet is pulled out from under
The walls disappear in the flies 
Behind them, the lenses of cameras
They all want a piece of us now
The story behind the unmaking
The what and the why and the how
Excuse if I choose not to bow

You say you're leaving
When I know that you're gone
After the fact, you'll be back
But long after the song is gone
After the fact, you'll be gone 
But long after the song",After the Fact
John Wesley Harding,"She had a criminal conversation with the devil
On the back seat of a burned out Toyota Camry
She said she'd finally found a way to start a family
But not one soul could conceive that she was on the level 
And the strange thing was she didn't seem to care 
He got what he came for and left her to kiss the air

But the baby burned like bitumen inside her
That inhuman son of a bitch never even called her
The doctor said, 'It'll be some kind of daughter' 
She dreamed she gave birth to a thousand spiders
Who crawled up to her ear and called her mother
And whispered words of wonder from her other love
There There, There There
It'll be all right, It's just a dream 
A bad dream baby

The days flew by like petals on a flower
Until the hour she screamed out with a vengeance
The busy father could not be in attendance
Although he sent his people to the baby shower 
And her tiny eyes were brighter than the sun
And shone upon her mother more than anyone
There There, There There
It'll be all right, It's just a dream
A bad dream baby

Now when mother dreams her dark and handsome stranger
Good daughter brings her messages and money
Changes dirt and dust to bread and honey
The dowager's reward for peopling the manger
And that little girl is growing in this world 
You can tell she'll always be her daddy's girl 
You can tell she'll always be her daddy's little girl
It'll be all right, It's just a dream
A bad dream baby

Do you hate the light

And home by midnight

John Wesley Harding,"Once upon a time
I could have had it all
A princess with a price on her head
Or the prince who'd climb her wall
But when pride has it in for someone
None of us can check the fall
Now I'm humble as a bumblebee
I'm getting used to how things have to be
Just another mumble
Buzzing round and round in rings
So afraid that I won't be king

This is the sting, I still want everything
Here is the twist, you're on my list and
Here's what I mean, you're still the queen
And I want you


Now I wonder
If I will ever be
The lighthouse in a sea of shadows
That you were when you shined for me
When I was going under
You knew when and where to be
Now I'm as good as Ebenezer after his conversion
I'd give all my goods away with no coercion
I'd give almost anything
Just to hear the hum of your wings


This is the sting, I still want everything
Here is the twist, you're on my list and
Here's what I mean, you're still the queen
And I want you, honey, I want you


I was as 'umble as Uriah
Just before his tumble
But I fumbled for the best of me
Amongst the jumble
Heaven knows where we went wrong

Here is the twist, you're on my list
Here's what I mean, you're still the queen

That you never act your age

Bombs in every drawer 
Strands of hair (Unfair! Unfair!)

Today we can't get back again

Tomorrow they would all crack back
Who are we to try to stop the fall?
There's no reason to worry
There's no reason to care 
There's no reason to wonder

And we used to love to share the same piece of air

We behave like real human beings
Who eat, then wash the dishes clean 
But I have held you in my arms
And tried to read your mind
And maybe baby if we both relax
The axe that grinds behind our backs
Will wear itself to nothing over time

Like getting on a tightrope and falling off
But there's never been anything harder than loving her
She's so demanding, so intense 
Her expectation of the ordinary is so immense
Better take her at her word
It would be easier to give up than live up to her
Such ludicrous perfection isn't found on earth
And for anyone who said that love was easy 
I said, for anyone who said that love was easy
She's a piece of work

She's up and down, she's round the wheel
She's governed absolutely by the way she feels
That's a lethal combination in a small house when it rains 
We sit around, then it pours 
Me, I'm so addicted to the great indoors
And she wants to shine again
She's the only person I have ever met
Who makes me feel I haven't tried hard yet 
And for anyone who said that love was easy

Did you think you'd still be you

What have they done to you, darling?
How'd they get away with that?
When you saw their funny mouse suits
Did you know that they were rats?

Maybe that's why you're confused

And it's like sunlight through the curtains

Soon we'll have to make ends me
Make our home between the sheets

John Wesley Harding,"After I had killed my wife
And by the jury been acquitted
I resolved to change my life
And try to lead a life less wicked
I roamed around from town to town
In search of some employment
It was here I settled down

I saw her standing in the sun
I was bewitched by all her features
And before the day was done
I fell in love with a school teacher
An since she had no next of kin
I offered my assistance
To my surprise she took me in

We spent the summer of that year
In a life of such perfection
But winter first appeared
I felt the cold of her rejection
It was then she turned to me
With a look I didn't recognize
It is our anniversary
It is our anniversary
And you cannot run away from me

I saw a light upon a knife
And in the moment that I recognized
I begged for my life",Sussex Ghost Story
John Wesley Harding,"All you have to do is smile
And the words just melt away
And there is nowhere worth going
And I have nothing to say

When you smile
Please take off your rings, your watch
We'll forget time as it's flying
I can see myself so deep in your eyes
Can you see yourself in mine

We'll forget just where we are
If we're anywhere at all
You're not the only one who's lonely
I'm not the only one who calls

When you smile
When you smile at me
When you smile
When you smile at me

When the shadows pass above
Put the sun on let it shine
And the world revolves you and me
Its center is just where we lie
Feels like time will crawl forever
This little room is everywhere
But we were made to be together
And if not it doesn't matter

When you smile
When you smile at me
When you smile
When you smile at me",When You Smile
John Wesley Harding,"When it's time to pack your bags
When everything appears as the drag that it is
Get down that brown case that your grandma had
Open it up and think of your dad
When you're feeling empty
And the echos round this cold white room have no identity
When it's time to pack your bags
Save a little room for me

When it's time to buy a home
When you're sick of using a different phone everyday
Settle up your debts and then settle down
Take that suitcase back to the lost and found
When you're feeling lonely
I guarantee the neighbourhood community will rally round you
Wait and see
When it's time to buy a home
Save a little room for me

When it's time to lie down
When you're sick of the sound and the sight hurts your eyes
Wrap up warm in a single bed
Tie up the loose strings that are in your head
When you're feeling empty
Dreams will fill you up in the big sleep city
When it's time for you lie down
Save a little room for me
Save a little room for me

And I promise I?ll never tell
I?m under it?s magic spell
Oh I?ll try to keep it to myself

Wondering just what is in it
Where it is in front of you

Well, perhaps you?re right
And you?re happy the way you are
It?s better this way by far
Oh but can you handle never knowing?
And what if you?re wrong?
And just denying yourself the best
Maybe that?s how you fail the test
Oh, don?t you have a life to live
And have you no initiative?
And, quick, before we both decay
Baby, are you made of clay

John Wesley Harding,"I started 
Playing guitar by the town memorial
All my songs were singing editorials
And when I'd done, the sermon on the mount
I counted my change and put it in my bank account
I didn't want to work at the local avatar
So I left home, expanded my repertoire
I did some gigs, No one booed
I got free beer and I drank it with gratitude

Once I started I couldn't stop
That's how I got from
The bottom to the top

A businessman with a very young dolly bird
Talked through the set, liked what he thought he heard
Dropped some names he claimed to represent
And asked me if I had any management
Well two weeks later, I'm signing on ??docubine??
Offered some drugs, at first I declined
Lots of parties where the spread's incredible
But don't get close 'cause the food's inedible

And I became a spinning top
That's how I got from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

I got a sweet deal and I moved to America
I fell in love with an heiress called Erica
Started out smart, soon got silly
I partied by the pool and then arrest for necrophilia
News travels fast like electricity
A bad mug shot, it's good publicity
I laid low for a month or two
And spent my dough building a recording studio

And that's when it all went pop
That's how I got from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

The label ??Empeola?? got me in the charts
My new management had me by the private parts
I went on strike, took the initiative
Forgetting that I didn't have a single thing to bargain with
I lost my nerve, my fall was glorious
The lawsuit was eternal and laborious
My new material was only fair to middling
Rome was burning and I did some fiddling

And finally, I was dropped
That's how I got back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

On the way down people tend to leave you where you fall
I tried to stand up but I didn't have the wherewithal
I nearly died in a cab one day
So I swapped my bourbon for a bottle full of perrier
There were rumors about my sexuality
The video star, killed by reality
Next thing I know I'm on my knees
Begging the camera, ""Will you vote me off the island please?""

But the world forgives a flop
That's how I got back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom


O well all that exposure and the phone starts to ring again
I experienced the strange urge to sing again
Well not long ago I was a boy with a dream 
I reacquaint myself with a razor and some shaving cream
Look at me I'm ripe for rediscovery
All I need is Mary to mother me
On the tenth green I was way over par
My partner offered me a tour in ??Jesus Christ's Superstar??

And that's when the penny dropped
That's how I got back back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom

Well we toured all over the states of America
I got a picture of my son from Erica
My parents wrote, ""Since you disappeared,
Hard to believe but it's just been one year,""
Now it's back to ale and cakes again
I wonder if I'll make the same mistakes again
I hope that you've enjoyed this tutorial
There's another busker who was playing the memorial

I'm getting bored of talking shop
That's how I got back from
The bottom to the top of the bottom
To the top of the bottom
To the top of the bottom

Where's the wind that takes me higher 
The hand that offers peace 
The heart that still gives shelter?
I want to go back to find 
The innocent days that I left behind

I still believe they're holding ground 
Behind the Battle Lines
If it takes a million miles over land and sea 
Gonna swim in the rivers of purity 
I know they still run free 
Behind the Battle Lines

One more mountain I must climb 
I've scaled so many in my time 
And if the sun goes down on me 
The light of truth will help me see

All days of innocence, I surrendered long ago

The eyes that are not blind 
The love that's never ending?

And my darkness is complete as the midnight sky

As you pour salt into my deepest cut of all 
My shattered heart, in pieces now 
And I'm gazing at the fragments of my life

Hold me now, maybe just pretend 
I could be someone that you might have loved before 
Hold me now, and let me believe in a kiss that means nothing to you
'Cause it means the world to me

Lord above, you sanctify your love 
And the barrier you built, forces you not to care 
Break down that door, take my hand if nothing more 
So when I'm falling, then I know that someone's there

I wondered a thousand times, if I could love again 
But I will overcome, what I can comprehend
The honesty I offer you 
Is as naked as your fear of loving me

Hold me now, let it never end 
Hold me like you've never done before 
Hold me now, we don't have to pretend 
Smash the chains and throw them to the floor 

Hold me now, and let me believe that a kiss is the way it should be

John Wetton,"And now I stand, forsaking pride 
The time has come to turn
The tide I've drawn the line
I've built my wall And I won't let
One more dream fall
All days of innocence
I surrendered long ago
Where's the wind that takes me higher
The had that offers peace 
The heart that still gives shelter
I want to go back to find 
The innocent days that I left behind
I still believe they're holding ground 
Behind the battle lines
If it takes a million miles over land and sea 
Gonna swim in
The rivers of purity I know they still run free
Behind the battle lines
One more mountain I must climb
I've scaled so many in my time 
And if the sun goes down on me
The light of truth will help me see
All days of innocence, I surrendered long ago
Where's the voice that speaks of mercy 
The eyes that are not blind 
The love that's never ending
A vision of eternity Oh, Lord! 
Never take the dream from me
Here I am, standing at the edge of destiny",Battle Lines [Movie Version]

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

She's the promise of pearl in a pool of heartache
She's the perfect little truth wrapped in little white lies
Like the wind she will turn
She can state the case now and then
Ignore the truth
When it ain't on her side
When her eyes claim that she's a lady
You better treat her as such
But comfort the little girl when her world gets too rough

If she
If she's the woman that you live for
Make her feel how much you need her
If she's the woman you love

In the moment that your lives touched
There was something in the stars
That made you feel you'd probably die
Just for a good morning in her arms
'Cause you knew you'd seen an angel
And you were sure she'd fly away
But she chose you when she landed
And gave her heart away

So she's your mystery trip into each new tomorrow
She's the first to laugh and she's the worst to cry
She's like the tide 'neath your ship
But all the fall and rise is just a call to dance

And she's always in time
And her love is like a river in a poem
Penned in wine
That takes you floating forever rhyme after rhyme

If she's the woman that you live for
Make her feel how much you need her
If she's the woman you love",If She

The season for the rodeo is over
And he's usually back home this time of year
But I haven't heard a word since
He called me from Santa Fe
Something in his voice said you were stealing him away

New Mexico - have i lost him to your sunset
Do your mountains life him higher than my love
New Mexico - guess we'll have to wait and see
If tomorrow's gonna bring him back to me

He said he'd never seen a place more beautiful
And he talked of maybe moving there someday
Where the stars in the sky shine like diamonds every night
I wonder if he sees those stars in someone else's eyes

He's in a bar, and she's in the bedroom crying
He thinks he'll drown all the hurt that he's feeling inside
A river of tears is washing away her every reason for trying
And the distance between them is silence, anger and pride

They don't talk to each other
They're no longer lovers
They won't even say the three words that could keep love from dying
She needs a shoulder, he needs to hold her
But he's in a bar, and she's in the bedroom crying

He tells the bartender his problems and thanks him for listening
Then he orders more whiskey to have something warm he can hold
She picks up the phone, and calls up a friend, 
And says she wishes she knew what was missing 
Both of them ask the wrong people why their love's growing cold

They don't talk to each other

You say it must be a miracle
Your heart even beats at all
After all that you've been through
You fell for too many promises, every line
And it was you that always took the fall
I know you're hurtin but don't be sad
I'm here to tell you that you've just had

A string of bad love
But don't give up
One good heart could change your luck
You've been tangled up and tied down long enough
Baby let me break the string of bad love

I've done some time on that trail of tears
And I swore I'd never love again so I know what you're going through
I fell in love with a heartbreaker every time
The road took another bend
I got over it, so will you
Have a little hope, you've just been through

A string of bad love
So don't give up
One good heart could change your luck
You've been tangled up and tied down long enough
Baby let me break the string of bad love

If you want to give it another go
Together we could take a shot
At making a love that won't unwind
Maybe we could tie a know, in that

The plan I never had a lot but I had plans
They took me down the road to where I am
I know now I'd do it all again

The dream was always just a step ahead of me
Too far to touch but close enough to see
There was always somewhere else I had to be
The dream, there's nothing more important than the dream
Without one nothing matters much it seems
It always keeps me goin where the winds of doubts are blowin
What always keeps me goin is the dream

The song it takes too many years to write the song
Where every word is just where it belongs
You wonder why on earth it takes so long
You shine if only for the very shortest time
The latest thing in melody and rhyme
And in the end you'd give up your last dime for

Talked to every old friend that she used to know
I couldn't figure out why she couldn't be found
There's only one lime green mustang in this cotton-pickin' town 
I've been a fool, there's no doubt

The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,

A sign was painted said: Private Property,
But on the back side it didn't say nothing

In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling;
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:

The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream","Laura, song (for the film, ""Laura"")"
John Williams,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart","My Foolish Heart, song (written for the film score of the same name)"

John Williams,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Flying Theme

When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love

Livin' in New South on Queensland time

He's a stockman, likes raisin' sheep,

Likes raisin' children, don't get much sleep

On the shady big verandah, with his hardworking wife,

Three young sidekicks,

It's a way of life.


Some years they make it, some years they don't

Sometimes the creek flows, sometimes it won't

Sometimes he's mean, he's got a gun

When the ewes are lambing he's got pigs on the run

Out in the lignum, on the water course

You could lose a pig dog, you could lose a horse.


Think you oughta know the channel's coming through

Wipin' out the bushland and the kangaroo

Greedy men with water rights to neutralise the land

When's it gonna stop I just don't understand.

With cotton in their ears and dollars in their eyes

Their banker grins and our country dies.


They love the bush, they grow the wool

They respect the land and it's beautiful

Bower Birds, Ring Necks and Water Hens

Red Wings and Red Tailed Black Cockatoos Think of all the rainbows we could lose

Koala Koala - we love you

But we chop down your home

And you run

Koala, Koala - where do you go

When we take your gum tree away


Please don't run on the road

And please don't cry

Help is on its way

We're gonna learn what makes you die

Gonna send in some money today


You can't dig a hole

Or live in a roof

Or hang from a big, fig tree

If I plant you a special Eucalypt

Will you come and live with me

What a paradise it could be

A walk in the bush could be heaven

I've been around the world

A couple of times or maybe more

I've seen the sights, I've had delights

On every foreign shore

But when my mates all ask me

The place that I adore

I tell them right away


Give me a home among the gumtrees

With lots of plum trees

A sheep or two, a k-kangaroo

A clothesline out the back

Verandah out the front

And an old rocking chair


You can see me in the kitchen

Cooking up a roast

Or Vegemite on toast

Just you and me, a cup of tea

And later on, we'll settle down

And go out on the porch

And watch the possums play


There's a Safeways up the corner

And a Woolies down the street

And a brand new place they've opened up

Where they regulate the heat

But I'd trade them all tomorrow

For a little bush retreat

Where the kookaburras call


Some people like their houses

With fences all around

Others live in mansions

And some beneath the ground

But me I like the bush you know

With rabbits running round

And a pumpkin vine out the back

John Williamson,"My Dad snores, does yours?
My Grandpa snores too
Through walls and doors
It rumbles right through
M'Mum's nearly goin' insane
Though she kicks him again and again
What are we going to do
Your Dad, does he snore too?

My Dad snores, does yours?
Like an old steam train
There he goes again
Like thunder and rain
We tried a peg on his nose
When he snores through the TV shows
What are we going to do
Your Dad, does he snore too?

My Dad snores, he roars
Like our old school bus
What's the fuss, he says
What's the matter with us
So we taped him on a blank cassette
But he still doesn't believe us yet
What are we going to do
Your Dad, does he snore too?",My Dad Snores
John Williamson,"Send down the rain, Lord, if you don't mind.
Send down the rain, lightning and thunder,
If my crops don't get a drink we cannot stay
I'll take my wife and kid's, an' just walk away

Yes, send down the rain, Lord, if you don't mind
Send down the rain, lightning and thunder
I grew like a tree on this farm and I'm goin' to die
I couldn't live in town, my roots go deep down

Yes, send down the rain so I can stand in it
Send down the rain, just like cats 'n' dogs
Fill up the crack's, float a few logs down the river

Send down the rain, Lord, if you don't mind
Send down the rain, lightning and thunder
It's just plain dirt but it's the world to me
I love all the bird's, I love every tree

Send down the rain, Lord, if you don't mind
Send down the rain, lightning and thunder
I've never been known to pray, but it's worth a try

John Williamson,"We had a cat
His name was Bill
He caught our budgie on the window sill
One holy day, one Sunday morn
Left only feathers on our back lawn
Oh no Bill, you can't do that
You silly pussy, you stupid cat
So we took him down, our family pet
And we left his balls with the family vet

Well the very next day he packed his bags
Left all his penthouse and playboy mags
How could we do it to the family vet
Go and leave his balls with the family vet
Well we get no postcards, no telephone calls
He's out in the bush somewhere, with no balls
And he's obsessed with sweet revenge
So he eats our parrots and our fairy wrens

[Chorus: x2]
Yes he's mortified and we all regret 
That we Left his balls with the family vet


How he's highly sought by the feral choir 
For his new found talent to sing much higher
Has no more time for female friends
Only parrots and fairy wrens
No sense of humor, ex-family pet
He's still angry, he's still upset
It still hurts, he can't forget
That we left his balls with the family vet

John Williamson,"Well it cost me thirty bucks to fix my budgie,
When the little blighter only cost me five.
The veterinary surgeon saw me coming,
But I had to keep my feathered friend alive;

He was shaking on his perch, the kids were crying,
The family gathered round his little cage.
I said I think it's time we got a new one,
That's when the family went into a rage.
	
Oh, the waiting room ponged like a rat house,
With heart worms and lung worms and lice.
And a Persian had her eye on the shoebox,
I suppose she thought our budgie might be nice.

Well the bird shit on the veterinary surgeon,
I heard him say the dirty little chick.
Guess he wondered why I didn't use my brains
And hit him over the head with a brick.

[Chorus]
Oh antibiotics for his color,
Two drops a day on his beak.
Some powder on the nose for his feathers
And clean out his cage twice a week.

Well it cost me thirty bucks to fix my budgie
When the little blighter only cost me five
And the bludger wakes me early in the morning,
It's got me puzzled how he survives.

One night I'll feed him to the tom cat.
Instead of worrying about him when we go away.
No-one wants to feed a shitty budgie,
When everyone's on holiday.

[Chorus]",Budgie Song
John Williamson,"Teary eyes at the window,
Where did Mum and Dad go?
I wish someone would hurry up and come and get me,
Gee I'm scared
The cat shot through, She saw the light and fled.
Cracker night was a real big deal, when I was a little kid
They started lettin' them off after tea I ran inside and hid
And all the dogs from everywhere were underneath me bed.

We all went down in our dressing gowns to see the big bonfire
Wide eyes watched the straw man burn on a mile-high pile of tires
Hot as hell, big black smell and red hot rings of wire.

Sky rockets zinging,
Catherine wheels spinning,
What a flamin' evening,
Fire trucks were screaming
Smoky haze hangin' round for days
And Grandma's ears were ringing.

Every night after school draggin' bits of wood,
Boxes and branches and rotten old fences,
And mattresses were good.
We even scrounged a vinyl lounge
And anything we could

Little Guy Fawkes's and letter boxes
Blown all out of shape
Light the wick and back off quick,
And make the big escape
Cackin' ourselves and rippin' my shirt
Scrambling through the gate

Sky rockets zinging
Catherine wheels spinning
What a flamin' evening
Fire trucks were screaming
Smoky haze hangin' round for days
And Grandma's ears were ringing.

A house burnt down on the edge of town
We all took off with Pa
This thing whizzed across the road
And nearly hit our car
A bang and spark lit up the park
And everyone went Ah! Ah! Ah!

Cracker night was a real big deal,
When I was a little kid,
It seems like only yesterday
Tucked away in bed
Dreams of schemes and double bunger
Daring things we did",Cracker Night
John Williamson,"Havin' a barbie by the river
With no one else around
A tropical honeymoon
Knocking a Four X down
She was standing in the water
Eating a pumpkin scone
When crunch! she was gone

They were doing the crocodile roll
The woman and the reptile
Doing the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

Down came her husband
With a gun and a carving knife
To slaughter every crocodile
For taking his darling wife

You can't go round eating Queens landers
You overgrown goannas
I'll turn you all into shoes
Crunch!

It was in the news
They were doin the crocodile roll
The husband and the reptile
Doin the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

Down came his bloodhound
With mangy curly hair
Picked up the scent
Away he went
Bum in the air
Then the dog got carried away
And ran out on a log
When church! no more dog

They were doing the crocodile roll
The canine and the reptile
Doing the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

Down came a wild pig
Rooting all about
The little swine
Drank the wine
And really pigged it out
Then the crocodile chased him round
And the little pig said ""up yours!""
Crunch! into another crocs jaws

They were doing the crocodile roll
The porker and the reptile
Doing the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

There's no moral to the story
Just a brand new dance
Grab your partner by the neck
And swing your crocodile pants
Dip your toe in the water
Are you ready for romance?
Swirl your tail around the floor
C'mon take a chance

Now your doing the crocodile roll
Stirring up the mud
Doing the crocodile roll
In the middle of the river

They were doing the crocodile roll
Stirring up the mud crabs
Doing the crocodile roll

Of the Digger who gives a mate a hand
And in the end they showed the world
The spirit of Australia

To grow up as he likes, to grow anything under lights

To hang a hide, to hide the dry or hang to pay the bills

Well my old shed, she leaks a bit, the roof is caving in
Nothing that a bloke can't fix with a few spare sheets of tin

Sticky tall green leaves came up from thrown out seeds
All it took was bantam poop, I watered 'em once and they grew some
They should be prime 'bout Easter time if no nosy neighbor steals 'em

And I couldn't sing a song with a trombone

John Williamson,"When I was a young man I carried a pack 
I lived the free life of a rover 
From the Murray's green basin till the dusty outback 
I waltzed my matilda right over 

Then in nineteen fifteen, the country said son 
There's no time for roamin' there's work to be done 
And they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun 
And they sent me away to the war 

And the band played Waltzing Matilda 
As the ship pulled away from the quay 
And amidst all the cheers, the flag waving and tears 
We set off for Gallipoli 

How well I remember that terrible day 
When our blood stained the sand and the water 
And how in that hell that they called Suvla bay 
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter 

Johnny Turkey was waiting, he primed himself well 
Showered us with bullets and he rained us with shells 
And in five minutes flat, well he blew us to hell 
He nearly blew us right back to Australia 

And the band played Waltzing Matilda 
As we stopped to bury our slain 
We buried ours and the Turks buried theirs 
Then we started all over again 

So those who were left just tried to survive 
In a mad world of blood and fire 
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive 
As the corpses around me piled higher 

Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head 
And when I awoke in the hospital bed 
I saw what it had done and I wished I was dead 
Then I knew there were worse things than dying 

And I'll go no more Waltzing Matilda 
All through the green bush far and free 
Coz to hunt and tent peg 
A man needs both legs 
No more waltzing matilda for me 

They collected the crippled, the wounded, the maimed 
Shipped us all back to Australia 
The legless, the armless, the blind and insane 
The brave wounded heroes of Suvla Bay 

And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay 
I looked at the place where my legs used to be 
And I thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me 
To mourn and to grieve and to pity 

And the band played Waltzing Matilda 
As they carried us down the gangway 
Nobody cheered, they just stood and stared 
Then turned all their faces away 

And now every April I sit on the porch 
As I watch the parade pass before me 
I see my old comerades, how proudly they march 
Reviving old dreams and past glories 

But the old men march slowly, bones stiff and sore 
Tired old men from a tired old war 
And the young people ask 'what are they marching for' 
And I ask myself the same question 

And the band played Waltzing Matilda 
As the old men still answer the call 
Year after year more old men disappear 
Soon none of them will march there at all",And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda
John Williamson,"We have drifted apart
Broken hearts, me and you
After all of this time
I'm satisfied inside to know

This memory that I had
It's more good than bad
You taught me how to sing
And bring you love

After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone

by John Williamson


Where ancient mountains are whittled down

Millions of years to a little mound

Where giant feet are fossil found

I see spinifex surfing on a dune,

The rock is redder in the afternoon

Tourists clicking madly soon


Where spring will come with any rain

A chance to flower and seed again

Forever garden risin' plain

The dangers of the wild remain


And away up there where the wind is blown

Never before felt so alone

More aware of skin and bone

I watch the parade of human folk

Strips of rubber, cans of Coke

Making dust and blowing smoke


Where the awe-inspiring power of time

Leave some fearful, some sublime

White man finds his progress prime

Black man feels no urge to climb


Now I believe we all are one

Features and creatures in the sun

Breathing the air we all belong

I have a dream I can't explain

Wattle soldiers, making claim

And paradise returns again

From gold down to violet the soul has been burned
And I understand fully why they have returned

Cause I'm into cattle, my Father was too
From Great Great Grandfather all the way through
And we've never been guilty of wasting daylight
We work hard, we play hard and we sleep well at night

Oh, six generations where camels run free
I hope I am never too blind to see
How fortunate, how proud can an old fella be

John Williamson,"You've heard about Ned Kelly and those other famous crooks
I've seen them on the TV, I've seen them in my picture books
Well, here's a little song about a bloke so bad and mean
An evil, vicious outlaw, the worst there's ever been

Oh, out in the bush where the kookaburras fly where the gum trees reach to the clear blue sky
There's a cave in the hillside where I hide, I'm a big, bad bush-bushranger

Deep in the cave there's a big, black hole that's filled to the brim with locks of gold
And diamond rings and things I stole, I'm a big, bad bush-bush ranger

Late at night when the sun goes down and everyone's asleep in town
I count all my money in my dressing gown, I'm a big, bad bush-bushranger

I'm a bush, I'm a bush, I'm a bush-bush ranger
Runnin' from the law, livin' on danger
Bang, bang, hands up, stick 'em up straight
I'm a big, bad bush-bush ranger

Got a rope and a whip and a gun, of course, I'm chased everywhere by the bush police-force
While I ride through the night on my big black horse, I'm a big, bad, bush-bush ranger

And when the townsfolk see me ride they lock all the doors and stay inside
And find a place that's safe to hide, I'm a big, bad, bush-bush ranger

I ride thirty miles through the wind and hail to hold up a bank or the Royal Mail
I give all my money to my girlfriend, Gayle, I'm a big, bad, bush-bush ranger

I'm a bush, I'm a bush, I'm a bush-bush ranger
Runnin' from the law, livin' on danger

John Williamson,"Oh there once was a swagman camped in a billabong
Under the shade of a coolibah tree
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled

Up got the swaggie and grabbed him with glee

John Williamson,"Wouldn't you like to ride along a country road
I'll give you a gentle push
I swell with pride to see the countryside
When I wander aimlessly through the bush
'Cause that's where I get my music
And that's where I live my life
You can call me a jolly swagman if you like

Call it humpin' my bluey,I reckon that's the style
So why don't you climb aboard with me, along the road a while

Been workin' in the big smoke, singin' at the pub
I talk to people everywhere - they still love the scrub
Longing for a piece of land and the Eucalyptus air
So why don't you come with me, I'll take you there

Maybe we'll find a shack somewhere
Plant an avocado tree
With fences only to deep out the cows
Share a dream with me

I've spent some time in your town, at every waterhole
'Cause I must drink a big brown land to quench a thirsty soul

Through cattle, sheep and hills of golden grain

John Williamson,"It's time to think of why we're proud to be a part of
A land so ancient, so hard to get a hold of
Why the kangaroo and emu is on the baggy green
Why do we sing of coolabahs, billabongs and cockatoos
Do we really care, are we aware of what we lose
While we knock it down again and again and again

C'mon wattle soldiers, wildlife warriors get angry
They'll call you green, they'll call you red
Just stay strong and turn your head
And think of little bilbies and gliders and rare wallabies
Now's the time to stir again
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time, IT'S TIME

Yeah, it's time to stop the slaughter of our native land
No more telling lies, drawing lines in the sand
Maybe we didn't know but surely now it's underhand
No more crocodile tears, did he die in vain
Did he make us cry, did he suffer all his pain
So we could knock it down again and again and again",Wildlife Warriors: It's Time

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

I'm in the mood for love?

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,

You just meant to share with me pleasure

You can feel your own heart beating in your chest
This life's not over yet
So we get up on our feet and do our best
We play against the fear
We play against the reasons not to try
We're playing for the tears
Burning in the happy angel's eyes

And it's love who stacked these stones
And it's love who made the stage here

But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out

Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

John Zuerner,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful

I wanna go and bounce the moon

John's Children,"Met a man he was nice
Said his name was paradise
Didn't realise at the time
That his face and mind were mine
Hippy Gumbo he's no good
Chop him up for firewood
It seemed good and it seemed right
That I should dig him on the night
But in the morning with the sun he pulled an automatic gun
He blew my soul, he blew my brain
He said I could not do the same
Hippy Gumbo he's no good
Chop him up for firewood
Hippy Gumbo he's no good
Chop him up and burn the wood.

John's Children,"Sara Crazy Child is devouring all the street 
With her pastel tortured dress 
And her seductive bongo beat 
Her skin's wild like the olives 
And her Body's bitter sweet 
Still she's only just thirteen 

And she's forgotten how to dream 
Her brother the Juke Box King 
With his venom mouthy sting 
And his knowledge twisted hair 
And his 1920's stare 
He lives beneath the roadway 

In a Minotaur's lair 
In summer he's a young boy 
But in winter he's a bear 
Broken dusty mama 
Her face melted just like wax 

Her once gazelle like features 
Bloodied by the age axe 
Sepia picture postcard 
Of the twosome of their home 
Soullessly they submitted to 
The guillotine of their own",Sara Crazy Child

Blown out my mind, I can't keep up the pace
I'm selling all my midnight, still broke and living on the ground
My gone little mama cut out without a sound

With my greased-up levis,
Baseball boots above my head
If it wasn't such a tragedy
I might wish I was dead

She took my ice-cream mustang
And my purple coloured dodeville
She even took my panpipes and my elixir of life pill

He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northen lights a-runnin' wild

I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight

Turnin' and tossin'  tossin' and turnin' all night
I threw the blankets on the floor, turned my pillow upside down

Johnnie Lee Wills,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water

You and your love brings me ecstasy!

But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night
Johnnie Ray,"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day
Johnnie Ray,"Dinner is ended, the music is grand,
Softly the lanterns gleam.
Isn't it splendid to sit hand in hand,
Silently lost in a dream?

Hands across the table
While the lights are low,
Tho' you hush your lips,
Your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know.
Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly,
And they say in their little way 
That you belong to me

Silence is golden, so do not reply,
And I shall understand.
All can be told in a look of your eye,
And in a touch of your hand.

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin'
Johnnie Ray,"Will I ever find the boy in my mind
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me
Will I recognise the light in his eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass him by
And never even know that he is my ideal?

Or maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be

Johnnie Ray,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, and maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless (I'm in Love With You)
Johnnie Ray,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song

Starting with the ABC of it 
Getting right down to the XYZ of it 
Help me solve the mystery of it

The sky's a blackboard high above you 
And if a shooting star goes by 
I'll use that star to write ""I love you""

One thing isn't very clear my love 
Teachers shouldn't stand so near my love 
Graduation's almost here my love 
You'd better teach me tonight 

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two 
And I've also met a chick or two 
But I still can learn a trick or two 
Hey teach me tonight 

I who thought I knew the score of it 
Kind of think I should know much more of it 
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it 
Hey teach me tonight 

The midnight hours come slowly creeping 
When there's no one there but you 
There must be more to life than sleeping 
Single in a bed for two 

What I need most is post graduate 
What I feel is hard to articulate 
If you want me to matriculate 
You'd better teach me tonight

He's a devil not a man

Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for you and me

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water, cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water, cool, clear, water

The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water, cool, water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water, cool, clear, water

Just one thing more than water, cool, water

Are you on the trail of buffalo?

Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?

Empty boots covered with dust
Where do you walk tonight?
