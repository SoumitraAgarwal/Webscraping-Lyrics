Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I have a heart that's proud, you bet
I have a mind that won't forget
And I have arms that are strong and yet
Tender when they want to to be

Well, you can be the will that finds the way
And you can be the one who saves the day
But show me tender when it's time to say
Exactly how it ought to be

And I never would've known it, darlin'
If I hadn't known about you
You said everyone can be a rock-'n'-roll like a river too

Well, something happens when you find someone
Who makes you feel like you can do no wrong
No, you don't have to take the whole world on
Just be tender when you want be

And I never would have known it, baby
If I hadn't known about you
You said everyone can be a rock-'n'-roll like a river too

So let the waters carry us away
Wave goodbye to the old parade
Baby, when we're unafraid
To be tender when we want to be

All the waters wash our cares away
All that we can see are better days
Don't ever let me hesitate
To be tender when I want to be",Tender When I Want to Be
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"If you ever need to hear a voice
In the middle of the night 
When it seems so black outside
That you can't remember light 
Ever shone on you or the ones you love
In this or another lifetime

And the voice you need to hear
Is the true and the trusted kind
With a soft, familiar rhythm
In these swirling, unsure times
When the waves are lapping in
And you're not sure you can swim 
Well, here's the lifeline

If you ever need to feel a hand
Take up your own 
When you least expect
But want it more than you've ever known 
Baby, here's that hand
And, baby, here's my voice that's calling
This is love, all it ever was and will be 
This is love 

And if you ever need some proof
That time can heal your wounds 
Just step inside my heart
And walk around these rooms 
Where the shadows used to be
You can feel as well as see
How peace con hover 
Now time's been here to fix
What's broken with its power 
The love that smashed us both to bits
Spent its last few hours 
Calling out your name
I thought this is the kind of pain 
From which we don't recover 

But I'm standing here now
With my heart held out to you 
You would've thought a miracle
Was all that got us through 
Well, baby, all I know
All I know is I'm still standing 
And this is love, all it ever was and will be 
This is love 

And I see you still
And there's this catch in my throat
And I just swallow hard till it leaves me 
There's nothing in this world 
That can change what we know 
Still I know I am here if you ever need me 
And this is love 

And if you ever think of me
Let it be around twilight 
When the world has settled down
And the last round of sunlight 
Is waning in the sky
As you sit and watch the night descending 
A car will pass out front
With lovers at the wheel 
A dog will bark out back
Ad children's voices peal 
Over and under the air
You've been there lost in the remembering 
And if you ever wish for things
That are only in the past 
Just remember that the wrong things
Aren't supposed to last 
Babe, it's over and done
And the rest is gonna come when you let it

And this is love, all that it ever was and will be 
This is love, when you let it, if you let it now 
This is love, all it ever was and can be 
This is love",This Is Love
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Baby, where's that place where time stands still?
I remember like a lover can
But I forget it like a leaver will

It's no place you can get to by yourself
You've got to love someone and they love you
Time will stop for nothing else

And memory plays tricks on us
The more we cling, the less we trust
And the less we trust, the more we hurt
And as time goes on, it just gets worse

So, baby, where's that place where time stood still?
It is under glass inside a frame
Was it over when you had your fill

And here we are with nothing
But this emptiness inside of us
Your smile a fitting, final gesture
Wish I could have loved you better

Baby, where's that place where time stands still?
I remember like a lover can
But I forget it like a leaver will

It's the first time that you held my had
It's the smell and the taste and the fear and the thrill
It's everything I understand
And all the things I never will",Where Time Stands Still
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"In this world there's a whole lot of trouble, baby 
In this world there's a whole lot of pain 
In this world there's a whole lot of trouble, but 
A whole lot of ground to gain 
Why take when you could be giving?
Why watch as the world goes by?
It's a hard enough life to be living 
Why walk when you can fly?

In this world there's a whole lot of sorrow 
In this world there's a whole lot of shame 
In this world there's a whole lot of sorrow 
And a whole lot of ground to gain 
When you spend your whole life wishing 
Wanting, and wondering why 
It's a long enough life to be living 
Why walk when you can fly?

And in this world there's a whole lot of golden 
In this world there's a whole lot of pain 
In this world you've a soul for a compass 
And a heart for a pair of wings 
There's a star on the far horizon 
Rising bright in an azure sky 
For the rest of the time that you're given 
Why walk when you can fly?",Why Walk When You Can Fly
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Every heart has got a story
About love holding out a lure
Baby, when you've been that lonely
You just want a cure

Fool you once, you are forgiven
Fool you twice, you're just a fool
You fear the future's all been written
By the past and what didn't last

All the better to dream of you
The better to be this side of heaven
Believing again when a dream comes true
The better to dream of you

Every story's got a chapter
That chapter will be defined
By what's before and what comes after
This one is mine

Everything that came before us
Wore me out and weighed me down
You raised me up like a gospel chorus
Rock steady on solid ground

The better to dream of you
The better to be this side of heaven
Believing again when some dreams come true
The better to dream of you

Like an old-time tent revival
I felt my heart come back alive
No preacher, baby, no Bible
Just this love to testify

Oh, the better to dream of you
The better to be this side of heaven
Believing again some dreams come true
The better to dream of you

The better to dream of you
Yeah, stranger things they might have happened
Believing again that dreams come true
The better to dream of you

The better to dream of you
The better to be this side of heaven
Believing again some dreams come true
The better to dream of you",The Better to Dream of You
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"We were born during the boom times
Played house down in the bomb shelter
Suffered through the wonder years
And silence at the dinner hour

But once upon a summertime
Out behind the old garage
We were buzzing on midnight
Luckys and Rolling Rock

Thinking we were heroes in our own hometown
Nothing less than heroes in that old hometown

Some married on a day in June
Some disappeared without a trace
And some of us are still at large
Still searching for a better place

But once upon another time
It didn't matter what they said
Didn't matter if we fell behind
We'd still come out ahead

'Cause we believed in heroes in that old hometown
Hey, you could be a hero in your own hometown

Now I'm long away and very far
From gazing at an evening sky
From wishing on a shooting star
From thinking that a heart can't lie

This world is gonna wear you thin
Knot you up and spin you round
This world will take its aim, call you every name
Trying to bring you down

Everything seems so clear 
When you're looking back from such a distance
When the road not taken disappears
Into the path of least resistance

But once upon a time oh-so long ago
Underneath this same old sky, every brand new road

Would know that we were heroes in our own hometown
Nothing less than heroes in that old hometown
We still loved a hero in our own hometown
Baby, you could be a hero in your own hometown",Hero in Your Own Hometown
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I can see it now, walking by myself
And suddenly you're there walking with somebody else
I can see it now, what's right up ahead
A scene I've played a thousand times over in my head

I can see it now; it isn't just a dream
Can't shake myself awake, can't fall right back to sleep
Face to face I come right up to the truth
I can see it now; I'm still not over you

I can hear it now, your voice saying my name
It's too late for me to walk the other way
I can hear it now, asking how I've been
Oh, and by the way have you met my friend?

I can hear it now, a breaking all apart
A strange familiar sound that's coming from my heart
Feeling just as bad as the day that it was new
I can see it now; I'm still not over you

When you're out of sight, baby, you're still on my mind
You're much too hard to lose, you're too easy to find
Like a bottle to a drunk, like trouble to a fool
I've only ever seen just what I've wanted to

I can feel it now as you walk away
Something left unsaid and the nothing left to say
I can feel it now like weather in my bones
Before it even comes, before I even know

I can feel it now, the empty and the ache
That bitter little pill that I don't want to take
Instead I'd swallow all the pride I ever knew
To crawl back if you asked, all that I would do
I can see it now",I Can See It Now
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I want to be your girlfriend; I want to be your new love
I want to be the one that you can't get enough of
I want to be your girlfriend, nobody else's but yours
I want to be the one who you'll do anything for

Never thought I'd ever wind up in a daze like this
Never thought I'd ever find myself wondering how you kiss
I see you nearly everyday, and everyday I lose my nerve
That I built up the night before, rehearsing every single word

I want to be your girlfriend; I want to be your new love
I want to be the one that you can't get enough of

You used to be just this guy I knew from that same old scene
For all the time that I've known you, just now I'm noticing
That everything there is to feel feels worse than any teenage crush
And all the times that I've been near you, now I can't get near enough

Oh, I want to be your girlfriend, nobody else's but yours
I want to be the one who you'll do anything for

I just keep on hoping that you're gonna see
If I could notice you, then you could notice me
Then I'd be more to you; oh, I just want to be

I want to be your girlfriend; I want to be your new love
I want to be the one that you can't get enough of
I'm gonna be your girlfriend, nobody else's but yours
I want to be the one who you'll do anything for",I Want to Be Your Girlfriend
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"When it's been that kind of day, baby
When everything is not what it should be
Everybody's had their say
Let's just say today is history

And keep keeping the faith
Keeping the faith, everyday
We're keeping the faith
Keep keeping the faith
Don't give it away

When your head's not making sense, baby
When your heart is just a mystery
When you're sitting on the fence
Instead of knowing where you're supposed to be

[Chorus]
Well, just keep keeping the faith
Keeping the faith, everyday
We'll be keeping the faith
Keep keeping the faith
Don't give it away

All the style, all the money
All the power you can buy
Won't do nothing if there's something missing
Way down deep inside

It's the weary, it's the lonesome
It's the forest that we just can't see
Don't forget now there ain't no one
Who isn't trying to see beyond the trees

So, just keep keeping the faith
Keeping the faith, everyday
We'll be keeping the faith
Keep, keeping the faith
Don't give it away

Keeping the faith
Keeping the faith, everyday
We'll be keeping the faith
Keeping the faith
Don't give it away",Keeping the Faith
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Been walking these streets, been deciding what's true
Been hands in my pockets, coat collar up, thinking 'bout you
I've been talking to myself, giving fate the third degree
I've been eyes on the pavement, admitting my part to strangers passing me

And I know it isn't fair, but nothing's ever been
Hey, when you look at me, baby, my god, how I feel so good again
I don't know where I went wrong, but it isn't right to lie
Hey, when you look at me, baby, my heart's wide open, naked to the eye

Now some lovers are apart, but they're never far away
I can see her in your eyes, hear her in your voice, and I have to turn away
Oh, what covet is to ache, is what aching is to me
For the arms of a man who knows who I am and where I need to be

And if I know what I know, then the lonely can't pretend
When you look at me, baby, my god, how I feel so whole again
Is there heaven after all, or just this empty space
That no amount of time, nor comfort in its hands can ever help me face?
Which is worse is yet to come, your rebuff or my resign
Hey, when you look at me, baby, I'm helpless as a child, naked to the eye

It's like a fever and a spell, unbroken by a sigh
Oh, when you look at me, baby, I'm going nowhere, just naked to the eye
Yeah, when you look at me, baby, everything's there, naked to the eye
Hey, when you look at me, baby, I haven't got a prayer, naked to the eye",Naked to the Eye
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"What I'm looking for after all this time
Keeps me moving forward, trying to find it
Since I learned to walk, all I've done is run
Ready, on my mark, doesn't everyone
Need a place in the world?

Could be right before your very eyes
Just beyond a door that's open wide
Could be far away or in your own backyard
There are those who say you can look too hard
For your place in the world

Takes some of us a little longer
A few false starts gonna make you stronger
When I'm sure I've finally found it
Gonna wrap these arms all around it

Could be one more mile or just one step back
In a lover's smile, down a darkened path
Friends will take our side, enemies will curse us
But to be alive is to know your purpose
It's your place in the world
Your place in the world
Your place in the world",A Place in the World
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Some people need to know what to expect
Need to keep control, need to keep one step
Ahead of every chance, as if chance decides
Who it's gonna pass, who it will reward
They don't understand; chances don't keep score
They just find us when we're there to find

[Chorus]
And so this has to be a sudden gift of fate
You're nothing less to me than a sudden gift of fate
It's not as if it comes down to your turn
That someone somewhere feels you've earned
You just learn to wait for sudden gifts of fate

Some people have never been the lonely kind
Never called a friend in the middle of the night
Just to hear a voice say it's okay
And now I hear you speak each and every word
That I didn't think lonely people heard
You took a long night and turned it into day

[Chorus]

You can celebrate; gifts are never late
You just learn to wait for sudden gifts of fate",Sudden Gift of Fate
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I'm not made of stone, I'm not made of glass
I've been alone, every one has
I've learned to forgive what I'm not
I just try to live with what I've got
Maybe I've got what you need

If you need something that not only feels right
Something that's based on a real life
One thing that's worth every page of the deal
Not some old line or rose-colored dream
Not some other time, you know what I mean
When I tell you that this is all that it seems and that's real

How far can I crawl out on this limb
There's so far to fall and here comes the wind
There's so much to lose, but love doesn't wait
So I'll be a fool who found out too late
But I've been a fool for far lesser things

And I want something that not only feels right
Something that's based on a real life
One thing that's worth every page of the deal
Not some old line or rose-colored dream
Not some other time, you know what I mean
When I tell you that this is all that it seems and that's real

Not some old line or rose-colored dream
Not some other time, you know what I mean
When I tell you that I'm, I'm all that I seem, and that's real
And that's real
And that's real
And that's real",That's Real
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"What if we went to Italy
A suitcase of books and one bag a piece for the summer?
I don't speak a word of Italian
Except for Campari and soda for two
How much is a Lire? Yes, a villa will do
And a breeze in Tuscany please

What if we spent all of our days
Improving our minds, learning new ways to be lazy
It wouldn't be too much of a strain
Relax after breakfast till lunch comes around
Can't wait for dinner; oh, I need to lie down
And refuel out by the pool

What if the ancients were lazy like us
Too blissed-out to paint, to sketch, or to sculpt
Just as relaxed as the tower of Pisa
Not ever missing that old Mona Lisa

What if we never got back on the plane
As summer turned colder and then warmer again
Losing all track of the passing of years
Till it no longer mattered how long we'd been here

What if we went to Italy
Maybe next year, just you and me for the summer
I still can't speak any Italian
But words are replaced under Siennese skies
By nothing so much as a nod and a sigh
And a wish to be always like this",What If We Went to Italy
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Some people remember the first time
Some can't forget the last
Some just select what they want to from the past
It's a song that you danced to in high school
It's a moon you tried to bring down
On a four-in-the-morning drive through the streets of town

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a photograph taken in Paris, at the end of the honeymoon
In 1948, late in the month of June
Your parents smile for the camera in sienna shades of light
Now you're older than they were then that summer night

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a need you never get used to, so fierce and so confused
It's a loss you never get over the first time you lose

And tonight I am thinking of someone, seventeen years ago
We rode in his daddy's car down the river road

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand
Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand
Come on come on
","Come on, Come On"
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I saw my life this morning
Lying at the bottom of a drawer
All this stuff I'm saving
God knows what this junk is for 
And whatever I believed in
This is all I have to show
What the hell were all reasons
For holding on for such dear life
Here's where I let go

I'm not running
I'm not hiding
I'm not reaching
I'm just resting in the arms of the great wide open
Gonna pull my soul in
And I'm almost home

I saw you this morning
You were looking straight at me
From an ancient photograph
Stuck between letters and some keys
I was lost just for a moment
In the ache of old goodbyes
Sometimes all that we can know is
There's no such thing as no regrets
Baby it's all right

I'm not running
I'm not hiding
I'm not reaching
I'm just resting in the arms of the great wide open
Gonna pull my soul in
And I'm almost home
There's no such thing as no regrets
But baby it's alright
I'm not running
I'm not hiding
I'm not reaching
I'm just resting in the arms of the great wide open
Gonna pull my soul in
And I'm almost home",Almost Home
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Saturday night and the moon is out 
I gonna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
Find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight
 
And I never have wandered down to New Orleans,
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio,
And I swore someday I was gonna go
Down a highway 10 past Lafayett
There's a Baton Rouge and I won't forget to send you a card with my regrets
'Cause I'm never gonna come back home
 
Saturday night and the moon is out 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight
Hey
 
They gotta alligator stew and a crawfish pie,
A gulf storm blowin' into town tonight
Livin' on the delta it's quite a show
They got hurricane parties ev'ry time it blows?
But here up north it's a cold, cold rain,
And there ain't no cure for my blues today 
Except when the paper says Beousoleil is a comin' into town
Baby let's go down 
 
It's Saturday night and the moon is out 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
Find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight
 
Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring you sister too
They got lots of music and lots of room
When they play you a waltz form a nineteen ten, 
You're gonna fell a little bit young again
Well you learn to dance with you rockin' roll,
You learn to swing with do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais so do?
When you hear a little Jolie Blon
 
Saturday night and the moon is out 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
Find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet

When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Show a little inspiration, show a little spark
And show that things that drew me to you and stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean something to you

Our hearts are beating while we sleep, but while we're wide awake
You know the world won't stop, actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Show a little passion, baby, show a little style
And show the knack for knowing when and the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us when fear obscures the path
You know we got this far, darling, not by luck
But by never turning back, no turning back

Some will call on destiny, but I just call on faith
'Cause the world won't stop, actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, to what your heart might say
Everything you got, you got the hard way

Caught up in our little lives, there's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes
You're searching for that field of clover

So show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show the world a great big light when you show it your heart
We've got two lives, one we're given and the other one we make

And the world won't stop, actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and your heart will say
Everything we got, we got the hard way
Everything we got, we got the hard way
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Because the world won't stop
Hang on, baby

",The Hard Way [Live] [Live]
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I took a walk in the rain one day on the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rails till I saw that train
Just to see how my heart would react
Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate

And for them I would not disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me

I take my chances, I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get

I sat alone in the dark one night
Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat

He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And threw away my cigarettes

I take my chances, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get

I've crossed lines of words and wire
And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out
And I've been on fire and the tears are mine to weep

Now I can cry until I laugh and laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half, I'll play from either side

I take my chances, I pay my dollar and I place my bet
I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get
I take my chances, I don't cling to remorse or regret
I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get
I take my chances

I take my chances

",I Take My Chances [Live] [Live]
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"The stars are out tonight
The breeze is warm and light
As I'm walking right back to you
Along the dreaming road, the only way to go
When I'm traveling by our code, that north is true
Once upon a time these same bright stars did shine
Down the center line leading here
Nearly thirty years ago
Now the map is stained and old
But on the dreaming road the coast is clear
I loved you more than life and I guess that's why I died
When you would not love me back, I couldn't survive
And so the girl I was turned into someone else
Keeping to myself and from the light
I wasn't odd or strange, just quietly rearranged
Sometimes the biggest change stays out of sight

So without plot or clue I ran away from you
I was twenty-two and drunk in Amsterdam
Got robbed in Paris, France
Got home on one last chance
And without a backward glance I began again
And the days just kept on rolling and I just kept on going
Without a thought of ever slowing down
I made this long road mine
But it was not the dreaming kind
Too many lost souls trying to get found
But beneath this ancient sky
One night we did collide
And the hole I thought was sealed opened wide
I tried so hard again not to fall back in
But you had me then by the throat
And a strange serenity came washing over me
Almost peacefully I felt the rope

A million miles goes by in the blink of an eye
And so I cannot try to slow time down
And years are made of sand slipping through my hands
Even faster than the speed of sound
The stars are out tonight
The breeze is soft and light
As I'm walking right back to you
With nothing left to hide, the tears have all been cried
And the girl who died is walking too
Down the dreaming road, where the light is always gold
The air is never cold and always fine
And north is always true and you are always you
And I'm that girl you knew once upon a time",The Dreaming Road
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"You could be this man; he's got it all worked out
To the nth degree, no fears, no doubts
He'll retire at thirty to his big-ass house
Next to the putting green

Now he's got a picture in his head of the perfect wife
Their perfect children, their perfect life
Nothing wrong with that
Coming home each night to his cul-de-sac of dreams

Funny now how it all went by so fast
One day he's looking over his shoulder at the past
When everybody had to go, had to be, had to get somewhere
How did he forget about what got him there?

Now you could be this woman; she's the CEO
She's got her power suits and her IPOs
She punched a hole in the ceiling years ago
And she hasn't pulled back since

Now there's a gardener for the flowers
A cook for the meals, a maid for the laundry
An accountant for the bills, a walker for the dog 
And a trainer when she feels the need to lose an inch

Funny now how it all went by so fast
One day she's looking over her shoulder at the past
When everybody had to go, had to be, had to get somewhere
Somehow she forgot about what got her there

Accidents and inspiration lead you to your destination
Or you could be the one who takes the long way home
Roll down your window, turn off your phone
See your life as a gift from the great unknown
And your task is to receive it

Tell your kid a story, hold your lover tight
Make a joyful noise, swim naked at night
Read a poem a day, call in well sometimes and
Laugh when they believe it

Funny now how it all goes by so fast
One day I'm looking over my shoulder at the past
Now everybody's got to go, got to be, got to get somewhere
Baby, don't forget about
You really shouldn't forget about
Baby, don't forget what got you there
I think it's what got you there
Yeah, it's really what got you there
You know what got you there",The Long Way Home
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"It's all I hate, but oh-so tempting
Fills me up, but leaves me empty
It's all regrets and second chances
What's the point of backward glances
That lead me nowhere?
I can't go back there

[Chorus]
Everything is so uncertain
All happening to you in a whirl
That's the beauty and the hurting
Of living in a maybe world

Who can stand all those should-haves
They wake us up and make us feel bad
The famous road will stay un-taken
All mistakes are worth making
Go back to sleep now
It all works out somehow

I'm sorry for the rain that broke the dam that caused the flood
I'm sorry for the pain, but that's the way it is because

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"You're making lists today
Of all the things you haven't done yet
You're driving everyone crazy
Are you having any fun yet?

Shrink says here's a little blue pill
Too young for your mid-life crisis
Mirror says you're over the hill

[Chorus]
There's nothing wrong with you
The simple life gets complicated
There's nothing you can do
Just enjoy the view be glad you made it

You're making resolutions
And it isn't even New Year's
You could try a new religion
You could wait until the dust clears

Guru says control your breathing
You're afraid you might have peaked

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Don't want to need the way I need you
Don't want to feel like this
Holding back all the words, but not the kiss
For the moment my heart begins to murmur
The moment of truth arrives
And I know you'll shake your head and say goodbye

[Chorus]
I know the price of this to me
I'll light the candle that shines on you
I'll be a slave to the beauty, but not the truth

Don't want to fear the way I fear you'll
Hurt me because you can
I never believed I'd crave that kind of man
I've seen the trail of hearts you've broken
I've seen the traps you lay
And if I had the strength, I'd run without delay

It's dark and getting colder, and I'm the beholder
And you're all I long to see
Don't want to love the way I love you

Now it's the facts that you can't shake (and don't fear it)
Now it's just time to let him know (each new step is)
You made a big mistake (one more near it)

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"What was it like?
How did it feel?
It's so hard to tell if it was real
I know I was there, but with every day
It slips away

And I feel like a passing glance that you never gave a chance
Baby, that's not right
What was it like?

What did you say?
What did I hear?
When did it start to disappear?
I know you were there
You know that too
What did we do?

'Cause I feel like a big mistake that you managed to not quite make
And just walk away

It's always gonna be hard
To take things a little too far

Come on, baby
Yeah, it's crazy
I'll be waiting whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready

Whenever you're ready
To light a match and to burn some bridges
Try to dance on a narrow ledge that's way too high

My own true love
Farewell for a while
I'm going away
But I'll be back
Though I go 10,000 miles

10,000 miles
My own true love
10,000 miles or more
The rocks may melt
And the seas may burn
If I should not return

Oh don't you see
That lonesome dove
Sitting on an ivy tree
She's weeping for
Her own true love
As I shall weep for mine

Oh come ye back
My own true love
And stay a while with me
If I had a friend
All on this earth
You've been a friend to me","10,000 Miles"
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"So your day begins like this
Wondering what might have been
Old regrets and chances missed
Borne away on some lambent wind

The job's okay, so it doesn't inspire
Thoughts of leaving it all behind
You used to have dreams of settin' the world on fire
All you want now is peace of mind

And a beautiful racket an' whispers and roars
The bitter and sweet between the truces and the wars
The noise and the quiet, the courage and the fear
And all of the wisdom between a smile and a tear

Do your dreaming in traffic jams
You do your running in shopping malls
You do your breathing the best you can
Between car pools and cell phone calls

Who cares, you'll never live in Paris
So what, you'll never travel by Lear
How do some of us learn what matters
While others never get to hear

Such a beautiful racket an' whispers and roars
The bitter and sweet between the truces and the wars
The noise and the quiet, the courage and the fear
And all of the wisdom between a smile and a tear

Hold on
Hold on

So your day will end like this
Turning slowly down your street
Silent worlds of kitchens lit
Front yards full of fallen leaves

Trees are bare, the garden's done
Another season gone to earth
Before you blink a new one comes
Reminding you what the old one's worth

And a beautiful racket comes in whispers and roars
The bitter and sweet between the roses and the wars
The noise and the quiet, the courage and the fear
And [Incomprehensible] wisdom [Incomprehensible]

Such a beautiful racket
Such a beautiful racket, hold on
Such a beautiful racket, hold on
",Beautiful Racket
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Tonight the moon came up, it was nearly full
Way down here on earth, I could feel it's pull
The weight of gravity or just the lure of life
Made me want to leave my only home tonight

Now I'm just wonderin' how we know where we belong
Is it in a photograph or a dashboard poet's song?
Will I have missed my chance to right some ancient wrong
Should I find myself between here and gone?

Now I could grab my keys, clear out in my truck
With every cent on board bringing me their luck
An' I could drive too fast like a midnight sleeve
As if there was a way to outrun the grief

Now I'm just wonderin' how we know where we belong
In a song that's left behind, in the dream I couldn't wake from
Could I've felt the brush of a soul that's passing on
Somewhere in between, here and gone?

Up above me, wayward angels
A blur of wings and grace
One for courage, one for safety
One for just in case

I thought a light went out but now the candle shines
I thought my tears wouldn't stop then I dried my eyes
And after all of this, the truth that holds me here
Is that this emptiness is something not to fear

Yeah, I'll keep wondering how we know where we belong
After all the journey's made and the journey's yet to come
When I feel like giving up instead of going on
Somewhere in between

Yeah, I'm just wondering how we know where we belong
Is it in the arc of the moon leaving shadows on the lawn?
In the path of fireflies and a single bird at dawn
Singing in between, here and gone",Between Here and Gone
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I don't really know how I got here this time
I was only just following orders
Listening to the voice in my mind
Saying steer clear of margins and borders

So I wasn't thinking of where we would go
On a could afternoon through the mountains we drove
Up a few hairpin turns and then spread out below
The valley appeared with the sun like Elysium

I looked out the window and stared at the fields
Where the blue sky and green were colliding
I looked back at you and I knew we were sealed
By a fate that has ways of providing

Yes, sometimes you get there in spite of the route
Losing track of your life and what it's about
The road seems to know when to straighten right out
The closer you come to Elysium

They say there's a place for those who are good
With it's pearly gates swinging wide open
The rest of us here are just knocking on wood
Quietly, piously hoping

I could wonder if all of it led me to you
I could show you the arrows and circles I drew
I didn't have a map, it's the best I could do
On the fly and on the run

To dreams that were tethered like kites to the ground
To the bridges I burned, to then turning around
It was here in your heart I was finally found
And the last battle won for Elysium
",Elysium
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Girls like me aren't hard to find
We grow like roses on the vine
We wear our hearts on our sleeves
You probably know a girl like me

We live alone and in our heads
We eat standing up or in our beds
Guilt and fear merge easily
In the quiet souls of girls like me

And loneliness is like a cold
Common and no cure we're told
We take to bed per chance to dream
In the blue light of the TV screen

Girls like me like summer light
And cold beer on a summer night
And boys who aren't afraid of what they see
Inside the eyes of girls like me

And hopefulness is like a drug
It makes a girl believe in love
And if somehow you love us back
We think there's something wrong with that

Girls like me aren't hard to trust
Your deepest secrets safe with us
And when it's time we set you free
You can always count on girls like me

It's good to know a girl like me
You used to love a girl like me
",Girls Like Me
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I'm standing at a traffic light somewhere in West L.A.
Waiting for the sign to change then I'll be on my way
The noise, the heat, the crush of cars just robs me of my nerve
And someone yells and blasts their horn and pins me to the curb

I'm a stranger here, no one you would know
My ship has not come in but I keep hoping though
And I keep looking past, the sun that sets above
Saying to myself, goodnight America

And I'm driving into Houston on a rain slicked Texas road
Land so flat and sky so dark, I say a prayer to float
Should all at once the Sanasito surge beyond it's banks
Like Noah reaching higher ground I'd offer up my thanks

'Cause I'm a stranger here, no one you would know
I'm just passing through, I am therefore I go
The moon rose in the east but now it's right above
As I say aloud, goodnight America

Midnight, it's hard to see the stars
Out on a highway near Atlanta
Full of strip malls and used cars

First light just roll your window down
And smell the salty air
Perfume of Charleston Town

I'm looking with a pilgrim's eyes upon some promised land
And dreaming with my heart outstretched as if it were my hand
And I'll hit the cross Bronx just in time to beat the rush hour lock
I have no clue what time it is from this world's busted clock

I'm a stranger here, no one you would know
I'm from somewhere else, well, isn't everybody though?
I don't know where I'll be when the sun comes up
Until then sweet dreams, goodnight America",Goodnight America
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Got my work clothes on for love, sweat and dirt
All this holy dust upon my face an' shirt
Headin' uptown now, just as the shifts are changin'
To Grand Central Station

I've got my lunch box, got my hard hat in my hand
I ain't no hero, mister, just a workin' man
An' all these voices keep on askin' me to take them
To Grand Central Station, Grand Central Station

Wanna stand beneath the clock just one more time
Wanna wait upon the platform for the Hudson line
I guess you're never really all alone or too far from
The pull of home an' the stars upon that painted dome still shine

I paid my way out on the 42nd Street
I lit a cigarette and stared down at my feet
Imagined all the ones that ever stood here waitin'
At Grand Central Station, Grand Central Station

And now Hercules is starin' down at me
Next to him's Minerva and Mercury
Well, I nod to them and start my crawl
Flyers coverin' every wall, faces of the missing are all I see

Tomorrow, I'll be back there, workin' on the pile
Going in, comin' out, single file
Before my job is done there's one more trip I'm makin'

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Nothing shatters, nothing breaks
Nothing hurts and nothing aches
We've got ourselves one helluva place
In my heaven

Looking down at the world below
A bunch of whining, fighting schmo's
Up here we've got none of those
In my heaven

There's pools and lakes and hills and mountains
Music, art, and lighted fountains
Who needs bucks here, no one's counting
In my heaven

No one works, we all just play
You can pick the weather everyday
If you change your mind, that's okay
In my heaven

Grandma's up here, Grandpa too
In a condo with to-die-for views
There's presidents and movie stars
You just come as you are

No one's lost and no one's missing
No more parting just hugs and kissing
And all these stars are just for wishing
In my heaven

There's little white lights everywhere
Your childhood dog in dad's old chair
And more memories than my heart can hold
When Eva's singing 'Fields of Gold'

There's neighbors, thieves and long lost lovers
Villains, poets, kings and mothers
Up here we forgive each other
In my heaven

For every soul that's down there waiting
Holding on, still hesitating
We say a prayer of levitating
In my heaven

You can look back on your life and lot
But it can't matter what you're not
By the time you're here, we're all we've got
In my heaven

Thousand stars above you.
And at a roadside stop, 
You call to talk to a voice 
Back home that swears they love you.

Hang up the phone 
And peel out of that joint. 
You try again, God knows when,

Would you stop and talk a while

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Deep in your blood or a voice in your head
On a dark lonesome highway that finds you instead
So certain it knows you, you can't turn away
Something or someone has found you today

Genius to Jesus, maybe He saved us
But who would believe us, I can't really say
Whatever the calling, the stumbling or falling
You follow it knowing there's no other way, there's no other way

They're Zealots and preachers and readers of dreams
The righteous gel out of stand, the safe drives to sin
The lonely and lost are just waiting to hear
Any moment their purpose will be perfectly clear

And then life would mean more, than their name on their door
And that far distant shore that's so near
They'd hear the calling, the stumbling and falling
They'd follow it knowing there's nothing to fear, nothing to fear

I don't remember a voice on a dark lonesome road
When I started the journey so long ago
I was only just trying to outrun the norms
There was never a question of having a choice

Jesus to genius maybe they've seen me
But who would believe me, I can't really say
Whatever the calling, the stumbling and falling
I followed it knowing there's no other way

But who would believe me, I can't really say

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Tell me the truth, don't ask me to lie
These are the things we say
You don't need proof and, and I'm not going to try
But I think we have lost our way

I don't own the sun and I can't raise the moon
So now as the darkness falls
Love's a hard one and over too soon
Another cruel landing caused

What I can do is turn now to you
Holding my hand to my heart
All that I know is I'm watching us grow
Closer and closer apart

And now all the kings horses and all the kings men
Wait for their clarion call
Pride hears its voice and fear wins again
And there's nothing to break our fall

What I can do is turn now to you
Holding my hand to my heart
All that I know is I'm watching us grow
Closer and closer apart
Closer and closer apart

Over and over and over again
The world only spends one way
The past is a distant flicker by now
And a lesson for another day

Now my sad little boat floats on out to sea
And you're almost out of sight
I'll remember you, please don't forget me
I whisper with all my mind

All I can do is turn now to you
Holding my hand to my heart
All that I know is I'm watching us grow

All I can do is turn back to you
And wave with one hand on my heart
Of that I know this is so hard to go

'Cause after all, baby, here I am in a
Bed of roses with a punch-drunk cretin
After all, baby, here I am with you

Can't remember lookin' for omens hopin' there was gonna be a sign
Can't remember figuring out the secret was inside me all this time
I can't remember walkin' without fear towards the light you shine
But it must have happened, yeah, it must have happened
And I know it happened, yes, it must have happened
Darlin' look what happened
",It Must Have Happened
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"When you see that you're leaving
And you see that you're gone
And you see there's no saying
Goodbye

All the trees are in mourning
The light is late from the sun
Casting shadow on shadow
Now and from the sky

And it's hard not to want to turn around
It's hard not to want to back on down
We're only as strong as our hearts within
Only as strong

And all you know of where the road goes
Is someplace far and unknown
You would think you would have gotten
Used to it all by now

But each day just gets harder
Every journey alone
Never knowing if you'll make it
Back home somehow

And it's hard not to want to turn around
It's hard not to want to back on down
We're only as brave as we think we are
Only as brave

And it's hard not to want to turn it down
For some guaranteed soul-crushing merry-go-round
But it driven you straight into the ground
Driven you down

And the three greatest gifts of moving on
Are forgiveness, hope and the great beyond
After that perhaps peace can come
Peace will come

And you see that you're leaving
And you see that you're gone
",Leaving Song
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"River starts with a drop of rain somewhere in this world
Light years shape this arc of sky and sand, a precious pearl and
You will light a stranger's life by letting yours unfurled

On and on it goes, sparks upon the wind
Like the July of 4th the crown of stars and a good time grin
On and on it flies on a new bird's wing
In a beating heart, the moon light rolls and the gift of spring

You can say that you'll never matter lose or win
World won't care, and it's hard to bare such a lonely wind
You can change a strangers life by letting yours begin

On and on it goes, chances everywhere
Like the train you missed and the rain that fell on the summer air
On and on it flies like the time we've lost
It's either running out or covering all our dreams in rust

Every night the TV shows one more bad day's news
A world away from what I know and what I do
But I could save a stranger's life if I had a clue

And on and on it goes, attention must be paid
Before it seems we're once all short and a second late
On and on it flies across the stratosphere
At the speed of love, if you stop and feel it you will hear

On and on it goes, sparks upon the wind
Like the July of 4th the crown of stars and a good time grin
On and on it flies on a new bird's wing
In a beating heart, the moon light rolls and the gift of spring",On and on It Goes
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"This isn't for the ones who blindly follow
Jingoistic bumper stickers telling you
To love it or leave it and you'd better love Jesus
And get out of the way of the Red, White and Blue

This isn't for the ones who buy their six-packs
At the 7-Eleven where the clerk makes change
Whose accent makes clear he sure ain't from here
They call him a camel jockey instead of his name

No, this is for the ones who stand their ground
When the lines in the sand get deeper
When the whole world seems to be upside down
And the shots being taken get cheaper, cheaper

This isn't for the ones who would gladly swallow
Everything their leader would have them know
Bowing and kissing while the truth goes missing
""Bring it on,"" he crows, putting on his big show

This isn't for the man who can't count the bodies
Can't comfort the families, can't say when he's wrong
Playing 'I'm the decider' like some sort of Messiah
While another day passes and a hundred souls gone

No, this is for the ones who stand their ground
When the lines in the sand get deeper
When the whole world seems to be upside down
And the shots being taken get cheaper, cheaper

This is for the ones that I see above me
Three little stars in a great big sky
Light for the world and hope for the weary, they say

This isn't for the ones with their radio signal
Calling for bonfires and boycotts, they rave
Exhorting their listeners to spit on the sinners
While counting the bucks of advertising, they'll say

This isn't for you and you know who you are
So just do what you want 'cause I know that you can
But I gotta be true to myself and to you
So on with the song, I don't give a damn
",On with the Song
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"The sun's going down past the pines
And shadows grow long down the hill
Follow the path known by heart
Down to the wide open fields

The dogs never moved from the shade
The mountains were bluer than blue

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Let's go down to the fields tonight
Where the grass grows 'round our knees
Lay down in the silver light
Tripping through the trees

Broken hallow in my hand
The distance in your eyes
The path's just gone, good luck so long
Cross ourselves and hope to fly

No road maps, no signposts
No north star, no lifeboats
No cavalry coming in sight
But we're alright

Let's feel small in the world tonight
Beneath the giant sky
Forget for once who's wrong or right
Just let it all go by

Close our eyes when we grow tired
And dream of where we'll be
And night gives way to another day
Have we ever woken up this free?

No road maps, no signposts
No north star, no lifeboats
No miracles coming in sight
But we're alright

I never had a talisman
I never wore a charm
But it's not too late to believe that fate
Was always keeping us from harm

No road map, no signpost
No north star, no life boats
No miracles coming in sight

No voices to guide us
No angels beside us
No [Incomprehensible], no mystical lights
We're alright

No omens, no compass
No Seir, no prophet
No cavalry coming in sight

But we're alright

",Why Shouldn't We
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"We packed up our books and our dishes
Our dreams and your worsted wool suits
We sailed on the eighth of December
Farewell old Hudson River
Here comes the sea
And love was as new and as bright and as true
When I loved you and you loved me

Two steamer trunks in the carriage
Safe arrival we cabled back home
It was just a few days before Christmas
We filled our stockings with wishes
And walked for hours
Arm and arm through the rain, to the glassed-in cafe
That held us like hot house flowers

Living in Paris, in attics and garrets
Where the coal merchants climb every stair
The dance hall next door is filled with sailors and whores
And the music floats up through the air
There's Sancerre and oysters, cathedrals and cloisters
And time with its unerring aim
For now we can say we were lucky most days
And throw a rose into the Seine

Love is the greatest deceiver
It hollows you out like a drum
And suddenly nothing is certain
As if all the clouds closed the curtains
And blocked the sun
And friends now are strangers in this city of dangers
As cold and as cruel as they come

Sometimes I look at old pictures
And smile at how happy we were
How easy it was to be hungry
It wasn't for fame or for money
It was for love
Now my copper hair's grey as the stone on the quay
In the city where magic was

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"The past comes upon you like smoke on the air
You can smell it and find yourself gone
To a place that you lived without worry or care
Isn't that where we all once came from

Green leaves and tall trees and stars overhead
And the sound of the world through the screen
But now you sleep with the covers pulled over your head
And you never remember to dream

You think you're just standing still
One day you'll get up that hill
In the age of miracles
Is one on the way

Greenland is melting, the west is on fire
But don't ever stop praying for rain
It's a curious place between hope and desire
Different gods, but the prayer is the same

And thousand-year storms seem to form on a breeze
Drowning all living things in their paths
And when a small southern town finds a rope in a tree
We're all once again trapped in the past

It seems we're just standing still
One day we'll get up that hill
In the age of miracles
Is one on the way

We can fly through space with the greatest of ease
We can land in the dust of the moon
We can transform our lives with the tap of the keys
Still we can't shake this feeling of doom

But I woke to find monks pouring into the streets
Marching thousands strong into the rain
Now if courage comes dressed in red robes and bare feet
I will never be fearful again

If I'm just standing still
One day I'll get up that hill
In the age of miracles, is one on the way

Seems we're just standing still

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I found myself between two places
Neither of them home
I could not recognize the faces
I've never felt so alone
So alone

I found myself between two choices
To settle or to run
All my life I've heard the voices
This time mine's the only one
The only one

I want to feel what the wind feels like
I want to go that high
And feel no fear instead of being down here
Holding up the sky
Holding up the sky

Life astounds us in an instant
Changing all we know
Blink just once and then you've missed it
All that you can do is watch it go
Watch it go

You want to feel what the wind feels like
You want to go that high
And feel no fear instead of being down here

A sunset and a dawn
I reached out and took the lifeline
Offered up between here and gone

But last night I put my ring back on
'Cause here with you is where I belong
Last night I put my ring back on

No life's without uncertainty
We both know how hard this love can be
It's just this hurting inside of me that threw it down,
Down down down

Who knows where hope comes from
But last night I put my ring back on
'Cause here with you is where I belong
Last night I put my ring back on

We can't speak like lovers we used to be
We can't change ancient history
And love wounds with such simplicity
And I threw it down, down down down, down

Your heart is all I want to see
Your hand reaching out to me
And your kiss remembers the mystery

Time was, I'd be as good as gone

Catching the wind as it went south
And I could touch every inch of sky
And the sweetest songs trilled from my mouth

But I'm no bird anyone can see
And there's no wind waiting for me
It's just a dream, it's just a dream
To be a bird flying free

I was a cloud that loved to drift
Offering shade to lay upon
And the greenest grass was my gift
And a summer day was my song

But I'm no cloud anyone can see
And there's just dust instead of green
It's just a dream, it's just a dream
To be a cloud drifting free

I was a light that loved to dance
Without a care of who might see
I tempted fate and welcomed chance
And I held the world inside of me

The clouds have fled, and the birds have flown
And the light that was is all but gone
It's just a dream, it's just a dream
To be a light
To be a cloud
To be a bird
Flying free",I Was a Bird
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Last night I dreamed of icy cliffs
Standing on the precipice
I leaned to see just where the edge would take me
The wind came up, I closed my eyes
I heard a shout and to my surprise
A hand reached out and pulled me back to safety

What's a hand, what's a dream
Who can say what it means
When everything that you know
Can disappear
Don't look back, the spirits cry
Just be glad to be alive
Everything that you love is right here
Everything that you love:

Life feels smaller than this stone
Worn smooth inside my palm
I keep it like a charm inside my pocket
I keep thinking I'll flame out
Leave no one with a doubt
That I was meant to fire like a rocket

What's a stone, what's a flame
There's always someone else to blame
When everything that you know disappears
Don't look back the spirits cry
Just be glad to be alive
Everything that you need is right here
Everything that you need:.

When I'm left here on the shore
The ancient basalt moor
Will beckon me to sleep among its heather
Who's not tempted to fold in
So that sleep may come again
Where the fire and the ice hide their treasure

Everything that you need",Iceland
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I'm heading out without a tear
I'm heading out without a fight
Nothing like this empty road
To take some trouble off my mind

Had enough of sad days
Had enough of sleepless nights
I only need a tank of gas
Babe I'm going for a ride

Cause when I'm all alone on a midnight highway
There's nothing like two hands on the wheel
And the radio playing I Won't Back Down
Baby that's about the way I feel

Might be gone a couple of hours
Might be gone a couple of days
I won't know til I turn around
We'll have to see just how it plays

Atlanta it's been way too long
By morning I'll make Asheville

There's nothing like two hands on the wheel
And the way the wind blows just before a rainstorm

Don't know if you tried to call
My phone ran out of signal
I don't know if you miss me at all:

'Cause I'm out here all alone on a midnight highway
And I've got both hands on the wheel

Why do some go and some stay
Do each of our hearts know their way
Through valleys of sorrow and tears
Across oceans of longing and years
And the sound of it all in my ears

I traveled
I traveled so far
I traveled so far to be here

And you with the blue in your eyes
The storms of life leave a few lines
And squinting you search for the signs
Of kindness, of love, of someone
To walk with in rain or in sun
Until then, life's hardly begun

You traveled
You traveled so far
You traveled so far to be here

It's worth it all learning at last

Step out of the shadow it casts
And let the sun shine on your shoes
Kick 'em off in the rain if you choose

Is a patch of green beneath your feet
A stubborn weed or a traveling rose
Either one lives to grow

What you look for in a stranger's eyes
Is if he sees through your disguise
How we long to be revealed
To be known we might be healed

Send it out into the Universe
A humble plea, a wish, a broken verse
Be a seed that lands inside the cracks
Seek the sun and it shines back

What you looked for when you were a girl
Was a window out into the world
From a speeding car or a passing train
You were hypnotized just the same

And what you look for now that you are grown
Is proof of how time has flown
An empty house, a strand of grey
And an endless longing for yesterday

Send it out into the Great Elsewhere
A kind of hope, a chant, a simple prayer
Be the child whose dreams won't ever fade
Shout and storm the barricades

What you look for in your darkest hour
Is a dirty street with just a flower

Send it out not knowing where it went
Into the blue, into the firmament
Be the one who wonders at it all

Whether to leave or to stay
'Cause underneath sorrow, underneath fear
There's nothing that's keeping me here

And it's a hard ride when you feel yourself tied down
Hide-and-earth bound
But there's no tether, on a zephyr

I tried to be constant just like a star
I tried to be steady and yar
But the storms keep breaking over my head

Forever and after, that's if we're charmed
You've got to hold on with more than these arms
Because love is all there is and time is just sand
And I might just slip through your hands

Some can't forget the last

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Today Joseph is sitting alone
With occasional nods to the waitress
She tops off his cup while she's snapping her gum
Making her rounds on the lunch shift
Counting out coins, he leaves them arranged
In neat lines and circles and arcs
She just stares at the tip that spells out her name
And ideas are like stars

And yesterday pedaling down 4th Avenue
Between the stalls and the bookshops
The sepia tones of a lost afternoon
Cradled a curio storefront
And inside the air was thick with the past
As the dust settled onto his heart
And here for a moment is every place in the world
And ideas are like stars

They fall from the sky, they run round your head
They litter your sleep as they beckon
They'd teach you to fly without wires or thread
They promise if only you'd let them

For the language of longing never had words
So how did you speak from your heart?
Yet here is a box that swears it has heard
That ideas are like stars

Tonight Joseph stood out in the yard
As Debussy played from the kitchen
Celestial companions till mornings first lark
Shone overhead and he listened
And who was that shadow there by the gate?
Who was that there standing guard?
It was only loneliness and loneliness waits

As it blew through the trees and the trees would bend
And I can recall the smell of the rain

Coming through the screen

I'd crawl in your bed when the lightning flashed
And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast
Its light all around your room

We lived on a street where the tall elm shade
Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade
That you held in your teeth as we lay on our backs
Staring up at the blue and the blue stared back

We'd grown just as tall and as proud as we pleased

They wrapped us in paper and moved us away
Your room was no longer next door to mine
This kid sister thing was old by that time

But oh how our dreams went bump in the night
And the voices downstairs getting into a fight
And the next day a silence you could cut with a knife
And feel like a blade at your throat

Twirl me about and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
And when I look up at you looking down
Say it as only a dream

The day you left home you got an early start
I watched your car back out in the dark
I opened the door to your room down the hall
I turned on the light
And all that I saw
Was a bed and a desk and couple of tacks
No sign of someone who expects to be back
It must have been one hell of a suitcase you packed

On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Somewhere alone with you

I wish that we were there together

One room bright and neat

Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

There is a bed where we shared times of love
And out of love those nights are memories best forgot
We argued about trivial things
And slept apart a wall we built among the sheets

There is a bed where sickness left its touch
And fever damp the sheets where I would shake all night
Cold burning on my brow
Hallucinations here and now
A fight to live or die

There is a bed where first we both made love
And left the marks, reminders of how good it felt
The hard, the soft, the sweat in midnight's hour
We built the fort, we climbed the tower

There is a bed where years will make us wise
Truth and lies defeat, despise and forgiving
The sheets our cradle birth to death
The twists and turns of love, the life we're living

There is bed where nights I lay awake
To think about my future to forget my past
My bed a boat to sail the seas
To land where safety finds me gripping to the mast

And though I feel the years slip through my fingers
Sorrow lingers and won't go away
There is a bed that is my sanctuary
A bed where I can end my days

I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine

I still  remember when thirty was old
And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence

Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine 

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew

No more sheltering now

Led me to avow

Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

Mary Fahl,"One April two sisters grew restless
Marooned in a dreary old town
So we packed up our dreams
And our dresses
As a cold rain was patterning down

Asleep above frozen dark waters
The wind carried us cross the sea
The sun woke us over Gibraltar
Tired and hopeful and free

Annie roll down your window
Have you seen a sky so blue
It's always lovely traveling with you

On midsummer nights in Coimbra
We drank porto til we were full
With the man with a scar on his forearm
Who said he'd been gored by a bull

September we stayed near the ocean
And we lived in a little blue shack
Cavorting at night with the tall trees
The neighbors hope we don't come back

Annie roll down your window
Have you seen a sky so blue
It's always lovely traveling with you

With winter upon us in Dublin
An Irishman played with your hair
You lost your heart at The Old Bailey
And some part of it still might be there

Annie roll down your window
Have you seen a sky so blue
Over clouds and endless rainbows
From my point of view
It's all been lovely
Traveling together with you

While my darling was in a dream 
The last sweet days of summer bloomed 
And dressed the trees in green 
Then soaring high in the gleaming sky 
From far across the bay 
Came a fearsome roar from a distant shore 
At the dawning of the day 

Then I called my men to follow me 
Knowing well that the view was dim 
Though tired and worn, how they fought all morn' 
As time was closing in 
And my heart was sad though sore with pride 
For brave lads all were they 
As the angels fly, how they climbed so high 
On the dawning of the day 

But the edge is moving nearer now 
Inside the fading sun 
And calling, calling out to them 
My brothers, one by one 
But only dust silence sounds 
The ashes float away 
As the twilight ends and the night descends 
'til the dawning of the day 

Forgive me love, I'm going now 
So very far away 
When darkness falls, only think me near 
And do not be afraid 
And please don't grieve when I am gone 
Abide in what remains 
'til the shadows end and we meet again 
On the dawning of the day 

For when shadows end, 
We shall meet again

You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Mary Gauthier,"I hated high school, I prayed it would end
The jocks and their girls, it was their world, I didn't fit in
Mama said, ""Baby, it's the best school that money can buy
Hold your head up, be strong, c'mon Mary, try""

I stole mama's car on a Sunday and left home for good
Moved in with my friends in the city, in a bad neighborhood
Charles was a dancer, he loved the ballet
And Kimmy sold pot and read Kerouac and Hemingway

Drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
All took me in

Charley and I flipped burgers to cover the rent
And Bourbons at happy hour for .35 cents
One day before work we got drunk and danced in the rain
They fired us both, they said
""Don't y'all come back here again""

Drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
All took me in

My dad went to college, and he worked for the state
He never quit nothing and he wanted me to graduate
My brother and sister both play in the marching band
They tell me they miss me, but I know they don't understand

Sometimes you got do
What you gotta do
And hope that the people you love
Will catch up with you

Yeah, drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
Poets and AWOL marines
Actors and bar flys
Writers with dark eyes
Drunks that philosophize

Mary Gauthier,"He'd get home at 5:30
Fix his drink, sit down in his chair
Pick a fight with mama
Complain about us kids getting in his hair

At night he'd sit 'lone and smoke
I'd see his frown behind his lighter's flame
Now that same frown's in my mirror
I got my daddy's blood inside my veins

Fish swim, birds fly
Daddies yell, mamas cry
Old men sit and think
I drink

Chicken, TV, dinner
6 minutes on defrost, 3 on high
Beer to wash it down with then another
A little whiskey on the side

It's not so bad alone here
It don't bother me that every night's the same
I don't need another lover
Hanging 'round, trying to make me change

Fish swim, birds fly
Lovers leave by and by
Old men sit and think
I drink

I know what I am
But I don't give a damn

Fish swim, birds fly
Daddies yell, mamas cry
Old men sit and think

There's a tiny village with its landscape painted green
A firehouse, a general store, all the streets are clean
The people at the depot love to hear that whistle sound
And they all wave at Jackie when the engine comes around.

He says roll train roll
The steel and all its rhythm
Are sweet music to his soul.
You'll be riding safe tonight
Come hell or freezing rain
The red caps got your baggage
All Aboard!! Jackies Train

A cow strays from the meadow
She's stranded on the track
Jackie's fingers lift her up
Then gently put her back
The train chugs on down the line
Through the kitchen and the den
Disappearing under Jackies bed
And back to town again.

Yes its Roll train Roll
The steel and all its rhythm
Are sweet music to his soul.
You'll be riding safe tonight
Come hell or freezing rain
The red caps got your baggage
All aboard! Jackies train

Jackie never stops the train when he's home all alone
He keeps her rolling round and round till mama, comes home

Jackie can't go out to play, the village needs him there
Every little detail of the train gets all his care
Gotta keep it rolling, gotta stay on time
When he dies they'll honor him
For miles on down the line.

Yes its Roll train Roll
The steel and all its rhythm
Are sweet music to his soul.
You'll be riding safe tonight
Come hell or freezing rain
The red caps got your baggage

Mary Gauthier,"A little girl lost, her world full of pain
He said it feels good, she gave him her vein
The dope made her numb and numb felt like free
Until she came down, down, down to a new misery

A junkie, a whore living for the next high
She'd lie cheat and steal, she forgot how to cry
Wide awake for two weeks, shooting heroin then speed
When she killed in cold, cold blood all she felt was her need

It's an eye for an eye, now you're gonna die
A tooth for a tooth, it's your moment of truth
There's no mercy here, your stay is denied
Go on and pray, pray, pray, there's mercy in the sky

Alone in her cell, no dope in her veins
The killer'd become, little girl lost again
She fell to her knees, she prayed she would die
On the cold cement floor, she finally cried

And love came like the wind, love whispered her name
It reached through and held her, lifted her pain
Fifteen years on death row, her faith deeper each day
Her last words were, ?I love you all?
Good-bye, Karla Faye

Now it's an eye for an eye and you're gonna die
A tooth for a tooth, it's your moment of truth
There's no mercy here, your stay is denied
Go on and pray, pray, pray

Mary Gauthier,"I called my mama yesterday
To wish her happy birthday
She said, ?Baby, your mama's getting old
And I'm damn glad to be alive today?

She said, ?I'm 10 years cancer free
And I thank the good Lord everyday
But Marie, she's got it bad
And honey, Patsy's passed away?

She said a lifetime ain't no time at all
She said a lifetime ain't no time at all

I listened to my mama's voice
And I felt a chill pass right through
'cause I've seen the virus take the boys
And I've watched my friends get sick too

We talked about how Michael died
With his friends around him everyday
How we all took turns by his side
How we helped him disappear that way

I know a lifetime ain't no time at all
I know a lifetime ain't no time at all

Mama said, ?Ain't we a mess?
Child, we're full of life and scared of death
It must be hell to watch your friends die young
But getting old now, there's some fun?

You know, life'd mean nothing if we didn't die
Laughter, empty, if we didn't cry
It's all the way it's supposed to be
But it moves fast and it's hard to see

'cause a lifetime ain't no time at all
Yes, a lifetime ain't no time at all
A lifetime ain't no time at all
A lifetime ain't no time at all

Mary Gauthier,"You throw me that look again
We both know what it means
Packing bags and tying up loose ends
Lettin' go of busted dreams

Silence fills the room tonight
You've never been this cold
To leave me sliding down your icy look
With nowhere to grab a hold

I know it's hard to know the truth
So we live with points of view
I'm counting on my lucky stars
I used to count on you

Everything you do to me
I've done to you before
There's beauty in the symmetry
Of evening the score

I know it's hard to know the truth
So we live with points of view

Mary Gauthier,"Our Lady of the Shooting Stars was that you last night?
Did we dance a whispered waltz, did I hold you in my sight?
When morning came with open arms she lifted you from me
The sunlight burned my eyes away now I cannot see

Our Lady of the Shooting Stars as I face the early light
All that I can think of now is joining you in flight
But I have followed gypsy's girl, I've lost my way back home
I've held the phoenix to my chest and ended up alone

If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?

Our Lady of the Shooting Stars teach me how to know
I want to feel my thoughts go dark and rest inside your flow
I'll awaken without fear and breathe the cool clean air
With your words upon my lips your will becomes my prayer

If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?

Our Lady of the Shooting Stars look what you have done
You've led me to the water's edge, running from sun
Are you in the briny mist? Do Seagulls scream your name?
Their wings suspended by your love, or do I reach for you in vain?

If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?
",Our Lady of the Shooting Stars
Mary Gauthier,"Honey sit down I've got something to say
Last night I drowned I got carried away
Swept up in the feelings the words poured out of me
This morning I'm so scared I don't know how to be

My heart moves
With the morning sun
It's not ready to set for anyone
When I said, ""I love you""
It was a slip of the tongue

I didn't lie but it wasn't the truth
I know it's not right but what can I do
My memories haunt me they never let me go
There's someone on my mind and I think you should know

My heart moves
With the morning sun
It's not ready to set for anyone
When I said, ""I love you""
It was a slip of the tongue

Love is more than a feeling
It's a way of living everyday
It's the hardest thing I ever gave away

Mary Gauthier,"You're crying 'cause I'm not crying
You're crying while I sit here looking strong
You're sad 'cause I don't feel the pain you're feeling
But my turn's coming after you're gone

You're angry for the good years you wasted
You're angry 'cause you watched me turn to stone
But soon the walls I've built are gonna crumble
My turn's coming after you're gone

After you're gone I'm gonna miss you
After you're gone I'll call your name
As soon as I can't I'll want to kiss you
Then I'll realize we'll never kiss again

After you're gone I'll fall to pieces
After you're gone, it's me I'll blame
I'll think of all the kindness you've shown me
And I'll hate myself 'cause I never change

And I'll be crying when you stop crying
Crying when you sit there looking strong
I'll be sad and you won't feel the pain I'm feeling

Mary Gauthier,"He's lying on the double bed acting self-assured
In his T-shirt and his underwear he's barely said a word
She pours a cup of coffee, lights the day's first cigarette
Picks up the phone and calls her kids from the motel kitchenette

There's two guys moving slowly in the room across the hall
Both their heads are pounding from last night's alcohol
They met in a chat room then they took it here
They both go by pseudonyms and soon they'll disappear

Cheaters, liars, outlaws and fallen angels
Come looking for the grace from which they fell
So they hold on to each other in the darkness
'Cause the morning light is hell at the Camelot Motel

He met her at the pool hall, the guys told him she is touched
Now she's ranting and she's raving about the Devil, Christ and such
He's thinking about the highway and the way she begged last night
He's wishing that he had blown this dump before the morning light

Cheaters, liars, outlaws and fallen angels
Come looking for the grace from which they fell
So they hold on to each other in the darkness
'Cause the morning light is hell at the Camelot Motel

Lancelot and Guenevere bang their bedpost in my ear
Neon lights the castle walls, bug lights in the entrance halls
I lie awake with a troubled mind thinking 'bout what I left behind
Me and the royal denizens got damn good reasons for our sins

Now there's a couple counting money in room 124
They're wrapping 10's and 20's throwing the 1's down on the floor
They're strung out and they're nervous, they jump at every little sound
He keeps picking up his pistol then putting his pistol down

Come looking for the grace from which they fell
So they hold on to each other in the darkness

Mary Gauthier,"Davey stole a Christmas tree from K-Mart last night
Red ribbons and silver bells, angels dressed in white
He tied, it to the bridge rail so passing cars could see
He danced a little dance up there, looked down and smiled at me

My bed is a lawn chair, cushions keep it soft
I sleep in the open air, under the Southern Cross
Next to the golf course by the Hyatt Hotel
Davey he is a friend of mine and we get along pretty well

Christmas in paradise under the Cow Key Bridge
Where the warm breeze blows so nice
And the landlord forgives

Snowbirds on the golf course wear Bermuda shorts and Polo shirts
Some play pretty good some play so bad it hurts
We pick up their golf balls that fly over the fence
We shine 'em up a little bit and sell 'em back for fifty cents

Christmas in paradise under the Cow Key Bridge
Where the warm breeze blows so nice
And the landlord forgives

I won't lie, we just get by but we'll be eating good tonight
Christmas dinner at 5 o'clock over at the Church of Life
They don't care who you are, they don't ask what you done
Come on down and bring a friend there's plenty for everyone

Christmas in paradise under the Cow Key Bridge
Where the warm breeze blows so nice
And the landlord forgives

The radio plays Christmas songs while we get high
And Davey shouts, ?Merry Christmas y'all?
To the cars passing by

Born a bastard child in New Orleans
To a woman I've never seen
I don't know if she ever held me
All I know is that she let go of me

I passed through like thunder
I passed through like rain
Passed out from under
Good-bye could have been my family name

Every time I settle down it happens
I get a restless feeling I can't control
I hit the wall, then I hit the highway
I've got the curse of a gypsy on my soul

So I move through like thunder
I move through like rain
Moving out from under
Good-bye could have been my family name

I can't break free of the winds that blow me
They roll in like a Gulf Coast Hurricane
I'd love to stay now but I don't know how
Hold me honey till I'm gone again

When it's time to leave forever
I pray the Lord don't take me slow.
I don't know where I'm going
I just wanna say good-bye and go

And I'll move through like thunder
Push through like rain
Pushing out from under




",Good-Bye
Mary Gauthier,"Under water, under the well
Under glass, under a ground swell
Chasing bliss, chasing my tail
Chasing desire, straight down to Hell

I couldn't love, could not forgive
I didn't know how to live and let live
My choices were few
On the ledge, looking up at you

Overdrawn, overfed
Overrun, over my head
I held a grudge, I held a gun
I held contempt for everyone

I couldn't cry, I couldn't learn
I didn't flinch when bridges burned
I was lost, through and through
On the ledge, looking up at you

I lived alone, I lived in rage
I lived in darkness inside a cage
On the fringe, a refugee
I couldn't trace it back to me

I grew mean, I grew small
I grew tired of it all
I couldn't tell false from true
On the ledge, looking up at you

Out of luck, out of time
Out of control, out of my mind
Running scared, running down
Running low to the ground

The blows were hard, the blows were mean
The blows were low, the blows were clean
I was left black and blue
On the ledge, looking up at you

Mary Gauthier


I felt the flames on my face

when I found the nerve to meet your eyes, so green

I stumbled towards your elegance

I tumbled, wide awake into a dream

and there you stood, so beautiful

destiny seduces, after all

I fell into the fire

that's a long way to fall


You gave me strength to speak

when my voice was weak and words were hard to find

your faith in me was solid and

it stood me up when I couldn't steady mine

all those times I cried at night

you promised me it'd be all right

you held me while my demons danced and crawled

I fell into your open arms

that's a long way to fall


A long way to fall

a long way to fall

I never should have drifted

I never should have left you all alone

I don't know what comes over me

looks like I'll always be

the troubled kid that runs away from

home

I reached for you the other night

you rolled away and moved against the wall

I fell into the space between us

that's a long way to fall


A long way to fall

a long way to fall


I got no one to hold on to and

I'm sinking slowly to my knees

I might learn to pray down here

or maybe I'll beg you baby, please

but you stare at me with marble eyes

and I don't think I've ever

felt this small

I've fallen out of your good graces

that's a long way to fall


A long way to fall, a long way to fall

a long way to fall, a long way to fall


",Long Way to Fall
Mary Gauthier,"From the painful rays of daybreak
Ripping darkness out your eyes
To every kiss with bourbon breath
Your daddy didn't hide, he didn't hide

From the crack of his backhand slap
To your mama's blue veined hands
That held her rosary desperately
'Cause she didn't understand

From the brokenhearted playground
In the lonely afternoon
To the violence of little boys
And the crying in your bedroom

Till the wind blows right through you and rain don't get you wet
Till your lips move constantly but you ain't said nothing yet
Till you ride that horse in circles, going up and coming down
Round and round, it's a merry go round

From the bitter tears of helplessness
Falling from your grandma's face
As they strap you to the stretcher
While she quickly packs your suitcase

From the money that you stole
From her on the day she died
To the long lines at the clinic
Waiting for a days supply, a days supply

Till the wind blows right through you and rain don't get you wet
Till your lips move constantly but you ain't said nothing yet
Till you ride that horse in circles, going up and coming down
Round and round, it's a merry go round

From the phone booth on the freeway
When there's no one left to call
To the porcelain cod you pray to
In the public restroom stall

From the milky white of heroin
As it bubbles and it sooths
To the dirty sheets you lie on

All the way up the bayou from Lafourche to Iberville
Dirty air, dirty laundry, dirty money, dirty rain
A dirty dark at daybreak burning the sugar cane

Christmas on the bayou, midnight come and gone
Driving past the sugar mill and all the lights are on
The parking lot is full of trucks I can see the furnace glow

The terrible fire
It don't matter how much I pray
The flames leap and burn me
There's nothing I can do
To make the fear go away
I try to keep moving
Try not to look back
Push really hard on the stone
But I walk through the fire alone
The tree by my window
Turns gray in November
I watch the leaves as they fall
The branches left naked
Reach up so proudly
I wish to God you would call
But me I'm the dead one
You are the lover
Who loved me right down to my bones
Now I walk through the fire alone
The powers that push me
They move me they own me
They constantly tell me to run
I try not to listen
I try to fight them
But never a battle I've won
So let go of lovers
I let go of diamonds
I've plenty of sins to atone
While I walk through the fire alone

Hold onto your mama
Hold onto the ones that you love
Hold onto your heart
Hold onto your visions
Hold onto what you're dreaming of

Or if you're hiding from

It's been a year now since you moved away
And even though I asked you to go
I miss you every day

I miss you in the evenings
Alone in the bed where I lie
I miss you in the morning
Before I open my eyes

I went and sold everything that I could, babe
Then I gave away what didn't sell
I moved south to Nashville
I might like it there but I can't tell

I've been hanging in Austin
Eating Chili's and good Bar-be-Q
Writing songs about losing and heartache
Hey babe, I'm writing 'bout you

A year ain't nothing
When you lose someone you love
A year is a drop in a bucket
When you lose someone you love

I been traveling hard since September
I don't get back to Nashville till June
And I played my songs all over the world
But I can't find a home without you

I press on like a mad rushing river
I press on with the will to survive
A part of me lives for the wind in my face
While the other part's barely alive

A year ain't nothing
When you lose someone you love
A year is a drop in a bucket
When you lose someone you love

So Happy anniversary, baby
May fortune and fate be your friends
Wherever you go, I want you to know
I don't think my love ever ends

I carry it down the highway
It's a part of my body and soul

Rainbows ain't something that you hold on to
They move out as the storm moves through

The bathroom's down the hall and it smells like piss
It's another night in another town
And I'm another blues traveler headed down

Falling out of love is a dangerous thing
With its slippery slopes and its weighted wings
With its birds of prey circling overhead
Casting vulture shadows on barren beds

Let me out, set me free
Let me out, set me free

The clock inside the church bell tower
Rings your name every hour
I see your face, I touch your hair
Then the ringing fades and nobody's there

Falling out of love is a treacherous thing
With its crucible kiss and its ravaged ring
With its holy whispers and labyrinth lies
Sacrilegious hungry sighs

Let me out, set me free
Let me out, set me free

I walk the streets, I taste the dirt
I'm flesh and blood and my body hurts
I search your silence looking for a crack
For a passageway, where I can pull you back

Falling out of love is a tedious thing
With its jailhouse smirk and its chain gang swing
It's time to serve and its sentence set
With its warm blood and cold sweat

Let me out, set me free
Let me out, set me free

When the rain won't stop falling, when the flood waters rise
When all that you're sure of washes out with the tide
You'll have no crazy lover there to make you look sane
You'll think of me then, when you're knee deep in rain

It ain't the wind, it's the rain

When rain fills the river and dark waters spill
Over the levee and rush down the hill
They'll carry me with them, I won't have to explain
There'll be no confusion, there'll only be rain

I was born lonesome and I'm lonesome still
Ain't nothing you've done ever changed how I feel
When the storm clouds are building, when the deluge takes aim

Mary Gauthier,"Packing vagabond visions and a dream drenched hunger for a home
Swaddled in road dirt, blood stained blankets and poems
On a stormy suitcase Sunday I awakened to the scream of the birds
They held their high notes and offered prayer without words

Sinking in asphalt, speechlessness and what could of been
Surrounded by strangers, scarred stars, stoned broken men
Riding the narcotic night, 'til she swerved and smashed into the curb
Morning spilled from the wreckage and offered prayer without words

Chains on the mast pull the past, nothing lasts but nothing ever ends
I leave town, break new ground, break down, leave town again
Trapped in the circle, anchored to the weight of the world
Under shooting stars that sink the skies and offer prayer without words

Justice rides with jaundiced eyes, jaded judges bleed the broken bench
Liberty's a homicide, she been flogged to death with money's monkey wrench
Desperado apostates set fire to every holy word we've heard
Silence billows from the burning book and offers prayer without words

Surrender, that sweet cleaning girl, folds white flags in Hallelujah Square
She can't remember where she's been, one day I'm gonna join her there

Their heat and their light bathed in blue as they march by
The all stars play when the saints go marching in
A second line forms and they wave white hankies in the wind

Satchmo takes a solo, and he flashes his million dollar smile
Marie Laveau promenades with Oscar Wilde
Big funky Stella twirls her little red umbrella to the beat
As the soul parade winds it's way down Eternity Street

Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
So, ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

Spy boy meets spy boy, and big chief meets big chief uptown
They circle and sway in their rainbow colored feathers and beads
They prance like peacocks, children of slavery freed

Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
Ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

The Krewe of the crossbones parades into the midnight sun
They march through the fire and come out beating homemade drums
While the French quarter queens in their high heeled drag disguise
Sing 'Over the rainbow' 'til Judy Garland quivers and sighs

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
Ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

Flambeau dancers light the walkway to Jean Pierces
There's a party tonight and all the girls are gonna be there
Sipping wormwood concoctions, drinking absinthe and talking trash
It's a red carpet, black tie, all night, celestial bash

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
Ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel
I said roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel
Yeah, roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

Mary Gauthier,"Tell me that you love me one more time
Before you leave, before you leave
Wrap your arms around me hold me tight
Before you leave, before you leave

Whisper to me softly in my ear
Before you leave, before you leave
Tell me that you'll miss me when you're not here
Before you leave, before you leave

When you get to where you're going
Would you call and let me know you're okay?
'Cause I'll be thinking 'bout you
Won't you ease my mind
And let me know you're safe?

The weather's turning, don't forget your coat
Before you leave, before you leave
Listen close, there's something you should know
Before you leave, before you leave

The darkness that shadowed you was mine
It was never yours at all
And the light behind your eyes that used to shine
Gets brighter as you walk away

Mary Gauthier,"Well, the grasses are swaying, sun's going down
Music is playing, you're weaving through town
Pull into the drive way, toss it in park

You stare out of the windshield, out into the world
It was all for the love of a wayward girl
Who left you with a second place smile and a broken heart

And the streetlights are starting to flicker to life
They glow for a minute then they get bright
Fireflies light up, circle and spark

there's nothing really that you can do
Put your hands in your pockets, try to get through
The distance between the daylight and the dark

And the front porch flags lie themselves down
Like forgotten soldiers and old wedding gowns
In closets unopened and graves without any marks

As the night curtains lower behind the rooftops
Shadows dance across the sidewalks
And ricochet off of the houses like pieces of art

And your mind is reeling as the sky is changing
All you're feeling and you're re-arranging
The rest of your life like lines on an old sailors chart

You climb back in, fire the ignition
Put your hands on the wheel, head into the distance
The distance between the daylight and the dark
",Between the Daylight and the Dark

This is not my street

This is not my house

That is not my bed

This is not my town

Another day another night

Another night another day

I wanna go home

I can?t find the way


The levee broke the water came

Went all the way up to my roof

I crawled up there and cried

What else could I could do?

Another day another night

Another night another day

I wanna go home

I can?t find the way


A boat brought me to I-10

I sat there three days, maybe four

Thousands stranded on the interstate

Every hour boats brought more

Another day another night

Another night another day

We wanna go home

We can?t find the way


With nothing but our dreams

And memories of who we?ve been

Scattered forth like seeds

At the mercy of the wind

Another day another night

Another night another day

We wanna go home

We can?t find the way


Another day another night

Another night another day

We wanna go home

We can?t find the way


",Can't Find the Way
Mary Gauthier,"Broken on the inside, that's what I used to say
Then I?d pack my bags, raise a white flag, drive away
I thought that's what made me strong
But I was young, I was wrong

And I ain't leaving any more
I'm not walking out that door
No more running away
I made up my mind to stay
I'm gonna stand my ground
Stare my demons down, I ain't leaving

I don't know when it happened
But I turned a corner somewhere on the road
And on this side of those stubborn years
Somehow I'm not so broken any more
I pushed away what I shoulda held
Yeah, but sorrow taught me well

And I ain't leaving any more
I'm not walking out that door
No more running away
I made up my mind to stay
I'm gonna stand my ground
Stare my demons down, I ain't leaving

there's still a whisper in my ear
That I'm trying not to hear
Haunted voices from my past
Promises of greener grass
Speaking to me everyday
Fighting hard to have their way

But I ain't leaving any more
I'm not walking out that door
No more running away
I made up my mind to stay

I wanna find out what it?s like
To live a different kind of life
To hang around and fight
For something I believe in

Understand I ain't leaving
I ain't leaving
Broken on the inside
That's what I used to say

Steam Train Maury died last night

His wife Wanda by his side

Caught the Westbound out of here

Hopped the high irons to the by and by

They say he jumped ten thousand trains

Rode a million miles for free

Helped out at VA hospitals and penitentiary?s

Dandy Dave, Rusty Nails and Sweet Lady Sugar Cane

Dead Eye Kate and the Baloney Kid raise their cups tonight in Steam Train?s name

Senators, congressmen, puppets on a string

Among the windswept vagabonds Steam Train was the king

The last of the hobo kings, the last of the hobo kings


Now bums just drink and wander round

Tramps dream and wander too

But a hobo was a pioneer who preferred to work for food

He knew how his nation?s doing

By the length of a side walk cigarette butt

Born with an aching wanderlust

Embedded in his gut

Hounded, beaten, laughed at, broke

Chased out of every town

With a walking stick scepter

And a shredded coffee can crown

The last of the hobo king, the last of the hobo kings


The last free men are hoboes

Steinbeck said, and he paid cash

And the stories that he bought from them

Helped write the Grapes of Wrath

But boxcars have been sealed for years

And trespassers do time

And the railroad yards are razor wired

And hoboing?s a crime

So here?s to you Steam Train Maury

Hold that Westbound tight

As you ride off into history

The last hobo, the last ride

The last of the hobo king, the last of the hobo kings


",Last of the Hobo Kings
Mary Gauthier,"Four nights alone in Amsterdam and I missed you every one
I wish this trip was over and it?s only just begun
I don't know when I?ll see you again
I can't think of it, it?s more than I can bear
I know I only kissed you once
But I hold it on my on my lips like a prayer

I see me in the window of an old café on the boulevard
Looking hunkered down blown around
I've forgotten what I'm out here for
I stood alone last night by the streetlight, aching for you
I watched the snow fall in Berlin
From a hotel room on Karl Marx Avenue

Oh please, I need your love
Oh please, I need your love

I dreamed of you in Belfast
Woke up to the echo of your voice
Walked the streets of Dublin
Talking to myself ?bout love and choice

I forgot the dream in Aberdeen and panicked
'Cause it felt like you were gone
I called your number in despair and you laughed at me
Thank God I was wrong

Oh please, I need your love
Oh please, I need your love

Well, I kissed you once and then I left
And I was hoping that you might remember me
Oh, I didn't even try to stay
I was teasing you with the possibility

Yes, I set a trap but I fell in
And I don't think I'm finished falling yet
What I tried to do to you, I did to me
I guess I'm working off the debt

Going crazy here without you
And it makes no sense at all
On my knees with my arms out
And my back against the wall

I miss you everywhere I go with an ache
That just grows stronger town to town
And if you don't want me, baby
I hope I'm strong enough to just keep moving round

Oh please, I need your love
Oh please, I need your love
",Please
Mary Gauthier,"My silence betrays me
Lets the demons take a hold
The truth always saves me
When there's nowhere else to go

When you flirt with the shadows
Darkness snakes under your skin
The only way back home
Is let the light of truth back in

I know you see it in my eyes
I know you know where I've been
So it's hard to understand
Why you'd take me there again

I'll come back to get you
But baby, I can't stay
The same road that brought me to you
Is gonna carry me away

I've come so far to stand here
I've earned this solid ground
I'll fight to keep you with me
But I won't let you take me back down

It scares me to death
To know what I need
I'm brave enough to love you
Brave enough to leave

Mary Gauthier,"The children are crying, they never got their supper
Where would you run to in the darkness of the night?
Even shadows fear to wander
They gather 'round me in the candlelight

Your crucifix is broken, bloody, sharp and shattered
I smashed it to pieces on the bedroom floor
Pain and prayers and promises scattered
Then I pulled the pistol from the dresser drawer

Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, what have I done?
Everything worth holding slips through my fingers
Now my hands wrapped around the handle of a gun

The further I fall, the less I falter
Forsaken, forgotten without love
The slow motion whisper turns into a holler
Forty years of push turns into a shove

Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, what have I done?
Everything worth holding just slips through my fingers
Now my hands wrapped around the handle of a gun

The chair that I sit in belonged to my daddy
Carved from the hard wood of a bitter tree
When he was alive he used tell me
?Kid I knew when you was born
You'd end up snake bit like me?

Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, what have I done?
Everything worth holding slips through my fingers
Now my hands wrapped around the handle of a gun
I'm holding on to the handle of a gun

Look at me, on the high wire

As I attempt to balance safety with desire

Step right up, get your tickets here

What you see should have you trembling with fear

Without a net, here I go

Ladies and gentlemen I promise you a show


As I?m crashing through the clouds I used to walk on

Reaching out for unfamiliar hands

Falling into the eyes of strangers

I wanna smile but I can?t

I?m looking for a soft place to land


When you?re up so high it?s hard to know

If you look foolish waving to the crowd below

It was plain, to everyone but me

Only a fool forgets the pull of gravity

But for a while, didn?t I fly?

Didn?t I shine like a star up in the sky?


Now I?m crashing through the clouds I used to walk on

Reaching out for unfamiliar hands

Falling into the eyes of strangers

I wanna cry but I can?t

I?m looking for a soft place to land


Bridge

I remember blue sky

I remember company

I remember laughter

I remember everything


As I?m crashing through the clouds I used to walk on

Reaching out for unfamiliar hands

Falling into the eyes of strangers

I wanna cry, but I can?t

I?m looking for a soft place to land

And it?s hard to find a soft place to land

Ain?t it hard to find a soft place to land

Mary Gauthier,"We stood in a long line waitin' for the door be unlocked
Out in the cold wind, ?round the razor wire fenced in cell block
Young mamas with babies, sisters and other kinds of kin
At Tallulah State Prison on Thanksgiving Day
We're waiting to get in

You gotta get here early
It don't matter how many miles you drove
They make you wait for hours, jailers always move slow
They run names, check numbers
Gravel faced guards they don't smile
Grammy and me in line, silently waitin' single file

Thanksgiving at the prison, surrounded by families
Road weary pilgrims who show up faithfully
Sometimes love ain't easy, sometimes love ain't free

My Grammy looks so old now
Her hair is soft and white like the snow
And her hands tremble
When they frisk her from her head to her toes

They make her take her winter coat off
Then they frisk her again
When they're done she wipes their touch off her dress
Stands tall and heads in

It's thanksgiving at the prison, surrounded by families
Road weary pilgrims who show up faithfully
Even though it ain't easy, even though it ain't free
Sometimes love ain't easy, I guess love ain't free
",Thanksgiving
Mary Gauthier,"Clouds are spreading like bruises on the evening sky
I walk the streets alone again tonight
It starts to rain, still I search each passing face

Blood is blood, blood don't wash away
Blood is blood, blood don't wash away

When I was a child they told me she loved me too much
She didn't keep me 'cause my mother loved me too much
She left without a trail, she left without a trail

Blood is blood and blood don't wash away
Blood is blood and blood don't wash away

I got a heart that's ripped, I got a soul that's torn
I got a hole in me like I was never born

Blood is thicker than water, blood is bound by God
I don't know who I am, I don't know who I'm not
I don't know my name, I can't find my place

Blood is blood, blood don't wash away
Blood is blood, blood don't wash away
Blood is blood, blood don't wash away

So, many times when the city seems to be without
A friendly face, a lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

Touch me and I end up singing
Troubles seem to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near, when you're near

And love, if all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest, I found the best

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
No, I won't last a day without you
Can't last a day without you",I Won't Last a Day Without You

Just in time, you found me just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, then losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear I've found my way
For love came just in time, you found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day

Mary Haskell,"It's not the glow you feel, when snow appears
It's not the Christmas card you've sent for years
Not the joyful sound when Sleigh bells ring
Or the merry songs children sing

That little gift you send on Christmas Day
Will not bring back the friend, you've turned away
So, may I suggest the secret of Christmas
It's not the things you do at Christmas time
But the Christmas things you do all year through

Mary Haskell,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn'
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A rosy hue settles all around
You've got the feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

And all of this happens because the world is waiting
Waiting for one child black, white, yellow, no one knows
But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter
Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever

It's all a dream, an illusion now
It must come true some time soon somehow
All across the land dawns a brand new morn'

Mary Haskell,"Like the sweet morning dew, 
I took one look at you,
And it was plain to see you were my destiny.
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride.
I'll sacrifice for you dedicate my life for you.
I will go where you lead always there in time of need.
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill.
There's no, no looking back for us, we got love sure 'nough, that's enough.
You're all, you're all I need to get by.
 
Like an eagle protects his nest for you I'll do my best, 
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me.
Darlin' in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door.
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher.
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.

Mary Hegarty,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Mary Hopkin,"I never knew that a day like today laid before us
I've got the sun in my heart and my heart's in the sun
Skies are as bright as your eyes
The horizon is open
Love is a ceiling, feelings are reeling, free as the air

Forever on and forever
Forever on, side by side
Whoever knew that we two could be as free as we'd fancied?
Fancy is free, but are we, who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love?

Whoever knew that we two could be free as we'd fancied?

What else on earth could ever bring
Such happiness to ev'rything

Shall in our hearts more sweetly sing
Than Love's old story.

Mary Hopkin,"Dream are nothing more than wishes
And a wish is just a dream
You wish to come true

If only I could have a puppy
I'd call myself so very lucky
Just to have some company
To share a cup of tea with me
I'd take that puppy everywhere
La la la la I wouldn't care
But We would stay away from crowds
And signs that said no dogs allowed

Oh We. I'd know he'd never bite me oh no
We would know he'd never bite me oh no

If only I could have a friend
To stick with me until the end
To walk along beside the sea
And share a bit of moon with me
I'd take my friend most everywhere
Lalalala I wouldn't care
But we would stay away from crowds 
And signs that said no friends allowed

Oh we would be so happy together Oh yeah
We would be so happy to be

Mary Hopkin,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Mary Hopkin,"The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause.
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

(There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!!

  

 ",There's No Business Like Show Business
Mary Hopkin,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

[Chorus]
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la,
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

[Chorus]

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

[Chorus]

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

[Chorus]",Those Were the Days (Quelli Erano Giorni)
Mary Hopkin,"The air was cool on lily pools,
Hazy lazy,
And here and there he'd stop to stare
Admiring all the flowers,
Wandering round for hours

The sun was warm across the lawn
Scented blended
He saw her linger
And with her finger open up a rose,
Standing on tip toes

Suddenly the rain came flurrying,
Sending the two of them scurrying,
Helter skelter for the shelter
And feeling bolder in the big pagoda,
He gently inquired her name,
And they waited till the sunshine came

And for a while
The griffin smiled,
Kindly, blindly,
Till the evening bell broke the spell,
And sadly they said goodbye
And one of the griffins cried

In Kew Gardens",Kew Gardens
Mary Hopkin,"When I watch you sadly going
When all you can say is no
Let my name be sorrow
Let my name be sorrow

When I long to see you smiling
When your fear just won't let go
Let my name be sorrow
Let my name be sorrow

Once we had laughs as big as lies
We had lies as sweet as you
Till one morning for us two
All was over

When the dawn is softly showing
Darkness lingers on your brow
Let my name be sorrow
Let my name be sorrow

When the roses we were growing
Lose their petals one by one
Let my name be sorrow

Once we had laughs as big as lies
We had lies as sweet as you

I asked my mother, what will I be
Will I be pretty, will I be rich

Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera

I asked my sweetheart what lies ahead
Will we have rainbows, day after day

I'll find my real love

I take no shorts
let suckers step up and see
I'll flip the script and get harder than Jepordy
I shot the sheriff and the motherfuckin' deputy
Test me
Check it
I'm not Keith Sweat but bet that ass
That I can make it last
Skinz turn they head so fast 
They end up catching whip lash
If hun's a monster 
I'm Carl Lewis on a meter dash
It's Grand Puba baby
And I'm gettin' crazy cash
What's the 411? Let me know, hun
What's the 411?

[Chorus]

Yeah, nig, what makes you different from the next nigga
Seen you last week 
And you couldn't even speak
You try to play like Mr. All-of-that
But now you want to come to me with some chit-chat
I don't have no time for no wham-bam thank you, ma'am
Ghas me up, get me drunk and hit the the skinz and scram
The same ol' shit you pulled last week on Pam
I'm not havin' that, No I'm not havin' that
You gotta do a lot more and that's just how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't runnin' up in me
I need a man who's lookin' out with some security
So come correct with some respect and then we will see
So if you with it, the drop the 7 digits
And I might just give you a call
If you ain't with it, then don't waste you time at all
So what's the 411, hun?

As I grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within
Oh God I'm hot as the water like a preacher who's sinned
I'm only human but
The world has put me on a platform since the day I was born
To only wait for my downfall but like a brick wall im too hard to brake
OK I do make mistakes but I'm the realest from the fake
That's why I'm the hardest to hate
Aaliyah baby girl I've learned to love those while ther still awake
Sleep Sleep 
And prepare a place for those who are good in the projects and hood
Give to those who are misunderstood
I know like Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still No1
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader a teacher I gotta, like a single parent provider
Put in back those hip hop dividers

Mary J. Blige,"While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids I have nothing to show
Wasted my years a fool of a wife
I shoulda have left your ass a long time ago

Well I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' shed no tears
No, I'm not goin' cry,
It's not the time
Cause you're not worth my tears
Well I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' shed no tears
No, I'm not goin' cry,
It's not the time,
Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times

Well I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' shed no tears
No, I'm not goin' cry,
It's not the time
Cause you're not worth my tears
Well I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' shed no tears
No, I'm not goin' cry,
It's not the time,
Cause you're not worth my tears

I know there are no guarantees
In love you take your chances
But somehow it seems unfair to me
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health 'till death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our hearts
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times

Well I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' shed no tears
No, I'm not goin' cry,
It's not the time
Cause you're not worth my tears
Well I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' shed no tears
No, I'm not goin' cry,
It's not the time,
Cause you're not worth my tears",Not Goin' Cry

Where I stop
You will never know
Round and round I go
Where I stop
You will never know

What is your master plan
What did you have me do
Confusion in my mind
Been hurt a thousand times
Now I know you're not true

You don't know what it meant to me
Just to make you happy
All this time I've waited
Now our love has faded
Please tell me why it's gone
So my life can go on

But bark at your dog baby, and I'll hold you down

I knew that our love had to end
But now it's gone so very far
That I can make a brand new start
I thought that we were meant to be
Be one big family
But I was weak and loved you still
No matter what you did, I could forgive

All I need is sincerity
All I need is sincerity
Thinking 'bout you all the time
Never seemed to cross my mind
How you could take the time to kill
Everything our love had built
I never knew how you could hide
Everytime you told a lie
But now I know why you're so cold
But I don't understand
Now that you set me free
I truly think that we
Could find love separately
I need sincerity
One thing, I'm not as weak
I'll always stand alone
But my mind is not made of stone
So I'll go on

On a scale of tough criminals, nothin' to call me
I'm a rare individual, young and I'm bossy
Guess it come from a rough life, cuffed at night
Lettin' off hot lead that bust from iron pipes
I'm the type that have to shed blood
Pray to the ghost of dead thugs, dead blocks that spread drugs
Fled from the cops 'till when my first joint dropped
I'm still wit my hood, Hollow Point still in the glock
But I've been shitted on by these high class hoes
Even these chickens did me wrong, I was just gettin' on
So I turned cold, givin 'em hard dick and straight to the hole
Like Rod Strickland, it was takin' it's toll
I needed someone I could hold in my darkest hours
A strong couple is a blessing and the heart is the power
Give me someone I could trust, not just a hotty to bone
Does she love Escobar, or love Nasir Jones?
Let me know so I could cop her the stones
What's clear to me, it's sincerity
Somebody I could call my own, yeah
All I need is sincerity",Sincerity [Bonus CD Version]

I never wanna live without you baby
I wanna be your lady
Love is so amazing

I never wanna live without you baby
I wanna be your lady

Just thinking 'bout being without you
Work 'til I'm tired and I can't eat a bite
'Cause I know someday is only...

I have the man that I want
I prayed so many nights for you and then my prayers came true
Now that I have the answer, I'll be wishing on a star
I'll follow you where you are

Through any kind of weather, yeah
Let's make a happy home because you mean so much to me baby
That's why I wanna be your lady

Mary J. Blige,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you",Overjoyed

I don't ever want what we have to end 
And I'll always be your friend 
Don't you feel me calling from afar
If you don't know I've been there from the start 
As sure as my name is what it is 
You'll always have a place in my heart

And I can't complain 'bout yesterday

Comb my hair and though some like it wrong 
Jump in my ride because it's on 
And I'm gone, I'm gone

Opened up my eyes and prayed, Lord

No matter what nobody say 
Even though it's cloudy 
I can see the sun rays 
Oh, 'cause it's a beautiful day 
No matter what nobody say 
'cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day

When the night time does finally hit 
There'll be no reason for guns 
It'll be fun, fun, fun, fun

Everything is good because I'm living and I'm healthy 
I'm not too concerned 'bout being poor or being wealthy

Once he seen you get so comfortable
Never wantin to commit fo sho
Always lying bout the girl next door
That's how all these things began
You let you guard down and he does you in
All you secrets he's been holdin that in
To throw back at you when it benefits him
So he can go and play with all his chickens

Tell me where the lyin and the front begun
Why you playin wit me 'cause it ain't fun
How can it be two if I'm your only one

Never thinkin that our love was on the shelf
Livin our life like there was no one else
That's how crazy this game is

If you're floatin' real high
And you feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me
If you're feeling the groove
It ain't knocking for you
So just get on the floor and just dance for me
And I know you been stressed
That's how we got you messed up
Get on the floor and just dance for me
Just be here and you'll jump
So stay here 'till it close
And stay up on the floor and just dance for me

But I'm tryin' to make it easy
For everybody to dance for me

And you know that we're gonna put it down
After two more drinks, we'll be feelin' the sound

Get off the wall 'cause I know that you can feel me
Stop the fronting and dance for me

Well it's your chance to prove it
You on hand 'till the sun up
And the pounds of smoke, bottles is empty
And I got them models in the Bentley
And six simply when I bounce in the club
Around thugs that smoke ounces of blunt
Cop cases of Cris', pop 'till they can't taste the shit
But hell, what's the major event
Real niggas, real broads, ill cars, hot rims
Sedan Coupes, SUV's, to the drop Benz
From the outside in, the party rock
We just started and we ain't tryin' to hardly stop
From the Bellvedere to the Bacardi shots
Just dance ma, 'cause you know the bar hot

From my life others shall learn a lesson.
Want a leader with the world on my shoulder
Age is young but my mind is much older.
Living up to everyone's expectations
Condemned me to a world of damnation.
I gotta clear these voices from my head,
All these opinionated noises.
Listen to the voice of my creator,
Opens doors to a path much greater;
On this path, the days draw nearer
When I can be happy, finally happy.
Searching for my destiny,
I search for what makes me happy,
Lost in what others thought of me.
I've gotta be happy, finally happy.
Searching for my destiny,
Search for what makes me happy,
Lost in what others thought of me.
I've gotta be happy, finally happy.
Time to broaden my horizons,
Come out from the dark and open up my eyes and
Start to define my destiny,
Experience what life can really be.
No longer concerned with your opinion,
Over my life I have dominion.
I'm stronger now than before.
I'm sure I can be so much more.
Not what you thought I would be,
Cause I'm gonna be happy, yeah,
I'm gonna be happy,
Finally, you see. . .

I search for what makes me happy,
Lost in what others thought of me.

Search for what makes me happy,
Lost in what others thought of me.
I've gotta be happy, finally happy.
Searching for what makes me me.
I gotta be so happy.
See, I gotta please me and me first.
How can I love you, 
And anyone for that meaning,
If I don't know who I am?
If I don't know where I stand?

Mary J. Blige,"No more invisible speechless, deaf and blind child
With neglected pleasures being addicted to denial
Floating through time, gravitating towards a warm arm
With an appetite for the emptiness that promises no harm

No more uncontrollable eruptions of emotional depression
A primal S.O.S. from the barren prison of selfless expression
that only the guilty with the innocent
Souls-know buried in social scar tissue of defective ego

No more relentless sifting through bodies seeking self
Settling through competitive combat for what's left on the shelf.
A mad melee of supply and demand driven by gullible pride that
leads to sedating the you that suffocates inside

No more - forever no more, because I've unshut my eyes
And the differences between God's word and Man's Wills was realized
Seeing opposing parallel lives some liquid, other frozen. Let me to never
seek from man what God has chosen.

Then the negative whispering subsided and the panicking ceased
the undercurrent suppression of pent-up terror was released as the
mystery of the unknown manifested pristine clear A positive message
of truth entered my ear

Now, across my face is a brand new smile
With a newly revealed meaning of a ""Destine Child""
A message of hope is being released from my Heart
And I am overwhelmed with dedication to do my part

All I ever wanted was to be as I once was - Unbounded
Somehow it got all twisted and before long sounded
As though life was continuous connive-thrive-drive
Choking out the simple joy of just being alive

Now I am filled with love and I sing a love song
A song for yesterday, today, tomorrow, and beyond
My new prayer is, Thank You God for setting Me Free",Forever No More - Poem
Mary J. Blige,"In the meantime, what do you do
When there's no one left but you
And you're alone
How do you feel when the one you love
Doesn't, doesn't seem real
Do you run, or do you try to heal
The hurt inside
But oh, but in the meantime

[1 - ]I have found within myself
Everything I need to get by
'cause I
Know what to do in the meantime
Continue to love you

There is no need for you to fear
For I am here, I'll be right here
All of your life
And I am willing and able to pull you
Pull you through, through the storm
That might await you on the outside
And all of your fears and your doubts will no longer exist
Because God has granted you the greatest wage
And He's done the same for me
'cause right now, you're all I need

In the meantime what do you do
When there is no one, love but you
And you're alone, oh (But in the meantime)

Mary J. Blige,"[Verse 1]
Some come around me try to call my bluff
Pushing my buttons just to see if I'm tough
Behind my back spreading all kind of lies
Cause your an agent working on both sides
Hanging around me trying ta get some shine
Your mad at me because I work for mine
Plus sweat and tears just to make a dime
While you sit back and try to take what's mine

[Chorus]
Don't let em push you to the limit 'cause they like it a lot
And if they keep pushing just tell em ta just keep it moving
(Keep it moving) keep it moving yeah
For you and your partner can keep hating on me
And I'm sorry that you feel this way but you can just
Keep it moving (keep it moving) keep it moving yeah

[Verse 2]
Spiritually, mentally, physically
I'm trying my best to better myself and no one else
But your so busy thinking that this money is gonna turn
Me ta someone else and settle for less
Get your own life, on your own time, stop hanging around
Trying ta drain me dry
I've been broke before,I can't do it no more, but if I have to
It won't be over you
No one in this world can make me self-destruct
If you listen real close you would hear just what I'm trying ta say to you, you and your crew
So stop sitting round waiting on me ta lose

But the kids seem to scatter off

That the pick of a letter comes a little thicker
And I said it would
And it's been coming for a long time

Let's get you ready for another, another lifetime
O!
Our position is just to see what you can do

Become a victim on the verge, I'll kick your ass now
E!

Are you out of your mind
Well you show me some love

With intentions high
You probably need a place to count your cash
(Need a place to count your cash)
You said you're sorry so many times
And I'm sorry that you ever did
Well you can take your life of love 
And stick it up in your main frame
Cause there'll be no more second chances
No more hot romances
And I like it this way
So let me break it down for you

[Chorus]

Better stop playin' me 
Start lovin' me
I ain't the same woman giving love for free
All my life sittin', thinkin' how to please you
Been flyin' so long now, my screws are loose
Now it's time to move
Cause I'm sick and tired of playin' the fool
Cause you play to lose 
And I play to win
Tried not tosin'
Treid to be your friend
Like every other girl 
Never sexed your friends
But it's over now
And you saying, ""How?""
I found something new
That worth the while
Instead of messin' with a bump cat poster child
But I'm focused now
People saying, ""Wow!""
In place of a frown on my face, a smile
You must be out yo mind
I have no time to get you ready for a love of a lifetime

You been wasting time
Are you out of your mind
Well you show me some love",Love

Cause I was young and restless
But there was long ago

When you let go
Avoid these drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain
Free from all the game
Free from all the stress
So bye your happiness
I don't know
Only god knows where the story is
For me, but I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whatever we win or loose
And I choose to win

It's been hard for me

Is not where I'm stoppin' at

I grew up as a 70's baby
Brought up in poverty and sin
Makin' jokes at the crazy lady
Never acred how she was dealin' within
I knew all the words to
Micheal Jackson's album as a kid
And when it came to the biggest crusher
No he wasn't my man
At the age of seven years old
A strange thing happened to me
Before I even saw
My life had flashed before me
And I've got the mark to show
And it became a thing of beauty
So I gotta let you know
That my life, that my life

Being grown had seemed so lone
Woke up and I'm seventeen

From all the sights that I've seen
From abusin' the hole in trust
You probably couldn't take some of things

Especially with your pretty colors (I'm telling you, I'm telling you)

Seems all we have to pass down is being useless
Broken homes, babies all alone, parent's never there
No food, no clothes to wear, anger everywhere
Ain't no values being taught, no productive thoughts
Jealousy rules the world, take shit at any cost
Gotta change our state of life, keep it worth livin'
God gave us voices to speak and that's our way of givin'
It's so much bigger than the furs and the jewels
What about encouragin' the youth to do well
What about givin' back what about unifying
Shit we all black get it together
Everybody's got their trials and tribulations
Learn to change the negative to positive situations
Don't hold the lessons that you learn
Pass it on and except the blessings that could earn

Now mama's workin' hard all day
And she said this before she left home
Take care of your little brother
Have the place cleaned when I get home
All these priorities
Me and Tanya had to learn to be grown
But at the time for me
Being grown had seemed so lone
Woke up and I'm seventeen
With nothing going for me
Except the fact that I sing
You know it hurts so much
From all the sights that I've seen
From abusin' the hole in trust
You probably couldn't take some of things
That I've lived in my life

It's been hard for me

Trying strugglin' in the streets
But where I've been- Is no longer where I'm at

It's hard and the street's a jungle (I'm telling you, I'm telling you)
Especially with your pretty colors (I'm telling you, I'm telling you)
So stay low and keep it humble (I'm telling you, I'm telling you)
Black women hold it down, keep your feet on the ground
Black men keep searching and you'll be found

It's been hard for me
Trying strugglin' in the streets
But where I've been- Is no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going- Is not where I'm stoppin' at

It's been hard for me

And where I'm going- Is not where I'm stoppin' at

In this world of continuous bullshit and full clips
Seems all we have to pass down is being useless
Broken homes, babies all alone, parent's never there
No food, no clothes to wear, anger everywhere
Ain't no values being taught, no productive thoughts
Jealousy rules the world, take shit at any cost
Gotta change our state of life, keep it worth livin'
God gave us voices to speak and that's our way of givin'
It's so much bigger than the furs and the jewels
What about encouragin' the youth to do well
What about givin' back- what about unifying
Shit we all black- get it together
Everybody's got their trials and tribulations
Learn to change the negative to positive situations
Don't hold the lessons that you learn
Pass it on and except the blessings that could earn

It's been hard for me

Mary J. Blige,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Verse 1:
You came home late last night
You smelled just like the scent of her
Not only that but you had lipstick all over your shirt
I'm thinking to myself
This man has no respect for me
I knew it all along 'cause you were talking in your sleep

It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby
It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

Chorus:
I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
'cause I'm through with you
(repeat twice)
I heard you...

Verse 2:
What you were sayin in your sleep
It violated me
No doubt about it
But there's nothing left for you and me
Because your busted
And I might as well go on
Boy it's gonna take a long time
To make this a happy home
You know..

HOOK:
It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that

But I misunderstood, baby

In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do

All you had to say is
I don't wanna be with you but
Don't you tell the truth now

Mary J. Blige,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Everyday I'm trying to get to know ya
But more and more you're changing up your act
Everyday I look for ways to bring us closer
But more and more you appear to be drawing back
And lately when We're making love its getting weaker
My heart don't feeling it and feeling is everything
And I'm feeling like maybe you just don't feel it
And I don't know how to play it
In the past, didn't know how to say it
But I

[Chorus]
I held my tongue too long
I can't do it no more (I just can't do it babe)
See how can a man be so cold
To a woman that loves him most (I don't get it at all)
(But if you wanna go) There's the door
(I can't hold ya) Boy you're grown
(You must got me confused)
(I treat myself way too good)
And a love that tears you down ain't really love

Everyday I'm getting up and making breakfast
And more and more you're walking in without a word
And everyday I'm trying to ask, ""Baby what's wrong?""
And more and more you say I'm getting on your nerves
And then you take me to the level of some bullshit
Ya said ya never had these problems from a white chic
You got me twisted and twisted is just not how I get with it
You need to sit down and hear it

[Chorus]

I'm pouring out my heart (my heart)
Don't just sit there while my heart is on the line
Speak your truth (speak your truth)
What it's worth (what it's worth)
Not a word you say will go unheard
Now if it's like that
Then baby just pack your bags
Cause I'm sick and tired of fighting
I'm sick and tired of trying
I had enough of waiting
I'm not that good with playing
I know I love you
But I love myself too

[Chorus: x2]",Ain't Really Love
Mary J. Blige,"Baby, can I talk to you for a minute?
Ohhh...
Ohh...
Listen...

Boy, you had me fooled
I can't believe you
'Cause' you never done anything that I asked of you
Always talking like I just can't do right
Blaming me for everything and that just ain't right
'Cause I...

[Chorus:]
'Cause I can't do this alone (I don't know what to do)
Alone(I'm tryna stay with you)
It's not all about you (Ohhh)

Alone...
Alone...
Alone

And I gave you everything I had
Yeah
And I never said nothing
Did everything for you
What did you do?
Nothing
Then you got the nerve to wanna run your mouth
Like I ain't never held you down
Baby, what did I do to deserve this?
'Cause' I put you on a shelf
Girl, I need help
'Cause' I can't do this alone, baby

[Chorus:]

And I tried to work this out(I'm tryna work this out)
But boy you're changing now (Oh, you're changing now)
What do I do? (What do I do?)
I'm so confused (I'm so confused, baby)

Said I tried everything.
I've done everything.

Mary J. Blige,"I know I do some things that make you so confused
One minute I'm so in love and the next I can't stand you
But if you may ask it's just the things that you do
That reminds me of all of the mess that I've been through

I got this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
With all this baggage in me
Everytime I hurt your feelings it's what someones done to me
I don't mean to hurt you

Heartache and pain I just can't do it again
So I look for the worst and brace myself for the hurt
But nobody has ever treated me this way
Please be patient with me 'cause I want you to stay but I got all

You know I love you yes I do
So don't, don't we get it confused

'Cause the sex was good, you had my mind, and I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently (thinking)
You was coming home to me (well)
Damn, I never heard the keys or
Felt your tap saying are you sleep (rewind that)

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Time to choose my clothes, choose my friends, be with my family
They been asking, 'girlfriend, where you been? We, ain't seen you in weeks.'
Been chasing this fool around, thinking he gonna hold me down
I would follow his lead thinking I'm gonna be the one he keep around
What I needed (not your finance)
And all that I needed (real commitment)
I really couldn't see it (not a real man)
You said you be there (in this relationship)
So many men (these men) think that all a girl (they think)
Needs is to be sold a dream, but I want
For real

You're missing more to let you play me
Don't wanna play house no more, no more
I'm tired of you playing
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry
It's time to do something for me

You turned your back, and back I came running
But the simple fact is that you ain't want me
Done enough lying and crying to myself
Nothing left to do but move
What else can I do but leave?
I believed that you would marry me, but now I gotta breeze
I be's with LT when you come to your senses
But then it's too late
That's always how it be
Catch me with the B's on the wheels, gizeppi's on the hills
Shoulda Marc Jacob Fe Fe bagged me when you had me
Next dude will gladly pick up where you left off

So I understand why daddy couldn't be there 
Cause it's so obvious no body taught him how to be a father either 
I'm not saying this to reminisce on the past 
I'm just saying this to make you understand that I need a father. 
And this is my problem this is why I couldn't keep no one this is why I couldn't stay alone I was so scared alone everyone needs daddy and 
I don't think she understands cause she really need a father the father in you my friend 

She really needed a father, the father in you 
When your wife is speaking fellas pay attention yeh 
Don't ignore her 
Oh I really need the father in you",Father in You

I'm the Los Angeles King and you remind me of Mary the R&B Queen
I got the 411 what's crackin' what I owe you for helping me go 4 times platinum
I had a kid to my life he's almost 2 I guess what I'm tryin' 2 say

Trying to find my way
Then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that its just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
And I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that year
It was when Aaliyah died I couldnt hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

Seen many men in my time
But none of them compare to mine
I ain't gotta knock on wood
To tell y'all that I got it so good
He's everything that I need and
All that a man should be
Put me on a flight if I wanna
Buy out the mall if I wanna

And I know ya'll heard before
These same old metaphors
My love is so much more
I don't wanna change it
I don't wanna do without ya baby
Cause he's just above the rest
I must confess the best
Love that I've ever had
And I just gotta let you know this

Don't let em tell you nothing different
You're the only one I'm needing
I don't want no one but you
Baby no one will do
And what they say don't even matter
They don't know what I know about ya
I don't want no one but you
Baby no one will do

It's me and him through the wire
Cause when it comes to love he delivers
My personal UPS
I'm sending him an SOS
That I love him and I want him
And don't wanna replace him with nobody else
I'mma keep holding on
I'mma keep the loving strong, ayayyyy

And I know ya'll heard before

We hurt each other
Then we do it again

Love is a temple
Love a higher law

I'm the Los Angeles King and you remind me of Mary the R&B Queen
I got the 411 what's crackin what I owe you for helping me go 4 times platinum
I had a kid to my life he's almost 2 I guess wat I'm tryin 2 say
Is thank you for over ten years in the ghetto gospel

But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere

And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

I came with 'share my world'
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way
Then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that its just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
And I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that year
It was when Aaliyah died I couldnt hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

[Chorus]

You remind me
Of a real love
(you don't 'ave to worry)
Real love
All night long
I'm goin down

You are everything but without it baby

And the cars
And the cribs
And the way
That things
Took off
I was signin'

On 1-25th
Just tryin'
My best
To get on
Back when
Me and puff
And b.i.g.
Was kids
And I knew
Jodeci
I was young
And tough
And fresh in love
And it was
All a dream
Signing a contract
No guiding light

I can get out

And get my
Family right

Were my life

Lessons that I've learned

Torn apart

Throw a fit
I used
To shed
A doubt
And blame it

Was mary than
And this is
Mary now

It's about
How we
Respect ourselves
And the men
Have no control
Of our self-esteem
And when
We see that
Then we can
Let go

Some mistakes
I lost some
Friends along
The way

Carry it

And I know
That there's
More for

Mary J. Blige,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Didn't expect so much stress to develop between me and you
I knew that it wasn't easy but sometimes
When we fight it don't seems like God's design
But then I hear words you said
And I promised I would stand for you and be true through the bad and the good
And I know what it means to be committed
So here's a word for you but you just ain't with it

Yea-ah
Tell me what happen?, 
It started changin' up and you and me are actin so different (oh)
I know that I love you
And you are in love with me that's watcha say 
But I just can't believe it

Did we disagree fuss and fight, get it wrong more that it's right
Did we make mistakes and fix mistakes but never even seein eye to eye,
But when the dust clear and settle and all is said and done
When the night breaks and the day finally come

Will you love me in the morning (eh,eh,eh) 
After the evening, will you, leave me?
Will you love me in the morning (eh, morning, eh, morning, eh)
Now that the suns up, will you, give up?

I agree, it's different
What once was just stayed the same (no)
But weren't you expecting this, 
See when it's true love there will be some goodness (yea-ee)
Now your so a distant
I know I'm not the women that I was,but you are not the man you was (oh)
But if you say you love me
 when its ain't enough you still in love you shouldn't even say you was

I know things, ain't the way suppose to be, 
But o.k. we'll get there this 
Baby its worth it. 
Sometimes we have doubts and love just ain't perfect

Cos it's meant for us to be this way
And in a minute it will be all
Cos we wanted it for so long

Just wait until you get home tonight
When we make up
We can deal with it
But after we make love oohh
I'm happy to be here tonight
Just wait until tonight

You show me something in love
That no one can contest
If I had to lay out my life for you ?
Can this moment pass
Gotta make it our last

Ooh I know it feels so right
I know my feeling just can't be tonight
Be sacrificed
Wait until tonight
We can put it all on the line

Just wait until you get home tonight
When me make up
We can deal with it
But after we make love oohh

But I promise you my love I'll never fail you
Don't you get it?
Each day we're writing history
A thousand years from now they'll talk about you and me

Put your soul through the business and touch the weight of your heart
But when you're backs on the wall there's a shortage of friends
You know that I'm with you till the end

'Cause we got hood love, cause I be cussin' I be screaming
Like its over
Then I'm loving then I'm feeling just to hold ya
And that's how we do
You know that hood love is the good love
That's me and you
How feel love?
Well I'm with ya never quit ya and
Now that's real love
When your not here then I miss ya cuz
I still love the way we do
You know that hood love is the good love
Ya that's me and you

Sometimes I think about leaving you
But wen I think about what we've been through
I get a feeling like it could be worse
'Cause I've given u my best and I don't mind it
That's fine
'Cause wen you loving somebody hard then you'll love that way for life
You got all of my heart and I'll never leave ya side
I gave my words to love all the way to the end
So no matter what I'll be right here
I'll be right here with you

Now I'll play tough but not for too long
You are someone I depend on
No matter how I act sometimes I can never walk away
Thought about it plenty times but no can take ya place

Ooh and there ain't no you, then there ain't no me
And if there ain't no us then I'd rather be by myself
'Cause no one else can understand my history and treat me like I need

Mary J. Blige,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who stand looking.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying the stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no

Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

He needs to start with your head

So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do

It filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist

Mary J. Blige,"I try my best to keep you here
But it's hard to hold a shadow
You said goodbye but I couldn't hear
Too busy praying for a miracle

And you left me on my knees
You just walked out the door
You didn't even have the decency
To intervene while I was begging God for
You to love me

I prayed about us every night
Boy I know you had to hear me
You could've stopped me then and told the truth
But instead you pulled a pillow over your head

And you left me on my knees
You just walked out the door
You didn't even have the decency
To intervene while I was begging God for
You to love me

You should've told me it was useless,
That I was praying empty prayers
But you hopped in your car, pulled out your keys
While you were leaving
I was begging God for you to love me

And I know that he had something better to do
Than to sit and listen to a broken-hearted fool
Could've been saving the world from a tragedy
But instead he was listening to me

I was asking, begging for a sign
To bring comfort to this lonely heart of mine
But apparently you're not what I need
I guess you walking out was him answering

You left me on my knees baby
You just walked out the door
You didn't even have the decency
To intervene while I was begging God for
You to love me

I tried my best to keep you here
But it's hard to hold a shadow",Empty Prayers

It’s my story, I’ma state it, you could love it or hate it
I’m just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That’s garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I’m reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your best, how it get to this

Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I’m to the point where I don’t know what I believe in

If you don’t want this, I don’t want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write, back
Tell me why it’s like that

So make up your mind, boy decide

That your baby boy would give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would calm the storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy would walked where angels trod?
When you kiss your little baby you know you kissed the face of God?

Mary did you know
Oh oh woah woah ooo

The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak

Mary J. Blige,"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with string
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

La neige étend son manteau blanc
Et les yeux levés vers le ciel
A genoux, les petits enfants
Avant de fermer les paupières
Font une dernière prière.

Petit papa Noël
Quand tu descendras du ciel
Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.
Mais avant de partir
Il faudra bien te couvrir
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid
C'est un peu à cause de moi.

Il me tarde tant que le jour se lève
Pour voir si tu m'as apporté
Tous les beaux joujoux que je vois en rêve
Et que je t'ai commandés.

Petit papa Noël
Quand tu descendras du ciel
Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.

Et quand tu seras sur ton beau nuage
Viens d'abord sur notre maison
Je n'ai pas été tous les jours très sage
Mais j'en demande pardon.

Mary J. Blige,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power, to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires, will come to you

And if your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind, so kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue (like a bolt)
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Your dreams come true
Your dreams come true",When You Wish Upon a Star

As sweet as can be
And grabbed my left hand
Started stepping
What else did I need to know
I said yes if you wanted to go
'Cause you are heaven
But you left me here

So I gotta see that boy again
'Cause I wanna feel that joy again

But I ain’t gonna lie, I wanna lose her

Ooh you have a way with females
I didn’t get your number or email
What the hell was in my brain
'Cause I know that you believe
But I couldn’t let you see that I was stressing
I lost breath and
Then you grabbed your Mercedes keys
But you paused before you leave
And I just stood there
Like I didn’t have a care

The person you want is losing

But the circumstances, changes course
Which is entirely up to the boss

Just because it’s written don’t mean you can’t play
Your hand to change your fate

He knows when you're a wake

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Mary Lambert,"Know girls who are trying to fit into the social norm
Like squeezing into last year's prom dress
I know girls who are low rise, mac eyeshadow, and binge drinking
I know girls that wonder if they're disaster and sexy enough to fit in
I know girls who are fleeing bombs from the mosques of their skin
Playing Russian roulette with death; it's never easy to accept
That our bodies are fallible and flawed
But when do we draw the line?
When the knife hits the skin?
Isn't it the same thing as purging
Because we're so obsessed with death
Some women just have more guts than others
The funny thing is women like us don't shoot
We swallow pills, still wanting to be beautiful at the morgue
Still proceeding to put on make-up
Still hoping that the mortician finds us fuckable and attractive
We might as well be buried with our shoes
And handbags and scarves, girls
We flirt with death every time we etch a new tally mark
Into our skin
I know how to split my wrists like a battlefield too
But the time has come for us to
Reclaim our bodies
Our bodies deserve more than to be war-torn and collateral
Offering this fuckdom as a pathetic means to say
""I only know how to exist when I'm wanted""
Girls like us are hardly ever wanted you know
We're used up and sad and drunk and
Perpetually waiting by the phone for someone to pick up
And tell us that we did good
You did good

I know I am because I said am
I know I am because I said am
I know I am because I said am
My body is home
My body is home
I know I am because I said am
I know I am because I said am

So try this
Take your hands over your bumpy love body naked
And remember the first time you touched someone
With the sole purpose of learning all of them
Touched them because the light was pretty on them
And the dust in the sunlight danced the way your heart did
Touch yourself with a purpose
Your body is the most beautiful royal
Fathers and uncles are not claiming your knife anymore
Are not your razor, no
Put the sharpness back
Lay your hands flat and feel the surface of scarred skin
I once touched a tree with charred limbs
The stump was still breathing
But the tops were just ashy remains
I wonder what it's like to come back from that
Sometimes I feel a forest fire erupting from my wrists
And the smoke signals sent out are the most beautiful things
I've ever seen
Love your body the way your mother loved your baby feet
And brother, arm wrapping shoulders, and remember
This is important
You are worth more than who you fuck
You are worth more than a waistline
You are worth more than any naked body could proclaim
In the shadows, more than a man's whim
Or your father's mistake
You are no less valuable as a size 16, than a size 4
You are no less valuable as a 32a than a 36c
Your sexiness is defined by concentric circles within your wood
Wisdom
You are a goddamn tree stump with leaves sprouting out

Look at the luck and fortune you've had
Why do you cry at night?""

Mary Lambert,"We went out to the city in your friend's Chevy
You and me stumbled in the backseat ready
Laughing at the top of my lungs
Said I'll never get old

We got lost on our way home from the city
All the lights had us thinking we were infinitely
Bigger, brighter, bolder, ready
Said I'll never get old
I'll never get old

Chasing the moon when I was on your front porch
All the days felt like chasing the sunrise into the morning
Feels like I'm
Chasing the moon
Chasing the moon

I got caught hiding bottles in my bedroom
Kelsey laughed, she said ""you never learn, do you?""
Every night had me hanging on the thrill of it
Sneaking out my house, waiting for your kiss

None of us ever felt beautiful
Telling secrets in the backseat confessional
Couldn't understand the meaning of our glory days
But we'll never get old
We'll never get old

What heaven did you leap from, dear love
How can I spell your name without the sound of
Autumn underneath my tongue
Without acknowledging the lovers who bent me in half
Bless them for bringing me to you
How can I say your name without
Also breathing the words, my God, I found you
How can I ever speak again with this mouth
When it has found where it belongs
When you touch me
I am a bed of calla lilies
I will make a house for you and fill it with evergreens
I will paint sunsets on every wall
So you can only see beautiful things
How can I say ""love"" without wanting to fold myself into you
Like a thousand paper cranes
Dear one
I was halved the moment I was born
The other piece of me is inside of your mouth
And I was found whole the moment you spoke",Dear One

Jessie's got himself a girl
And I want to make 'er mine

And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell 'er that I love 'er, but the point is probably moot

'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!

I dream in color

A deaf tongue and blinded ears
Can you fill the shelves in here

Want you to want me like I'm all you got
Mama see's seeing it but can't make me stop
Telling the truth it might mean you get broken
But letting it hurt that's my method of coping
Doubt in season like that smoke in my lungs
What they project on me what I've become
Down on my knees unsure what to say
No I never learned how to prey
Don't know, know who I been fooling
But you got me running in circles I'm ruined
Let you inside opened up all my wounds
Taking my ribcage and ripped it in two

Tie off all my tendons
Watch how they stretch
Oh I've got the muscle

Knocking down my sternum
Began at a young age
Too much space between

There's impenetrable silence inside of my head
There's nothing I can buy when I'm practically dead
I get so tired of writing everything I should have said
That maybe this time I'll put my pen down and just tell you instead
You see I opened up my ribcage and violins flew out
The organs softly played through my violin mouth
I got lights hotter than love hidden beneath my tongue
Written on my skin
It tells me your the one

Times are hard but I heard you say
Why you telling me
I've been seeing for myself
Down along the lea
Don't know how well off you are
Pills and money, safe and warm
Watching from your silver star
You don't know you're born
Harbored in your little cove
Loath to put to sea

Take a good look in her eyes
Pupils look like plates

His lamest flame will be
Too brief and burn too pale
And all attempts to fire it up again will fail
I run around behind his friends
And play the waiting game

There's nothing I can do
So why do I keep holding on
I only wish I knew
I was born too weak and I feel like a fool
But it's out of my domain

His lamest flame will die
Before the night is out
Just a heap of ash
The wind is blown about

For him these feelings fade away
But for me they're still the same
Na na na na na na na na na - His Lamest Flame

His lamest flame is here
And flickering its last
And through the dying light
We journey to the past

But still I'd give up all I've got
To have him back again

Cash in your ignorance learn about the truth
And it's no playground it's one big let down
It looks like a backstreet bargain baby
But you just got screwed
And on that high road you live in shadows
And the one that follows is your silent twin
And it's a sad reminder
That when you try to find her
She's back on the old main drag in trouble again

Ten hail Mary's and she's ready to score
Dealing with the damage of a grown up war
But turning tricks and tourniquets
Are nothing more than another wasted day

Cinderella's on the corner with her eyes in tears
Waiting for the moment when the magic appears
They expected her home for the past two years
I guess she lost her way

The tide is always turning
Deep inside your desire's burning
And you're dying just to get away

You thought you had it down
When you first came to this town
Now you're begging for a helping hand
And a brand new day

And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Mary Lou Williams,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary [#]
Mary Lou Williams,"What's your story, morning glory
What makes you look so blue
The way that you've been acting
I don't know what to do
For I love you, sure as one and one make two
What's your story, morning glory
Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So, won't you let me know your point of view

What is your story, morning glory
You've got me worried too
The postman came this morning
And left a note for you
Did you read it, then you know that I love you

Oh, won't you tell me that you love me too","What's Your Story, Morning Glory? [#]"
Mary Lou Williams,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no-how
Without a song

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song!!",Without a Song [#]
Mary Lou Williams,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Mary Lou Williams,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",Carioca
Mary Lou Williams,"I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me

Mary Lou Williams,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight

Mary Lou Williams,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Love came, planning to stay

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

This morning, the same one you're going to make love with tonight.

Mary Martin,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new

That thrills and delights me, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness Of You
Mary Martin,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do

And foolish though it may seem 
To me that's everything 

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you 
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

With the sound of music,
With songs they have sung,
For a thousand years.

My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise from the lake
To the trees.

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze,
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night,
Like a lark who is learning to pray.

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who

Who once knew better words

If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like

The set that's smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios

Can get Russian reds to yes her

Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows

And good's bad today
And black's white today

Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's

Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction

Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm

And never wished for turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too

I was never at a party
Where they honored Noel Caaahd
But social circles spin too fast for me

I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I love the theater but never come late
I never bother with people I hate

Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls

Life without care
I'm broke--it's ""oke""
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ball games, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight that isn't a fake
I love the rowing on Central Park Lake
I go to opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose?
I'm flat--that's that
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp

Don't know the reason for cocktails at five
I don't like flying, I'm glad I'm alive
I crave affection, but not when I drive
That's why the lady is a tramp

Folks went to London and left me behind
I missed the crowning, Queen Mary didn't mind
Won't play Scarlett in ""Gone with the Wynde""
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like to hang my hat where I please
Sail with the breeze
No dough--hi-ho!
I still like Roosevelt, I think he's a champ

Mary Martin,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get a Kick Out of You
Mary Martin,"How I love a glass of beer
(More beer)
Beer goes very good with beer

When I'm drinking beer I'm thinking, ach life is beer
But there's someone I love even more than beer

I love Louisa, Louisa loves me
When we rode on the merry-go-round
I kissed Louisa and then Louisa, Louisa kissed me
We were so happy, so happy and free

But today, yes sir, they're shining and new
Oh, what a change has come to me
I've been dusted off the shelf
I am not myself
What a different world I view

I see a new sun up in a new sky
And my whole horizon has reached a new high
Yesterday my heart sang a blue song
But today hear it hum a cheery new song

New love, new luck, new sun in the sky",New Sun in the Sky
Mary Martin,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,

You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.

You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say

You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.
I'm a lazy lout that's just about to stop,

You're the top!

You're the top! You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top! You're a hot tamale.

You're Ovaltine.

I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
That I can break free
Cause you see I have been down for so long
Feel like the hope is gone
But as I lift my hands, I understand
That I should praise you through my circumstance

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just want to praise you
I just want to praise you
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you

Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
So much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gon lose my mind
But I know you want to see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need you to lift this load
Cause I can't take it anymore

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just want to praise you
I just want to praise you
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you

Been through the fire and the rain
Bound in every kind of way
But God has broken every chain
So let me go right now

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just want to praise you
I just want to praise you
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just want to praise you
I just want to praise you
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just want to praise you
I just want to praise you
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you

Take them off
What ya gonna do, yeah

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just want to praise you
I just want to praise you
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you",Shackles (Praise You)
Mary Mary,"Everybody has bad days
When they feel like no one cares
Call your friends in the middle of the night
And they just can't be there
I know someone who's available
And He'll answer every time you call
He won't ever leave you alone
That's just the kind of friend you should know

Anybody know somebody
Someone who will love anybody
Even if they're just a nobody
I know somebody, somebody

Anybody know somebody
Someone who will love anybody
Even if they're just a nobody
I know somebody, somebody

Let me offer you a suggestion
And I'll leave without no doubt
A love that reaches far and wide
That's where my faith lies
Let me tell you why
Cause every time I'm sad and lonely
He comes and puts His arms around me
Cause God's love is the first
And it is the last so if you ask

Anybody know somebody
Someone who will love anybody
Even if they're just a nobody
I know somebody, somebody

Oh I got a friend who loves me so
You ask how much I'll never know
And since I've found this love
I want to share it with everyone, oh

Anybody know somebody
Someone who will love anybody
Even if they're just a nobody
I know somebody, somebody

Would You hear his prayer tonight?

I know the answer to your question 
Yes the Father still loves
Sometimes when you have children
You don't always like what they do 
So when go to your heavenly Father
Say Lord I love You
And when you ask Him for forgiveness
This is what He'll say to you

I sent a message in the wind
When the birds sang their song

Mary Mary,"It was once upon a time not long ago
Lived a little black boy in the middle of the ghetto
Pretty good kid but he always found trouble
Inner city life it ain't hard to find trouble
No income in the home you find struggle
2 years struggling it's no puzzle
He hit the block hard and found him a hustle
Burned the wrong bridge and now he needs muscle
He tried to let it go but the streets don't forgive
I guess they ain't heard of live and let live
But after going round and round he broke it down finally found out
That only god can save him now

Save me now, please save me now, save me now, please save me now
I'm on my knees, down at the floor
You're the one I need oh lord
Save me now

Still I'm wondering
How in the world did I get here
And what am I doing
Took the ring and acted like I do
Without the ceremony
Now I got three little ones and I'm
Hurting and I'm lonely
Threw away my dreams when I left school
Now I'm 22 never should've choose him over you

Mary Mary,"Born into simplicity
Such an average Child, you wouldn't think
That His life would bring the greatest change
And by His name, every life would be saved

Only one could be Savior
Only one could be King

How would you describe a king?
Would he wear a crown and royal things?
Or would he rule the world with a strong hand?
Or give his life for all of man?

Only one could be Savior
Only one could be King

Wise men came from far away
Following a star to find the way
To the place where Baby Jesus lay
Just to bring Him gifts and give Him praise

Only one could be Savior
Only one could be King

Call Him Emmanuel, they call Him Messiah
The Savior, the Son, He's the King
Born of a Virgin, so pure and so perfect
Forever He's worthy, He's the King
There's nobody greater than my precious Savior

Mary Mary,"He came to be, so meek and mild, a savior yet and humble child
A holy Lamb, precious lamb, they called him Lamb of God
It was the greatest demonstration of love that the world would ever know
God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son
And this son came as a lamb, he would become a conquering King
But he came as a Lamb, He would be king of kings
And Lord of Lords but he came as a Lamb, and he came for you
People came from miles around, all to worship and bow down
Oh the privilege, the privilege it was, they called him Lamb of God.
Sheppard's came seeking this lamb, and their lives will never be the same
The angelic host formed a choir, and sang from the heavenliest 
Wise men were wise enough to seek and bow down to this Lamb
He came to seek and to save the lost, he came because he loves you
It's great to know that God so loved the world
But more important to know, that God loves you
Now here it is, many years have passed
They say his time has come and passed
Oh but I'm so glad, that it remains
You're still the Lamb of God
John looked over the horizon and saw one walking as no man walked
And he said behold the, Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world
He's still saving, he's still redeeming, and he's still there for you today
Receive him, say yes to him, and he will change your life
Time can not change him and ages do not time him, he's still the Lamb of God

Still holy, still righteous, still the Lamb of God
Still savior, still redeemer, still the Lamb of God
Still alpha, still omega, still the Lamb of God 
Still lovely, still healing, still the Lamb of God

Have you ever had something that you knew you had to say
But the message wasn't so pretty
Couldn't say it the nice way
Kinda like you're jealous, you're selfish
You got a bad attitude

See my grand momma told me that I'd better tell the truth
Cause if I hold this information and just let it brew
It's gonna be like

Mary Mary,"""God made dirt and dirt don't hurt!""

Funny thing about a garden
Beauty lives within its gates
Bugs and thorns and weeds, they grow there
But they all help to create
Vivid color variations
Sweet aromas and sensations
Realize under it all, something not so beautiful
But we all

Need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain to wash our souls
We need a little bit
(I) need a little dirt to grow.

Life at times can make you weak.
And I have cried myself to sleep
Cause reality makes you cry
But the truth will dry your eyes
Things they just can't stay the same
When you work hard and you pray
Yeah it may be kind of rough now
But the point I'm trying to make is that we

Need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain to wash our souls
We need a little bit
(I) need a little dirt to grow.

Oh sometimes you may sing for yourself
You struggle hard just to prevail
its the lesson you need to learn
its the way you've got to earn
Champions never accept defeat
They fall and get back on their feet
Cause they know (they know)
Like I know (I know)
That if you want to grow we

Need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little bit of dirt to grow
We need a little bit
(I) Need a little bit
Need a little rain to wash our souls
We need a little bit
(I) need a little dirt to grow.

Need a little dirt to grow

Mary Mary,"I hold a memory of myself
Reflections of what I used to be
These broken roads that got me here
Can't make it hard to face reality
But a new day is here
It's time that I embrace it
Can't wait another day
Right now I gotta face it

I never ever wanna press rewind
Never wanna go back in time
Not much glory
In that story but it's mine so I'm
Loving who I am today
The past has past away
Finally I
Have forgiven me

I hold a memory of myself
So young and foolish and not knowing
Careless decisions that I made
I wish somebody would have told me
But a new day is here
It's time that I embrace it
Can't wait another day
Right now I gotta face it

A transformation
The old into the new

He hides in the midst of religion
But I know that my God is listening there for me
There's a greater mission
You're no girl, you're no man, but a plan for greater peace
I'll fight for the light until my flesh falls deceased
I'm fighting the devil, fighting police
And in the church Lord I'm looked at as Satan
Cause in my music I curse
But I'm trying to do better and that's the thing that really hurts
All this sex and the drugs in my life mean nothing
When my Superfriend hugs me at night tears come rushing
There's no kryptonite, no dealing no lie that could be told
That can separate the power that you have over my soul
So stunting is a habit when I'm gripping this mic
Y'all thinking I'm a pimp but I'm trying to be like Christ

Caught me before I hit the ground

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Take these broken wings and learn to fly

You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise",Blackbird
Mary McCaslin,"We have been so close together
Each a candle each a flame
All the dangers were outside us
And we knew them all by name

   See how the bramble and the rose
   Intertwine
   Love grows like the bramble and the rose
   Round each other we will twine

Now I've hurt you and it hurts me 
Just to see what we can do
To ourselves and to each other 
Without really meaning to

So put your arms around me
And we'll sing a true love song
And we'll learn to sing together
Sing and laugh the whole night long

Mary McCaslin,"My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on.
I need your strength, 
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
From this old world I try to hide my face,
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place.
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell,
in darkness with memories I know so well.
 
I need your love more than before,
I can hardly carry on anymore.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe, 
without you babe,without you babe,
My mind and soul have felt like this,
Since love between us no more exist.
And each time that darkness falls,
if finds me alone with these four walls.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.

Mary McCaslin,"Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And I was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

In a lonely shack by a railroad track
I spent my younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made me a slave to my wand'ring ways

And the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And I was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

Oh I met a girl in a border town
I vowed we'd never part
Tho' I tried my best to settle down
She's now alone with a broken heart

You don't sound different,

You were above me,

Mary O'Hara,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

Mary O'Hara,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

These things are dear to me

Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.

He was too good to me
How can I get along now
So close he stood to me
Everything seems all wrong now
He would have brought me the sun

He'd never say go away now
I was a Queen to him
Who's gonna make me gay now
It's only natural that I'm blue

I throw myself in a watery grave
With fourteen horses on top of my head
I hear the voice again and again

I walk through the everlasting pit
By the mountain of fire and the fountain of spit
The pilgrims beside me just talk talk talk
I am the goblin and the mangled hawk

A demon lured me to his bed
Where I fell into a poison sleep
I dreamed of a river of ants inside me
And they were sad and started to bleed

In the saddest voice, in the saddest voice

I think I'm returning to

To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

Mary Travers,"I have these moments
All steady and strong
I'm feeling so holy and humble
The next thing I know
I'm all worried and weak
And I feel myself starting to crumble

The meanings get lost
And the teachings get tossed
And you don't know what
You're going to do next
You wait for the sun
But it never quite comes
Some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message comes through

And it says to you. . .

Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival
And one day we'll all understand

I had a woman
Who gave me her soul
But I wasn't ready to take it
Her heart was so fragile
And heavy to hold
And I was afraid I might break it

Your conscience awakes
And you see your mistakes
And you wish someone
Would buy your confessions
The days miss their mark
And the night gets so dark
And some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message shoots through --

Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival
And one day we'll all understand

There is no Eden or
Heavenly gates
That you're gonna make it to one day
But all of the answers you seek
Can be found
In the dreams that you dream on the way",Part of the Plan
Mary VanArsdel,"Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Angels on my left and right
To keep me safe all through the night

There's a place way up high
Starry bright there, through the night there
Close your eyes, let your wishes fly
You'll be in Dreamland by and by

Dimpled and drowsy, off you go
Over the treetops, sliding down a rainbow
Sleepyhead, curl up in your bed
And 'til the sun says, ""Rise and shine""
Sleep warm in Dreamland, baby mine

There's a place worlds away
Time has wings there, green with springs there
Smiles and songs bloom on every tree
Only in Dreamland, just wait and see

Deep down inside us, a child's still there
Wishing for Dreamland, knowing that it's somewhere
Though it may seem so far away
If you believe that dreams come true
You'll find a Dreamland waiting for you
Mmm, go to sleep now, dear

Mary Wells,"That day, I first saw you passing by
I wanted, to ask your name but I...was much too shy
But I was looking at you so hard
That you must have had a hunch.
So you came up to me and asked me my name.

You beat me to the punch
That time
You beat me to the punch
Yes you did.

After, I had known you for what seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch.
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours.

You beat me to the punch
One more time
You beat me to the punch
Yes you did.

Since I loved you
I thought you would be true
And love me tender
So I let my heart surrender
To you, yes I did.

But I found out
Beyond a doubt
One day, boy
You were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me
Blue.

So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day.
And beat you to the punch
Yes I will
I'll beat you to the punch
This time.",You Beat Me to the Punch [DVD]

Mary Wiles,"Bobby Little lives on the other side of town,
He's got a picture of a girl in a gown,
He tells his daddy,"" someday you'll see, she will be with me.""
His daddy tells him, "" Son its just not right.
Shes from money boy, she's not your kind.
Don't even call, shell just turn you down.
You're from the wrong side of town.""

But every Sunday after Sunday school
Dressed in his finest hopin' she never knew.
He'd walk her home then he'd say good-bye with tears in his eyes,
She lives uptown in a big white house.
He knows someday but he don't know how.
Lord its not what he prefers, he'll have to break the news to her.
He's from the wrong side of town.

He doesn't have money, no he doesn't have have fortune or fame.
And he doesn't understand why he has to live his life in shame.
But he knows that he loves her, can he make her see somehow,
It shouldn't matter if he's from the wrong side of town.

Next Sunday its the same routin', oh but this time he's wearin' his jeans
He thinks its the last time he'll walk her home, then he'll be alone.
He takes her by the hand the truth he'll face
He knows in his heart she's gonna walk away, but she takes him by surprise.
She looks into his eyes and says "" Your from the wrong side of town.""

Well I don't need money, no I don't need fortune or fame,
And I don't know why you have to live your life feeling ashamed.
Don't you know that I love you, well I hope you do by now,
It doesn't matter if your from the wrong side of town
No it doesn't matter if your from the wrong side of town

Mary Williams,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

It's like heaven to be near you

Times when we're apart
And I can't face my heart

If my hours could be spent near you
I'd be more than content, near you

Make my life worth while

She is the older

And that we look like each other
There's something that they forgot

Just finish cleanin' up your room
Let's see the dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight
Or you don't go out Friday night.

And walk yourself to the laundromat
And when you finish doin' that
Bring in the dog and put out the cat.

Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen,"I've given up my nightlight 'cause I'm not scared of the dark.
I've tasted buttermilk, slept through Jurassic Park.
I've taken off my training wheels, used adult shampoo.
Sometimes there's no limit to the scary things I'll do.
I don't hide in the closet when I hear a thunderclap.
I dunk my head in water, I've sat on Santa's lap.
I never bat an eye when I get my measles shot.
So when things get scary, it's a good thing I've got

Bravery, I'm loaded with bravery
When I'm in a pinch, I don't even flinch
I'm cool and I'm calm

Bravery, I'm brimming with bravery
I'm always prepared. And if I'm still scared, I get my Mom.

First day at kindergarten, others might have wept.
I sat and played with Legos, At nap time, I just slept.
I climb the tallest jungle gyms, slide the biggest slides.
When I go to Disney World, I ride the biggest rides.
Last Friday at assembly, in front of the whole school,
I played a singing carrot and didn't lose my cool.
I hopped out on that stage, and sang out clear and strong.
In sticky situations, I always bring along...

Bravery
Three cheers for Bravery.
The sight of a ghost, won't turn me to toast.
I'm better than that.

Bravery
I'm brimming with Bravery.
But if I despair, and Mom isn't there,
There's always Dad.

Wavery
When my knees get wavery,
My heart's in my mouth, my nerves heading south,
And I've got the shakes.

Quavery
When my voice gets quavery,
I suck in my gut. 
I'm mean and I'm lean. 
I swagger and strut.
A P.T. Marine. Left right, left, right,
I left the jitters behind.

Three cheers for Bravery

When it goes halfway, I'm upside down!
So why do my feet stay stuck on the ground? It's not logical!
My Mom said ""Hon, does my hair look bad?"" I said ""Yes!""
She got mad. I tell truth, she tells Dad. 

Is that logical?
It's not logical. It's not logical. It's not logical.
Is there Elmer's glue on the sole of my shoe?
I'm full, but they say, ""one more bite.""
I'm wide awake, but they saw, ""Sleep tight!""
To say goodnight when it's still light? That's not logical.

Masa Sumide,"I pretend that I'm glad you went away
But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get, you could ask my heart
Just like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now, you know, I'll be loving you still
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had

Now that we're cosy and clinging,

And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Well sir, all I can say is

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

We stopped beside a little flower stall
A bunch of bright forget-me-nots
Was all I'd ever let you buy me

Once upon a summertime, just like today
We laughed the happy afternoon away
And stole a kiss at every street cafe

You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree
I was as proud as any girl could be
As if the mayor had offered me the key
To Paris

Now another wintertime has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chimed
You loved me once upon a summertime

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Long gone uptight years from Birdland
And I'm still teachin' it with 'em
Years from the land of the Bird
And I am still feelin' the spirit
5000 light years from Birdland
But I know people can hear it

Bird named it, Bird made it
Bird heard it, then played it
Well stated Birdland
It happened down in Birdland

In the middle of that hub
I remember one jazz club
Where we went to pat feet
Down on 52nd Street
Everybody heard that word
That they named it after Bird
Where the rythym swooped and swirled
The jazz corner of the world
And the cats they gigged in there
Were beyond compare

To play in Birdland is an honor we still dig

Searchin' in the sun for another overload

I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

Now all the labels out wanna send a memo 
To do a remix ya'll, but Mase say N-O 
Figure once I make it, they'll fake it 
And ain't nobody show me love when I was naked 
And when he threw my tape in the trash, I laughed 
Now a nigga' tape on blast, I laugh 
Figure as days pass, make more cash 
And I push everything from E to H-class

I was standin' on the corner sellin' dope for dough 
Now I no longer hope I'll blow, smoke my droll

But see, I could go the whole summer, gold Hummer 
But I'd rather go Lex bubble, cuz it's less trouble 
Make my dough and I just stack, no investment 
I live off just that 
Money, hoes, and clothes, and shit that I'm best at 
But I'm a Bad Boy so you gotta expect that 
Why do what most do? Do what you 'possed to 
Make hot jams ya'll, sell bicoastal 
If you want a hit you can let me coach you

This is so true, I do what pros do, 
Cuz broke ain't a state that I'm tryin' to go through 
Dealers give me credit any place I go to 
Drive out in the Benz say ""Let Mase owe you'""

Mase,"I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had twenty four hours to live, what would you do?  
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?

Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request

Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gon' play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow, so what

You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Fours, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, git them cats I wanted to git
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in eighty-six
Went home took a shower in nice cold water
And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?

What hey yo, if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papi's spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to twenty three, I'm a be strapped wit TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me

If I had twenty four hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct
Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds

Twenty four left until my death
So I'm gon' waste alot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

Want to help me get rid of my rivalries 
Want to be the ebony to my ivory

'Cause broke ain't a state that I'm tryin' to go through 
Dealers give me credit any place I go to 
Drive out in the Benz say ""Let Mase owe you'""

With all this money that we can make, 
Why y'all cats want to playa hate? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to?
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 
With all this money that we can make 
Why y'all cats want to playa hate? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 

See, the moral of the story is 
I'm not here to replace Notorious 
I'm just a young cat tryin' to do his thing 
Harlem World style, pursue my dream, 'cause see 
The things that went 3 mil, I didn't even like that 
You say you got mad hoes, well we'll see tonight
Mase be the cat that'll lead you to the light 
Messin' with me shorty, you'll be a-ight 
Stop listen' to all them cats on the block 
That tellin' you that Mase don't rock 
'cause Mase is hot and Mase got a drop and a yacht and a big knot
To move you and your moms off the block 
For real though, Mase got real dough
That be in briefcases cats kill fo' 
And since you can't beat us, it's best you join us 
'Cause I know you won't have this hold that's on us 

With all this money that we can make, 
Why y'all cats want to playa hate? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to?
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 
With all this money that we can make 
Why y'all cats want to playa hate? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to?",Do You Wanna Get $?

Mase,"Yo Carl man  come here  lemme school you to some shit 
Yo what up dud 
Remember that girl you said was nineteen somethin' 
Yeah I remember that shorty 
She was not nineteen 
Word! Yes she is she nineteen 
Nigga I followed her to school that's how I know 
Nigga I followed her to school you know I don't be into that 
Dog  dog  she showed me some ID bee word up 
Niggaz got to jail for that 
Lot a niggaz go to jail 
See you not a regular nigga right there, I know I know 
Her friend ain't want to give me the pussy 
You want to know what that bitch said to me 
What happened?  

I really want to mess wit you 
But I ain't ready to have sex wit you 
And I don't mind caressing on you 
But I need to be, I need to be 
You know I need to be loved by you 
You know I need to be hugged by you 
And I can't wait to be touched by you 
'Cause I need to be, 'cause I need to be 

How many niggas out remember the 
First time they try to take a girl virginity 
And through the bullshit, you lost your identity, and lost your cool 
'Cause you ain't know what to tell all your niggas at school 
I had niggas making bets like, did he fuck her yet? 
Ask her did he touch her bra, when I say nah they say ah
So tomorrow I use that pressure to undress her 
But the more I caress her, more I feel like a molester 
So I wait for the day deserve it 
But every time I go to touch it, then she say I hurt it 
I can't even talk sex, and then she say I'm perverted 
And then she say, Mase. why we can't wait? What, I ain't worth it? 
It ain't that but girl you never say I go too fast 
All I'm seatin' when I'm eating, or goin' in your ass 
I guess you like that, huh 
 
Now mother may I? Yes you may 
I told her 'bout all the baddest bitches from Harlem to LA 
Now anything that Mase can blaze, gotta get away 
See girl, work is work and baby, when I'm workin' I get paid 
For overnight stays that's gonna cost you breakfast on trays 
No need for shower curtains, we bath in camays 
I live the willie life 'cause that's the style that I portray 
We pop crystal like my niggas got a raise 
See nowadays man you got to know these bitches age 
'Cause they ass be real fast when they be goin' through that phase 
You fuck a girl that's young, and you gonna end up in the cage 
'Cause her moms ain't tryin' to hear that you never knew her age 
And naughty is the only way that Bad Boy plays 
Fuck them hoes, have them girls recoverin' for days 
A nigga like me, I have a girl head in a daze 
And I never eat pussy 'cause I'm too stubborn in my ways, come on 

I need to be licked from my head to my feet 
To make a long story short, girl I need me a freak 
She can be fat, black, light skin, type slim 
Matter fact shorty ain't even got to like me 
As long as when she grab my meat, she take it down real deep 
Till her body feel weak, then I'm fallin' asleep 
See I ain't talkin' 'bout these pre-madonna bitches you meet 
I need a girl that if I ask her handle me and my peeps 
Get down dirty, and lick ice down my butt cheeks 
Then she wiggle, then I giggle, then she feel my nutsy 
Then if she give my dick a kiss, probably give her clit a kiss 
Then I hit it from the back, then I yell whose shit is this 
Then I go so hard that she need her guts fixed 
If she make my nuts itch, I kill that slut bitch 
I done been around the world, uh huh, and never met a girl 
That's so thorough that could suck a dick until my toes curl, uh huh",I Need to Be

And number two, girls run like buses, you may miss one
Catch another one every  hour on the hour, promptly
And number three, what that girl ain't willin' to do
You got a hundred more girls more than willin'
And number four, is a  new rule to the new pimp testament
You can't be a playa and hate the playas
That don't make no sense

(Why you over there lookin' at me) 
I don't like when, you know, I'm in a club 
(Why you over there lookin' at me) 
And I'm with my honey 
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
You got, you know, the haters 
They wanna be tough guys all of the sudden

Hehe, cause you boys ain't with you 
Little do they know, your girl roll harder than 
Some of yo niggas
Dig? 

Now what the hell is you lookin' for? 
Can't a young man get money anymore? 
Let my pants sag down to the floor 
Really do it matter as long as I score? 
Can't my car look better than yours? 
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws 
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors? 
How is murder? 
P. Diddy name me pretty 
Did it for the money, now can you get with me? 
People wanna know who is he, he get busy 
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy 
Niggas on the block know Mase motto 
One thing about Harlem World, we all got dough 
98' Tahoe, Tommy and a Roscoe 
Case I'm every chased by a Donny Brascoe 

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here

Yo, I can't get mad cuz you look at me 
Cuz on the real, look at me 
Yo, it always be the haters that be sittin' in the rear 
Dissin' every gear, but they better listen here 
You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on yo own 
Cuz bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone 
Plus it won't be long till they send me the dome
Sit gently, while I'm on the Bentley phone 
Why you don't like me? 
Cuz I'm mad fly and icy? 
And why you can't satisfy yo wifey 
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure 
CD, TV's, really would I know ya 
Now me and blink float in the gold Rover 
So it's only right you get the cold shoulder 
And if you got a girl, don't be real committed 
Cuz Mase will hit it, you got to deal with it

Make it hot baby, make it hot (come on)
Make it hot baby, make it hot (come on)
Make it hot baby, make it hot (come on)
We don't stop

We was all at the Greek fest, it's hot and sandy 
I rent scooters,  I'm with my family 
Tank top, flip flop, really nothing fancy 
But get approached by a girl named Tammy 
Who looked good enough to be Miss Miami 
But say, since some her peeps call her Candy 
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy 
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's 
He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties? 
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties? 
Please, tell me something that I don't know 
Like if we have sex, you don't want dough
And if it's not a problem you can meet me at 10 
I'll be in room 112 and bring four friends 
And if you gon' hit me, it gotta be a quickie 
And please no hickies, cuz wifey's with me

Why you over there lookin' at me

I get hard when I want to
Angelettie, Bad Boy, niggas ain't ready

Yo, you the type of cat in the building holdin' the cracks
Playin' son to the niggas on the corner holdin' the gatts
Nigga come through, a nigga kill, never blow back
You the nigga never did but send in all the facts
Yo, I know niggas like you cuz I meet 'em all the time
And I greet 'em with the 9 if they ever keep what's mine
If I lose I get loc, put a fool in the yoke
Two to his throat, take his jewels and his coat
More than likely, you ain't got to like me
And this might be the last time I take you nicely
For my legion, fill up the season and start squeezin'
Niggas talkin' shit, be behind the cars weavin'
There's no breathin', ain't nobody in here leavin'
You kill my man, I kill your bitch, now we even
I'm from a cold world, where it's bleeding 20 degrees in
Fahrenheit, niggas get sniped for no reason
Do a lot of work, got plenty funds and many guns
Many sons, niggas do anything to anyone
And on the streets I don't doubt nuttin'
So when you talk to Mase better watch yo mouth son

Yo, if niggas wanna act we can act
You niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap

You niggas got gatts, we got gats
You niggas wanna style, we style

Yo, started with a blue whip, got a silver new whip
Cuz feds watch when I do shit, keep poppin' up new shit
Keep the whole Harlem World on some Clue shit
We crisp bub sippers, strip club niggas
Peace to the street team, ya'll get love niggas
Six years ago I was the have-not nigga
Hot nigga, represent for all my block niggas
Now I'm 6 drop niggas, baggette rock niggas
10 G's a show and I ain't even drop niggas
Shock niggas who thought I was a pop nigga
You go against Mase you get your wig rocked nigga!
Players like me'll leave your whole block bitter
Roll hard like when I see the bank stop nigga
Hustle is a hustle, so I never knock a nigga
Don't really fuck with Dame, but still I copped Jigga

Yo, if niggas wanna act we can act
You niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gatts
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul
You get wild, we get wild

Yo, I do this everyday, why brag about the glory?
Tell you the whole truth, never half the story
You wasn't no hater, you'd probably be happy for me
Billboard first slot in every category
Niggas say they love me, they don't love me
I know deep down they wanna slug me
I feel the vibe when they hug me
Luckily I rock jewels that be chuckie
Over Iceberg Rhugby, pushin' a Benz buggey
For a better batch, roll fever for notes
And need I approach little niggas seated in coach
I mean, um, think it's smaller than the weed in my roach
The seed in my smoke, the niggas ain't cheap, they broke
Oh yeah, this my dough year
Jealousy and envy'll get you nowhere
You don't like me, bet against me
You right, got dough do whatever you like
I get front row seats on the night of the fight
My Roley too tight, how many link, loosen my ice
And 'for I scoop the dice, bet a grand I beat the duece twice
Niggas who don't make dough, I can affil'ate with 'em
I'm dyin' from a sickness known as Willie-ism

Me no care if the B's be tinted, you won't see me in it 
'Less there's TV's in it 
I can tell by the way you talk and the way you chit-chat 
You foul and if you had styles you wouldn't get back 
You thinkin' you invincible, you ain't hard to get at 
I know everywhere you go, everywhere you live at 
I be wanna click-clack and you be ready to get back 
I be ready to go to war, you ain't gon' be with that 
You be the same cat that I run up on and spit at 
Bleedin' all crazy and don't know where you hit at 
I'm dead up, niggas doin' drama better shut up, I'm fed up 
Know for my Roley I was set up 
I can't let up, you in some shit that don't concern you 
Send a bullet through your thermal, you know crazy 

Everything that I do be all about the loot 
I been kickin' up dust in my Polo boots 
Gettin' blowed on the droll, takin' smoke up my nose 
I give the world to a woman, but I don't love hoes 
I'm a player, baby and don't you forget 
You need to get with it, let me hit it and split it 
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub, everyday 
The player way, the player way

I've been waiting 20 minutes baby 
Now drop yo drawers
And do something outstandin' with yo jaws
After all this waitin' I can see clean through yo forehead 
You mo' said than done, give mo' head than some 
Throw my jacket down in the puddle, hell no 
If you don't know a pimp, somebody besta tell y'all 
Yeah the women say it's good to have a confidant 
But yet and still they give it up to pimps, once a month 
See a lot of these pimp lovers, they took they K-man 
Front like they real and hold a fake in 
You wastin' the time 
Serious ballas and ready hoes, got da women walkin' 
Dibs on da strip with steady toes 
As I pull up, cranking is thinking the bigger fat, natural expertise 
Plenty money workin' for G and whoever next to me 
And I ain't gonna rest till we made a statement
I'm straight up you want it down? It's time for a replacement 

Everything that I do be all about the loot 
I been kickin' up dust in my Polo boots 
Gettin' blowed on the droll, takin' smoke up my nose 
I give the world to a woman, but I don't love hoes 
I'm a player, baby and don't you forget 
You need to get with it, let me hit it and split it

",Puff's Intro
Mase,"Yo, I be that young fly fellow, got thorough
Down for denaro, hit everything in the Triburo
And I'm the newest member of the Bad Boy team
And I'mma bring this nigga Puff mad more C.R.E.A.M.
With hooks galore, leave this city shook for short
And I'mma take 'em back where Biggie took 'em before
You stay a playa'
Since you can't stay up with the Pope
And stick to what you do best, stick to wearin' coke
You lookin' for excuses, ways to say you're broke
Can't keep a whip, cuz you can't pay the note
Fuck the side, I'm waiting for you on top, Mercedes drop
Black 380's cops, 'till the day I get knocked
All I ask when I die, dress me fly and neatly
And brush my waves so I'm handsome when the bitches greet me
Word from the wise, niggas jerk pies, we hurt them guys
Bust lead, to skin they head and leave them circumcised
So how you wanna settle this?
Rappin' or on some ghetto shit
We can do it yo way, with mics or with metal shit

Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise
Niggas run they mouth, I'mma break jaws
Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours
Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars
Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise
Niggas run they mouth, I'mma break jaws
Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours
Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars

Yo, yo before it's all over, lot of blood gon' be spilled
We ain't discriminatin' even thugs gon' be killed
We early inheritors , born into C.R.E.A.M
If a nigga' get sheist then we form as a team
Bullshit if you want and it be on for this C.R.E.A.M.
The weatherman don't even know the storm I'mma bring
But yo, I'm not the man with whom you interact
So before you grab gatts to jack, remember that
You take dough from Mase, you might as well send it back
I got thugs everywhere, where you going spending that
When clicks come to brawl, everything I hit fall
Niggas play sick wid y'all, wit me they ain't sick at all
No matter how big or small, I get rid of ya'll
And shit I spit at y'all, come in one size fit all

Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise
Niggas run they mouth, I'mma break jaws
Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours
Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars
Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise
Niggas run they mouth, I'mma break jaws
Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours
Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars

Yo, yo if you think I'm on some sweet shit
Then won't you creep quick, I let the heat spit
Make a nigga ""G"" flick, classic criminal
Keep a gatt by my genitals, thugs love me
So don't get splashed for the minimal
We never vest up, be in a double breast tux
Plus keep a fresh cut, picture me getting lefts stuff
I let one lose, to show you I ain't the one do
And I ain't puffin' nuthin', make all my gun shoot
You let your gun loose, none o' 'em niggas gun proof
Watch them niggas drop, when I pop one in they sunroof
And we be lead bustin', leavin' niggas head gushin'
You niggas talkin' 'bout guns like you said something
I'll be lacin' 'em, hollow tips, I be wastin' 'em
That's what you faggots get, tryin' to fuck with Mase and 'em
Bad Boy, '97, front, there'll be none o' that
And all you cats, running your trap, one in your cap

Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise

Do you really wanna hurt Mase?

Or is it really that you envy Mase?
Or you don't really wanna see me fly?  

Now you don't wanna see me angry
Ain't enough cops or cuffs to chain me
Days to arraign me, KKK's to hang me, insane me
Ya need ice picks to bang me
Need more than a straight jacket to restrain me
Or more guns with my prints for you to frame me and mame me
Nigga, look at you and look at us
My duns don't fuss, Harlem win you with a thrush
Nigga you better hush, I can mess out the cave 
Niggas still get touched
And them little ones you bust ain't enough for us
Listen here, Mase'll make you disappear
And yo' mouth'll be the reason that you missed this year
Man who needs ya? You don't need me, I don't need you neither
That's why my next Lex gon' be a two seater
And the things I do to you won't leave you beautiful
And though yo' feelin' fuck me, I'm feelin' mutual 

Do you really wanna hurt Mase?
Or do you really wanna make me cry?

From the M to the A nigga dollar sign E
Come around money if you ever tryin' to find me
I was murder for six years, seen no clean from it
Drop murder off, Mase woke up at Teen Summit
My niggas joke, niggas broke, kill a laugh
I got power, make a call, get a mil' in cash
Like my money and ya ain't cuz they don't tax me
Actually, anything you got to ask me, fax me
I'm no Beamer dreamer, I'm a Bentley man
Car totally smashed threw out 50 grand
How ya figure ya bigger when Mase that nigga
And every style I deliver come with much charisma
Knock it off, now will ya , I'm the one that bitches live for
Don't get me wrong you niggas make it hot I make it sizzler
And I don't know you cats, so don't you get familiar
And if you violate me and mine I guarentee I peel ya

Do you really wanna hurt Mase?

If I ever whisper on a remix, I got C-chips
Time is money, when you talk gotta be quick
I don't see how ya'll hang or even be wit
Niggas ridin' in the Benz with only one V-6
But I know how it is when ya go into the bar
Got girls overreact, they thowin' you a star 
Got niggas player hatin' don't even know who you are
And go as far as leavin' bullet holes in yo' car
When you're from Harlem World niggas never see yo' views
They wait for you to flop or be on BET News
All they see the G's and jewels, V's that ya cruise
Being the underdogs, they can't wait to see us lose
Don't hate me, thank me
I don't get mad when nigga's bitches prank me
Make you cranky to see me places that you can't be
I'm too pretty to let you niggas shank me 
And frankly, know you probably hate me cause you ain't me

Do you really wanna hurt Mase?
Or do you really wanna make me cry?
Or is it really that you envy Mase?

Yo  when you look in my eyes what chu see? 

A sincere man or just a bunch of G 

Why second guess  the brotha would last 

They took a whole clique from the George and the Ave' 

The booties in Arbua  boats and hoover crafts 

So if Biggie could love the dough, Murda could love the cash 

Butter Benz, gave the Tahoe to my other half 

If she got the Benz then guess what mami have 

Why dread it, tell the waiter too much ice in the crib 

Blick's so drunk, he think we singing ""Nights Like This"" 

He say when he grow up he want a life like this 

Sleep all day and plus you want ice like this? 

While girls throwin' head I ain't even touch dice 

I ain't trust Don King, how i'ma trust Mike? 

I date bull daggers, and I don't trust Dykes 

Need a clearner nina, 'cause they don't bust right 

I ain't stingy, when everybody see the plush life 

Buy rims before the benz, so I look just right 

Girls love me, try to get the girls that love Mike 

All I need is a cup of cool-Aid, I got enough ice 



1- [Cheri Dennis] 

All I ever wanted was you for me 

'cause that nigga who I'm with don't give a fuck about me 

And all I ever wanted was to be there for you 

'cause that girl who you with don't give a fuck about you 



You unhappy, and I see it when you cry 

You look like your life has just been minimized 

I ain't your man, I'm your man on the side 

You just call me when you plan to slide 

And if you ever feel like you want to creep 

All you gotta do is just give me a beep 

Only way I won't call you back less I'm asleep 

Gettin' my money or layin' it wit' a piece 

We hit the block, shop a lot 

She see her man, but she don't want to drop the top 

And you know that don't really mean a thing to me 

Can't no girl ever run game with me 

You know Mase, got a lot of places to be 

Spots in Ohio, kick in NC 

And I be wit older dudes and know the rules 

So if a man pick up the phone I know the code to use 



Repeat 1 



If you cheat on me, I'ma cheat on you 

If you don't speak of me, I won't speack of you 

I'll tell you now, we wait about a week or two 

Then I know what we could do 

We could just get our food and stay in 

'cause people on the block is hatin' 

They know your man, and know we datin' 

So we gotta do this just stay friends 

(OK) Amen

Save your dough, you know I wanna treat you out
Fuck sucking your dick, I wanna eat you out
I'm like whoa now, slow down
You remind of these young chickens I knew from uptown
Got a butt like this girl that worked in Motown
So if we ain't gonna fuck then where we go now
I don't move too fast, you move too slow 
You wasn't saying this just a moment ago
You was sitting at the bar just spending my dough 
You owe me something bitch, you gon' blow me or something
She said this thing you need to know before we fuck
I ain't like all these other sluts
And if I told you I was a virgin you wouldn't believe me
I know getting pussy for you is easy
You hit every bitch from Antee to a Tuskeegee
Plus you know I know your girlfriend KiKi
And for a moment honey tried to freak me
But being the man I am I'm still in pimp mode
Could tell she was Harlem 'cause I seen her zip code
And then she started showing me pictures of Flipmode
So I'm with my man and you know we gon' discuss her 
All I could hear is him sayin', don't trust her
You know her lil' cousin fuck with Usher
Plus her best friend got a baby from Busta

Long as you hot, long as you cop 

Long as you not that nigga who be doin' never come through the block

You take nigga's around the world with girls suckin they cock 

But just because a nigga ride witchu, fly witchu, high witchu 

That don't mean when bullets come he gon' die witchu 

It be them niggas you be knowing that long 

You be killed, run up the block with your new Rolley on 

Don't be quick to flip a nigga brick and spend what's on

I didn't have to fix the block when shit was broke

Same gun, same clip, same dumb bitch 

All Out, Harlem World, same old clique 

Same old studio, same old shit 

Shit don't change just because a cop took six to the brain 

Meeno got a lawyer, man I'm hip to the game 

You could find a gun, but if my prints ain't on that thing 

What is you sayin'? 

And on the same block that I get my glocks from 

You see the same cop that get popped with the shot gun 

(Mysonne: Mysonne)

(Mysonne: Mysonne) 

I give the same old money to the same cop's bum

I sit back and listen to them drunks on the block 

Tryin' to school me with jewels, tellin' me who to watch 

I killed five people, I'd let survive 

And the five I took away, I'd a left alive 

If I could do all it again I'd bring Virg' back 

Or I switch places with him, I hope you heard that 

I would have preferred that, I ain't have to starve 

Pitch crack, have to rob and catch a charge 

And I'd do it all again if I had to 

Pitch no-win to win, and I'd be glad to 

And I'd hit every target I took aim at

I got a baby by a lady I don't even love a lot 

Wish I wore three rubbers 'case the first rubber popped 

But you can't cry now, milk already spilt 

I had eleven friends and ten already killed 

Went down south and I ain't feel the guilt 

And I ain't ready to war but that ain't the way built 

And for all the nights and all the fights 

That I had for all this money over all these dice 

All my cars and homes and all my ice 

If I could do it all again, I'd do it all for Christ 

Whoever thought the limelight or the super-stardom 

Whoever thought there'd be a problem comin' through Harlem 

Can't even chill, cats want to make me a villain 

Cats that I grew up with I gotta contemplate killin' 

Nobody love me, I'm my own mister, and on my own, mister 

Mama did what she could but now I'm grown, mister 

Though she told me once, wish she'd told me then 

Though I'm the youngest, I'mma grow to be the oldest man 

And cats thinkin' they gon' win 'cause they veterans 

Ain't about age at this stage, man with the most cheddar win 

How you live right? Every day get in bigger sin 

How you say no at the door screamin' ""Let me in""? 

From the outside it's lookin' gooder than it ever been 

But tell the truth, when I was broke it was better then
