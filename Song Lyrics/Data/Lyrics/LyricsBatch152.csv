Grand Prix,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on",Day in the Life

[Grand Puba Maxwell]
Here comes the Puba and you know I won't fake it
Usually bust records on gettin butt naked
Made for the Benzi, drive a nigga skins he
pump the tape, grab your dick, get with the Puba frenzy
c'mon honey sing, don't you, try to eject
_Slow Down_'s what you say, once my joint gets erect
Some try to copy but they just can't sketch it
Some try to follow but they just can't catch it
With the boom boom tap, yeah alla dat
Huh, I'm livin fat, me fall off, there'll be none of that
See who's the one to flip it?  Quick to tell a nigga to zip it
Stud drink the 40 cause we ain't got time to sip it
Grand Puba got body
Kick some of them, some of those, and some yardies
As dope as they come, suckers sing or hum
Don't try to step to this, you know your shit is slum
First batter up well here's the pitch - it's a curve
Second batter up because the first got served
The one who arouse, as I browse for a blouse
Kick styles by the piles, as I leave a trail for miles
Skins when I please, hit from here to Tel Aviv
I'm gettin G's, no more time for the line of free cheese
Here's the four one one hon, the one who gets the job done
I know you know the flavor of the Puba

""What goes around comes back around again..""

[Grand Puba Maxwell]
O-kay o-kay o-kay, what more could I say?
Alamo get the boom and.. parlay parlay
I'm far from the average, civilize the savage
When I'm low on protein I'm with the bean soup and cabbage
Skins on the diet, kick the flavor, cause a riot
Do a show and get the dough and then I'm off to the Hyatt
So tie me on the spliff, ain't no ands or if
And if you really want to riff you just might end up playin stiff
Girbauds hangin baggy, Hilfiger on the top
Knapsack on the back, that's just my flavor Hobbes
As my man gives a zigga zigga, watchin three grow bigga bigga
To Pos K, that's my nigga
Here goes the wreck, whaddayou expect?
If you want to see some wreck, send cash, not a check
Grand Puba, more than a public figure
Quick to kick the bone up the butt of a golddigger
Now Tic-Tac-Toe means I hit three in a row
If I do a show then you better have my dough
Low, low, well how low can you go?
Call on Grand Puba if you really need a pro
Cause my shit's more rugged than G.I. Joe
Don't front honey, act like you know
Now big up to my Brooklyn mob (Brooklyn!  Brooklyn!)
Big up to my Uptown mob (Uptown!  Uptown!)
Now brothers want to diss me cause it's my turn to burn
My best advice for the brothers is to sit back and learn
I don't diss nobody to be somebody
I just like to kick the flavor to make the people party
See all I'm sayin, is respect due
Those who tried to follow, sorry I left you
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie and Alamo
So if you ever want the flavor you know where to go
Now how we go..

First things first, here goes the opposite of worst
Slid out my mother's ass, looked at the nurse, and kicked a verse
This ain't my man Heav's joint, so shit, here's a curse
For those who got stuck, well KCUF means FUCK!
That's what I like to do after the Puba makes a buck
For those who say I suck well then step up and push your luck
You're aced out, now your assed-out, I still hit joints
til they pass out, at three o'clock I let my MC class out (UH!)
So keep a clear focus, cause I say hocus pocus
That's all I have to say to make the mob swarm like locusts (YEAH!)
Then I climb the bridge, push Uptown to the ?
to the Harlem River Drive to pick up Ali at the Rutgers
Then we chatta-nagga-noogi, to go pick up Stud Doogie.. ""easy back it up""
Ha hah, so all you Grand Puba wannabees
You better pack it up ""easy back it up""

[Kid Capri]
Now dig it
Here's the kid, never did a bid
Never hit skid, check out the shit I did
Live in the Bronx, born in Brooklyn
Chilled in Manhattan never got my shit tooken
I'm easy on the flex, you know my shit is right
We're goin on a flight, so hold on tight
Kid Capri is on point with my man Grand Puba
If suckers try to flex they'll get twisted like a tuba
Never cause trouble, that's not my style
Always on the move, stack papes by the pile
I'm crazy on the low, but I go places though
I always do a show so you know I got dough
Girls try to sweet talk, but bullshit walk
For those who try to hawk I stab clit like a fork
I'm very intelligent, so don't try to play me
Try to press the issue and I'll bust that ass baby
I'm thick like a shake, very high yella
Describe Kid Capri, Uptown's big fella
So now you know the flavor, and please do me a favor
Stay your ass out my path, cause I snap you like a gator, later

So cancel all the nonsense that you heard, thus far
You wanted the best at your request so here we are!
So call me the Grand man, I laid off the Sandman cause I like
workin nights, I hit some joints and then I get into flights
Then push Uptown to Shabazz, get a fish sandwich with bean soup

And head straight for the center, the dope style inventor

Type of shit that hits when you pump it in your truck
Not Ashford and Simpson, Ike and Tina Turner
Sonny or Cher, it's somethin' dope on your ear

So whether Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

Now let me tell you folks just exactly what I mean
The way they try to lower, the black man's self esteem
Put us in their schools and I call em mental graves
When they teach us bout ourselves, all we learn that we were slaves
Then they say Jesus was white, understand
That means that Mystery God in the sky's a white man
These two things alone make us start to feel inferior
Then we grow up thinkin' they are superior
Why does the black licorice taste the worst?
Why does the black jellybean taste the worst?
Why do the bad guys always wear black?
Why is bad luck when you see a black cat?

They want to use us a tool, and also as a slave
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
Musa came to the cave and taught them Ock
The tricknowledge that the Devil once forgot
Now the ten percent rules over the eighty-five
You see we have to do more than just keep hope alive
I don't hope and I don't do dope
But I still feel the pain from my ancestors swingin' on a rope
Now pardon me as I distill on a Devil's grill

Knowledge Cipher, divided by Power Equals Wisdom
But you know we have to start with Knowledge first
Divine evil's what dispearse in a hearse
Situation that we in, some people sayin that we're cursed
The lack of the knowledge of ourselves makes it worse
Science that we drop, make the average head burst
So do the knowledge on the very next verse
I heard a brother say, ""I wash the clothes, I cook your food
I pay your rent,"" now is that how the story went?

Aiyyo God you trust the Devil?  (Now Cipher)  Me neither
Now brothers say, ""Why you diss the church like Ock?""

Now Momma Lova has no loot, but she'll spend her last dime
to make sure her child has an Easter suit

Who makes the loot?
Who makes the loot? Grand Puba
Well, who makes the loot?  Bust it

Goodness grief, let me lighten up the brief
Honies spell Grand Puba when they wanna spell relief
Who is the man, more than a hundred grand?
Give a pound to a friend, put a tool to a clown
Damn, bang, bang, bang, Jimmy Coco Puff
Who is the one who gives you nuff?
Don't answer, here comes the flavor
And you wanna ask what Grand Puba gave ya?

Some dope shit, some real live shit
Puba is the one who's givin' fits
A new style, new style, are you ready for this type?
Now, I rock hip, everybody's rockin' hype
On the very down low you might see me at a show
If the show ain't for dough then you won't see the bro
The Grand man, just as usual
But let me slow down 'cause I know I'm confusin' y'all

Grand Puba, Grand Puba
Grand Puba, Grand Puba
Grand Puba, Grand Puba
Grand Puba

Bust it we gon' move on like this, I once caught a bid
I never hit skid, never date a girl if the girl
Got a kid, nah, poppa's got a brand new bag
And I never hit skins once they sag
Guy says groovy, you like to see a movie?
Stick it in easy, it comes back greasy
First to tell you  slow down
But be the second to take you uptown

I won't fall or fumble, trip stagger or stumble
Not a soft sucker but I still come humble
The next candidate, who holds all the weight
It ain't him or him, you better get the story straight
Ron Stud is my D. J. makes the girl feel like it's foreplay
Comin' like a bull, so you better yell, ""Ole""
Here is the one, I shine like the sun
You get too close, you might get done

Yeah, funky
Ain't nuttin' but funky, it's just funky
Aiyyo, check this out
The right type of hype
This how we gon' move it for the 90's and the year 2000
Check it out, do the knowledge, this ain't no loop
This is some real live funky, funky get down on the get down
And I'm flowin' to this type of hype

The bass player's real, the drummer's real
The bass player's real, and the drummer's real
Word is bond

I beg your pardon who's the one with the roughness?
Super extra toughness, Grand Pu-ba-la!
See I'm the chosen, I keep the snakes frozen
Check out how I blows in, girl it feels good when it goes in
Here's the situation, supreme motivation
helps me get the loot, and then I knock the boots
I jump high like Jordan, Flash like Gordon
'bos, Girbauds and shorts is probably what I'm sportin
Fuck what you heard, this is what you need to hear
It's the same as last year, so _Step to the Rear_
Cause when I was a shorty couldn't wait to drink my first 40
Find an ex-shorty in the hallway and get naughty
Jump on the elevator, hit the lights out
My moms was a yardie so my pops kept a stout
Ooh a young boy tipsy, that's without a doubt
It wasn't hard to tell what the Puba was about
Love the ladies lovely used to do it on my knees
Certain honey got a problem go see Puba he can ease ya
Here I am, and here I stand
Honey all that good shit tell me, who's the man?
From, here to Bangkok, I sign my John Hancock
on the contract, it's like 1-2-3 Contact
Kick shit on the really cause I do it on the daily
Straight to the hole like my man Malik Seally
I hit stunts, on occasion smoke blunts
My moms don't like me cause I wear gold fronts
If honey wants to flam it's no thing to me at all
Alamo and Stud Doogie, it's time to have a ball
I'm a go-getter, and I'm out to go-get
If you're makin movies, CANCEL that shit
You're still makin movies?  Man, get your corder-cam
Oops, cam-corder, but shit you know the order
Couldn't get no skins, until you got a Benz
Didn't have no friends til you started makin ends
I see it daily, weekly monthly yearly
Think you got it goin on?  Really
I never sold gems to the bums in the slums
Only robbed devils, made a few number runs
Brothers round my way they like to blabber at the gums
Just jealous cause I got it by the tons
Twenty fifty hundred, is how I count my bills
Then I take it slow because it runs into the mills
Brothers try to step to this but all they catch is chills
No frills, Puba pays the bills
Ron Studda spin the wheel back like his name was Pat Sajak
on Wheel of Fortune.. that's how we keep it scorchin
Alamo HEY, Sadat X HEY, Baby Pop HEY, now let me keep it rollin
This is just the way I move to keep my pockets swollen
Lights cameras action here comes Mr. Satisfaction
I be maxin and relaxin til it's time to jump in the action
Now for grown I speak with a tone which I choose to call my own
Ghetto prone I guard the zone like the kid from _Home Alone_
Type of style that flows for days it's like it pays to save amaze
Now I be careful on the lays because the AIDS are nowadayses

Yeah positivity over comes negativity check it. 

A gat don't make you a man cause a man made the gat
So stop with the black on black  (x2)

Verse 1:
We got black on black
Black on crack 
Knowledge of self is what the black people lack
Grew up in the projects with the welfare and the food stamps
Modern day concentration camps
Where we lost all our unity
Because the negativity pulls us down like gravity
Black people on eath others back 
Little shortie sedated thinkin' the way out is by selling cracks
I seen black borthers cry like day by day the number multiply
And the devil don't give a damn long as a black man kills another black man
It makes his job more eaiser 
As the tick goes with the tock he's just gettin'  sleezier and sleezier
Here's a good example of yourself 
Talkin' about a devil on a record they put you on the shelf
As long as you talk about ""Yo I bust this nigga and I bust that nigga""
You grow bigger as a rap figure
But that's still black on black welcome back 
It's time to graduate from that

Hook:
Change gon come change gon come time to free the dumb time to free the dumb
(x3)
Change gon come say what say what so get up out the slum

Verse 2:
Now let's deal on the real don't you set sick of this?
The way we hate eachother the shit's ridiculous
It's time to move on to the next phase 
Cause there's too many shorties gettin' boxed in the grave
Some think respect is an uzi or a tech
But when he steals your intellect it's like a rope around your neck
That's the 2000 tricknowledge 
That's the shit you won't learn in college brother
You get to be strong you got to hold on
You got to know the ledge before you hit the edge
Time to get wise and civilize
Open up your eyes all three eyes and recognzie
What your doing all that bullshit you pursueing
Put your whole life on ruin
Let's kill the black on black vigga
Cause it only gets us locked up or in the box quicker
And that's ain't how you get the cheese
Cause now ya locked up or gunned down by your enemy
But I'm a deader that gat
Remember a gat don't make you a man cause a man made the gat 
Word is born 

Keep it true God keep it true (x8)

Free drinks til ten, yo money, where's the fuckin bar?
Honies all creamed out types and all lookin cute
Me and Doogie same ol low-top baggy jeans and boots
Body bangin, tits hangin, while we profilin
Me and Ali' mad geeked off Long Island
Uhh!  Picture that, but then it dawned on me black
honey set them traps, that's why Tyson was where he was at
They want you for your name and fame, quick to get buttnaked
When you play em out, they run and said you tried to take it
That's why I don't talk to those, who like to pose in videos
with no clothes, and groupies at shows
Cause I know what's goin on, you won't catch me in the wrong
Don't even try it baby, dig it

Chorus

[Puba]
Well times is gettin drastic, time to pack the plastic
Slide up in the wrong one, you'll end up in the casket
No not me, I'm more careful see
I make sho' I can't catch that old HIV
But I tell you entertainment is some shit
These groupie girls are sick
Do most anything so they can get picked
to come to your, room, smoke a little, boom
Hear a little tune, after that, zoom zoom!
No thanks, I'm only here for the bank
And I'ma tell you point blank, won't let my dick walk the plank
I hate to bust your bubble, so be out, on the double
Cause I know how you groupies are, and I don't want no trouble
So give me my cash and I'll pass on that ass
When it comes to hittin ass, on the road, I'll just fast
	But don't you talk about skins all the time?
Baby not ALL the time, but, when I do talk about skins, they mine
I refuse to go out, like Magic Johnson; have to retire
cause I touched a live wire, now my shit's on fire
I travel in the name of Allah
Won't be a fallin star for no hooker in a bra, that's dead
You won't, roll me out, on a stretcher
cause my second head, led my first head into bed
So baby gets to steppin, be gone
'Fore you nigga make a move like that
just make sure you put a rubber on

Chorus",Don't Waste My Time
Grand Puba,"Yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, I've found him
I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker

I hit a flow all dipped in lotion
Sit back and sip moe as I'm countin' my doe
Grand Puba macks well, Doogie, comin' with the New York
We keep it real like jail when we might talk
Honies know 'cause when I'm in the set
Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin' lady
When ya flow this flow then its all cream and baby
I made this one for the brothers in the party
To find a hottie
And dance body to body
Step one: first you grab honey by the waist
Step two: then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three: then ya look her dead in the face
Step four: now its time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's
The teasa's, the one who wants the money and the visa's
I'ma tell honies straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, Dig it
This ones designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba lights it up for you every time

Ooooh, yeah I like it

[Verse 2]
Could it be I've stayed away too long
Seems MC's be wishing I was gone
Because they want to be where I are 
But ya can't get that far
So stop wishing on a star
Its only one Grand P
So honey do what you did on the night you creeped with me
Its no doubt I come real with that
The butter track
The one that makes the honeis hit the bed mat
I'm energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit 
So just move like I'm simon and I said it
Ya see my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe, 'cause when it comes to gettin' down
I'm gettin' looser than a crackheads hair weave
And I, bet ya my dolly, while ya never find another style like this 
If ya search a million miles
So why'n cha let Puba ingnite your party
I hit a flow liike Al Jarrow
But I've been doin' this for years
I'm leavin' MC's in tears,tears; dig it
Cause they fallin' just like the rain
Grand Puba's too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left 'em backwards, they thought they farted when they shitted
Cause Puba's everything, and everything is Pu
Cause I hit'em with the (one), and then with the (two) 
Yeah, 'cause that's just how Grand Pu and Stud Doogie do
Ya didn't know I was the bomb baby
Somebody should've told you, somebody should have told you

Puba:
Long Island you dumb bitch
When it comes to this my style flows Free like Willy
Watch me grab the cream like them Beverly Hill Billy
I know you're happy with the shit you just bought
It's the greatest return since Jordan hit the court
Because my style changes frequently
See I been shit talkin' mics since the days of delenquency
Now I'm still the same low down gold teeth and Gortex
And on occasion with the ruff sex
Stud Doogie heats it up like a flannel
Cause he's smooth as wall panel 
Hits the one and two like a freebee channel
I have no time for bullshitters I get bad honies jitters
As I walk be all the chickenhead critters
I got more funk then En Vogue got junk in they trunk
My flow hits ya like a filty piece of skunk
So Alley get the scomma fromt he dodge spot
Put it in the L and get high like an astronaut

Now see they call me Mr. Mingo

Hey man no doe
You know the type you go out a few nights they sweat your pockets tight
Cause they rock they're rockers right
Go away little girl you gets nothing
But here take a Bufferin to ease your pain and sufferin'
Cause I'm so aware of too many things
I know what I know if ya know what I mean
Come clean because I'm a fiend for a beat and a theme
Comin' strong like Hakeem and it ain't a dream
Now is it me or is this hittin' like Tyson?
Like a plate of beans and rice I be a needy winds on ice and

Of putting niggaz on ruin', coming stronger than Ewing

So save the patty for the wack and it'll stem from the crack
You know what, I don't hit guts of no nasty sluts
Or get strung on butts, I just hit 'em wit' the roach deluxe
'cause Doogie, you know how shit do
So Sadat, let's bag this money, then push back to the bungalow

Go and tell your mother, it's return of the blues

So fuck them others 'cause I ain't trying to hear it
Then if time and giving loot, I be fucking five women

Slide up in the cut, it burns your rubber up like acid
So if you're playin them games, you best be careful
Don't let the 5-1-6 make you dareful
There you go, feelin good, you're out of town
And it's one of those nights, you feel like gettin down
You ain't choosy on the honey you picked
No glove on your stick, you just wanna hit it quick

Get the honies hooked like they kids is hooked on Power Rangers
And I ain't goin' now where word is born 
Cause I've been doin' this since Shay Shay Lafon

In that time, a nigga didn't see nor hear
Got to the point, there was no respect at all
I was shocked when you did not collect my call
Spent nights in my cell just beatin' my dick
Thinkin' bout, how we used to fuck and shit
I took you out, bought cha' ass a bunch of shit
When I get out
I'm gonna fuckin' punch this bitch right in her mouth

My mind burns with the words that I forget
I don't seem to be able to lose me
I warm the streets that shake and bruise me

I get the feeling this was sent to test me
Can I please get someone to bless me?
I still forgot those damn cigarettes
'Cause I travel in my own illusion
Cut a path through all the confusion
Tell me, man, is this as good as the whole world's gonna get?

I get the feeling it's a new day, sun is rising
I get the feeling everything is gonna change

I fall asleep with the TV too loud
Spending time staying in with the out-crowd
Dreams come and leave me in cold sweats
Tomorrow feels like a new day coming
I can't see it being all for nothing
And I know it's as good as the whole world's gonna get",As Good as It Gets

Up until then so he wasn't sure what to think when
He saw swans and they were wading
On the shores of a pale white lake
That he'd never seen there before
And it was quite beautiful and it was far away
Cause everything beautiful is far away

Get yours,go for yours

Get yours everytime the opportunity knocks
And don't chill-out too hard or you'll be out of the box
Stop running your face and try to listen instead
Or you'll be known as a loud-mouth Joe Rockhead

Why sit at home bummin' just a-wastin' your time
When all ya gotta do is seek an' you'll find
What you want out of life,it's there so get it
If you don't,then later you'll grow to regret it
You can ignore and think I'm talkin' out loud for my health

You got to crawl before you walk,you see that opens the doors
Because you can't start buildin' from the sixth floor
If you work real hard,all your dreams will come true
If it happened to us,it can happen to you
The world is yours for the talkin' so what you waitin' for
You should be contemplating on how to go out and

You can't make it with a monkey ridin' on your back
Got to get up to get down,get on over the hump
Let your feelings flow and adrenalin pump (ugh)
Stay on your guard,never take three strikes
Get everything you want but get the best out of life
Ya see,what your future holds is no mystery
When you're the one who's in control of your destiny
Just put that weak pride aside,go make it or break it
You don't need it,then leave it,someone else will sure take it
An eternal flame burns in everyone of us
Turnin' the negative things in your life to a plus
Workin' real hard beats the competition

I was takin' my time
I was chilly the most contemplating and debating about what I should do
I made a sharp left turn

Because it's gonna hit the fan at 12:00 o'clock
Then there was this flygirl,she said she wanted to know
Why are you all dressed up with no place to go?
She said she'd take us to a place where we could hear some hip hop
But little did we know she meant the house that rocked

The house that rocked(x3)

She was a real flygirl,dressed in leather and lace
She looked pale ""Yo"",I thought it was paint on her face
She said it was the last house,corner rockin' bird lane
But you might need a cross and a little wolfsbane
Well we were at the door 
And when it opened inside there were freaks galore
Their eyes glowed as if lit by an eerie light
I said ""I don't think I should have came here tonight""
And when I asked her what was up,he door slammed and locked
She was gonne and we were,trapped inside the house that rocked

The house that rocked(x3)

Zombies were on the floor and what do ya know
They were doin' the Pee-Wee Herman,what a real creep show
Creatures were playin' cards (Igor was cuttin' the deck)
Somebody screamed (There's Dracula,cover your neck)
Now Lurch was rockin' the mix and on his shirt it read
The music hideously provided for the living dead
Now they was illin' and that was no doubt
But all we wanted to do was get out
I was wishing I was chillin' back around the block
Instead of running for my life inside the house that rocked

The house that rocked(x3)

It was a grizzly situation,very gruesome indeed
And would you believe tha walls started to bleed
Frankstein was steady scheming as he left the room
In came the Mummy and the creature from the black Lagoon
They said ""Your time has come"" you could scream and can holler
But you're never gonna leave this little shop of horror
You can think that it's a joke to have a heart full of fear
But you feel that way because you're not here
Take heed and stay away,whether you like it or not
'Cause those who enter never leave the house that rocked

The house that rocked (x3)",House That Rocked
Grandmaster Flash,"Hey people,we got a little something
That we want to tell you all,so listen
Undestand,""Yo God made one no better than
The other,every girl becomes
A woman every boy a man""
While you're livin' in your mansion
Driving big cars,there's another
On the street cold sleepin'
On the ground
So when you walk by,""Yo,don't act
Cold-blooded,'cause it just ain't
Fair to kick a man when he's down""

'Cause,He is somebody
Like I am somebody
You are somebody
Like I am someone

Whether you're here or you're gone
Right or you're wrong,you were meant
To be somebody from the second you're born
Don't criticize and knock one another
It ain't really that hard to just be
A brother,so be good speak up
Don't wait for it to happen,life is
Passing you by and homeboy
You're cold knappin'
Don't get hung up on what you're not
Be proud of what you are and whatever
You got!
'Cause it's a cold cruel world causing
Kids to cry,if you're hangin'
Your head,cold kiss it goodbye
Stand up for your heritage,rejoice
In the fact
Whether you're red,white,tan
Yellow,brown or black

'Cause,He is somebody
Like I am somebody
He is somebody
Like I am someone

There are fireman,bankers,messengers,preachers
Brokers,policeman,executives,teachers,journalists
Janitors,architects,doctors,restaurant workers
Nurses,chief rockers
If you feel you're somebody
Be proud and show it!'Cause everybody's
Somebody,(Ugh) and ya know it
It doesn't matter if you're black,white or Chinese
Livin' in the States or reside overseas
'Cause you and I are special,same as everyone else
And if you don't believe me
You're only cheating yourself
'Cause we all got a  purpose in life to achieve
(That's a fact)And here's another
That you better believe

That I am somebody
Like you are somebody
He is somebody
Like I am someone

You got wealth,good health and you're stuck
On yourself
Let me tell you that you're better than no body else
'Cause you got no self-esteem,so I'm richer
And when you leave this earth you can't
Take money witcha
So play your dumb game,call me out
My name,but there's nothing
You can do that could make me feel shame
We're all created equal we live and we
Die,so when you try to bring
Me down I keep my head up high
Don't judge a book by its cover 'cause
It's never what it seems
Now I know what I'm sayin' and I feel
I gotta scream

That I am somebody
Like you are somebody
He is somebody
Like I am someone

So be yourself, HUH!!!",I Am Somebody
Grandmaster Flash,"Just get off wall,let's have a ball
The '70's are gone,it's the '80's ya'll
Grab a flygirl by the hand and ask her to dance
c'mon fellas don't be shy,just take a chance
You'll never know,it might lead to romance
'Cause the beat is cold stompin'
It'll put you in a trance
You're so hypnotized that you stop and stare
I'm steppin' out of this,'cause I'm not wit' that there
Get on the dancefloor come on take a stand
All the girlies in the place want to dance with you,my man
Get on the floor and work it out if you can
Here's my ulterior motive,I mean my game plan
It doesn't hurt to flirt,just go 'head and chase a skirt
You can't help it,it's your line of work
To get women on the floor
It's you they adore,you might as well
Give'em what they came here for

You know what time it is (x8)

Hang on party people,'cause here we go
We're gonna cold take the party to another plateu
But in order for us to achieve a new height
We want to hear Flash cut the beat up,ain't that right
While Flash is choppin' the mix like an ax on the wood

(scratch)

You gotta dance 'cause the beat is finger lickin' good
Throw your hands above your head and reach for a cloud
And if there's  anything you want to say,say it loud
I know the bass is pumpin' so hard the lights are dim
And ya'll are letting me know we're cold blowin' the rim
That's right,you're being served,served with a smile
And homeboy you don't like it,we can step in the aisle
Just show no shame,you know it's only night
And if there's anything you want to get off,get it off tonight

You know what time it is (x4)

A simple push of the fade,a little flex of the wrist
Flash whoopin' the mix while I'm kickin' the gift
Yo' like a double edge razor,the boy is nice
When he cuts,give him room,or you might get sliced
He's too cold to hold,too hot to be stopped
This jam that we got is good to the last drop
Whether you like it or not,we rock
Yo' since the day we emerged,have you heard
That it was all about a party and yo this is word
This party's rated NS for no suckers allowed
That's the scoop
Hear me troop
So don't you come here actin' wild
But as you know there's always on in the crowd
You want to party then act like you know,can you dig it
And if you came too ill forget it,I ain't wit it

You know what time it is (x5)

Horns",U Know What Time It Is
Grandmaster Flash,"Well you got a hot date and you want to be fly
Throw on a Gucci blazer and a Gucci tie
Not a hair out of place,a freshly-shaved face
You think you're walkin' out the house with style and grace
(Don't you)
You pick up your girl and take her to dinner
'Cause when the night is over you think you're gonna win her
Then you move real close using all your charm
And then your girl says ""Baby guess that""

(I smell your underarms)

That odor,it's ringin' out loud and clear as a bell
You can't hear it because you're immune to the smell
I describe your aroma as foul and pathetic
And they can use your odor as the latest anesthetic
Now I know that it's stone cold funk,I can tell
'Cause it's written all over by the way you smell
That funk the aroma,that smell,that scent
You'll be arrested for malicious body odor intent
Your odor going 'round,doin' people bodily harm
And then somebody turned around and  said

(I smell your underarms)

You woke up late for work usin' the same old line
Don't think I'm gonna wash my underarms this time
The more you ignore,the worse the smell grows
And you pick out all clothes by using your nose
It was the rush hour when I was on the train
And the smell of underarms was drivin' me insane
It was a sure-fire way of bringing me to my death
I couldn't hold a conversation,I was holding my breath
And you cold see the funk just like a cloud in the air
Was homeboy sittin' next to me,I swear!
And when I saw the direction this girl was leaning
You could hear homebody's underarms just screaming
(ugh.....)

(I smell your underarms)

Hanging at a party one night,all alone
Sippin' on a bottle of Dom Perignon
The crowd was on the floor,rocking the beat
Smelling like thay ain't bathed since last week
The smell was all through the house,cold rockin' the place
The funk fill the air like a fresh can of Mace
When you raised your hands I had to sound tha alarm
A girl said ""Look,there's Monster growin under his arm""
We were so shocked we couldn't even run (uhgh)
And they declared  his arm public enemy number one
Now throw your hands in the air,if you want to party hard
Now put your hands back down,everybody's,'cause
You didn't use Right Guard

And if you want to rock in to the broad daylight
Somebody say, what it look like
What it look like
You don't stop
I'm gonna talk about the man that's the real McCoy
No other cool brother than Keith Cowboy
Went a eight and a half, 29 ways
A medium search take a look at my face
You check up my hair and then you look in my eyes
Cause all I'm here to do girl is make you hypnotize
Till you hip hop the shoobop dobop take a look on your arm {*fade*}",Freedom
Grandmaster Flash,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew 

The shark got sick and then he exploded 
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker 
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a Rolls Royce 
Gotta rank as number one 
To be the people's choice 

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle 
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle 

Up above your head is the flash of light 
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain 
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever 
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather 
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night 
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood 
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women 
That give me good love in the beginning 

Bubble bath and candle lights 
And girls saying Scorp you alright? 
So stop standing there
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

I was sitting on the corner just a wasting my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see huh!
The rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the be bop swing
To have Stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
To own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
'Cause rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap something people wanted to hear
See before my reign it was the same old same
You took ""the ba with the ba""
That's street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're stepping out of here
You ever think you're getting up, down, around or in huh huh!
You better think again my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off

Well, I'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow
So what ya M.C's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's at cock
I'll be carrying out bodies stiff as a rock
Carrying out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
'Cause anything you wanna do I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my M.C school, my class was packed
And tricks were for kids so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I'll buy a mansion for my mother
A 24/7, the cool-aid smile
Say hey Track 11, look at my power

Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand
Because I look good, do you hear my man?
And if you can't take that ya chump ya own hand
You one-girl-at-a-time getting M.C
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework you would surely find
When Scorp get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talking don't pay, you're drifting away
When I see you on a stage I'm a blow you away
You're right, there is no difference between me and you
Except I look good and you look Through
Take that!

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped in to the M.C scene
Biting your moves, taking fake awards
Saying everyone else was perpertrating a fraud
But your nothing but a clone of my flesh and bone
Now you trying to play grown on the microphone
But I'll tell ya 'bout a night, and ya know I'm right
When you listen to us rocking to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpertrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the word of the master teacher
Or you die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat ya
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why were gonna get everything we want
'Cause like a shadow in the night, I'm the sight unseen
And I'm the bona-fide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
'Cause my rhymes make vowels plus they make sense
See I'm down with Cowboy, you will rock the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and huh! Scorpio
Kami-Kazi, Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And going down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm a make you my slave
And I'm a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme then bury yourself huh!
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only M.C that'll never die
So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top
But when you se Melle Mel you're gonna have to drop

On my superfly cold crushin' fame and glory
How I rocked the children and the young ladies
I even rocked the countries that was overseas
'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm a do it to you
I'm a show ya how I rocked it y'all all night long
But when I rock with Chaka Khan I just said

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you

Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five,"I'm a son of a bitch ready to stitch
You muthers not ready to rock
I've shed all my tears & ain't got no fears
& they key to my heart bears no lock

Hell has granted me three wishes
Life - Death - Immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
Fuck your blessed trinity

Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out

I'm a bastard & brave I'm nobodies slave
I'm telling you once & for all
Breaking the laws coz I know the score
Waiting on nobodies call

Hell has granted me three wishes
Life - Death - Immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
Fuck your blessed trinity

Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out

Let's burst right out of here
""Let's go""





",The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel
Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

Grandmaster Melle Mel,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew 

The shark got sick and then he exploded 
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker 
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a Rolls Royce 
Gotta rank as number one 
To be the people's choice 

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle 
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle 

Up above your head is the flash of light 
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain 
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever 
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather 
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night 
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood 
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women 
That give me good love in the beginning 

Bubble bath and candle lights 
And girls saying Scorp you alright? 
So stop standing there
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge

Grandpa Jones,"Are You From Dixie

Hello there stranger how do you do
there's something I'd like to say to you
You seem surprised I recognize
I'm no detective but I just surmise

You're from the place I'm longing to be
your smiling face seems to say to me
You're from my homeland my sunny homeland
tell me can it be?

Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie where the fields of
cotton beckon to me
I'm glad to see you tell me I'll be you and the friend
I'm longing to see
Are you from Alabama Tennessee or Caroline
Any place below the Mason Dixon Line
Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie 'cause I'm from Dixie
too.

It was a way back in old '89
When first I crossed that Mason Dixon Line
Gee but again I long to return
To those good old folks I left behind

My home was way down in old Alabam'
On the plantation near Birmingham
and there's one thing certain I'm surely flirtin'
With those southbound trains",Are You from Dixie?
Grandpa Jones,"I've traveled over the country wide a seekin' fortune fair
I've been down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere
From Portland east and Portland west and back along the line
I'm goin' now to a place that's best that old home town of mine

Eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart

There's bound to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a rambling through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand

Oh, eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart

Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
The place that's right for that love site is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville

Eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart

Grandpa Jones,"There's a big holler tree down the road here from me
Where you lay down a dollar or two
Well you go round the bend and when you come back again
There's a jug full of good ole mountain dew

Oh they call it that ole mountain dew
And them that refuse it are few
I'll shut up my mug if you fill up my jug
With some good ole mountain dew

Now my uncle Nort, he's sawed off and short
He measures about four foot two
But he thinks he's a giant when you give him a pint
Of that good ole mountain dew

Well my ole aunt Jill bought some brand new perfume
It had such a sweet smellin' pew
But to her surprise when she had it analyzed
It was nothin' but good ole mountain dew

Well the preacher rolled by with his head heisted high
Said his wife had been down with the flu
And he thought that I ought just to sell him a quart
Of that good ole mountain dew

Well my brother Bill's got a still on the hill
Where he runs of a gallon or two
Now the buzzards in the sky get so drunk, they can't fly
From smellin' the good ole mountain dew

Oh they call it that ole mountain dew
And them that refuse it are few
I'll shut up my mug if you fill up my jug
With some good ole mountain dew

Grandpa Jones,"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon",Dark as a Dungeon

Ev'ry night when I go to bed
I thank the Lord that my kids are fed
They live on beans eight days and nine
But I get 'em fat come pickin' time
Get 'em fat come come pickin' time

If I seem distant, it's cause I'm scared of losing you
Something is different, cause I don't want you to leave in the morning
One night could never be enough, never be enough

No, it's more about the buddies you make

Served his country for me and you
And sacrificed his life
And we still miss him all the time

She means it when she talks about love
It means so completely
She knows just who I am.

Iâm leather, sheâs lace,
We fit perfectly
She makes it so easy
To be me.

Iâm strong in the head, a dreamer in heart,
I donât finish everything that I start,
Iâm easily mad, quick to the draw,
Slow to give in when itâs all my fault.
But sheâs on my side through all my stubborn pride.

Someone I simply can't help but adore

Some day I'll find my love

When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day

I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.

So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile

You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite,

A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all

Grant Green,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the kids would call me patches
Papa used to kid me about it
Of course deep down inside
He was thinkin' he had done all he could do
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
But he did wonders when the time got bad
A little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the plow
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later papa passed away
I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was dad's strictest rule
So every morning 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave this but I wanted a home
But I always remembered what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best, It's up to you to do the rest
:
But then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through, Cause
Everyday I had to work the fields
Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of a family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to face another day
Though years have passed and all the kids are gone
I aimed to take my mama to a brand new home
God knows people that I shed a tear
My daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin', ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you
I could still hear papa when he'd say
Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest"".",Patches

Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Grant Green,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Grant Green,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Trolling down a long canal
Onto savage shores and gilded floors
Of coliseums through the load-in door

Certain of this one thing
Certain of this one thing
Certain of this one thing
That superslomotion got the upper hand on me
On me, on me

Holy visions had ceased to come
My tongue was numb and I was feeling tired
Crying out in a wordless howl
Screeching off to the underground

Certain of this one thing
Certain of this one thing
Certain of this one thing
That superslomotion got the upper hand on me
On me, on me, on me

Sleepy rhythms were lulling us
Syrup sweet and poisonous
How I found my way back, I'm not sure
Through the channels and little streets that curve

Certain of this one thing
Certain of this one thing
Certain of this one thing
That superslomotion got the upper hand on me
On me, on me, on me

Not a rail to grasp ahold

Nor a savior there beside

By decree of the county affairs

Good Christians, they gave you a lily-white dress

And take to the ways of the whites

Your daddy , Joe Little, had woes of his own

Drink was much stronger than greed

Were no place to let rest a deed

And the men who came there to drill

In the sun baked clay of Indian lands

There, in the desolate fields

Chained to a log in a torn white dress

Raised five of your own

And for a spell it was as almost as though

The light of justice had shown


The hand that had written this part but for you

And made it all plenty hard

Gave you a gusher, a well spring of oil

There in your own back yard


So pile them kids in the plush back seat

Ridin? shotgun in the Packard to town

With your man, Tom Fisher, one hand on the wheel

The other on your knee now

Scattering flowers washed down by the rain

Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside

Cry like a child, though these years make me older
With children my time is so wastefully spent
A burden to keep, though their inner communion
Accept like a curse, an unlucky deal

Played by the gate at the foot of the garden
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
No words could explain, no actions determine
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall

Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Grapefruit Sound Lab,"The picture perfect couple
In a picture perfect frame,
In a picture perfect house
Where everything's the same.
Each thing in this picture 
Is not what it seems.
This picture perfect life 
Was just a shattered dream.

If I told you that I loved you
Would you even really care?
I'll be right here forever
Were you ever really there?
No sadness in the morning,
No scars upon your face.
Tear-stained pillow talk 
And the feeling of disgrace.

Will it be like this forever? 
Will the damage be undone? 
The game we played was short and sweet,
We must have jumped the gun.
When you're left alone with nothing,
And you know you think you won:
This picture perfect couple was just like everyone.

...each thing in this picture
Is not what it seems:
This picture perfect life 
Was another Silent Scream.

Papa said ""Son, you'll never get far,
I'll tell you the reason if you want to know,
'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go""

Well baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than most any old thing
Well when I get those jelly roll blues
Why I'd go and get anything in this world for you.

Down to the jewelry store packing a gun,
Says ""Wrap it up. I think I'll take this one""
""A thousand dollars please,"" the jewelry man said
Dupree he said, ""I'll pay this one off to you in lead""

Well you know son you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad -
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

Dupree said ""Judge, you know that crossed my mind""
Judge said ""Fact it's gonna cost you your life""
Dupree said ""Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right""

Well baby, baby's gonna lose her sweet man
Dupree come out with a losing hand
Baby's gonna weep it up for awhile
Then go on out and find another sweet man's 
Gonna treat her with style

Judge said ""Son, I know your baby well
But that's a secret I can't never tell""

Grateful Dead,"You're bringing me down, I'm running aground,
Blind in the lights of the interstate cars,
Passing me by, the busses and the semis,
Plugging like stones from a slingshot from mars.

But I'm here on the road, bound to the load,
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars.
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up,
The highway, the moon, and clouds and the stars.

Black throated wind, keeps on pourin' in,
With it's words of a life where nothing is new,
Ah, mother american night, I pass from the light,
Ah, I'm drownin' in you.

I left st. louie, city of blues,
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget.
I tried to pretend it came to an end,
Cause you weren't the women I once thought I'd met.

But I can't deny, times have gone by,
Well I never had doubts or thoughts of regret,
And I was a man when all this began,
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet.

Black throated wind, whisper in sin,
And speaking on life that passes like dew.
It's forced me to see you've done better by me,
Better by me that I've done by you.

Now what's to be found by racing around,
You carry your pain wherever you go,
Full of blues, and tryin' to lose,
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know.

So I give you my eyes and all of their lies,
Please help them to learn as well as to see.
Capture a glance, and make it dance,
But looking at you is looking at me.

Black throated wind, keeps on pourin' in,
With it's words of a life that could almost be true,
Ah, mother american night, here comes a light.
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do.

Going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do.
Going back home that's what I'm gonna do.
Cause you've done better by me than I've done by you,
I'm drowning in you.

Grateful Dead,"As I was walkin' down Grosvenor Square,
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air,
From the other direction she was calling my eye,
Could be an illusion but I might as well try, might as well try.

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes,
And I knew without askin' she was into the blues.
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls,
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls.

In the heat of the evening when the dealin' got rough,
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff.
As I picked up my matches and was closin' the door,
I had one of those flashes, I'd been there before, been there before.

Well I ain't often right but I've never been wrong,
Seldom turns out the way it does in the song.
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right.

Well there ain't nothin' wrong with the way she moves,
All scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues.
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by.

Grateful Dead,"When I was just a little young boy,
Papa said ""Son, you'll never get far,
I'll tell you the reason if you want to know,
'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go""

Well baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than most any old thing
Well when I get those jelly roll blues
Why I'd go and get anything in this world for you.

Down to the jewelry store packing a gun,
Says ""Wrap it up. I think I'll take this one""
""A thousand dollars please,"" the jewelry man said
Dupree he said, ""I'll pay this one off to you in lead""

Well you know son you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad -
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

Judge said ""Son, this gonna cost you some time""
Dupree said ""Judge, you know that crossed my mind""
Judge said ""Fact it's gonna cost you your life""
Dupree said ""Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right""

Well baby, baby's gonna lose her sweet man
Dupree come out with a losing hand
Baby's gonna weep it up for awhile
Then go on out and find another sweet man's
Gonna treat her with style

Judge said ""Son, I know your baby well
But that's a secret I can't never tell""
Dupree said ""Judge, well it's well understood,
And you got to admit that that sweet, sweet jelly's so good""

Well you know son you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad,
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

Same old story and I know it's been told,
Some like jelly jelly - some like gold
Many a man's done a terrible thing
Just to get baby that shiny diamond ring",Dupree's Diamond Blues
Grateful Dead,"Waves of violet go crashing and laughing
The rainbow winged singing birds fly 'round the sun
Sun bells rain down in a liquid profusion
Mermaids on porpoises draw up the dawn
What's become of the baby this cold December morning?

Songbirds frozen in their flight
Drifting to the earth, remnants of forgotten dreaming
Dawning answer comes there none.

Go to sleep you child, dream of never-ending always
Panes of crystal ice sparkle like waterfalls
Lighting the polished ice caverns of the dawn,
But where in the looking-glass fields of illusion
Wandered the child who was perfect as the dawn?
What's become of the baby this cold December morning?
What's become of the baby this cold December morning?

Racing in rhythm of the sun
All the world revolves captured in the eye of woman
Allah, where are you now?

All eyes are blinded by the sparkling waters
Scheherazade gathering stories to tell
But where is the child who played with the sunshine's?
And chased the cloud shape to the regions of mind?
Standing stream cries the south wind
Lost in the regions of
Shadow-like chains of illusion, delusions of living and dead.",What's Become of the Baby
Grateful Dead,"Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion
Shall we go, you and I while we can
Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?

Mirror shatters in formless reflections of matter
Glass hand dissolving in ice, petal flowers revolving
Lady in velvet recedes in the nights of good-bye
Shall we go, you and I while we can
Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?",Dark Star [Studio Version][*]
Grateful Dead,"In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams; unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

In the book of love's own dreams
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my lights grow old

When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You flew to me

In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me",Attics of My Life
Grateful Dead,"Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or
Rain is falling from a heavy sky,
What do you want me to do,
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon long ago
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way
Like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner
Where it's been waiting to meet you,
What do you want me to do,
To watch for you while you're sleeping?
Well please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming too

Look into any eyes
You find by you, you can see
Clear through to another day
Maybe been seen before
Through other eyes on other days
While going home,
What do you want me to do,
To do for you to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon long ago

Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams
To another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted
With words half spoken
And thoughts unclear
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

Just a box of rain,
Wind and water,
Believe it if you need it,
If you don't just pass it on
Sun and shower,
Wind and rain,
In and out the window
Like a moth before a flame

And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there",Box of Rain
Grateful Dead,"Fare you well my honey
Fare you well my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this broke-down palace
On my hands and my knees I will roll roll roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time, in my time, I will roll roll roll

In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back back home
It's a far gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

Going home, going home
By the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

Going to plant a weeping willow
On the banks green edge it will grow grow grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go, the river roll roll roll

Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul",Brokedown Palace
Grateful Dead,"Come on all you pretty women with your hair a hanging down
Open up your windows 'cause the Candyman's in town
Come on boys and gamble roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven boys I'll take your money home

Look out look out the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend 'till
Candyman comes around again

I come from Memphis where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis be one less man alive
Good morning Mr Benson I see you're doing well
If I had me a shotgun I'd blow you straight to hell

Look out look out the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend 'till
Candyman comes around again

Come on boys and wager if you have got the mind
If you've got a dollar boys lay it on the line

Won't you tell everybody you meet that the Candyman's in town

Grateful Dead,"Operator, can you help me
Help me if you please
Give me the right area code
And the number that I need
My rider left upon the Midnight Flyer
Singin' like a summer breeze

I think she's somewhere down south
Down about Baton Rouge
But I just a can't remember no number
A number I can use
Directory don't have it
Central done forgot it
Gotta find a number to use.

Trying to check out her number
Trying to run down her line.
Operator said that's priv'ledged information
And it ain't no business of mine
It's floodin' down in Texas
Poles are out in Utah
Gotta find a private line

She could be hangin' 'round the steel mill
Working in a house of blue lights
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland
Talking to the night
I don't know where she's going
I don't care where she's been
Long as she's been doin' it right

Long as she's been doin' it right",Operator
Grateful Dead,"'Till the morning comes, it'll do you fine.
'Till the morning comes, like a highway sign,
Showing you the way, leaving no doubt,
Of the way on in or the way back out.

Tell you what I'll do, I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now, make yourself easy, make yourself easy
Make yourself easy, make yourself easy

'Till we all fall down, it'll do you fine,
Don't think about what you left behind
The way you came or the way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow

Tell you what I'll do, I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now, make yourself easy, make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

When the shadows grow, it'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow, it'll ease your mind
The shape it takes could be yours to choose
What you may win, what you may lose

Tell you what I'll do, I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now, make yourself easy, make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy",Till the Morning Comes

Annie Beauneu from Saint Angel
Say ""the weather down here so fine""

Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand

Fever roll up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

See here how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just like
Any other day
That's ever been
Sun goin up
And then the
Sun it goin down
Shine through my window and
My friends they come around
Come around
Come around

The people may know but
People don't care
That a man could be
As poor as me

He's lying in pain
Now let's go run
And see

Run and see

I said my prayers and went to bed, that's the last they saw of me
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me
Please, don't murder me

When I awoke, the Dire Wolf, six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window, all I said was come on in
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me
Please, don't murder me

The Wolf came in, I got my cards, we sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades, but the cards were all the same
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me
Please, don't murder me
Don't murder me

Out in red on the streets today
And the rivers keep a talkin'
But you never heard a word it said",Easy Wind
Grateful Dead,"You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go
I was having a high time, living the good life, well I know
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say

I'm having a hard time, living the good life, well I know
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you

Wheels broke down, leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying

I could show you a high time, living the good life, don't be that way
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone
We could have us a high time, living the good life, well I know",High Time
Grateful Dead,"Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train's got to run today

I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I heard some say better run away
Others say better stand still

I don't know, but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead

Who can deny, who can deny
It's not just a change in style
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles

I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Things went down we don't understand
But I think in time we will
Now, I don't know, but I was told
In the heat of the sun a man died of cold

Keep on coming or stand and wait,
With the sun so dark and the hour so late.
You can overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride

It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will

I don't know, but I been told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long

One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give",New Speedway Boogie

'Cause when life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door
Think this through with me, let me know your mind

It's a buck dancer's choice my friend better take my advice
You know all the rules by now and the fire from the ice
Will you come with me won't you come with me
Wo, oh, what I want to know, will you come with me

Goddamn, well I declare, have you seen the like
Their wall are built of cannonballs, their motto is don't tread on me
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come with me, or go alone, he's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me; it's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait
Wo, oh, what I want to know, where does the time go

I live in a silver mine and I call it beggar's tomb
I got me a violin and I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go

Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide

Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go

Grateful Dead,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

And buddy, that was good enough for me

More than my wine 
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would Pearly, believe them

You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home

Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has it's beaches, it's homeland and thoughts of it's own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has it's seasons, it's evenings and songs of it's own

There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone

Said, ""One for the money and two for the show""

Howling at the blood on the moon
Big diesel Mack truck rolling down my way
I can't hit that border too soon

Running hard out of Muskrat Flats

Hail on my back like a shotgun blast
High wind chimes in the night

Oh oh, the pride of Cucamonga
Oh oh, bitter olives in the sun
Oh oh, I had me some lovin'
And I done some time

Since I came down from Oregon
There's a lesson or two I've learned
By standing in the road alone
Standing watching the fires burn

The northern sky it stinks with greed
You could smell it for miles around
The good ole boys in the Greystone Hotel
Sitting doing that git on down

Oh oh, the pride of Cucamonga
Oh oh, silver apples in the sun
Oh oh, I had me some lovin'
And I done some time

I see your silver shining town
But I know I can't go there
Your streets run deep with poisoned wine
Your doorways crawl with fear

So I think I'll drift for ol' where it's at
Where the weed grows green and fine
And wrap myself around a bush of that bright
Whoa, on Oaxaca vine

Yes, it's me, I'm the pride of Cucamonga

Grateful Dead,"As I was walkin' down Grosvenor Square,
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air,
From the other direction she was calling my eye,
Could be an illusion but I might as well try, might as well try.

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes,
And I knew without askin' she was into the blues.
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls,
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls.

In the heat of the evening when the dealin' got rough,
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff.
As I picked up my matches and was closin' the door,
I had one of those flashes, I'd been there before, been there before.

Well I ain't often right but I've never been wrong,
Seldom turns out the way it does in the song.
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right.

Well there ain't nothin' wrong with the way she moves,
All scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues.
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by.

The wind in the willow's playing ""Tea for Two,""
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue,
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand,
Everybody's playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band.",Scarlet Begonias

Whoa, unbroken chain
Looking for familiar faces
In an empty window pane

Listening for the secret
Searching for the sound
But I could only hear the preacher
And the baying of his hounds

Willow sky
Whoa, I walk and wonder why
They say love your brother
But you will catch it when you try

Roll you down the line boy
Drop you for a loss
Ride you out on a cold railroad
And nail you to a cross

November and more
As I wait for the score
They're telling me forgiveness
Is the key to every door

A slow winder day
A night like forever
Sink like a stone
Float like a feather

Lilac rain, unbroken chain
Song of the saw-whet owl
Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane
Listening to the winds howl

Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls
Unbroken chain of sky and sea
Unbroken chain of the western wind
Unbroken chain of you and me

I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night
Till the morning came around

I set out running but I'll take my time
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

I ran into the Devil, babe
He loaned me twenty bills
I spent that night in Utah
In a cave up in the hills

I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

But the Devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill
And he vanished in the air

I set out running but I take my time

I just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry
Away each lonely night
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie
And she's my heart's delight
Second one is prison, baby
The sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me
I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe
And one in Cherokee
First one says she's got my child
But it don't look like me

I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe
The one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child
But it don't look like me

I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight",Friend of the Devil
Grateful Dead,"Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watchin' flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet

And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from payin' dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues Yeh

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the french perfume you'd care to smell

She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
Go on, my friend, do anything you choose
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeh

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billy Jean was waitin' when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame

I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues,yeh

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark
Just ridin' and runnin' across those desert sands",Mexicali Blues
Grateful Dead,"I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine,
Looked up in the heavens Lord I saw a mighty sign,
Writt'n fire across the heaven, plain as black and white;
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight.

[Chorus]
Huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
Yea, huh one more Saturday night,
Hey Saturday night!

Everybody's dancin' down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery.
The temperature keeps risin', everybody gittin' high;
Come the rockin' stroke of midnite, the whole place gonna fly.

[Chorus]

Turn on channel six, the President comes on the news,
Says, ""I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues.""
His wife say ""Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do,
Crank up that old Victrola, put on them rockin' shoes.""

[Chorus]

Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth,
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought He'd call it planet Earth.
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes,
When the rock and roll music meets the risin' sun.",One More Saturday Night [Live]
Grateful Dead,"Boots were of leather
A breath of cologne
Her mirror was a window
She sat quite alone

All around her
The garden grew
Scarlet and purple
And crimson and blue

She came and she went
And at last went away
The garden was sealed
When the flowers decayed

On the wall of the garden
A legend did say:
No one may come here
Since no one may stay",Rosemary
Grateful Dead,"Saint Stephen with a rose, in and out of the garden he goes
Country garden in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain

Stephen prospered in his time, well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now? Stephen would answer if he only knew how
Wishing well with a golden bell, bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight, writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer, darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own
Did he doubt or did he try? Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen will remain, all he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam,
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home

Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman, spinnin' that curious sense of your own
Can you answer, yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?",St. Stephen
Grateful Dead,"Sugar Magnolia blossom's blooming
Head's all empty and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

She come skimming through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia
Ringin' that blue bell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey, come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight
Crazy in the sunlight yes indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander round
I wander round

Sunshine daydream
Walking through the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Breathing more freely
Light out singing
I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream
Walk you in the sunshine",Sugar Magnolia
Grateful Dead,"Without a warning you broke my heart, takin' it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark, said your love for me was dyin'

Come on baby, baby please come on baby, cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights let it shine on me shine on your love light
Let it shine on me let shine, let it shine

When I get lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you darlin' to make things all right

So come on baby, baby please and I'm beggin' you baby cause I'm on my knees,
Turn on your lights let it shine on me
Turn on your love light let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it

Without a warning you broke my heart, takin' it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark, shine your love for me was dark

Come on baby, baby please come on baby, cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights let it shine on me turn on your love light
Let it shine, let shine",Turn on Your Love Light
Grateful Dead,"Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars

But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, I'm drowning in you

I left St. Louis, the City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it came to an end
'Cause you weren't the woman I thought I once met

But I can't deny that times have gone by
When I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet

The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
And it speaks of a life that passes like dew
It's forced me to see that you've done better by me
Better by me than I've done by you

What's to be found, racing around
You carry your pain wherever you go
Full of the blues and trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know

So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do

Goin' back home that's what I'm gonna do
Turnin' around
That's what I'm gonna do

'Cause you've done better by me
Than I've done by you",Black-Throated Wind
Grateful Dead,"Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
Nighttime would fine me in Rosa's Cantina,
Music would play and Felina would whirl.

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina,
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden,
I was in love, but in vain I could tell.

One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the west Texas wind...
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love.

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of rose's I ran, out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one; he looked like he could run,
Up on his back and away I did ride.

Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso,
Out through the badlands of New Mexico.
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
My love is stronger that my fear of death.
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark...
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart.

And as last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
I can see Rosa's Cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward, down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
I've got to make it to rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel 
A deep burning pain in my side. 
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle, 
I'm getting weary, unable to ride. 
But my love for 
Felina is strong and I writhe where I've fallen. 
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest 

I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.
From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina good-bye.",El Paso
Grateful Dead,"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia, California on my mind.
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh, and on across Caroline.

Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill, and we never was a minute late.
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown, rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.

Had motor trouble it turned into a struggle, half way 'cross Alabam,
The 'hound broke down left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham.

Straight off bought me a through train ticket, right across Mississippi clean
And I was on the midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans.

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town.
People are there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down.

Sure as she bore me, she bought me a silk suit, put luggage in my hands,
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land.

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte,
Flying over to the Golden State,
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.

Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone,
Cut your engines, cool your wings,
And let me make it to the telephone.

Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia,
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line.",The Promised Land
Grateful Dead,"Went to see the captain, strangest I could find,
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line.
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels,
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools.

Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rockin' of the boat,
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float.
I won't leave you drifting down, but woh it makes me wild,
With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child.

Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

The bottles stand as empty, as they were filled before.
Time there was and plenty, but from that cup no more.
Though I could not caution all, I still might warn a few:
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools.

Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
It was later than I thought, when I first believed you,
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.",Ship of Fools

Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair,
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair,
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind.
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind.

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee,
Said tell me where your strength lies if you please.
She spoke so kind and she talked so fair,
Well Samson said, Delilah cut off my hair.

You can shave my head, clean as my hand
And my strength will become as natural as any old man.

You read about Samson, all from his works,
He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.
One day when Samson was walking along,
Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.

He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,
When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.

Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,
But Samson got his hands around that lion's jaws.

Got to settle one old score
And one small point of pride

Keep him from the sun
Ain't no bed will give us rest, man,
You keep us on the run

Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down

We can share the wine",Jack Straw
Grateful Dead,"Me and my uncle went ridin' down
To South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe,
That day on the pony, just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

I took the horses up to the stall 
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, You know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they was all around,
Wheat liquor and money, they loaded down,
So soon after payday, no one seemed ashamed,
You know my uncle, he starts playin' the game,
Hey! A hollow jack and the winner take the hand.

My uncle starts winning, the cowboys got sore,
One of them called him, and then two more,
Accused him of cheatin', oh no it couldn't be,
I know my uncle he's as honest as me,
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.

One of them cowboys he starsts to draw,
And I shot him down Lord, He never saw,
Shot me another, Right then he hit the floor,
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,
And we hightailed it down to Mexico.

Now I love thoe cowboys, I love their gold,
Love my uncle, God rest his soul,
Taught me good Lord, Taught me all I know,
Taught me so well, that I grabbed that gold, and
I left his dead ass there by the side of the road",Me & My Uncle

Together, more or less in line, just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine; Houston, too close to New Orleans,
New York's got the ways and means; but just won't let you be, oh no

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love,
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man Once told me ""You've got to play your hand""
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime, if you don't lay'em down,

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me,
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me what a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine,
All a friend can say is ""Ain't it a shame?""

Truckin', up to Buffalo Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time, you pick a place to go, and just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel,
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street, set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin They just won't let you be, oh no

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel,
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin',
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me,
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me what a long, strange trip it's been

Back home, sit down and patch my bones, and get back truckin' on",Truckin'

If you see the little red rooster, won't you please drive him home
If you see my little red rooster, won't you please drive him home
Been no peace in the barnyard people, since the little red rooster's been gone

I could arm a town the size of Abilene

And I could pay you back with one good hand

And you'll never find another honest man.

Sweet Suzie, last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is baby,

Grateful Dead,"All I know is something like a bird within her sang,
All I know she sang a little while and then flew on,
Tell me all that you know, I'll show you snow and rain.

If you hear that same sweet song again, will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet is passin' by,
Laugh in the sunshine, sing, cry in the dark, fly through the night.

Don't cry now, don't you cry, don't you cry anymore.
Sleep in the stars, don't you cry, dry your eyes on the wind.

I can tell by the mark he left, you were in his dream.
Ah child of countless trees, ah child of boundless seas.

What you are, and what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me,
Born to me, Cassidy.

Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac.
I can tell by the way you smile, he is rolling back.
Come wash the nighttime clean, come grow the scorched ground green.

Blow the horn, and tap the tambourine.
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me, Cassidy.

Quick beats in an icy heart, catch colt draws a coffin cart,
There he goes and now here she starts, hear her cry.

Flight of the seabirds
Scattered like lost words,
Wield to the storm and fly.
Fare thee well now, let your life proceed by it's own design.
Nothing to tell now, let the words be yours, I'm done with mine.
Fare thee well now, let your life proceed by it's own design.
Nothing to tell now, let the words be yours, I'm done with mine.",Cassidy
Grateful Dead,"A pistol shot at five o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for
No I won't tell you a thing

Yesterday I begged you
Before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found

If you can abide it
Let the hurdy gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away

I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing, will not die

Take up your china doll
It's only fractured
And a little nervous from the fall

Grateful Dead,"Once upon a time there was an engineer.
Drove a locomotive both far and near.
Accompanied by a monkey that would sit on a stool
Watching everything the engineer would do

One day the engineer wanted a bite to eat,
He left the monkey sitting on the driver's seat,
The monkey pulled the throttle, the locomotive jumped the gun
And did 80 miles an hour down the mainline run.

Big locomotive right on time, big locomotive coming down the line.
Big locomotive No. 99, left the engineer with a worried mind. 
The engineer called up the dispatcher on the phone,
To tell him all about his locomotive was gone.

Dispatcher got on the wire, switch operator to the right,
Cause the monkey's got the main line sewed up tight.
The switch operator got the message on time,
Said there's a Northbound livin' on the same main line,

Open up the switch I'm gonna let him through the hole,
Cause the monkey's got the locomotive under control.

Bad girls will even do things on the sly
Look for your supper to be good and hot

Natural born easy on the road again

Friend come by, say looking for his hat
Wants to know where your husband's at
I don't know, he's on his way to the pen
Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again

Went to my house the front door was locked
Went 'round to my window, but my window was locked
Jumped right back, shook my head
Big old rounder in my folding bed
Jumped into the window, broke the glass
Never seen that little rounder run so fast

Grateful Dead,"I feel tears welling up from down deep inside,
Like my heart's got a big break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake.

You might think that I'm taking it hard since you broke me off with a call,
You might wager that I'll hide in sorrow and I might lay right down and bawl.
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch,
Heartaches a goin' to the inside, my tears are holding back, tryin' not to fall.

My heart's our of the running, true love scratched for another's sake,
The race is on and it looks like heartaches, and the winner loses all.
One day I ventured in love never once suspecting
What the final result would be.

Now I live in fear of waking up each morning,
And finding that you're gone from me.
There's an aching pain in my heart for the name of the one that I hated to face,
Someone else came out to win her, and I came out in second place",The Race Is On

Grateful Dead,"I know these rails we're on like I know my lady's smile,
We see a dozen dreams in every passing mile.
Can't begin to count the trips she and I have made,
But I wish I had a dollar for each time we've both been down this grade.

[Chorus]
And a hundred thousand tons of steel, made to roll.
The brakes don't work and this grade's too steep, her engine's sure to blow.
And a hundred thousand tons of steel, out of control,
She's more a roller coaster than the train I used to know.

It's one hell of an understatement, to say she can't be beat.
She's temperamental, more a bitch than a machine.
She wasn't built to travel at speed or through mud slides.
These wheels are bound to jump the tracks before they burn like the ties

Murphy sure out done himself to pick this stretch of track
I can only hope my luck is ridin' in the back.
Well I have pray to god this ain't the day we meet,

Grateful Dead,"Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear.
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of bricks
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye.
With shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.

Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head,
Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door,
Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on channel four.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows,
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose.
Put my arms around you, love you til you cry,
Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you 'til you die.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.",When Push Comes to Shove

Grateful Dead,"Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face
But afraid, we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime falls
And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me, you and me

Click, flash blade in ghetto night
Rudie's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

So the kids they dance, and shake their bones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink, yeah
History's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own. On our own. On our own.

If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shinning ball of blue we can call our home

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians, throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

Shipping powders back and forth
Singing ""black goes south and white comes north""
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours""
And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical he rant and rage
Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Sing ashes to ashes, all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
It's dizzying, the possibilities

Built to last 'till lightness fades,
And darkness falls on all.

Try hard but you cannot give.
Other times, you'd gladly go
With what you need to give.

This tomcat heart with which I'm blessed
Is destruction lovings twin?
May I chose to lose or win?
Maybe when my turn comes I will have guessed.

When sacred fails before profane

Even the purest of romantics compromise.

Put it all on plastic and I wonder where we'll be when the bills hit.

We can run,
But we can't hide from it.
Of all possible worlds,
We only got one:
We gotta ride on it.
Whatever we've done,
We'll never get far from what we leave behind,
Baby, we can run, run, run, but we can't hide.
Oh no, we can't hide.

I'm dumpin' my trash in your back yard
Makin' certain you don't notice really isn't so hard
You're so busy with your guns and all of your excuses to use them.

Well, it's oil for the rich and babies for the poor,
We got everyone believin' that more is more,
If a reckoning comes, maybe we will know what to do then.

All these complications seem to leave no choice,
I heard the tongues of billion speak with just one voice,
Saying, ""just leave all the rest to me,
I need it worse than you, you see.""
And then I heard,
The sound of one child crying.

Today I went walking in the amber wind,
There's a hole in the sky where the light pours in
I remembered the days when I wasn't afraid of the sunshine.

But now it beats down on the asphalt land
Like a hammering blow from god's left hand
What little still grows cringes in the shade like a bad vine.",We Can Run
Grateful Dead,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

Grateful Dead,"Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore,
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door.
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea.

She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter,
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water, and
She bears it away with a love that the river has taught her.

Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear.
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field,
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal,
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring,
Black dirt live again!
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing,
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing

Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield.
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name,
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin.
Water bright as the sky from which it came,
And the name is on the earth that takes it in.
We will not speak but stand inside the rain,
And listen to the thunder shouting ""i am! i am! i am! i am.""

Nothin' more, the love of the women, work of men.
Seasons round, creatures great and small, up and down as we rise and fall.",Let It Grow

And the moon came up in wine

People joining hand in hand
While the music plays the band
Lord they're setting us on fire

Balls of lightning roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on

Keep on dancing through to daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed but the band's all packed and gone
Was it ever here at all?
But they kept on dancing

In loops around the twisted shafts of lavender,
They're crawling to the sun.
Underfoot the ground is patched
With arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita,
Stark and shiny in the breeze.
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
Droop so hungry neath the sky.
William Tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch
No furthermore and/or it may require a change that hasn't come before.
No more time to tell how, this is the season of what,
Now is the time of returning with our thought
Jewels polished and gleaming.
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein,
Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming.
Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll,
Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow,
Five men writing with fingers of gold,
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale,
Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
Riding in the whale belly, fade away in moonlight,
Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below.",The Eleven

When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd,
Winter morning breaks, you're all alone.

And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud

Wherever he goes the people all complain.

Wishing well with a golden bell, bucket hanging clear to hell,
Hell halfway twixt now and then,
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again.

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight, writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky.
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer, darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye.

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow,
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned.
Several seasons with their treasons,
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own.
Did he doubt or did he try? Answers aplenty in the bye and bye,
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills,

Seashore washed by the suds and foam,
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home.

Says, ""Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup
That only love can fill, only love can fill""

Been walkin' all mornin', went walkin' all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and light
And I feel the wind and I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand
Says, ""Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup
Only love can fill, only love can fill""

From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand
Says, ""Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe

Grateful Dead,"I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine,
Looked up in the heavens Lord I saw a mighty sign,
Written fire across the heaven, plain as black and white;
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight.

Huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
Yea, huh one more Saturday night,
Hey Saturday night!

Everybody's dancin' down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery.
The temperature keeps risin', everybody gittin' high;
Come the rockin' stroke of midnite, the whole place gonna fly.

Huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
Yea, huh one more Saturday night,
Hey Saturday night!

Turn on channel six, the President comes on the news,
Says, ""I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues.""
His wife say ""Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do,
Crank up that old Victrola, put on them rockin' shoes.""

Huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
Yea, huh one more Saturday night,
Hey Saturday night!

Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth,
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought He'd call it planet Earth.

Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
And Bobby flagged the diesel down, just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

I took my harpon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blue
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang near every song that driver knew

Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord, in everything I done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for that home, I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday

Grateful Dead,"Me and my uncle went ridin' down
To South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe,
that day on the pony, just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

I took the horses up to the stall 
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, You know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they was all around,
Wheat liquor and money, they loaded down,
So soon after payday, no one seemed ashamed,
You know my uncle, he starts playin' the game,
Hey! A hollow jack and the winner take the hand.

My uncle starts winning, the cowboys got sore,
One of them called him, and then two more,
Accused him of cheatin', oh no it couldn't be,
I know my uncle he's as honest as me,
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.

One of them cowboys he starsts to draw,
And I shot him down Lord, He never saw,
Shot me another, Right then he hit the floor,
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,
And we hightailed it down to Mexico.

Now I love thoe cowboys, I love their gold,
Love my uncle, God rest his soul,
Taught me good Lord, Taught me all I know,
Taught me so well, that I grabbed that gold, and
I left his dead ass there by the side of the road",Me and My Uncle

Teeth big and pointed and his eyes were bugging out

Just out of prison on six dollars bail

And I showed him a picture of you
I said, ""Pal get to know her, you'll like her
Seemed like the least I could do.
'Cause when he's chargin' his chopper
Up and down your carpeted halls
You will think I am dressed up quite proper
Never mind how I stumble and fall.

You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

'Cause you're a sweet little softcore pretender
Somehow, babe, it got as hot as it gets
With her black leather and gold spike suspenders
And your chain, your black whip and pets.

Well we know you're the reincarnation
Of the infamous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love the ovation
And the scene that it seems to create.

You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

You analyze me, tend to despise me
You laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a say when I'll dance on your grave
Unable to dance I'll still crawl across it
Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll crawl.

You must really consider the circus
It just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you.

And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
Well I know you wake up here only
When the snakes come marching in.

For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe

Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
She promised, she'd be right there with me

Dodging lions and wastin' time
Those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em
Well, it sure has been a long hard climb

The train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, life will be sweet like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

So I left Rome and I landed in Brussels
On a plane so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform, yes and young girl pullin' muscles
Well, it should have been a long hard ride

Had to be held down by big police

When the strings of my heart begin to sever,
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears,

But the heart has it's seasons, it's evenings and songs of it's own

And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay

Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone

Odds against me been increasin' but I'll pull through
I never could read no road map, I don't know what the weather might do
But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine
I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose

Never know now, just don't never know, no
Well it's been heaven but even the rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'
And I'm as good as gone again

I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance
And the rain fallin' down, well, you never know, just don't know
Listen, sure don't know what I going for, but I'm gonna go for it for sure

Grateful Dead,"Inspiration, move me brightly
light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
more than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
statements just seem vain at last

Some rise
some fall
some climb
to get to terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
all are dim but one is bright
The spiral light of Venus
rising first and shining best
On, from the northwest corner 
of a brand new crescent moon
While crickets and cicadas sing
a rare and different tune
Terrapin station

In the shadow of the moon, terrapin station
And I know we'll be there soon, terrapin 
I can't figure out, terrapin
if it's the end or beginning, terrapin
But the train's put it's brakes on, terrapin
And the whistle is screaming, terrapin",Terrapin Station [Medley]
Grateful Dead,"Must be getting early clocks are running late
Faint light of the morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle curse the glare
Draw the curtains I don't care 'cause it's alright

I will get by I will get by
I will get by I will survive

I see you've got your fist out say your piece and get out
Yes I get the gist of it but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way the only there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

I will get by I will get by I will get by I will survive

It's a lesson to me the eagles and the beggars and the seas
The ABC's we all must face try to keep a little grace

It's a lesson to me the deltas and the east and the freeze
The ABC's we all think of and try to win a little love

I know the rent is in arrears the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow's giving kerosene, kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

I will get by I will get by I will get by I will survive

The shoe is on the hand that fits, there's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit 'cause it's alright
Oh well a touch of grey kinda suits you anyway
And that was all I had to say and it's alright

I will get by I will get by I will get by I will survive

We will get by we will get by we will get by we will survive
We will get by we will get by we will get by we will survive",Touch of Grey

Grateful Dead,"Awoke today, felt your side of the bed;
The covers were still warm where you been layin'.
You were gone, oh gone, my heart was filled with dread;
You might not be sleeping here again.
But it's all right cause I love you, and that's not going to change.
Run me around and make me hurt again and again.
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name.
The rain is gonna come, oh it surely looks like rain

Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from the cries you were listening to a fight.
Well you know, oh know, haste is the last thing they're thinking of.
You know they're only tryin' to make it through the night.

I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn.
It's just that I, oh I, have gotten used to havin' you around.
The landscape would be empty, if you were gone,
But it's all right cause I love you, and that's not going to change.
Run me around and make me hurt again and again.
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letter of your name.
The rain is gonna come, oh it surely looks like rain.",Looks Like Rain
Grateful Dead,"Well, the first days are the hardest days, don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door
Now think this through with me, let me know your mind
Whoa oh, what I want to know is, are you kind

Now it's a buck dancer's choice, my friends, better take my advice
You know all the rules by now and the fire from the ice
Now will you come with me, won't you come with me?
Whoa oh, what I want to know, will you come with me?

Sister, well, I declare, have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls, their motto is ''Don't tread on me""
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone, he's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me, it's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait
Whoa oh, what I want to know, where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine and I call it beggar's tomb
I've got me a violin and I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice
Whoa oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?

Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about here beside the rising tide
Come hear uncle John's band, playing to the tide
Come on, come on or go alone, he's come to take his children home

Whoa oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?

Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about here beside the rising tide

Grateful Dead,"First thing I remember knowin'
Was a lonesome whistle blowin'
And a youngun's dream of growin' up to ride
On a freight train leavin' town,
Not knowin' where I's bound
No one could change my mind but mama tried

One and only rebel child
In a family meek and mild,
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learnin',
For the bad I kept on turnin'
Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus:]
And I turned twenty one in prison
Doin' life without parole
No one could steer me right
But mama tried, mama tried,
Mama tried to raise me better
But her pleadin' I denied,
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried

Dear old daddy, rest his soul,
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Workin' hours without rest,
Wanted me to have the best,
She tried to raise me right but I refused

That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried",Mama Tried
Grateful Dead,"The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
Let my guitar playin' friend fill my request
Let him sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come alive.
Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me home before I die.
I recall last Sunday morning when the choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers there's a song my mother sang
Can I hear it before you travel on.
Sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come alive.
Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me back home before I die",Sugar Magnolia (Encore)
Grateful Dead,"Merry run around, sailing up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

They love each other, Lord you can see it's true
Lord you can see it's true, Lord you can see it's true

He could pass his time around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in the way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

They love each other, Lord you can see it's true
Lord you can see it's true, Lord you can see it's true

Its' nothing, they explain it's like a diesel train
Better not be there when it rolls over
And when that train rolls in, you won't know where it's been
You gotta try to see a little further

They love each other, Lord you can see it's true
Lord you can see it's true, Lord you can see it's true

Though you'll make a noise, they just can't hear your voice
They're on a dizzy ride on you're cold sober

They love each other, Lord you can see it's true
Lord you can see it's true, Lord you can see it's true

Hope you will believe what I say is true
Everything I did, I heard it first from you

Heard your news report, you knew you're falling short
Pretty soon won't trust you for the weather
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been
You got to try to see a little further

Grateful Dead,"Oh, sinning is a gentilized journey
Take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and saintly
Without Him walking by your side

And when you come to make your crossing
At the end of the pilgrim's way
If you ever will meet your Savior
You will surely meet Him on that day

Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at its deep water
Look at that wide river
Oh, heavy mighty billows roll

You better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
Oh, I'm sure without Him
That you never will make it home

That awful day of judgment
Is coming in the by and by
We'll see our Lord descending
In the glory from on high

Oh, let us get in touch with Jesus
And in the special love of God
And maybe ever get ready
When he comes on Jordan's tide

Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at its deep water
Look at that wide river
Oh, heavy mighty billows roll

You better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
Oh, I'm sure without Him that
You never will make it home

Now what you gonna do?
Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, how you gonna feel
When you come to the end of the way?

Grateful Dead,"It's a man's world

And the smell of her roses does not remain

All his children grew and grew, they ain't never grown so tall before
They may never grow so tall again

We dug him up on Tuesday, he hardly aged a day
Taught us all we ever knew, we ain't never known so much before
We may never know so much again

Mason's children ran and flew, they ain't never run so fast before
Swore they'd never show their face again

Grateful Dead,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded
Though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain
Tempting you to defy it

Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off

Just Louise and her lover
So entwined
And these visions of Johanna
That conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the keychain
And the all night girls they whisper of
Escapades out on the ""D"" train

We can hear the night watchman
Click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them
It's insane

Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here

The ghost of electricity
Howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna
Have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost
He takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery
He likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me

He's sure got a lotta gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
While I'm in the hall

Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna
They kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums
Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, 'This is what
Salvation must be like after a while'
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles

See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say
""Jeeze, I can't find my knees""

Oh, jewels and binoculars
Hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna
They make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess
Who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him""

But like Louise always says
""You can't look at much, can you man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him

And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road

He writes every thing's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes

The harmonicas play
The skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna
Are now all that remain
",Visions of Johanna

Just one old day, yes I did,

We ain't gettin' down like we used to do,
I mean it's pretty good now, but there was a time,
When it didn't work too well.

And there were days
And there were days besides
When phantom ships with phantom sails 
Set to sea on phantom tides
Comes the lightning of the sun
On bright unfocused eyes
The blue of yet another day
A springtime wet with sighs
A hopeful candle lingers
In the land of lullabies
Where headless horsemen vanish
With wild and lonely cries lonely cries

There were days
And there were days
And there were days I know
When all we ever wanted
Was to learn and love and grow
Once we grew into our shoes
We told them where to go
Walked halfway around the world
On promise of the glow
Stood upon a mountain top
Walked barefoot in the snow
Gave the best we had to give
How much we'll never know we'll never know

There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Polished like a golden bowl
The finest ever seen
Hearts of Summer held in trust
Still tender, young and green
Left on shelves collecting dust
Not knowing what they mean
Valentines of flesh and blood
As soft as velveteen
Hoping love would not forsake
The days that lie between lie between",Days Between

Grateful Dead,"Way down upon Sycamore Slough
White man sings the blues
Selling roses of paper mache
And flecks of starlight dew

Swiped a bunch and threw them your way
Where hazy moonlight glows
Way down, down along lazy river road

Way down upon Shadowfall Ward
End of the avenue
Run, hide, seek in your own backyard
Mama's backyard won't do

All night long I sing love's sweet songs
Down where the water flows
Way down, down along lazy river road

Moonlight wanes as hound dogs bay
Never quite catch the tune
Stars fall down in buckets like rain
There ain't no standin' room

Bright blue boxcars train by train
Clatter while dreams unfold
Way down, down along lazy river road

Way down upon Seminole Square
Belly of the river tide
Call for me and I will be there
For the price of a taxi ride

Nighttime double clutches into the day
Like a truck down shifting it's load
Way down, down along lazy river road

Moonlight wanes as hound dogs bay
Never quite catch the tune
Stars fall down in buckets like rain
There ain't no standin' room

Bright blue boxcars train by train
Clatter while dreams unfold
Way down, down along lazy river road

Thread the needle right through the eye
The thread that runs so true
All the others I let pass by
I only wanted you

Never cared much for careless love
Oh, how your bright eyes glow
Way down, down along lazy river road
Way down, down along lazy river road
Way down, down along lazy river road

Chop it down and you can't stop me

Went to the well but the water was dry
Dipped my bucket in the clear blue sky
Looked in the bottom and what did I see?

Grateful Dead,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Grateful Dead,"The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
Let my guitar playin' friend fill my request
Let him sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come alive.
Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me home before I die.
I recall last Sunday morning when the choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers there's a song my mother sang
Can I hear it before you travel on.
Sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come alive.

Grateful Dead,"Thought I heard a blackbird singing
Up on Bluebird Hill
Call me a whinin' boy if you will
Born where the sun don't shine
And I don't deny my name
Got no place to go, ain't that a shame?

Thought I heard that KC whistle
Moaning sweet and low
Thought I heard that KC when she blow
Down where the sun don't shine
Underneath the Kokomo
Whinin' boy got no place to go

So many roads, I tell you
So many roads I know
So many roads, so many roads
Mountain high, river wide
So many roads to ride
So many roads, so many roads

Thought I heard a jug band playin'
If you don't who else will?
From over on the far side of the hill
All I know the sun don't shine
And the rain refused to fall
And you don't seem to hear me when I call

Wind inside and the wind outside
Tangled in the window blind
Tell me why you treat me so unkind
Down where the sun don't shine
Lonely and I call your name
No place left to go, ain't that a shame?

So many roads, I tell you
New York to San Francisco
So many roads I know
All I want is one to take me home
From the high road to the low
So many roads I know
So many roads, so many roads

From the land of the midnight sun
Where the ice blue roses grow
Along those roads of gold and silver snow
Howlin' wide or moaning low
So many roads I know
So many roads to [unverified] my soul

Grateful Dead,"As I was a-goin' over Gilgarra mountains
I met Colonel Pepper and his money he was counting
I drew forth my pistol and I rattled my sabre
Saying ""stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver""

Musha ringum duram da
Whack-fall the daddy-o
Whack-fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

The shining yellow coins did sure look bright and jolly
I took the money home and I gave it to my Molly
She promised and she vowed that she never would deceive me
But the devil's in the women for they never can be easy

[Chorus]

When I awoke between the hours of six and seven
Guards were standing 'round me in numbers odd and even
I flew to my pistols, but alas I was mistaken
I fired off my pistols and a prisoner was taken

[Chorus]

They put me in jail without a judge or jury
For robbing Colonel Pepper in the morning so early
They didn't take my fist so I knocked down the sentry
And I bid a long farewell to that cold penitentiary

Others take delight in carriage a-rollin'
I take delight in the juice of the barley
Courting pretty women in the morning so early

Peals of fragile thunder keeping time
Recall the days that still are to come some sing blue.

Down to the water, deep sea of love
Beneath the sweet calm face of the sea swift undertow.

Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know,
See how it feels in the end.
May lady lullaby sing plainly for you soft, strong, sweet and true.
Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow tapping at the window, touch your hair
So swift and bright strange figures of light float in air.

Who can stop what must arrive now? something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night you're still by my side shine inside .
Gone are the days we stopped to decide where we should go, we just ride.
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams gone, both dream and lie.

Bent my ear to hear the tune, and closed my eyes to see.

Where all the pages are my days, and all the lights grow old.

Grateful Dead,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine big 707 set to go
But I'm stuck here on the grass where the cold winds they do blow
And where whiskey was and bars and the women they were fine
There she goes my friend, she rolling down at last

Here the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
There the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down it ain't no earthy good to me
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I can be
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a railroad train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around.

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills.

Set out runnin' but i take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If i get home before daylight, i just might get some sleep tonight.

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air.

Got two reasons why i cry away each lonely night,
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my hearts delight.
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail,
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail.

Got a wife in chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me.

All your reindeer armies, are all going home

Has taken all his blankets from the floor

Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you

Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew

Get out of the door and light out and look all around.

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times i can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me what a long, strange trip it's been.

Truckin', i'm a goin' home. whoa whoa baby, back where i belong,
Back home, sit down and patch my bones, and get back truckin' on.
Hey now get back truckin' home.",Truckin' [Single Version][*]

Grateful Dead,"You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies, are all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, baby blue","It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"

Grateful Dead,"If I had my way, I would tear this old building down.

Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair,
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair,
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind.
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind.

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee,
Said tell me where your strength lies if you please.
She spoke so kind and she talked so fair,
Well Samson said, Delilah cut off my hair.

You can shave my head, clean as my hand
And my strength will become as natural as any old man.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.

You read about Samson, all from his works,
He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.
One day when Samson was walking along,
Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.

He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,
When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.

Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,
But Samson got his hands around that lion's jaws.

He ripped the beast till he killed him dead.

Grateful Dead,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
Nighttime would find me in Rose's Cantina,
Music would play and Felina would whirl.

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina,
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden,
I was in love, but in vain I could tell.

One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the West Texas wind...
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love.

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of Rose's I ran, out where the horses were tied...
I picked a good one; he looked like he could run,
Up on his back and away I did ride.

Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso,
Out through the badlands of New Mexico.
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
My love is stronger that my fear of death.
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark...
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart.

And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
I can see Rose's Cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward, down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
I've got to make it to Rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle.
I'm getting weary, unable to ride.

But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen;
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest.
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina good-bye.",El Paso [Live]

Grateful Dead,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

On a summer's evening we formed a merry group
Boys and girls together we would sing and waltz

The tots sang ""ring-a-rosie,"" ""London Bridge is falling down""

I went down one day, I went down one day to see a gypsy woman,
Just one old day, yes I did,
I want to find out, I want to find out,
I want to find out, I want to find out now,
What's wrong with me and my baby.
We ain't gettin' down like we used to do,
I mean it's pretty good now, but there was a time,
When it didn't work too well.

I went down to see this gypsy woman, you understand,
I told her my story, I told her what was goin' on.
And she told me, man she said, all you need, all you need,
She said all you got to have, oh lord,
Just a touch of mojo's hand, oh bring it back on,
And it feels pretty good, yes indeed.

Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Take me back to another morning
To a time so long ago
When the sweet Magnolia blossomed
Cotton fields as white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo
Who lived and died by the river's bed
Looking back, I still remember
I was proud to be his friend

Mama said, ""Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg
Traded for a chestnut mare
Lord, her never spoke in anger
Though his load was hard to bear

Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn

That path is for your steps alone

Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair,
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair,
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind.
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind.

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee,
Said tell me where your strength lies if you please.
She spoke so kind and she talked so fair,
Well Samson said, Delilah cut off my hair.

You can shave my head, clean as my hand
And my strength will become as natural as any old man.

You read about Samson, all from his works,
He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.
One day when Samson was walking along,
Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.

He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,
When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.

If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,
I would tear this old building down.

Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,
But Samson got his hands around that lion's jaws.

Grateful Dead,"Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity.
Paint it with a skin of sky, brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me.

A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race.
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face.
But afraid, we may our home to waste.

There's a fear down here we can't forget hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around singing ashes to ashes all fall down.
Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime calls
And again the hunt begins and again the bloodwind calls

By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes.
It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Stalking turf, dividing up meat.

Nightmare spook, piece of heat, you and me, you and me.
Click, flashblade in ghetto night. Rudie's looking for a fight.
Rat cat alley roll them bones. Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politicians throwing stones

Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price.
Money green or proletarian gray, selling guns instead of food today.

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
While the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
Heartless powers try to tell us what to think

If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink.
History's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own.
If the game is lost then we're all the same

No one left to place or take the blame.
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or this shinning ball of blue we can call our home
So the kids they dance, they shake their bones

While the politicians are throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down.
Shipping powders back and forth
Singing ""black goes south while white comes north""

And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours.""
And the current fashions set the pace.
Lose your step, fall out of grace.

And the radical he rant and rage, Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians are throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
'Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free

It's dizzying, the possibilities. Ashes, Ashes all fall down.",Throwing Stones [Live]

Killed poor Laura Foster, don't you know your bound to die
Bury her on the hillside with other people's lives

You can't find a ride like that no more
The night the chariot swung down low 
Ninety-nine children had a chance to go
One long party from front to end 
Tune to the whistle going round the bend 
No great hurry, what do you say? 

Might as well to be every way
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well 
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well

Ragtime slowly for twenty-five miles 
Then switch over to the cajun style 
Bar car blowing rhythm and blues
Rock 'n' roll wailing in the old caboose
Long train running from coast to coast 
Bringing home a party when you need it the most 
Work on the box car, beat on the bell 
Nothing else shaking so you might just as well

Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well 
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well 

Never had such a good time in my life before
I'd like to have it one time more 
Whoa! One good ride from start to end
I'd like to take that ride again, again! 
Ran out of track and I caught the plane
Back in the county with the blues again

Grateful Dead,"Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand,
Watchin' flies and children on the street,
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile,
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet.

And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came.
I guess I came to keep from payin' dues.
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen,
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues. Yeh!

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose,
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze,
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today.

She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town.
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell.
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold,
All the french perfume you'd care to smell.

She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear,
""Go on, my friend, do anything you choose.""
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms,
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues.

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose,
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today.

And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law.
Billy Jean was waitin' when he came.
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun,
I'd have no one but myself to blame.

I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind.
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues.

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark
Just ridin' and runnin' across those desert sands.","Mexicali Blues [Live at the Spectrum, Philadelphia, PA, September 21, 1"

Head's all empty and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need

Pays my ticket when I speed

She can make happy any man alive

Caught up in sunlight

When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying

And stashed behind your couch

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind","Sick and Tired [Live, February/March, 1966]"

Grateful Dead,"Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back step, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two-time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

And I say row, Jimmy row
Gonna get there, I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row, row, row, row, row

Here's a half a dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie down below
The levee doin' the dopaso

And I say row, Jimmy row
Gonna get there, I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row, row, row, row, row

Broken heart, don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast and not too slow

And I say row, Jimmy row
Gonna get there, I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row, row, row, row, row

That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the juke box down
Two bit piece, don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

And I say row, Jimmy row
Gonna get there, I don't know
Seems a common way to go

Grateful Dead,"Went to see the captain, strangest I could find,
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line.
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels,
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools.

Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rockin' of the boat,
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float.
I won't leave you drifting down, but woh it makes me wild,
With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child.

Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
It was later than I thought when I first believed you,
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

The bottles stand as empty, as they were filled before.
Time there was and plenty, but from that cup no more.
Though I could not caution all, I still might warn a few:
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools.

Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.
It was later than I thought, when I first believed you,
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

Grateful Dead,"Red and white, blue suede shoes

Grateful Dead,"I had a hard run, runnin' from your window
I was all night running, running, Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run in, run around and run down
Run around the corner, Lord, run smack in to a tree

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

Dressed myself in green, I went down unto the sea
Try to see what's goin' down, try to read between the lines
I had a feelin' I was fallin', fallin', fallin', I turned around to see
Heard a voice callin', you were running back to me

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

Ran into a rainstorm, I ducked back into a bar door
It's all night pourin', but not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me? Throw me in to the jail house
Lord, until the sun goes down, 'til it goes down

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had-a, a wicked mind
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Weh-ell!
Delilah was a woman fine an' fair
Her pleasant looks-a, her coal black hair
Delilah gained old Samson's mind
A-first saw the woman that looked so fine

A-well went Timnathy, I can't tell
A daughter of Timnathy, a-pleased him well
A-Samson told his father, 'I'm goin a-a-a'

'Can't you find a woman of your kind and kin?'
'Samson, will you please your mother's mind?'
Go'd and married that-a Philistine

Let me tell you what, old Samson

Well, he roared at the lion, the lion run
Samson was the first man the lion attach
He caught the lion and got upon his 'ack
A-written that he killed a man with his
And Sampson had his hand in the lion's jaws

If I had my way
If I had-a, a wicked world
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

""A-how strong of it came forth sweet?

Well, the bees made-a honey in the lion hair

Well, if I had my way
Well, if I had-a, a wicked world
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Sewed me tow knot, an' formed a plot
Not many days 'fore Samson was caught
A-bind this hands whilst a-walkin' along
A-looked on the ground and found a lil' jawbone
He moved his arm ropes, a-pop like thread
Dropped those threads free, three thousand were dead

Lord, If I had my way
Well, if I had a, a wicked world
If I had a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Samson's trick though they never found out
""Till they began to wonder about""
A-'till his wife sat up upon his knee
""A-tell me where your strength lie, if you please?""

Samson's wife she a-talked so fair
Told his wife cut off-a his hair
""Shave my head, clean as your hand""
""Till I become a natural man!""

Grateful Dead,"In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams; unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

In the book of love's own dreams
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my lights grow old

When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You flew to me

In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me","Attics of My Life [Live at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, CA 1970"
Grateful Dead,"In the timbers to Fennario, the wolves are running round,
The winter was so hard and cold, froze ten feet 'neath the ground.
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.

I sat down to my supper, 'twas a bottle of red whisky,
I said my prayers and went to bed, that's the last they saw of me.
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.

When I awoke, the Dire Wolf, six hundred pounds of sin,
Was grinning at my window, all I said was ""Come on in"".
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.

The Wolf came in, I got my cards, we sat down for a game.
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades, but the cards were all the same.
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.

In the backwash of Fennario, the black and bloody mire,
The Dire Wolf collects his dues, while the boys sing 'round the fire.
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.
No, no, no don't murder me. I beg of you,
Don't murder me. Please, don't murder me.","Dire Wolf [Live at Santa Rosa's Veterans Hall in Santa Rosa, CA 1969 Ve"

Grateful Dead,"There was a wealthy merchant
In London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter
The truth to you I'll tell
Oh, truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
There was none but Jack the sailor
Her true love e're would be
Oh, her true love e're could be

Now Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

She went into a tailor shop
And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away

Well before you step on board, sir
Your name I'd like to know
She smiled all in her countenance
They call me Jackaroe
Oh, they call me Jackaroe

Your waist is light and slender
Your fingers are neat and small
And your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannon-ball

Well, I know my waist is slender
My fingers are neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

The war soon being over
She hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds
Oh, who quickly healed his wounds

This couple they got married
So well did they agree
This couple they got married
So why not you and me?
Oh, so why not you and me?

Cause when life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door.

It's a buck dancer's choice my friend; better take my advice.

Come with me, or go alone, he's come to take his children home.

It's the same story the crow told me; it's the only one he knows.
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go.
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait,
Wo, oh, what I want to know, where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine and I call it beggar's tomb;
I got me a violin and I beg you call the tune,
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice.
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?

Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside,
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide.

Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide,
Come on along, or go alone, he's come to take his children home.

Grateful Dead,"There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Summer flies and August dies
The world grows dark and mean
Comes the shimmer of the moon
On black infested trees
The singing man is at his song
The holy on their knees
The reckless are out wrecking
The timid plead their pleas
No one knows much more of this
Than anyone can see anyone can see

There were days
And there were days
And there were days besides
When phantom ships with phantom sails 
Set to sea on phantom tides
Comes the lightning of the sun
On bright unfocused eyes
The blue of yet another day
A springtime wet with sighs
A hopeful candle lingers
In the land of lullabies
Where headless horsemen vanish
With wild and lonely cries lonely cries

There were days
And there were days
And there were days I know
When all we ever wanted
Was to learn and love and grow
Once we grew into our shoes
We told them where to go
Walked halfway around the world
On promise of the glow
Stood upon a mountain top
Walked barefoot in the snow
Gave the best we had to give
How much we'll never know we'll never know

There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Polished like a golden bowl
The finest ever seen
Hearts of Summer held in trust
Still tender, young and green
Left on shelves collecting dust
Not knowing what they mean
Valentines of flesh and blood
As soft as velveteen
Hoping love would not forsake
The days that lie between lie between",Days Between>
Grateful Dead,"In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked through your mother's face
Wildflower seed on the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home 

Roll away, the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew

I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
It can ring like fire when you lose your way

Roll away, the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew

God save the child who rings that bell
I may have one good ring baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused just listen to the music play

Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind

Roll away, the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew

I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

Roll away, the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew
Roll away, roll away the dew","Franklin's Tower [Live From Lindley Meadows, Golden Gate Park, San Fran"
Grateful Dead,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind","Casey Jones [Lyceum, London, England 5/26/1972]"
Grateful Dead,"There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Summer flies and August dies
The world grows dark and mean
Comes the shimmer of the moon
On black infested trees
The singing man is at his song
The holy on their knees
The reckless are out wrecking
The timid plead their pleas
No one knows much more of this
Than anyone can see anyone can see

There were days
And there were days
And there were days besides
When phantom ships with phantom sails 
Set to sea on phantom tides
Comes the lightning of the sun
On bright unfocused eyes
The blue of yet another day
A springtime wet with sighs
A hopeful candle lingers
In the land of lullabies
Where headless horsemen vanish
With wild and lonely cries lonely cries

There were days
And there were days
And there were days I know
When all we ever wanted
Was to learn and love and grow
Once we grew into our shoes
We told them where to go
Walked halfway around the world
On promise of the glow
Stood upon a mountain top
Walked barefoot in the snow
Gave the best we had to give
How much we'll never know we'll never know

There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Polished like a golden bowl
The finest ever seen
Hearts of Summer held in trust
Still tender, young and green
Left on shelves collecting dust
Not knowing what they mean
Valentines of flesh and blood
As soft as velveteen
Hoping love would not forsake
The days that lie between lie between",Days Between [Blu-Ray]

Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Grateful Dead,"As I was walkin' 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction, she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without askin' she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls

In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before

Well, I ain't always right but I've never been wrong
Seldom turns out the way it does in a song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

Ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
Had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by

Wind in the willow's playin' ""Tea For Two""

Grateful Dead,"Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run
Galveston, oh, Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying
In the sun, at Galveston, at Galveston","St. Stephen [Live at the Fillmore West, San Francisco, CA 2/27/69] [Liv"
Grateful Dead,"Baby
B-B-B-Baby
Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

Grateful Dead,"Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?

Say it might have been a fiddle
Or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now
I can feel it in my feet now
Listen here it comes again

There's a band out on the highway
They're high steppin' into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancin'

Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

The sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinnin' dizzy
Lord the band kept us so busy
We forgot about the time

They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand while
The music played the band
Lord they're setting us on fire

Crazy rooster crowin' midnight
Balls of lightin' roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playin' on

Keep on dancin' through the daylight
Greet the mornin' air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they keep on dancin'

Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancin'
Full of singin' and romancin'

Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you

You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has it's beaches, it's homeland and thoughts of it's own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has it's seasons, it's evenings and songs of it's own

There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has it's beaches, it's homeland and thoughts of it's own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has it's seasons, it's evenings and songs of it's own

Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has it's beaches, it's homeland and thoughts of it's own

His army's great his soldiers strong
Come with me to fight at Falkirk
Send them back where theyt belong
I don't have the blood of kings
But I'd die for Scotland's pride
Even nobles follow me
Into battle side by side
Nightmares haunt my lonely nights
I must be strong and I must fight
Braveheart they call me
If they knew if they could see
Repeat first one
Vengeance burns a raging anger
I have lost the fear to die
Braveheart that's what I am
I kill until my blood runs dry
The lust for battle in my veins
Inspires me to take your life

I kill until my blood runs dry

But masters of the fight

Grave Digger,"I believe I see your face
Reflected in the glass
Your blue eyes seem to laugh at me
You have captured my soul
You broke my heart 'long time ago
I'll make you love me too
Don't play for keeps, don't play to win
We're playing your game
I can't believe the words you say
That love's just gone someday
A coolness has replaced your love
My fortune fades away
I recall the times we had
Those days of happiness
I never will believe you
When you say love's a game
Night after night
It's a game
Love is a game
As you lie there, my heart stands still
You're just another girl

With lots of golden smiles

Far as life, yo it ain't worth it
Put a rope around your neck and jerk it
The trick didn't work
Your life was fucked up from the first day of birth
After watching Jackie Gleason walk into a precinct
Gun down the captain for no fucking reason
And get some LSD or a drink from the bar
Get behind your wheel and crash the car
Like Desert Storm, got bombs for the war
Confront an alligator, let it eat ya raw

Mom and dad are white and you're dark as ink
Maybe you're Sicilian with a tan
But you hate lasagna and the pizza man
Now you stand on the grave digga plot and
You're singing the blues about the rough life you've got
Not! You don't wanna live no more
I guess you're really ready for the grave yard tour

The first was convinced
Stuck a water hose in his mouth at full blast so his head can explode
Second one said, ""Hmmmm, that's good but I can top it!""
Put an ax up to his head and then he chopped it
Blood shot out in every direction
The rest didn't know what to do, I made suggestions
Put a slug in your mug, overdose on a drug
Wet your hand, stick a knife in the plug
Or be like Richard Pryor set your balls on fire
Better yet, go hang yourself with a barbed wire
Three and Four fell deep into the spell and
Ran to the zoo, locked themselves in the lion's den
Number Five said, ""It ain't worth being alive!""

Verse One:

I grew up in the violent island of Shaolin
Fifty-five home and cease thoughts implore
When jackpot rot was hot, I was not
A rusty-ass child with tears and snots
Acquired the knowledge, how to master my thoughts
My skinny frail body couldn't fuck with the sports
Six feet two still wack on the court
So I stalked New York with a black pitchfork
My style date back to ninety-watt
cuttin the box, while I be clocks with no socks
Remember the days before your pants would sag
Puerto Ricans on the block just throwin up tags

Verse Two: Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper

Yo I was born with a rusty spoon as a mouthpiece
Life was hard cause the graves was my company
Hang with my problems just as trouble predicted
to cross the path, as I laugh at the vic-ted
No warmth for sure, the vents would spit average
watchin devils, fiend like a savage
Blood brothers need me call, ooh-OOH!!!
In a minute, a minute, Ghostface and all, check it
With the Grym and the Undertake
Devil's get baked I'll stiff your ass like an eighth
Tortures and screams building up my steam
Death to whoever bumrushes through the bloodstream
Yo somethin ain't right I don't get it
I feel a vibe blood brothers are you with it
If I have to choose one or the other
Back the fuck up spook, yo that's my blood brother

Verse Two: Too Poetic/Grym Reaper

Back in the days of Lee's and BVD's
I grew up deceived, by wicked enemies
My lifespan began to dim in the error
When you can't even trust the man in the mirror
Now Gravedigga niggaz receive my trust
and like Christ, we walk among the thieves and the sluts
I bring stress like skins on PMS
The street's a bloody mess, there ain't no EMF
in sight my thoughts are to leave the slums
I hustle with beats and drums not keys and guns
My feet are numb, as I walk my dogs
I cut off the fogs with the Gravedigga swords
Life parole, as me and my man is violated
Hookers are neutered and spay-ted
Snakes are decapitated, and castrated
Niggaz is lost your whole Ark is bein raided
Shows today are hectic, niggaz'll wreck shit
Lift off rounds and jet quick
This piece is gettin heated
Cause a rush, a stampedin
Devils are all defeated by the blood brothers

Chorus

Verse Three: Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper, Ryzarector

Yeahhh, as the earth erupts
I conduct to destruct your rucks when I big up
Catastrophes are blaspheme
Pour a container of brains on your grave through a strainer
I capsize your coffin, I wreck your morphin
Breakin devils down like Steve Austin
I gotta rip on a peel for a minute
Let's get some god degree, cause a blood brother's hard to be

Power equality
Allah sees equality, follow me
Law and order but I stick it in water
Many heads got slaughtered back in Latin Quarters
Like this brother named Rick was thick but got bit
by the same motherfucker that he ran with
Band of the hand the Clan's my fam
Something mom duke could never understand
From the grave to the gutter
Death to another, who tries to fuck with my blood brothers

All the sin steppin in on my face there's a grin
Another dumb vic once moved now step
Grabbed em by the wrist, come to the abyss
Meet Katie, abortion was known with this lady
A Ph.D. many degrees had Mercedes car
She took it to a bar got lit
Like a skunk got drunk, danced rather bumped
Boom, she took the car to the nigga's pad
She didn't want to kick it so the bitch got stabbed
Wrong place and wrong time don't exist no more
or for, according to the Gravedigga law

Verse Two: Ryzarector

This crab named Black, brother sell up crack
And it's a natural fact, in his pockets he had stacks
Bad ass beemer he drove, cause he sold his soul
to get ahold of the chrome and gold
True, he felt good as he walked his hood
Bein hunted every night, like a bear in the woods
See cops play the role of a fox
if they catch your ass out on the block, ock
it's back to the penalty box
But Black was the type that was like
""Yo fuck the see-cipher
 I got to get papes, every night""
Trailed but you came for kills
See cipher, ain't the only niggaz on the bill
He had like a quarter mil stashed on him
With the click, came through, and he blasted em
So perhaps you're catchin mad snap like that
nigga Black, smack, but you caught by the death trap

Bitch she had a body like a Lexus Coupe
Her step-father, was robbin the cradle bangin the boots
her heartbeat increased at night she couldn't sleep
Daddy dearest, was bringin her grief between sheets
Deep scars invaded her soul force and mind
Six years of torture started at age nine
At age sixteen already an old maid
deceived, she was caught like Freddy in a bad dream
Meanwhile her body is being defiled
Tellin her mother, only brought a stage of denial
Moms followed pops on the low-down
led to a showdown, for a week shit slowed down
But one night overcome by lust
Father Dukes tried to score just one more thrust
He should've held back the RZA got an axe
Gave his dick forty whacks and threw his ass in the death....

The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz, in a head full of dread

I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth the nurses surrounded my with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil

Grew up in Hell, now I dwell, in an Islamic Temple
I'm fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes, you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I'm obsessed

Giving niggaz brain dimples
Dragging they asses on a hook by they temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
'Cause when I kill them, I'm not leavin' one element to autopse

First I'll assassinate 'em
And them I'll cremate them
And take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate 'em

Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones

Can you please explain to this court when these problems first began?

The year 84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil gen
I realize my ideas has spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears

I saw the torture brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair

I got tackled with handcuffs
And shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a Holy Tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks

And sewed my eye lids open, so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt

And nailed my hands, feet to the form of the cross, ah, I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye, refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my face
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape

Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca, carajo, cono
Calm down people, please, calm down
Let us please, proceed with the defendants explanation

Enta the realms of understanding
And take good heed and you could bleed
While I'm standing, three stages of pure hell
Justifications of red cells, rain drops hits the pelv

Path is dull and narrow
You're stalked by a shadow
I pierced your skull with a fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time

Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose
You better hurry
Don't stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry

On your right side there's fire
On you left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor?
It's a claw, took his fucking ass to the fucking core

Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood

Some more, I give you some more
And watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor
Worms that dig your pores

I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain
You can't stand, you're up to your hands in quick sand

You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matta
Stab you with a dagga of Jacob's Ladder

Y'all not ass, y'all titty
y'all style is shitty
How dare you try to represent New York fuckin City
I been down since BVDs and dew rags
shelltops and shags
I was a little badass with regular and tre bags
Always tryin to get shit I never had
'cause times is bad like luck
That's why I don't give a fuck
I dig up my nose and my butt
on the bus or the train
This is for niggas walkin in the rain
listenin to they walkman(e)
talkin the New York fuckin slang

Partial Chorus

Verse Three: Rzarector

In the streets of New York
bullshit walk, green talks
I be the giant on the top of your beanstalk
waving down your flags
jagged grab niggas with bloody rags
holdin fat bags
takin heavy drags
then I add more shells to the mags
Shots goin off you getin caught like tag
The diamond crystal I be rippin up your flesh tissue
and have my pitbull lockin on your bone gristle
Castin shadows in every battle
I rabble words like scrabble
drag your brain through the gravel
at the speed of sound of ryhme travel
Allow me to dabble
with a flow that's infallable
Maintain your order
as words I slaughter
I destroyed a 
whole city like Soddom and Gomorrah
or Babylon
I'm runnin shit like a marathon
Niggas frontin Don
with a set like Frank Avalon

Verse Four: Scientific Shabazz

Shabazz is here to cause panic
Another fuckin madman born to the planet
Sendin niggas to the pearly gates
I'm psyched out
I got screws loose like Norman Bates
Shoot shit up like it's a gallery
Blowin snakes heads off to earn me a salary
Devils choke from the gunsmoke
Once I'm provoked,
I shove a fifth long down ya throat
and let ya taste the steel
Another body unidentified
Shit from the pot is spilled
Ya punk ass'll get out traumaed
I'm swellin devils' melons for my man Farak' Muhammed
Get a crew and try to surround me
and one by one I'll light y'all up
and send ya asses to King's County
Solo pro-morgue supplier
Ya want a nigga bang
Fuck Spenser, 'Bazz for hire

Verse Five: Gatekeeper

Make room the masculine Gatekeeper
kicks suspense in a terrified forms
that keep you warm
You're tensed up
Niggas get wrenched up
on a rock
Mix a whiplash,
bodies are gettin' smashed
So let the volcano blow and erupt
Destruction drift off
Niggas are gettin flipped on
Yeah comin after ya, huh
I only got half a ya
Other part froze in Alaska
While define the feast a high beam
Ghost of a drug fiend
I'm physical dreams
I breathe steam
Thoughts are plutonic
The chronic scripture
angles and riptures
I get ya
Yo, I smash like a comet
Punish tha drain ya

Partial Chorus

Verse Six: Killa Priest

I stalk the face like a leopard
The microphone shepherd
is speakin parables one and two, catch it
The brain counselor, track fertilizer,
the murdalizer
You never heard a wiser
I open heads like the archives
Allow me to explain my brain in the darkside
I strike ya beam 
and watch it gleam
I'm solar,
steadfast, patient like Noah
The rap psycho
be the enlightener
Prey upon the weak and strong I'm the sniper
And light that ass like gasoline
I dig through your chest like a jar of vasoline
I leave your brain regurgitating plancid
until your rhymes are exaperated
I clip up a niggas thoughts
with a pool of zodiac signs
and I slowly attack the mind
The Killa Priest will bend your ideas
I see you cry in fear
There's no surviving here

Yo, this one goes out to Prince Paul, my man Fruitkwan
the Gatekeeper, Prince Rakeem and last but not least
the Grymreaper
[Some motherfucker's out robbin your home (Cypress Hill)]

As your soul enters the next stage
Reality becomes obsolete
You have nothing to fear, nothin to fear
Walking in the shadows you realize
That live is nothing but a fog of animated death
[Grave-diggers!!!]
And to my right it's the one that they call, the Grym Reaper

Verse One: Too Poetic/Grym Reaper

Sparks through the dark, I'm diggin in the dirt
Or diggin in your brains or your skirt
Burying the past is a very hard task
I make loot and now everybody's diggin up dirt
I spark the night like a rasta with reefer
And to my right is the Gatekeeper

Verse Two: Fruitkwan/Gatekeeper

Here comes the one, the one wicked sun from the slums
That's how i do when the Gravedigga crew comes for
example, leaving corpses blissed
half hypnotized with my mark on their wrist
The protecta, spector of death, the selecta
Is the RZA, the RZA, the RZArecta

Verse Three: RZArector/The RZA

The bloody, ferocious, attack, hits the body
Explosive diagnosis, it's fatal like multiple sclerosis
Oh it's, not the hocus-pocus, Gravedigga nigga

I be the sick lunatic with the devilish poem
From the mists of the darkness I come with this
Hittin straight, to the chest, like a Primatene mist
Ryzarector, YAH, the fanatical type
I'm like a bat, in the night, when it's time to take flight
Here I am, in the flesh, and yes I love sess
I'm obsessed, by the sounds, the track possess
Intellectual, killer, special majestical
Ropin up the devils have em hangin from my testicles
Nowhere to run to ba-bay
There's nowhere to hide

Ahh... fuckit! Another day, another ducat
From here to Nantucket MC's kick the bucket
I'm rugged ruff flow-in up till I bust
While other rappers is flatter than a white girl's butt
I manifest my name and the reason I came in the first place
Word shake your brain just like an earthquake
A lot of people admit that I am raw
I cover my ass like a V-I-M, store
My forms are real wicked like Dahmer
A whole mob of a lot of niggaz is like a meal ticket
It's nowhere to run to ba-bay
It's nowhere to hide

Yo
As a child, a bad seed, was on the prowl
Runnin mad wild, cause death was my style
The crazy, maniac, yo lunatic
I circle like a shark when the fresh blood drips
Needles to the pen now you're in
I eat em then I feed em chop chop rippin sheets from your skin
Terror is in, with the RZA and the Grym
Problem one now begins, hah!
Streak up your skull to the sides of a freedom
Record to the meter, so tell me who could be the next one
Gravediggaz complex death oath
And watch King Tee, kill a fuckin note
Here we go, I'm cursed with dawn you was warned
And now, I'm slayin every new firstborn
It's nowhere to run to ba-bay
It's nowhere to hide
It's nowhere to run to ba-bay

Here comes the drastic...[Protect Ya Neck intro]
Just like... a tactic, attack it, attackin, ATTACKIN
I'm wrappin you bastard now prepare your casket
Death is the final step, when y'all step
To intercept, the rep, of a brother, who has kept
His status, stop the madness, that is
I flow just to show that, black, y'all can know that
Me, being wack is like naps on Kojak
Eruptions of volcanoes, o-ccur when I speak
Try to twist my dialect and get caught by tornadoes

Suicide it's a suicide

Suicide it's a suicide

So you want to die, commit suicide
Dial 1-800-Cyanide line
Far as life, yo it ain't worth it
Put a rope around your neck and jerk it

The trick didn't work
Your life was f***ed up from the first day of birth
After watching Jackie Gleason walk into a precinct
Gun down the captain for no f***ing reason

And get some LSD or a drink from the bar
Get behind your wheel and crash the car
Like Desert Storm, got bombs for the war
confront an alligator, let it eat ya raw

Back to the function, riding the caboose to hell
BZZZZZT touched the third rail.
You f***ed up chicken, now you just got fried
Cause it's a suicide

[Chorus]

Hey you little rich kid, what's your beef?
Come and tell the Grym Reaper all of your grief
You asked for a Benz and you only got a Jeep
Your pop's got endz, but yo he's mad cheap

Maybe you're a bastard child you think
Mom and dad are white and you're dark as ink
Maybe you're Sicilian with a tan
But you hate lasagna and the pizza man

Now you stand on the grave digga locked and
You're singing the blues about the rough life you've got
Not
You don't want to live no more

I guess you're really ready for the grave yard tour
When you get home just fill up your windows and you doors
Turn your oven on high for about four hours
Light you a blunt, kiss your a** goodbye
You ga**ed yourself 'cause it's a suicide

[Chorus]

Yep
I've said it before and I'll say it again
Life moves pretty fast
If you don't stop and look around every once in a while

you could miss it
Verse Three: Prince Rakeem/Ryzarector
Six f***ing devils stepped up playing brave God
Had the f***ing nerve to try and enta my grave yard

I'm the Ryzarector, be my sacrifice
Commit suicide and I'll bring you back to life
The first was convinced
Stuck a water hose in his mouth at full blast so his head can explode
Second said hmmmm that's good but I can top it

Put an ax up to his head and then he chopped it
Blood shot out in every direction
The rest didn't know what to do, I made suggestions
Put a slug in your mug, overdose on a drug

Wet your hair stick a knife in the plug
Or be like Richard Pryor set your balls on fire
Better yet go hang yourself with a barbed wire
Three and Four fell deep into spell and

Ran to the zoo, locked themselves in a lion's den
Number Five said it ain't worth being alive
Smoked a dust suede, mixed it with cynaide
The only one to escape was number Six

He went home
Sat in the tub and slit his wrists
Yeah, more graves to dig. Goodbye

There's no way out of the death trap

You can't come back, back
No matter what you do when you fall in a death trap
You can't come back, back
No matter what you do when you fall

Time and time again life?s getting shorter
Fear in the air what appears is the border
A nigga named, Stef, was shootin' up meth
With some coke, had a stroke, so I chilled for his death

Time has arrived, four in one mind
All the sin steppin' in, on my face, there's a grin
Another dumb vic, once moved, now step
Grabbed 'em by the wrist, come to the abyss

Meet Katie, abortion was known with this lady
A Ph.D, many degrees, had Mercedes car
She took it to a bar got lit like a skunk, got drunk
Danced rather bumped

Boom, she took the car to the nigga?s pad
She didn't want to kick it, so the bitch got stabbed
Wrong place and wrong time don't exist no more
Or for according to the Gravedigga law
So watch what you do ?fore a fool talks back
And behold, riding on your shoulder's a death trap, yo

You can't come back, back
No matter what you do when you fall in a death trap
You can't come back, back
No matter what you do when you fall

This crab named Black, brother sell up crack
And it?s a natural fact in his pockets he had stacks
Bad ass beemer he drove 'cause he sold his soul
To get a hold of the chrome and gold

True, he felt good as he walked his hood
Bein' hunted every night like a bear in the woods
See cops play the role of a fox
If they catch your ass out on the block, ock
It?s back to the penalty box

But Black was the type that was like
?Yo fuck the see-cipher, I got to get papes?
Every night, trailed but you came for kills
See-cipher, ain't the only niggaz on the bill

He had like a quarter mil stashed on him
With the click, came through and he blasted' em
So perhaps, you're catchin' mad snap like that
Nigga black, smack but you caught by the death trap

You can't come back, back
No matter what you do when you fall in a death trap
You can't come back, back
No matter what you do when you fall

You can't come back, back
No matter what you do when you fall in a death trap
You can't come back, back

Bitch, she had a body like a Lexus coupe
Her step father was robbin' the cradle, bangin' the boots
Her heartbeat increased at night, she couldn't sleep
Daddy dearest was bringin' her grief between sheets

Deep scars invaded her soul, force and mind
Six years of torture, started at age nine
At age sixteen, already an old maid
Deceived, she was caught like Freddy in a bad dream

Meanwhile her body is being defiled
Tellin' her mother only brought a stage of denial
Moms followed Pop's the low down
Led to a showdown for a week, shit, slowed down

But one night overcome by lust
Father Duke's tried to score just one more thrust
He should've held back, the RZA got an Axe
Gave his dick forty whacks and threw his ass in the death

You can't come back

Or get slapped in the jaw bone
From the megawatts of the raw pone

All over the Mediterranean Seas

Yo, hah yo, rahh, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo...
Yo, I got stress on my brain that causes chest pains
inside the best frames ghetto blood clots is scored by slug shots
and drug spots, well if you're too poor to move out
or get a new house, it's like livin in a war walkin through shootouts
And you doubt God exists, when hard fists
be poundin on your head like jackhammers
You're trapped in the black drama, you hear the laughter
seconds after that you fade out, you're played out, you're laid out
Your heart nearly gave out, you're lucky that you made out
with just a few scars when the beating ends
The streets [sniff] let ya breathe again
But evil men, will soon be on the receiving end
of Universal Law, I'm callin on the meek and the poor
To fight back and never forfeit the day you have to go to war
With forces that are armed upon the seven continental borders
A mental fortress is essentials to absorb this
My sword hits the human orb until it orbits
In the art of war kids see Grym Reap be morbid
Since pieces of the lost civilization in the past
Had my photographs etched inside of pyramids
To laugh at this revelation, without 365 days of concentration
and twenty-four hour meditation, would be foolishly pagan
I'm ancient as 'amen', see I stay Grym
Throwin fools in in a pit full of pit bulls to be shaken
Or strapped to the crossroads of Hell and inner sin
Which trap the sinners in, to sell such in Sing-Sing
I bring Grym tidings, tidal-ed/titled your wave all not exciting
Stop riding the dick, start writin your own shit
Cause I stick figures that think they fat and can't rap wind blast
I make em Slim Fast, lookin like stick figures
I'm all that, I bag chips at concerts and shows
Get more panties than hoes that boost Victoria Secret clothes
Foes is tagged like ex-foes toes at the coroner's
Kids with cold feet rise and fall like the barometer
Grym will mentally chop your career
See shit is locked down here, like penitentiary blocks in tears
Escape outta your ducts every time you hear my name
you better duck fate, or catch a fuckin face full of duct tape
You get smacked like a trick that sniffed off her money
Then smoked like Rzarector with the blunts dipped in honey

Verse Two: Prince Rakeem/Rzarector

Rotate your head like a gyro, my hair grows in knotty spirals
Feet resembles Christ's description from the Bible
Water-walker, immune to all physical torture
Pull out fast in a Porsche, upon a double-crosser
My penis rise up in the morning like a Phoenix
And blast iron cells into a low blooded 'nemic
The imperial - material's venerial
MC's get murdered in serial, you can't fuck with the material
Unorthodox paradox, my shit is seen wide-screen Magnavox
Grabs thought like Doctor Octopus
Cause war like the grandson of Kush
I'm hangin devil's heads on a evergreen bush
Sugar-frosted sorceresses bitches get exhausted
Pussy lips be drippin, like leaky faucets
Undercover see-Cyphers sprayed up like windshield wipers
While I'm guzzlin Piper's, changin my son's shitty-ass diapers
Dime piece trapped in sync like many time piece
You get stampeded by the wildabeast
A rap dast' plus tracks black like Chow Yun Fat
Oppositional forces get their eardrums flat
Common denominator, I swing the mic saber like Vader
He was fooled by the inter-pre-atation made from a traitor
MC's get their wigs blown, trounced off my fistbone
Choked from my death, every time they break a wishbone
Eventually, I knew the whole world would mention me
Potentially, I have the key to make G's
MC's breeze on my tracks, I rock the fruit with the trees
Killa bees spread rapid like diseases
See it's, like the second comin of Jesus, of Nazareth
be fabulous, raise the dead crowd up like Lazarus
Hazardous vocabulary attacks be beautiful
Acoustical notes we provoke, it comes out musically dope
Niggaz realize they just can't cope
The hair, bustin out the head resembles fire and smoke Loc

I blast watts in circuits like General Monk-Monk was Turkish
My science is divided deep into your central nervous
Pervert area codes peep this murder
I'm boxed-in, suckin hologram tits, inhalin oxygen
Parallel world of crab niggas and sea shells mix
I pierce my dick and sword right through you pelvics
I'm hell stricken bomb, wrapped in trees of palm
Physical existence is descendants of Allah
I travel at high rates, Weaker men are primates
That either migrate or get burnt to the stake
I feed off lyrical light beams of amphetimene
My terminology is panatomic like lobotomy
Crazy el loco, gas niggaz like Sunoco
Flush em like Presto, Blast in your chest bone
I raise from the shore, like Sodom and Gomorrah
with traction, flashin a 4-wheel drive Ford Explorer
While mucus lies within the center of the Rubik's
The roots of the wine induced the enzymes inside your nucleus

No handout, I chop your fuckin hand off from the wrist

Inside, they ain't strapped for the ride it's suicide
I spread like a fungus, ran the devil from among us
Let the rain in the days in the valley of Columbus
The all-natural cosmetic, supernatural gi-netic
My genes, by all means, they backpass synthetics

Spawn of a form of neuron who ain't warned of the wicked

Marchin with an army of extra-terrestrial beings
Descended from celestial beings

Wise words that guided missiles, Yacub's blade of steel
Gods use mental pistols and Ezekial's wheel

To an acropolis, twelve armageddon acropolis

Beer is done skunks and fear the other knotty set up
To killers, you faked up niggas shut the hell up

Gravediggaz,"This is the story of three little pigs
And the projected damage that they did, pig number one was white
Thought everything he did was right, the pigology of self
Pink skin terror and wealth, just hogging shit up for self

Rolled up on a pig named swine
A brown skinned pig convinced him they was one of a kind
The swine fell for the short tail
But no way in hell was earth that stale

Stone chicken eggs, hit 'em in the mud that they lay
When it hatched, it was chicks of another shade
The stone age, the origin of aids in the bone age
There was a pig, skin was black
He cleaned up the swine and they filthy acts

If not they was be forced to sent back
But trouble come first, stale shit got worse
Consumers of swine are now cursed
The exile meant from 'Bylon, after three on
The shores of north America's hoof
When they celebrated thanksgiving with the wolf

When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray
When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray

There was a rich man, a poor man, a beggar, and a thief
Now each had a different hustle to get food to eat
The rich man was paid, 'cause the poor man was workin'
Like a slave, he only gave him, minimum wage

The poor man endured this, torture for his four sons
His daughter and his wife, 'cause he sought a better life
His boss laid him off on the 4th of December
He sold sweatshirts and boxer shorts, to keep his fort

Now deep in the winter, he got pneumonia, from a cold
This ended all of the little hustles that he controlled
He was troubled in his soul, he couldn't sleep he wouldn't eat
But by his side was a strong woman, not taking defeat

She pleaded and begged the rich man, for the hubby
Who gave fifteen years of his life, for the company
Conversation was brief, with no relief in sight
Then she unleashed her four sons into the night

They robbed that rich man blind
Then fled over the borderline, escaping with all the cream
But still could not restore the mind see
Life is a dangerous game and it seems cash rule eventually
Authored mentally

When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray
When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray

The rich man's soul turned to dust through the lust
To control as much fluff, his cold heart touched
The old fart grew up, with goals to be the fly kid
With the golden midas, touch

Smokin' dutches that he ignited at will
Usin' hundred dollar bills the big will, up until, he collided
With fate, had a stroke while chokin' on some stake
This was fatal as hell was not bein' able to take his pace
Back to the cradle

Jack and Jill ran up the hill
Jack said, ""I never ran, never will, 'cause I'm from Brownsville""
But still, the living provider, the outsider had beef
With Peter Piper 'cause his girl Goldilox put stocks in his viper

On the yellow brick road he lost control
Got charged for runnin' down the scarecrow, on the loose
Runnin' from hot pursuit, lead by Dr. Seuss
Riding hard on his jock, when Pete got blasted by the keystone cops

When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray
When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray

When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray
When I was young they was feeding me fairytalz
And this goes on until I'm old and gray

Carried the weight for his mom's operation
25 years workin for the train station
Cause he was black the community reacts
Summer tricks, picnic for kids, he gave it back

Last brother to harm or bomb shit

Spillin your plasma on the concrete
Killin the murderer, acts of war
Villains attack the poor
Women and children pack heat now
Growin up I was sad young buck
Dad said ""Son look don't become corrupt""
I knew he really meant well
To see me represent and excel
But yo the torments of hell lay dormant until

I saw the woman I love colored in blood
War is hell, I cut shells, was then covered in mud
As four ships hovered above, my heart griefs
But at least she didn't take the mark of the beast
Rest in peace boo
If I blessed then I'ma meet you on the other side
But for now I gotta slide
Through physical mindfields
Miserable is how my mind feels knowin it's long time to heal
Shit is real
Another black mold in a hole
God rest your soul as you travel back home
I'll carry your essence in the thoughts I'm manifestin
As pleasent memories outshine my depression
My physical stress says it's time to rest
Bein chased by the devil tryin to take my breath

Many warm hugs and soapy back rubs
Candlelight's held tight at the hips every night
My soul is cold boo, I can't abandon ship
Cause of false reactions, I miss you with a passion
Your new being represents a universal mean
So rise like cream black queen
Unfortunately you died in my arms
From a stray bullet from afar
That ripped through the car
My dreams are intense with very little sense
My pretense cracked to find an honor like a track boo
I want to follow in pursuit
What I got to do, what I got to do

Gold armor, surround my body

Golden livin tablets
Transmitted by the Abbot
Blood related king to King David's mighty men
I appear in the atmosphere like nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon

helium, xenon, argon, neon, freon, be gone

The range where sick sounds grave
You can't respond
Dynamic semantics makes your mind go frantic
Hand picked Gods
Razor sharp be my standard
Breakin from bondage and white garments
Eye ball as black as onyx
Hair gonna grow as long as a comet's tail
Escape from Hell
Watch the Gods be real
What makes rain and hail, snow and earthquakes?
Goin through crisis, or mad devices
I thought girls was made of sugar and spices
Always wanted to fuck 'em like Isis
While others bow down, Percival, Cyrus
I'm inside my lab stabbin rhymes on black papyrus
Your weight couldn't measure a snow flake
How you gonna shine on a God while you rotate
I dislocate your head, your neck, your back, your legs, your kneecap
Back smack your ass bitch
And splatter your gall bladder

Terror far beyond the stars of William Shatner
The rattler can't deport on my speed of thought
Then escape New York in East London  or import

Stronger currents than my brains runnin rapid
Hereditary practice pierce hoes through metal jackets

Five stepper grandson of Nefar
The rest of ya'll heffers, thimble
Ya'll resembled Uncle Fester
God biding escape
Through telepathic gates
Integrate, causin one mind to elevate
Stagnate competition, like an earthquake
Causin the earth to shake
On release day, diggin more graves

Freshly picked out the cemetery, bear the plot

Yo, projectiles lace the project ailes
Organic, saw panic when I wreck shit and smile
With more props than New York City got blocks
I cripple your whole knot till your air drip of snot
First encounter of Hell, is facin Grym
Lacin human shells with radiation until cell mutation
Begins to permeate flesh
Like skins bein pressed
And barb wire, steel mesh
As 200 nerve endings record the pain
I cut like the Wu-Tang sword hittin the brain
The main issue for invasion of your brain tissue
Is your dismissal, nigga I reign official
I lack fear like a black bear
Slash your chest area open 
And have the whole world soakin within your hemoglobin
Then blast, your lyrics be on face and astrophysics
You couldn't be your ... if you were Noriega's chemist
Bustin' the mic like Brooklyn fire hydrants in the summer
Bangin like a Forerunner
Lyrically my formula is see-4 to the third power
Of ice, fire, and water
This equation causes manslaughter
Torture upon the microphone
With the type of poem
The strikes like a poem with a baseball bat
Why waste the track, I'm better than all of that!

Chorus 2X",Pit of Snakes
Gravediggaz,"Yo, there's still time

As the door close, the cold wind blows
Down America like the Wall of Jericho
Some will walk the sheet close
Many are called but few are chose

Who knows until the day they be exposed
UFO's surround the globe
The world is prepared to explode
So I grab hold of the North Pole

Not tryin' to meet the lost soul, at the crossroad
We're bein' sucked up into the black hole
Young becomes old, mighty clouds roll
Unfold the scrolls that were foretold, by the forefathers

The end of the world saga, streets flooded with lava
Mommas and papas, toddlers, hip-hoppers, and rastas
Rock stars and mobsters, above streets in helicopter
Filled with doctors readin' the death roster

Guts spillin' out like pasta, sky, misty, often tipsy
From off the whiskey, the gypsy, told me, my chances, were risky
Cops, pull up and frisk me but never could they get me, too shifty
I will go, into my dungeon, and summon up the second comin'

People started runnin', aliens with hair like Rastafarians
Captured, placed inside of aquariums, studied by scientists
This is it, 'The Apocalypse', I see the mother ship above the cliff
Over Egypt, it made me sea sick, I see the eclipse
And the abyss, the night shifts

It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

The archangel imprison my soul into a prism
Usin' cell division and molecular collision within me
He listen and analyze the heartbeat and rhythms
Of children livin' brutalized

My ears became used to the vibes of ruined lives
Sounds in the chamber I was hidden in
Was so spine-tinglin' I was tremblin'
Envisionin' the fear, here within a new millennium

Where rain became toxic, the air's stale and noxious
Comets hit co-ops with force that made blocks split
Flocks tried to escape a fate that made even hard rocks slide
As nuclear dropped out of the sky, causin' burns too severe

For hydro peroxide and sodium oxide, deep down outta basements
Fish turned lopsided and upside down from atomic face lifts
Through the blackness I saw John the Baptist, on the atlas
Holdin' the masters to my Psalm under his arm

But long before I even wrote 'em
23 elders each wrote me a Psalm
And placed them within my motor neurons
It contained the approximate date of, 'The Apocalypse'

Deposited in scripts of the 20th century prophets
The clock ticks, tick, tick, tick upon the land borders
I count down the manslaughter
Military camcorders under ocean waters

Red October causin' fish to grow arms, legs, tits
And double heads, mutating the eggs as the radiation spreads
Over the water beds, I watch Mother Nature as she bled
Grym, was placed in skin casing to begin lacing hymns

Through the basement, won't be no escapin'
From the South to the North
Where you run ten paces and your face is fallin' off

It's repentance day
It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Raised in Hell, waitin' for angels like Rafael
Comin' from space to trace, they race
Thrown in jail cells I had a purpose since
The sperm cell, to bail out and get braille

For the blinded children in Israel
Kids kill forget the bill
For, dollar bills and drug deals by the mayor
Controls the people livin' legal

Sit back and chill, until time will reveal
Two thousand and one holy men with force fields
Levitatin' space ships, earthquake hits, United States splits
Projects turn to snake pits

Secrets of the Masons came to revelations
Babylon destroyed by the nations aggravations
Riots in the train stations, criminals grabbin' cops
Snakes rattlin', angels draggin'

Seven head dragons out the Roman empire
Surrounded with fire, liars in the Pentagon
Drop their nuclear bombs, ran, panic
But still, was trapped on the planet

Died before the mother ship landed
Only the chosen ones understand it, some can't
'Cause of TV brain damage, no time to be romantic
This day your independence and repentance, pentance, pentance

""Now I see the light, my whole life is moving in one direction
I see that now, there never has been any choice for me""

Repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Did you repent today?
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

As long as you got mentally dead people
Who are living in a mental death
Meaning living in a mental grave
you need somebody to dig that grave up and bring them back to life
There's no chance for a physical dead
but there's chance for the mentally dead
(Yo, one two one two two)
So we gonna come and resurrect them
That's why they call me the Ryzarector
I'm out to resurrect the mental dead, by diggin up they graves
Bringin em back to the surface

Niggaz is caught up in the midst of six
You better grab ahold of your crucifix
And this is it, the black God exists
Can you understand this?  Let me teach you a lesson, yo
The pre-existence of the mathematical biochemical equations
The manifestations of God, Earth Air Fire and Water
which are in it's basic formation, solid liquid and gases
that caused the land masses, and the space catalyst
and all matter that exists and is dense
Third dimension, that must be observed through physical comprehension
It takes a nerve to be struck, wisdom is the wise
poet spoken to wake up, the dumb who've been sleeping
The fourth dimension is time, it goes inside the mind
Run the channels energized up through the back of your spine
So observe as my G energy strikes a vital nerve
One swerve of the tongue it pierces like a sword through the lung
Have you not heard, that words kill as fast as bullets
when you load negative thoughts, to the chamber of your brain
And your mouth pulls the trigger that propels
wickedness straight from Hell
From the pits of your stomach where negativity dwell
I searched the East coast and West coast down and most found
the small towns is like ghost towns, everybody moves slowed down
From Uptown to Bucktown give a fuck now Shaolin gots the crown
And cops'll still serve you from Jamaica Ave. to Myrtle
And cats carry more shells than turtles
Brooklyn Down Park Hill pussies unfertile
Buy wholesale never retail get females in deep spells
If you eat well, you sleep well
Send enemies to Hell
What makes hair skin epidermis fingernail
Regenerate, when everything else disintegrate
A teflon vest so bullets can't penetrate
On the corner of my block there stood this old man
A black immigrant from the land of Sudan
Who used to tell stories to the children in the building
But never had a dollar to keep his pocket filled in
He bombed he knew Deuteronomy the science of Astronomy
But didn't know the basic principles of economy
I say the wise man don't play the role of a fool
The first thing a man must obtain is Twelve Jewelz
Knowledge Wisdom Understanding to help you achieve
Freedom, Justice Equality Food Clothing and Shelter
After this, Love Peace and Happiness
He had the nappiest head, I told him total satisfaction
is to achieve one goal in the scheme of things
He who works like a slave, eats like a king",Twelve Jewelz [RZA Solo]

Hoverin the projects, spotlight shinin bright

Snaps your head inside the bear trap

Like trains in the night

Before I turned inwards and forced her to fly

Melt into the thin air

And he would say trust is a hard thing to come by these days
And you have no idea just how it will feel until it happens for real
You have no idea how bad it will feel until it happens for real

Never crossed the line
Try to hide the filth inside
All to be forgiven

Are you still alive?
All dried up and scarred inside
Save yourself in time
Can I ask you
Are you still alive?
Crawl into your little world
Leaving yourself naked
Smashing up the innocence
To watch the flower die
Idle hands that make no plans
Will never make perfection set in stone or made of clay
When I ask you
Are you still alive?
All dried up and scarred inside
Save yourself in time
Can I ask you, are you still alive?
You found your world is made of glass
A bitter pill to swallow
Looking through the cellophane
That used to be your eyes
Try to hide the filth inside
Can you be forgiven?

Are you still alive?
All dried up and scarred inside
Save yourself in time

Because you're always slipping away from me

Because you're always slipping away from me

So violently to touch, I'm anything

Because you're always slipping away from me

Because you're always slipping away from me

Your cup of life is overflowing
There to catch the fall
Bending down to kiss the sorrow
So silently to touch, it's tearing me down
Innocently to clutch, I'm feeling so weak

And the sky is grey

By the stone that bears her her name

And flickers like a candle

I go back to linger
In a life not long ago

To a girl I loved
And rooms I remember
Just like a ghost who is lost
I'm wandering through
My heart is aching
With a thousand joys and sorrows
In my sleep
In my dreams
I call her name

And flickers like a candle
Still the spirit of love
Forever stays the same

Tonight I felt the summer ending
In the darkness, ever softly
She slipped on by
Down in the field
At the four roads crossing
I watched the flashing
Last blue stars of the fireflies
I stood there on the ground
Where my ancestors lay sleeping
In this land
They lived and loved

That's how they showed their honour and their pride;
They said it was a sin and shame and they winked at one another

Kelly and his gang came tearing down the street
They went into an empty room and a bottle of whiskey stole
They put the bottle with the corpse to keep that whiskey cold

Think I need you (Margarita)

Take your time, dance real slow
Remember that song from the radio
Got your old man's, got a place to go
Cause we all need a little temptation

Those two big fellas are looking for a fight
It's what they like to do on a Saturday night
Maybe it's the alcohol, maybe it's the lights
But they just want to get your attention

Talk to me , baby, it's all right
I might look strange, but I don't bite
And if you let me hold your hand
I can find a way to make you understand

Called last call, now it's time to go
But I'm not the guy who gets to walk you home
We could have made history, I guess we'll never know
I'll see you in dreams

And he keeps a little grocery store, the ancients name is Brown
And he has a lovely daughter, such a treat I never saw
Oh I only hope someday to be the old man's son-in-law.

Well, Old Brown he sells from off his shelf most anything you please
He's got juice tarts for the little boys, lollipops and cheese
And his daughter minds the store, and it's a treat just to see her serve
I'd like to run away with her but I don't have the nerve

And it's old Brown's daughter is a proper sort of girl,
Old Brown's daughter is a fair as any pearl
I wish I were a Lord Mayor, a Marquis or and Earl
And blow me if I wouldn't marry old Brown's girl.
Blow me if I wouldn't marry old Brown's girl.

Well, poor old Brown now has trouble with the gout,
He grumbles in his little parlor when he can't get out
Oh and when I make a purchase, lord, and she hands me the change
That girl she makes pulverized, I feel so very strange

But Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly when I say a tender word
Ah but old brown says that she must wed a Marquis or a Lord,
And I don't suppose it's ever one of those things I will be
But by jingo next election I will run for Trinity

Great Big Sea,"From a barge in the harbor I went roaming on shore 
And stepped into a pub where I was oft times before 
And as I was sitting and enjoying my glass 
Who chanced to walk in but a young Spanish lass 

She sat down beside me and kept squeezing my hand 
Saying 'Sir you're a stranger not long to this land' 
Will you roam, Johnny Sailor, would you roam along with me 
To some lonesome spot where nobody can see 

[Chorus]
Don't you leave me Johnny Sailor' were the words she did cry 
Waving and weeping and wiping her eyes 
When you reach home in your own Newfoundland 
Think of the young Spaniard who kept squeezing your hand 

I quickly consented with her for to roam 
She lived by herself in a neat little home 
She was brisk, plump and jolly and her age scare 19 
And the name of that maiden I think was Irene 

One fine summer's morning our ship, she set sail 
And down by the seashore lovely Irene she came 
Waving her pocket handkerchief and wiping her eyes 
Don't leave me Johnny Sailor' were the words she did cry 

[Chorus]

I'll give you farewell love on a fine summer's breeze 
But love don't forget me when you're crossing the sea

You can't believe you're broken heart will ever mend
But every mountain has its faces that'd make you want to stop
On this so unwelcome journey from the bottom to the top

Move along
I believe there's Something Beautiful to see
Move along
I believe there's Something Beautiful
Just waiting for you and me

I know you'll never count the tears you've cried
Though you've asked a million questions
No one could tell you why
A single soul is chosen to be the one put to the test
But there will be some consolation for a heart that never rests

The years will make us older
The winters make us colder
And there's one more thing I've come to know for sure
There's no bitterness that smolders, no chip on any shoulder
That a random act of kindness couldn't cure

[Chorus]",Something Beautiful
Great Big Sea,"She doesn't see the coming fall
She doesn't show no fear at all
Bring on autumn moon or the driving rain
I only hope I see her face again

[Chorus]
Everything is gonna be alright when summer comes
The darkest stars will burn so bright when summer comes
We will open up our bodies to the warming of the sun
When summer comes

I will wait in the silence until she returns
To melt the frozen prison round this fool who never learns
Every living thing that's born must have its end
What winter takes away, spring brings back again

[Chorus]
Summer doesn't feel the coming frost
And she doesn't yield to pain or loss
Death where is thy victory where is thy string
When every year we hear the birds of summer sing

[Chorus]",Summer
Great Big Sea,"Wake up
Without a care
Your head's not heavy, your conscience clear
Sins are all forgiven here
Yours and mine
Fear is gone without a trace
It's the perfect time in the perfect place
Nothing's hurting, nothing's sore
No one suffers anymore
The doctor found a simple cure
Just in time

All these things if I were king
Would all appear around me
The world will sing when I am king
The world will sing when I am king

Oh, she walks right in
She don't even knock
It's the girl you lost to the high school jock
She shuts the door, turns the lock
And she takes your hand
She says she always felt a fool
For picking the captain over you
She wonders if you missed her
Said she always told her sister
Oh, that you're the best damn kisser
That she's ever had

All these things if I were king
Would appear around me
The world will sing when I am king
The world will sing when I am king

Daylight waits to shine until the moment you awaken
So you never miss the dawn
No question now, you know which road you're taking
Lights all green, the radio plays just the perfect song

Well, the war's been won
All the fights are fought
You find yourself in just the spot
It's a place where everybody's got a song to sing
Just like the final movie scene
The prince will find his perfect queen
The hero always saves the world
The villains get what they deserve
The boy will always get the girl
When I am king",When I Am King
Great Big Sea,"When I was a lad in a fishing town
Me old man said to me
You can spend your life, your jolly life
Just sailing on the sea
You can search the world for pretty girls
Til your eyes are weak and dim
But don't go searching for a mermaid, son
If you don't know how to swim

'Cause her hair was green as seaweed
Her skin was blue and pale
Her face it was a work of art
I love that girl with all my heart
But I only like the upper part
I did not like the tail

I signed onto a sailing ship
My very first day at sea
I seen a mermaid in the waves
A-reaching out to me
Come live with me in the sea, said she
Down on the ocean floor
And I'll show you a million wondrous things
You've never seen before

So over I jumped and she pulled me down
Down to her seaweed bed
And a pillow made of a tortoise shell
She placed beneath my head
She fed me shrimp and caviar
Upon a silver dish
From her head to her waist
It was just my taste
But the rest of her was a fish

'Cause her hair was green as seaweed
Her skin was blue and pale
Her face it was a work of art
I love that girl with all my heart
But I only like the upper part
I did not like the tail

But then one day she swam away
So I sang to the clams and the whales
Oh, how I miss her seaweed hair
And the silver shine of her scales
But then her sister, she swam by
Set my heart awhirl
'Cause her upper part was an ugly fish
But her bottom part was a girl

Yes her hair was green as seaweed
Her skin was blue and pale
Her legs they are a work of art
I love that girl with all my heart
And I don't give a damn about the upper part
'Cause that's how I get my tail",The Mermaid
Great Big Sea,"Is it just me, or a message from above?
Bells are ringing, push has finally come to shove.
The door before me now is open just enough.

And I'm sick and tired of waiting for dreams that never come,
And games I never played in, but still wish that I had won...

I'm alive, I've got one shot and I'm taking it to you.
I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon
That this is my one small step, this is my walk on the moon.

Don't you think their hands were shaking as that rocket ship touched down?
I'm sure they shivered when they finally touched the ground.
And the giant leap so fragile that it hardly made a sound...
But it must have been amazing what a world they got to see.
So I don't care, my foolish fear won't get the best of me now

I'm alive, I've got one shot and I'm taking it to you.
I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon
That this is my one small step this is my walk on the moon.
This is my walk on the moon.

Oh it must have been amazing, what a world they got to see!
So I don't care, my foolish fear won't get the best of me now...

I'm alive, I've got one shot, and I'm taking it to you.
I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon...
I'm alive, I've got one shot, and I'm taking it to you.
I'm alive, I've come to realize, not a moment too soon 
That this is my one small step,
This is my one small step, 
This is my walk on the moon.
This is my walk on the moon.
This is my walk on the moon.

Great Big Sea,"There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari-Mac

A bumble bee stung me right above the knee

Great British Jazz Band,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

And I don't know why, I let that mean woman make me a fool

Great Caesar's Ghost,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you get's me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

I can feel you breathe
Washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way",Bertha
