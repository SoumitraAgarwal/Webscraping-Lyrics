Henry Mancini,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic
Henry Mancini,"If you're feeling fancy free,
Come wander through the world with me,
And any place we chance to be, 
Will be a rendezvous.

Two for the road,
We'll travel through the years, 
Collecting precious memories,
Selecting souvenirs 
And living life the way we please.

In the summertime the sun will shine,
In winter we'll drink summer wine,
And any day that you are mine, 
Will be a lovely day.

As long as love still wears a smile,
I know that we'll be two for the road,
And that's a long long while.",Two for the Road
Henry Mancini,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",The Second Time Around
Henry Mancini,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Henry Mancini,"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you 
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
 
A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
(You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer)

If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
You'll never know if you don't know now",You'll Never Know
Henry Mancini,"What is a youth
Impetuous fire
What is a maid
Ice and desire
The world wags on
A rose will bloom
It then will fade
So does the youth

So does the fairest maid
Comes a time when one sweet smile
Hasn't seasoned for awhile
Then loves in loves with me
Some they only think to marry
Other will tease and terry
Mine is the very best perry
Cupid he rules us all
Caper the caper sing me the song
Death will come soon to hush us along
Sweeter than honey,bitter than gull
Love is the past time that will never pull
Sweeter than honey, bitter than gull
Cupid he rules us all

A rose will bloom,it then will fade
So does the youth,so does the fairest maid",Love Theme
Henry Mancini,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
Henry Mancini,"Do ya hear that whistle down the line?
I figure that it's engine number forty nine
She's the only one that'll sound that way
On the Atchison, Topeka And The Santa Fe
 
See the old smoke risin' 'round the bend
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend
Folks around these parts get the time of day
From The Atchison, Topeka And The Santa Fe

Here she comes
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hey, Jim you'd better get the rig
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
She's got a list o' passengers that's pretty big

And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel
'Cause lots o' them been travelin' for quite a spell
All the way from Philadelphiay
On The Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

All aboard, all aboard

Henry Mancini,"If I could hold you in the arms of love tonight
I'd never let you go
As the hours go by I'd show you why we've waited for this
As two lovers whisper low

If I could feel that magic kiss your lips invite
Imagine the joys I'd know
The day has died away, let's find a hideaway
And share the promise of a new tomorrow
In the arms of love tonight

The day has died away, let's find a hideaway
And share the promise of a new tomorrow
In the arms of love tonight

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
",In the Arms of Love [Vocal Version]
Henry Mancini," The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play 
Through a meadow land toward a closing door 
A door marked ""nevermore"" that wasn't there before 

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories 
Of the golden smile that introduced me to 
The days of wine and roses and you 

(The lonely night discloses) just a passing breeze filled with memories 
Of the golden smile that introduced me to 
The days of wine and roses and you-oo-oo ",Experiment in Terror (Twist)
Henry Mancini,"Make believe you're in a jungle movie
Watch the baby elephants go by
The beat is groovy
It's a brand new dance you ought to try
Come to the jungle and see the animal attraction
Baby elephants in action walk

See the big baboon beat on the bongo
As the baby elephants advance
Down in the Congo
All the swinging monkeys do this dance
Come to the jungle and see the animal attraction
Baby elephants in action walk

If you plan on joining a safari
Don't get dressed for going on a cruise
The thing to carry is an extra pair of dancing shoes

Henry Mancini,"How soon will I be seeing you?
How soon?
I wish I really knew
When will I be hearing 
Words I want to hear?
Pretty little love words 
Whispered in, my ear

How soon will I be seeing you
And dance the way we used to do?
I see the starlight gleaming
Forgive me if I'm dreaming
Tell me, honey, now
How soon?

And when will I be hearing
Words I want to hear?
Pretty little love words
Whispered in, in my ear
How soon will I be seeing you
And dance the way we used to do?

I see the starlight gleaming
Forgive me if I'm dreaming
Tell me, honey, now
How soon?

I see the starlight gleaming
Forgive me if I'm dreaming
Tell me, honey, now
How soon?",How Soon (Theme Song)
Henry Mancini,"When you're standing alone
With the mountains and the sea
Where the arms of the world open wide
Where the truth is as plain as the falling rain
And as sure as the time and the tide

You know we're all His children
His next of kin, that's the way it began
No matter where you're going or where you've been
You're part of the family of men

When you walk down the road
And the sun is on your side
With the sweet river breeze for your face
Where you don't hear a sound as you look around
Everything sort of falls into place

You know we're all His children
His next of kin, that's the way it began
No matter where you're going or where you've been
You're part of the family of men

You know we're all His children
His next of kin, that's the way it began
No matter where you're going or where you've been
You're part of the family of men
",All His Children
Henry Mancini,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Henry Mancini,"Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend

",Charade (Opening Titles)
Henry Mancini,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me",Dream a Little Dream of Me
Henry Mancini,"Often I think this sad old world is whistling in the dark. 
Just like a child, who, late from school 
Walks bravely home through the park. 

To keep their spirits soaring and keep the night at bay. 
Neither quite knowing which way they are going, 
They sing the shadows away. 

Often I think my poor old heart has given up for good. 
And then I see a brand new face, 
I glimpse some new neighborhood. 

So walk me back home, my darling, tell me dreams really come true. 
Whistling whistling here in the dark with you. 

Often I think my poor old heart has given up for good. 
And then I see a brand new face, 
I glimpse some new neighborhood. 

So walk me back home, my darling, tell me dreams really come true. 
Whistling whistling here in the dark with you.","Whistling Away the Dark [From ""Darling Lili""]"
Henry Mancini,"I love you,
Hums an april breeze,
I love you,
Echo the hills!

I love you,
The golden dawn agrees,
As once more she sees,
Daffodils!

It's spring again,
And birds on the wing again,
Start to sing again,
The old melodies!

I love you,
That's the song of songs,
And it all belongs,
To you and me

I love you . . .

And it all belongs,
To you and me.
And it all belongs,

Henry Mancini,"I'm in Dreamsville, holding you
A dreamy view, just we two alone
If love in Dreamsville, time is new
We're here to love and we do

We can see the rest of the world
Below us from our pink cloud

There's no boundary to this magic land
As we go exploring hand in hand
In dreamy Dreamsville
Far away and here we love
Here we stay

There's no boundary to this magic land
As we go exploring hand in hand
In dreamy Dreamsville
Far away and here we love
Here we stay",Dreamsville [From Peter Gunn]
Henry Mancini,"Young lonesome soldier
Sleeping in the rain
Far from home
Half a child
Half a hero

Someone's son
Someone's lover
Dream that your someday child
Never knows the rain",Soldier in the Rain

Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me

But I still feed the flame

In the night

You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil

Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance

Preying deep from within
Come take me in

But I still feed the flame

You know I want your touch of evil

The day may be
Wait until dark
And we'll be warm

Together
Where our fantasies take form

When I can't feel your nearness 
In the night
My disappointments disappear

A cheerless day may bring us
Little dreams
That seem to miss their mark
But oh my darling

From the wreckage of humiliation
I got my self respect
I pulled myself together
What the hell did you expect
You should see the pain I go through
When I see myself I see you
Everything that you did I do
When I see myself I see you
Rage

I'm just like you
My flesh isn't my flesh
My blood isn't my blood",Just Like You
Henry Rollins,"When no one will listen and time won't wait
When you see yourself and see the one that you hate
When the night lasts forever and time stands still
When you see yourself and want to kill
When the world doesn't fit the head on your shoulders
When you punch the walls and feel the world's fist
The big ideas you have leave you feeling so small
I can see it in your eyes you can't deal with it all

What do you do when you want to get over
What do you do when you want to get through
What do you do when you just can't take it
What do you do when you just can't fake it anymore

Feel the pressure
Feel it squeeze
The eyes in your head
The heart in your chest
Where's the answer
Where's the release
What do you do

When the lies that they told and the price that you paid
Force you to see the mistake that you made
When they shake your hand and stab your back
When frustration paints your four walls black
When they pick you up and let you fall
When you find their something is nothing at all
When ends miss ends and the endlessness sends you
Down to the bottom of the drain in pain
When you're pushed to the edge and can't maintain",What Do You Do
Henry Rollins,"I know you
You are too short
You had bad skin
You couldn't talk to them very well
Words didn't seem to work
They lied when they came out of your mouth
You tried so hard to understand them
You wanted to be part of what was happening
You saw them having fun
And it seemed like such a mystery
Almost magic
Made you think there was something wrong with you
You'd look in the mirror trying to find it
You thought you were ugly
And everyone was looking at you
So you learned to be invisible
To look down
To avoid conversation
The hours, days, weekends
Ah the weekend nights alone
Where were you?
In the basement?
In the attic?
In your room?
Working some job?
Just to have something to do?
Just to have a place to put yourself?
Just to have a way to get away from them
A chance to get away from the ones who made you feel so strange and
Ill-at-ease inside yourself
Did you ever get invited to one of their parties?
You sat and wondered if you would go or not
For hours you imagined the scenarios that might transpire
They would laugh at you
If you'd know what to do
If you would had the right things on
If they' d notice you came from a different planet
Did you get all brave in your thoughts?
Like you were going to go in there and deal with it
And have a great time
Did you think that you might be the life of the party?
That all these people were going to talk to you
To find out that you were wrong
That you had a lot of friends and you weren't so strange after all
Did you end up going?
Did they mess with you?
Did they single you out?
Did you find out you were invited because they thought you were so weird

Yeah, I think I know you
You spent alot of time full of hate
A hate as pure as sunshine
A hate that saw for miles
A hate that kept you up at night
A hate that filled your every waking moment
A hate that carried you for a long time

Yes, I think I know you
You couldn't figure out what they saw in the way they lived
Home was not home
Your room was home
A corner was home
The place they weren't
That was home

I know you
You're sensitive and you hide cuz you fear getting stepped on one more time
It seems that when you show a part of yourself 
That is the least bit vulnerable someone takes advantage of you
One of them steps on you
They mistake kindness for weakness
But you know the difference
You've been the brunt of their weakness for years
And strength is something you know a bit about
Because you had to be strong to keep yourself alive

You know yourself very well you now
And you don't trust people
You know them too well

You try to find that special person
Someone you can be with
Someone you can touch
Someone you can talk to
Someone you wont feel so strange around
And you found that they don't really exist
You feel closer to people on movie screens

Yeah, I think I know you
You spend a lot of time day dreaming
And people have made comment to that affect
Telling you that your self involved and self centered
But they don't know do they?
About the long night shifts alone
About the years of keeping yourself company
All the nights you wrapped your arms around yourself so you could imagine someone holding you
The hours of indecision, self doubt,
The intense depression
The blinding hate the rage that made you stagger
The devastation of rejection

Well, maybe they do know
But if they do they sure do a good job of hiding it
It astounds you how they can be so smooth
How they seem to pass through life
As if life itself was some divine gift
And it infuriates you to watch yourself 
With your apparent skill in finding every way possible to screw it up
For you life is a long trip
Terrifying and wonderful
Birds sing to you at night
The rain and the sun
The changing seasons are true friends
Solitude is a hard won allie
Faithful and patient

Yeah I think I know you",I Know You
Henry Rollins,"I should have seen my end coming from a long way off
My friend said man she`ll give you the blues, don`t get caught
But I went ahead and told myself a bunch of lies
And spent night after hammered night getting back my mind

I am a fool when I think I need you
I`m a fool to believe
My heart is so wide open
I`m so easy to deceive
I`m a fool I`ll keep believing
Like a fool I`ll believe it all
I`m a fool who`ll keep on coming
And like a fool, I will crawl

I waste time in my mind thinking of you - I`m a fool I know
And it hurts to take the pain over and over - I`m a fool I know
I keep wrecking myself when I should be healing my wounds
I`m a fool I know
Self mutilation is the only thing that I know - I`m a fool I know

I've watched your front teeth sharpen and I`ve felt your muscles flex
You have the kind of eyes that turn mere mortals into wrecks
I know first hand so well all the hard times you direct
Seduced rejected reduced ejected again",Fool
Henry Rollins,"If I listened to everything that they said to me 
I wouldn`t be here
And if I took the time to bleed from all the tiny little arrows shot my way 
I wouldn`t be here
The ones who don`t do anything are the ones who try to put you down
You could spend your entire life in the nowhere land of self doubt
When you start to doubt yourself
The real world will eat you alive

It`s time to align your body with your mind
It`s hero time
It`s time to align your body with your mind
It`s time to shine

I`m talking to you
Hero time starts right now
If you think you`ve got 100 extra years to mess around you`re wrong
This time is real. Your time is now
It`s hero time

Hard times are getting harder
The liars are acting strong
You better get a grip on yourself
Or you won`t be around too long

No such thing as spare time
No such thing as free time
No such thing as down time
All you got is life time
Go!

I got grace in times of friction
I got truth in times of fiction
I got no time for the hype
Suicide? I`m not the type

No time for drug addiction
No time for smoke and booze
Too strong for a shortened life span
I`ve got no time to lose",Shine
Henry Rollins,"I`m so tired of myself
I`m tired in my sleep
I`m so tired of my lies
I`m tired of the secrets that I keep
I`m so tires of looking inside myself
Trying to find something
I`m getting tired

And I know I need something
Because the grind is burning me out
I don`t want to hurt one of them
But I`ll do it
I`m getting tired

I`m so tired of the things that I hear
I`m so tired of the things that I fear
I`ve never seen the end so clear
I`m getting tired

I know I need something to make me live
Because the grind is pounding me down
I don`t want to kill one of these walking insects
But I`ll do it
I`m getting tired",Tired
Henry Rollins,"I`m a monster
Walking these streets
Crawling these walls
Whatever it takes to get to you 

It all starts and ends with you
Sometimes you hurt me but it`s true
Don`t want to love you but I do 

I`m a monster
You touch me deep inside
Monster, monster from you I cannot hide 

I`m a monster
No need to fear me
Crawl into my cave with me
Don`t let this time go wasted 

And I`m burning
Burning hard, burning real
Doing anything to feel

Something`s gonna break before I`m done
Doing damage sounds like fun
Let`s go out, let`s go get some",Monster
Henry Rollins,"I've been around
Turned around
Made to see
New eyes burning in my head
Color bends
Liar friends
New eyes seeing the black and white
Ripped away
Burned away
Strength and beauty live
In the black and white
Black and white
Can't hide bright light
Shining through the darkest night


In the black and white

new eyes
Hate lies
Sun blind
Everything to see
Sun light
Blind light
Burned hollow
Burned clean
Everything to see
Find light
In dark
Blind eyes see
All the colors lie
I'm an only man

The lies hurt my mind so I think you understand
Color driven madness was all I used to see
Lving in the black and white
Breathing in the black and white
Being what there is to be
Seeing what there is to see
Is the only thing left for me
I'm living free in the black and white
Colors lie
Try to hide
You can't hide
In the black and white

But I still love rock and roll

I got my angel raising kicks I'm raising hell just like I did I'v got a lot of crazy friends you forgive me of my sins can't take it with you when you're gone but I want enough to get there on and I am never growing old

The workday passes like molasses in wintertime

I'm getting paid by the hour and older by the minute

I'd love to call him something, but I think I'll just call it a day

Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

Well this lunchbreak is gonna take all afternoon
And half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's alright
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone is for me you can tell 'em I just sailed away

It's only half past twelve but I don't care

I sleep eighty miles an hour
To the whining of a diesel down the interstate
Dreamin' 'bout my little girls

Shower up and do just what we came to do
Sing for the people
Count the money and the miles back home to you

With a six-piece band and a guitar in my hand
Singin' songs about my life
All the good times and the bad

And head somewhere I've already been
Then I lay down in that double bed alone
And I thank the lord again

I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost, it's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

You said time was all you really needed
So I walked away and let you have your space
Leaving didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face

And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance, I'd lie again

Just to see you smile

Been running round my brain
Says it may drive me insane

Looked up right at her

A new thought came to me

Far away, far away.

Then I must go, and you must stay.
So, Mary, marry me, let's not wait.

Love me now, for now is all the time there may be.

Teardrops glad you dropped by cause you can help me to drown my pride
And since you're here the time just seems to fly
To let you know you're gonna be with me till I lose my mind

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

I wish this love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That this dollar sign whould be keeping us apart
But you know I love you yes I love you oh how I love you

And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this world had not yet crossed our minds
For the answer could be found in children's nursery rhymes
And I'd come running back to youand I'd come running back to you

No you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent got to leave you all alone

Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors twenty-four sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train rolls out of Kankakee

Rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names switchyards full of old black men
Of graveyards full of rusted automobiles
Good morning America how are you

Said don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Playin' card games with an old man on the club car
Many a point no one's keepin' score
Pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels a rumblin' neath the floor

And the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep rockin' to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning America how are you...

Well it's night time on the City of New Orleans

And sometimes it's hard to tell the foolish from the wise

Waitin' patient by the Chinaberry tree
With her feet already dusty from the pathway to the levee
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees
And I'd paid her no attention as she tagged along beside me
Trying hard to copy everything I did
But I couldn't keep from smiling when I'd hear somebody saying
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid

Even after we grew older we could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holding hands
For as surely as the seasons she was changing to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man
And she often lay beside me in the coolness of the evening
Till the morning sun was shining on my bed
And at times when she was sleeping I would smile when I'd remember
How they used to call us Jody and the kid

Now the world's a little older and the years have changed the river
'Cause there's houses where they didn't used to be
And on Sunday I go walking down the pathway to the levee

there's no one but you

Dizzy, babe, the way you got me tripping
Got me so amazed
No one can do the things you do
Like the way you be kissing on my body
Boy, there ain't nobody
Exclusive?s what you are to me

[Chorus]

(No one else) No one else (In my life) in my life
(On my heart, on my mind)
(I hope you feel) I hope you feel (The way that I do)
I do
Exclusive me and you

I pick 'em all up in hoopties
But honey is bad, so tonight it's the Coupe I whip
And I usually come dirty, but tonight I'm fresh
Come and throw on some exclusive shit
It might sound like vanity
But mami's bad, I swear to God I think I'm losing my sanity
Picked her up in the Porsche, skipped off to a yacht
Came back and had dinner at the ?

And I'm cool on these honeys
And all of her friends hate when I come around
Cause they know money's involved, the Coupe or the
truck
23 and 20s involved
Might rain all day and be sunny tomorrow
But nobody could love you the way I do
Always do the right thing, or at least try to
But the way I put it on you is exclusive, ma
So all that talk that your friends do is useless, ma

In hopes to learn my name
We all have lives that we must leave some are great and some are weak
I'm somewhere in between

I used to think the world was round until I filled my head with sound
And pictures of a place where I was good and wrong was right
And nothing kept me up at night except the songs we made

Now I think that I have had a change of heart
I see my end has been here from the start
It's art

I see my future from the corner of my eye

Is it all in my head?
These ghosts in the hall ways, and mirrors, and under my bed

In each town I find there's always a graveyard near by
I'm taking here home
That girl from Glasgow whose father just left her alone

And I was moved inside that crooked room
I reached out my hand and shyly asked her to dance
She cried as we swayed and in my head that song continues to play
The saddest melody that just won't go away

And in my mind she's fully real
A little voice that helps me feel
And if they thought I was crazy then
Wait until they meet my friend ",Lydia

We didn't get along
And when I stop to think about it
I guess we were the same
Too stubborn to apologize
Too filled up on rage

I wish she felt young again
When everything was new
When her father held her hand
And said, ""There's nothing you can't do""

Right On Christmas day
It said, ""Your grandmother is dying
In a painful way

She'll make it 'til next week""

Right before I moved

I hope she hears her husband's voice
Telling her she's coming home

Like a line of poetry
Or a fucking fit of honesty
I'll do my best to keep you, keep you sleepy as the south
With my old watch on your wrist
And my thumbs inside your mouth
Suck on my fingertips until you kill all my prints
So your boyfriend has no clue
Of how much I've been touching you

My problem with me is my problem with you
It doesn't take much
For me to come unglued
I put my headphones on
And hear your favorite songs
And it kills me to know
That this won't be one of them

You know it saves me to think even for a little while
I owned the set of shoulders that you came to rely on
Like in that movie theater when you whispered in my ear
I almost didn't make it
This has been my hardest year
Your job is killing you faster than a cancer could
So now you're giving up like they always said you would
You've got that old map out now and you found the farthest town
You hope that if you're lucky this is where you'll settle down

I don't care where you move I don't care if it's far

Being touched could be

Pinned under his demands
I am still an option that you have

Pull me out when things are at their worst

You can show up at my house
Completely unannounced
We'll have that movie kiss we talked about

Where there are no words
Just a soft and gentle score
Our ears will ring from all the strings

We'll let the screen go black
And watch the credits run
And see the names of every one

And who we ever missed

When I think about my family and how much they've endured I want to wrap them in my arms and keep them safe and warm but they would never know this because I'm so far removed fixated on my bloodline I adopted my excuse it wasn't on the radio or on some TV show I used it for survival I'm learning how to slowly let it go

When I think about my enemies and all the time we waste suiting up in armor for the battle that we waged I want to pull my t shirt off and wave it in their face and yell out I surrender I no longer have the strength so let's rip up all the score cards and call the game a tie we'll both become the winners and walk away with a little peace of mind

When I think about my history a collection of events filled with important characters who mostly came and went regret is like a bill unpaid it controls your every move if you throw it into the violent see it will always come right back to you the past presents the future take your hands from your eyes so you can wave to all the people as you roll through what's left of your life

That's where I fell in love, when the stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while I kissed a smile upon her face
'Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered, 'manana'
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as a whispered, 'manana'
'Cause our tomorrow never came

There in a veil of white, by the candlelight, she knelt to pray

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

I'm getting sentimental over you

Once I wondered why, I'd sit at home and sigh
I'm getting sentimental over you
Words cannot describe this poetry inside
I'm getting sentimental over you

I thought I was happy, I could live with myself
Now I see that love is all that I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind
And just make up your mind?
That you'll be sweet and gentle, be gentle with me
'Cause I'm getting sentimental over you

Herb Alpert,"Tell her you care each time you speak
Make it her birthday each day of the week
Bring her nice things, sugar and spice things

Minute to minute you'll never know why
Coax her, pet her, better yet, get her

We're all little children fresh from school

Herb Alpert,"Tangerine, she is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine, when she dances by
Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh

And I've seen toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine, she is all they say
With mascaraed eye and chapeaux by Dache
Tangerine, with her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame

And I've seen clothes on Tangerine
Where the label says 'From Macy's Mezzanine'
Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl
But she's only fooling one girl
She's only fooling Tangerine

Herb Alpert,"Dear, this evening seemed to go so awfully fast
We had so much fun and now you're home at last
I looked forward to a kiss or two at the garden gate
But you gave me just one peck and insisted it was late

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms
Here am I, begging for only five minutes more
Only five minutes more of your charms

All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Don't you know that Sunday morning, you can sleep late?
Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms

For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people get a soul
Ony those in love would know
What a town without pity can do

If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how ""bad"" we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

The young have problems
Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us
Try to help us
Before this plain granted planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two

And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles

For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,

A record star he thought he'd be
He heard of singers like Beatles
And The Chipmunks he'd seen on TV
Why not a little Spanish flea?

Inside a doggie from Madrid
He arrived in the city
Still singin his sweet harmony
As proud as any flea could be

He walked around
As if he owned the town
Humming his pint sized melody
With his guitar he knew he'd be a star
And in his own home town, how proud he'd be

Then all at once he met a man
Who said, ""I'll help you if I can""
He listened close to his song
And then he sang right along for you see

Herb Alpert,"What now my love, now that you've left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn to ashes
And my hopes turn to bits of clay?

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night, without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul

What now my love, now that it's over?
I feel the world falling all around me
Here come the stars, tumbling around me
There's the sky, where that sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone?
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live if I should live or die

What now my love, now there is nothing?
Only my last, my last good-bye","What Now, My Love?"
Herb Alpert,"Hey!  Life, look at me, I can see the reality,
'Cause when you shook me, took me outta my world, I woke up.
Suddenly I just woke up to The Happening.
When you find that you left the future behind.
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of, 
then you better beware of,
 
The Happening.
One day you're up, when you turn around,
You find your world is tumbling down.
It happened to me and it can happen to you.
 
I was sure, I felt secure until love took a detour.
Yeah!  Riding high on top of the world, it happened.
Suddenly it just happened, 
I saw my dreams torn apart 
when love walked away from my heart.
And when you lose a precious love you need to guide you 
something happens inside you,
 
The Happening.
Now I see life for what it is.
It's not of dreams, it's not of bliss.
It happened to me and it can happen to you
And then it happened.
Oo, and then it happened.
Oo, and then it happened.
 
Is it real?  Is it fake?
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine for certain,
Suddenly it starts hurtin'.
I saw the light too late when that fickle finger of fate.
Yeah!  It came and broke my pretty balloon,
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up, so sure,
I felt secure until love took a detour.
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of,
then you better beware of,
The Happening.
The Happening.

Herb Alpert,"Why do birds suddenly appear

Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

Herb Alpert,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now

Herb Alpert,"I keep hearin' your concern about my happiness
All that thought you've given me is conscience I guess

Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all

I heard she had a style
And so I came to see her
And listen for a while
And there she was, this young girl
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt she found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that she would finish
But she just kept right on

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Oh, singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song

She sang as if she knew me
In all the God despair
And then she looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And she just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,

In ways I always thought were new 
Despite the knowing this is strange 
Inside 
I hope I'll never change 
Shine 
I'm trying to be brave 
Bring me bring me 
Bring the answers on in waves

Turn me on and watch me go 
Straight and narrow 
Nice and slow 
Push me over see me spin 
Watch me fight the fight the pull within

I am wasting without you 
Broken pieces without glue 
Why 
Just as I think it's done 
You're there 
Darkening the sun?

Turn me on and watch me go 
Straight and narrow 
Nice and slow 
Push me over see me spin 
Watch me fight the fight the pull within 
Turn me on and watch me go 
Straight and narrow 
Nice and slow 
Push me over see me spin 
Watch me fight the fight the laws within",Addiction

To touch

Won't point the same way north

Far away from it all 
But I can't move at all

Allies across the years 
You witnessed the best 
Gave drainage for all my tears 
And closed on request 
You saw before me when 
I knew it all 
You turned the other way 
Watching me fall

You see it all

If when you're leaving me 
Remember me this 
If we're dependent still 
We cannot miss 
You're maybe the last to go 
Probably the first 
Show me a little place 
Where I can grow worse

Everything's changed
The closer I get to the top
The more it feels strange

Everything's moved
Everyone move
The closer I get to the drop
The more that I lose

If and or when I might stop
Please do not follow me
If and or when I might drop
Please don't swallow me

Turning round
The sound of falling

Everything's new
Everything's new
The closer I get to the drop
The more my vision pulls me through

Somethings don't change

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Your eyes have clouded
Your smile is fixed
And your thoughts are far away from here
You kiss me like an actress
Then walk out of shot
Your indifference abundantly clear

I'm empty, used up
Only dregs in my cup
And airplanes in my head
You shrug off my embrace
With a smile on your face
We should be sleeping in separate beds

Give me my heart back now
It's half broken anyway
Give me my heart back now
I beg you to go away
The sooner you walk out the door
The sooner I pick myself up from the floor

You use me up
Like a pack of cigarettes
Then crush me and cast me aside
You talk like it's a duty
Looking for your own beauty
While pretending to gaze in my eyes
You're never there
When I'm gasping for air
And the airplanes all explode
Lifting off from the runway
Oh, this traffic is one-way
And we've come to the end of the road

Give me my heart

You're giving me nothing
You've taken my all
And I feel like an empty shell

Drown the words that we've said
And if you stay you'll just put me through hell

Give me my heart",Airplanes in My Head
Herbert Grönemeyer,"Full moon, I'm drunk as a skunk
So mad about her, you can see the depths to which I've sunk
Can't stand the days, at night I call her name
Prowl around the neighborhood, the hunter captured by the game
I've been trying to steal her heart for so long

She's stubborn but so am I
I want her more as each and every day goes by
Be my ally, conquer her pride
We two together could besiege her heart from every side
Be my friend, don't let her slip through my hands

Cast your spell upon her, I'll stalk through her dreams
So I can find her there defenseless, surrendering her love to me
And if you do this for me, oh what delight
I'll turn into a werewolf then and howl to you throughout the night

Full moon, shine down your light on me
Full moon, make me her lunacy
You know she doesn't want me but you can turn the tide
I can't go on without her so quickly, make her mine
Full moon, hear my lonely cry

You're so pale, I'm deathly white
If nothing happens soon I don't think I can last the night
From up in heaven you stare down on us serene
I'm in desperation, and I'm begging you to rescue me
Do something now, tomorrow will be too late

My last hope's in your power,listen to my plea
And help me now to win her heart or it'll be the end of me
I'm drowning in the tears that all true lovers shed
Don't leave me in this limbo, moon
Don't leave me in this loneliness

Full moon

Come and make her want me the man of her dreams
So I can find her there defenseless surrendering her love to me
And if you do this for me - oh what delight
I'll turn into a werewolf then and howl to you throughout the night

I want to enjoy this moment till the end of time
So good to feel you by me, good fortune overflows
I willingly surrender, find comfort in your arms

I'm beside myself with joy
Feel I could float away with you
Weightless, carefree, deep in love, it's ecstasy

Rain on me your kiss of fire
Call up the storm

Take me, I want to be overwhelmed by you
So good to have you here

Hatte ein Messer gekauft
Saß wie immer im Kino
Ihm war egal, was da lief

Stach einfach zu
Direkt neben sich
Er sah in Zeitlupe
Jeden einzelnen Stich

Er hat es geschafft, schon vorbei
Er fühlte noch nicht viel

Was soll denn daran so schlimm sein

Führe, wo es zu kämpfen gilt
Niemals Verschlagenheit im Schild
Tu nicht ungefragt, was alle tun
Alle hat kein Gesicht

Zieh deinen Weg
Als freier Radikaler
Zieh deinen Weg
Sei unvorsichtig, verrückt
Zier dich nicht
Irrtum ist keine Falle
Verschenk dein Herz
Und nimm es auch wieder zurück

Lass dir niemals dein Lachen stehlen
Auch wenn dir manchmal die Gründe fehlen
Hab keine Angst vorm Lächerlich sein
Schüchtern ist das neue Forsch

Wenn dir die Worte verlorengehen und dann
Nimm die, die grad im Weg rumstehen, denk daran
Ich sag mir auch viel, hör's dann nie, und ich bin
Nicht dein Vorbild, aber der, der dich liebt

Zier dich nicht
Versuch zu sein und nicht zu scheinen
Genieße dich
Binde dich nie an nur eine Idee,verschreib dich nicht nur einer Idee
Zier dich nicht
Bleib mit dir im Reinen,
Zeig Verständnis
Aber verstehe nicht zu gut

Lüge nicht
Geh dem Kummer nicht entgegen
Prüfe dich
Ob du weißt, wovon du sprichst
Zweifel nicht
Jeder Berg lässt sich bewegen
Gib nie auf
Sei bereit fürs große Glück",Zieh Deinen Weg
Herbert Grönemeyer,"Haust du bereits oder lebst du noch
Befindest du dich im Lebensloch
Und alles rauscht an dir vorbei

Stehst du ständig unter Strom
Vergreifst du dich immer mehr im Ton
Hast du eigentlich für nichts wirklich Zeit

Du fühlst dich wie im freien Fall
Du gibst niemand so richtig Halt
Und nichts bedeutet dir irgendwas, irgendwas

Dies ist das Lied zur guten Nacht
Zieh den Stecker raus
Wende dich an die Dunkelheit
Denn sie kennt sich aus

Deine Nerven rebellieren
Weil sie ein rauhes Dasein führen
Und Rücksicht ist ein leeres Wort
Du machst aus dir 'ne Achterbahn
Mit dir will keiner Schlitten fahren
Und keiner teilt mehr mit dir sein Brot
Und langsam geht dir alles schief
Was gestern noch von selber lief
Ist heute nichts als Quälerei

Dies ist das Lied zur guten Nacht
Zieh den Stecker raus
Wende dich an die Dunkelheit
Denn sie kennt sich aus

Und gib ihr einfach deine Schuld
Dämonen, deine Pflicht
Fehltritte, deine Ungeduld
Und sie kümmert sich
Und sie kümmert sich",Zur Nacht

Und was sich nicht ändert, an dem bin ich noch dran

Were it like a child's, forever straight and cruel
I've never tried to see what it means to me

Where I left myself, somewhere if I only knew
I've never tried too much, found no line of trust
Will I ever learn,
Will I ever learn?

Hold on, hold on, we never do
Leaving doubts, ringing out and falling through
Hold on, hold on, rescued and freed
I wanna race, I wanna place, I wanna be

Were I like a page, a script of many souls
It would ease my mind and let me choose my road
And every single theme would take a load off me
If I only learnt,
If I could only learn

Where this story goes is written in the dark
Living off the luck and reaching out too far
And at the very end I'd read it all again
Cause I never learn,
Cause I never learn

I miss you

We forget and we deny
We loose and still we try

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Memories come as lovers go
The same re-runs of the same old shows
The way we are is fine
I always remember the good times

Played with every heart I knew
Good excuses overdue
Broken every golden rule
And nothing's borrowed
And nothing's new

And it's one more time
For the same old boys
One more time for the few
God will come to soon for us all
So what else can we say

Keep the moments
Damn the years
No hell, no heaven
No cares, no fears
Tear the letters
Drown our tears
For good or better
Only here

And it's one more time for the same old boys
One more time for the few
God will come to soon for us all

Show me your hand
Could you lend yourself to me
I'm tied to the past held by my truth
Don't know who to turn to
I need to be free
 
God only has interest
In his own plans but never in me
I pray for the day where I pay back
The pain where I feel something
Brought to many tears
Sowed seeds of hurt
Now my back's to the wall
Longing for forgiveness, I'm
Wholly confessed help me work
Out the score
Help me work out my score
 
Revive me
Bring an end to these days
And help me to leave them  
Without guilt without shame
(Need your sacrifice to be in this
World reach out to me)
 
Give me reason to hold on
Give me a sign to start
Is there any place
For the hopeless?
I need space for my heart
 
Revive me
Bring an end to these days
And help me to leave them  
Without guilt without shame
And I'm out of time, out of reach
Needs your sacrifice
To be in this world

Herbert Joos,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Herbert Joos,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me

Je suis en manque de toi
Je me languis de ton parfum
Sentir ta bouche effrontée
Épouser tous mes rêves
Dans un délicieux va et vient
Retenir nos élans
Pour que la nuit
N´en finisse pas
Tout oublier
Sous mes doigts impatients
Trouver ta voie sacrée

Je n´ai qu´un pays
Celui de ton corps
Je n´ai qu´un peché
Ton triangle d´or
Je découvre en toi
Toutes les audaces
Quand tu m´aimes

Lorsque tu dénoues
Tes jupons soyeux
Moi je m´engloutis
Au fond de tes yeux
Ta gorge étincelante
Tes buissons secrets
Quand tu m´aimes

Je ne pense plus qu´à me perdre
Au plus profond de toi
Et ta peau manque à ma peau
J´ai perdu le sommeil
Et je n´arrive plus à travailler
Je n´en peux plus
Je paie le prix que paie
Le vice à la vertu

Je n´ai qu´un pays
Celui de ton corps
Je n´ai qu´un péché

Je découvre en toi

Et soudain tu trouves

Qui arrache en moi
Un cri de victoire

Du beurre, du blé, du jonc, des radis,
J'avais des des tas d'amis des chiens et du jambon du pays,

On venait s'amuser chez moi tous les jours
Les filles étaient jolies avec leurs cheveux courts

Mois je disais c'est bon tout ça, 
Pour après demain on verra

Quand j'avais de l'argent
Du beurre, du blé, du jonc, des radis,
J'avais autour de moi toutes les filles les plus jolies

Je révais d'être aimé pour moi même,
Je savais que c'était impossible mais quand même,

Je me disais faut changer ça,
On verra ce que ça donnera

Alors j'ai donné mes actions et mes titres au porteur,
Mes terres et mon château à mon frère et ma soeur
Et mes obligations n'ont aucune valeur
Car j'ai donné tous les timbres et tout mon or au facteur

Y a des Noël qui te fascinent

Que ça les rend heureux

On mange de tout on vit par terre
Mais le bonheur est pensionnaire
Chez nous depuis toujours

Chez nous, ça sent la soupe et le bébé dormant
Les disques craquent car on les joue souvent
Nos chiens sont fous mais pas du tout méchants
Chez nous, la porte reste ouverte jour et nuit
Il y a toujours un plat de spaghettis
Et du café tout chaud pour les amis

Ici, le capital c'est la tendresse
On va puiser notre sagesse
Dans le silence des caresses

Alors, les grands discours les belles paroles
Tous ces slogans qui vous cajolent
Le rhytme fou des villes folles
Ça colle pas chez nous

Chez nous, on règle l'heure au bruit de nos voisins
Et dans les murs y a pas un clou qui tient
Mais les belles nuits passées sur un bouquin
Chez nous, le mot bonjour veut dire vraiment bonjour
On se dispute à coups de mots d'amour
On dirait pas qu'on vit dans une tour

For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now

What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Herbie Brock,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

Without no seam nor fine needle work
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane

And gather it all with a basket of flowers
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Have her wash it in yonder dry well

Plow the land with the horn of a lamb

They'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise
Other's just come to harm

I wish that he was here tonight
It's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia, it was just a false alarm

A ghost of aviation
She was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending
On beautiful foolish arms
Amelia, it was just a false alarm

Maybe I've never really loved
I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
And looking down on everything
I crashed into his arms

He saw how I worried sometimes

""All the guilty people,"" he said
They've all seen the stain
On their daily bread
On their Christian names
I cleared myself
I sacrificed my blues
And you could complete me
I'd complete you

Herbie Hancock,"The big man arrives
Disco dancers greet him
Plainclothes cops greet him
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening
Sophomore jive
From victims of typewriters
The band sounds like typewriters
The big man he's not listening
His eyes hold Edith
His left hand holds his right
What does that hand desire
That he grips it so tight

Edith in the ring
The passed-over girls are conferring
The man with the diamond ring is purring
All claws for now withdrawn
One by one they bring
His renegade stories to her
His crimes and his glories to her
In challenge they look on
Women he has wanted grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces
Gently to the spoon

Edith in his bed
A plane in the rain is humming
The wires in the walls are humming
Some song-some mysterious song
Bars in her head
Beating frantic and snow blind
Romantic and snow blind
She says-his crime belongs
Edith and the Kingpin
Each with charm to sway
Are staring eye to eye
They dare not look away",Edith and the Kingpin
Herbie Hancock,"Rousseau walks on trumpet paths
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line

In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive
They'll eat a working girl like her alive
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band
He hangs it up above the jungle line

The jungle line, the jungle line
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats
Charging, chanting down the jungle line

There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit
And metal skin and ivory birds
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line",The Jungle Line

Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene

Some mark of inbetween
I lay down golden-in time
And woke up vanishing

Sweet bird you are
Briefer than a falling star
All these vain promises on beauty jars
Somewhere with your wings on time
You must be laughing
Behind our eyes
Calendars of our lives
Circled with compromise
Sweet bird of time and change
You must be laughing
Up on your feathers laughing

Golden in time
Cities under the sand
Power, ideals and beauty
Fading in everyone's hand

Give me some time
I feel like I'm losing mine

With the earth spinning
And the sky forever rushing
No one knows
They can never get that close

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

And now that time has passed 
I still remember your tenderness 
Just the thought brings the warmest breeze to my memory

Touch me again so tenderly 
And I'll survive every day 
Cause I'm burning inside, by your sparkling side 
Since you came to me so tenderly",Tenderly

Too late I guess, Cause I'm in a mess

Why lead me on this way?
I thought there'd be no price on love
But I had to pay.

If I could perform one miracle
I'd revive your thoughts of me

Herbie Mann,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April

 Que isto é bossa nova Que isto é muito natural

 é que os desafinados também têm um coração

 Revelou-se a sua enorme ingratidão
 Só não poderá falar assim do meu amor

Oh maybe for tomorrow

Herbie Mann,"Sunday is gloomy; my hours are slumber-less
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless

Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know

With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

In the morning and started to laugh

A dan dos rios
O mel do cacau
E o sol da manh he luna morena

The taste of the clove

Cinnamon stone

The dance of the rivers

I can't get her out of my head
I can't get loose, I just can't move
An inch from her

Walks talks gets out of hand
The way she takes her place
The way she smiles

An endless line of people
Some love, some hate you
Some only try to make a fool out of you

Chorus:
But every once in a while
Someone's passin' by you just can't get of your mind
Someone passin' by
Gives you that precious little grain
That makes you feel real
& keeps you out of the rain
(it feels like love - ) let's get lost

Some people try to sound like big money
Others overlaugh when things ain't funny
I was lookin' into many eyes in vain
I've been hooked on lies insane

Every day you see if you're a star like me
An endless line of people
Some love, some hate you
Some only try to make a fool out of you

chorus:

If life is drivin' you to drink
You sit around wonderin'
Don't know what to think
There's always somebody hangin' round
Playin' with dynamite
You told me back in '68
I was goin' down the ?
You were goin' straight
But I remember in '74
You wanted me to hang around & take some more
My mama told me, daddy said it right
Son you're just committin'g suicide
Drinkin' & gamblin', stayin' out all night
Just livin' in a fool's paradise

Herman Brood,"Goin' down the line, head up high

Some say I'm freakin', and they'll try to start rumours
Some people say that I won't last long

Fascinating, starin' at faces

Herman Brood,"The neon light, of the Open all night
Was just in time replaced by the magic appearance of a new day-while
A melancholic Reno was crawling on his back just in
Front of the supermarket door-way child

Hey girl, on a cold summer night
As we stood on the corner
As a man passed by and asked us
What we were doing what we need
As he pointed his big fat finger
To the people hangin' round at the corner of the - other side of street
Oh well

Doin' nothing, just hanging around
What do you mean doin' nothing Sir
So we had to hit him to the ground
Doin' nothing just hanging around

Herman Brood,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love

Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away

We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Herman Brood,"And now, the end is here 
And so I face the final curtain 
My friend, I'll say it clear 
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain 
I've lived a life that's full 
I traveled each and every highway 
And more, much more than this, I did it my way 
Regrets, I've had a few 
But then again, too few to mention 
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption 
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway 
And more, much more than this, I did it my way 
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew 
When I bit off more than I could chew 
But through it all, when there was doubt 
I ate it up and spit it out 
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way 
I've loved, I've laughed and cried 
I've had my fill, my share of losing 
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing 
To think I did all that 
And may I say, not in a shy way, 
""Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way"" 
For what is a man, what has he got? 
If not himself, then he has naught 
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels 
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way! 
Yes, it was my way",My Way
Herman Brood,"Hello mamma don't blame me
If I look a lil'
Out of control
But life as a Rock 'n Roll idol
Is worse than livin'
In a tell tale hole

Last night
As I flew my jet fighter
Some ramblin' 
Jarred upon my ear
Tell me ma
Was it plain suspicion
Or real lightnin' I did fear

The company
Is proud of me
I'm the best sellin' 
Act around
Talkin' trash to the press
Workin' my ass off
From town to town

Hey man take a smoke
Take a line
Why'are songs are out a sight
Of course we're gonna
Make you a star

Why'are gonna be trapped
In some Rock 'n Roll jive
Why'are gonna be in trouble

As long as you don't know
What why'are talkin' about

Won't be long
Before why'are gonna find out
Why'are local misfit's gonna be
A national breakout
Gonna prove why'are smalltown

Gonna do a lil' thing
To make you feel

& I won't let go
Entertain this mob
Like fightin' a bull in a rodeo

Herman Chittison,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream
Herman Chittison,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended
Herman Chittison,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

So let this bar be my shelter 
Because it's got a roof 
And I could sit at this table 
Lit with a candle
And I will drink in order to warm me up

Herman Düne,"First: when the bad times come
I need to know: ""will you be here?""
When surrendered and trapped i'll cry
Will you stand by me?
Hold my hand when it shivers
Cause i hear them coming
My breath hard and the fever
The blood in my throat and in my temples
Exhausted by fear when i need to rest
YOU
Would i hide here?
In the bottom of your cellar, under your sheets
Would i hide here?
A walk through the cold struck down by hunger
And the light of your room at night
Can i trust the light?
When i am not gone after year 2000 because of you
Will you bring me books, books of truth
And hold a little candle?
Stand still please, stand still and under the threat
Would i hide here?
In the trunk of your car or in your bathroom
Would i hide here?
Would i hide here?
In the bottom of your cellar, under your sheets

She was wearing a warm coat with a hood,

The other held a cigarette.

I would have felt like a very beautiful one.
Same attitude : I've got same nerves !
Same language I'm writing, though I don't
Understand a word of what you try to say.
I know each word of those words was chosen
And rehearsed a long time before I got into
The room and felt no-adapted.

And between the cramp in the morning and the falling
There is no space

And between the tight jeans and the second hand scarves

How could that precious feeling have run away from me?

and the G-train to the L-train
And riding through the Reconstruction
There was nothing I could care about but
How you could have run away from me

To the place where I live

And the snow storm made me cross concrete
Between high-speed highway lanes and exit lanes
And I woke up to a sign that said
“for U-turns it’s the second right”
And the thought that I could die
Getting out of my car trying to stop
A crazy blind New Jersey traffic-jam
The thought, it told me:
Hey, David you could have called your parents
You could have sang a beautiful song with your sister
You could have been in the cabin last spring
You could have written something good eventually
You could have told someone you loved you did
And then, by chance, I got back on the road
And I could start
not thinking about anything that matters
It’s like when I sent that letter
and forgot to write your name on it

and stay with me, for a minute.
Take away my fear and take me where it is quite!
David, Come here.....and sing something easy.
Whisper it in my ear, make my place a safe place.


                (Verse 2)

And my baby she's scared of strangers.

Because once she was hit with a baseball bat.

But when i'm with her in her flat.

She doesn't even bother putting a lock on the door.

My baby's not scared of strangers anymore.


And my baby, she doesn't like cars.

Because she thinks they're a nuisance in this town.

But when I drive her around.

She doesn't mind riding shotgun.

My baby thinks that driving......it's fun!


And my baby she's afraid of sharks.

She always thinks she saw a fin.

But when I tell her It's a dolphin!

She comes back swimming faster then an alligator!

My baby's not afraid of sharks anymore.",My Baby Is Afraid of Sharks
Herman Düne,"People put pictures of places in frames
I remember someone's face but then I forget their names
I have a book for writing down who I meet and where I'm going to
But my home is nowhere without you

There is nowhere like the ocean to breathe
And the world is wonderful as it is
Now I might try to settle down on some beach in Malibu
But my home is nowhere without you

My home is nowhere without you
My home is nowhere without you
My home is nowhere without you
My home is nowhere without you

I met the natives and they shook my hand
In a warehouse in Providence, Rhode Island
They said they had a room for me there with an incredible view
But my home is nowhere without you

There are houses full of dogs and full of bugs
In a city full of gods and full of thugs

I wandered there down the streets and up on first avenue

But my home is nowhere without you


My home is nowhere without you

My home is nowhere without you

My home is nowhere without you

My home is nowhere without you


My home is nowhere without you

My home is nowhere without you

My home is nowhere without you

Herman Düne,"I remember travelling by your side
I was your disciple and you were my guide
Now the choice is made and the wrong is done
and I will meet you next year in Zion
Next year in Zion

And I remember the drugs we did
I was drinking opium and you were smoking weed
There are healthier things I now get high on
And I will meet you next year in Zion
Next year in Zion

I have no home and I have no house
and I am quiet like a mouse
but I can fight like a giant
and I will meet you next year in Zion 
Next year in Zion

Now no one has a thousand friends
and something starts where another ends
I was wrong when I said you were the one I could rely on
and I will meet you next year in Zion
Next year in Zion

Now drink your wine and drink your beer
And kindle your candle on the chandelier
It looks like gold but it's made of iron
I will meet you next year in Zion

I have no home and I have no house
and I am quiet like a mouse
but I can fight like a giant

Herman Düne,"On a Saturday, we had a date
For the best day of the week
I said I would meet you by the gate
And then I kissed you on the cheek
We could go for a sunset by the docks
Throw stones to the water and watch them sink
You asked me for a lighter 
And I handed you a matchbox
And I watched you smoke as the sky turned pink
On a Saturday, on a Saturday, you were all that I could care for

On a Saturday, on a Saturday, you were all that I was there for
On a Saturday there was dust in my eye

And you told me you knew how to remove it
I said tonight is the night for you and I
And I intend to prove it
If you care for a ride 
Then I can show you around
The city is so pretty in the fall
You said drive me uptown 
You said drive me down town
It doesn't matter to me at all

On a Saturday, on a Saturday, you were all that I was there for
On a Saturday, on a Saturday, you were all that I could care for

Ray Charles on the radio
Listen to the beat
Dancing is automatic
You couldn't seat still
You were jumping in your seat
And you were looking fantastic
On a Saturday nevertheless
You told me you could not stand the rain
I said, baby I will take you to Los Angeles
On silver plated plane

On a Saturday, on a Saturday, you were all that I could care for
On a Saturday, on a Saturday, you were all that I had a prayer for
On a Saturday, on a Saturday, you were all that I was there for
On a Saturday, on a Saturday, you were all that I had a prayer for",On a Saturday
Herman Düne,"In August I went out to the country for resting
There was a family of swallows in the barn there nesting
I saw the little ones and their feathers were breezy
I pictured their life and I thought it was easy
I said these guys just have to sit there and squeak
And their mother comes back with insects in her beak to feed them

You said, man,
Swallows migrate and it is amazing
They fly from Alaska to Argentina with their little wings
And I said I had never heard of such a journey
But someone knows better than me
Someone knows better than me

And then we were in Stockholm and it was beautiful in July
And the day after this famous Swedish director Ingmar Bergman died
And all the national papers had some special issues
With beautiful pictures and interesting interviews
I figured it was unlikely that they would gather all this stuff overnight
They must have needed much more time than this to write

And he felt rancid
And you said David
David don't you know about pictures?
They keep them at hand for the death of celebrities
And I said I will never get used to how twisted news can be
But someone knows better than me
Someone knows better than me

And then I remembered one month of June in Coney Island
When I was hiding a bottle of beer in the sand
It was too late for the ride(?) and it was too late for the Cyclone
Then I didn't have a girlfriend, but I didn't feel alone
I didn't need anyone to watch the sunset or maybe my brother
And now every time the sun goes down I hope we will be together kissin'

Baby listen
Baby I don't want to be without you
It would make me so mad, I wouldn't know what to do
I was blind but now I can see
But someone knows better than me
Someone knows better than me
Someone knows better than me",Someone Knows Better Than Me
Herman Düne,"I wonder what you dream about 
When you're sleeping, and I hold you 
Do you remember some of the many 
Stories that I told you 

And if you find yourself in Alaska 
Curled up by a big bear 
And if you feel like there is a big paw 
Going through your hair 

Well I hope that you hear 
A song to your ear 
With a groove so jazzy 
And a voice so clear 
You see 

Don't you worry a bit 
Try to think about me 
Don't you worry a bit 
Try to think about me 

See the hyena and the monkey 
Fighting in the sun 
See the marauding bandit 
Shooting his gun 

In the hard hit of the summer 
When the rivers run dry 
And at the dawning of the millennium 
With no supply 

And the looted shop 
With the window smashed 
With the crooked cop 
Investigated for cash 
You see 

Don't you worry a bit 
Try to think about me 
Don't you worry a bit 
Try to think about me 

And in the land of our forefathers 
Covered in dust 
People were dying 
They were sick to their guts 

And you saw the holy shore 
Infested with sea lice and kelp 
You saw the submarine king 
Crying for help 

And you moved your hip 
And you tightened your grip 
And then you bring your lip 
Onto my lip 
You see 

Don't you worry a bit 
Try to think about me 
Don't you worry a bit 
Try to think about me 

Don't you worry a bit 
Try to think about me

Herman Düne,"Amigo we back to wherever we started

Indigo turned black and were both broken hearted

There are pictures of us but the colors will fade

And Soon I'll be just rain on your parade

We're on different tracks, and on opposite ends

But was it any different when we were still friends ?

When you look down to the valley from the top of a mountain

When you throw down a silver coin in a fountain=

And you wish you were back in the land where you were raised

And you wish you were back in the crowd where you were praised

Where a show is performed

And the audience attends

Was it any different when we were still friends ?

[Solo : ]

I had a dream and your name was Blackfoot Jack

I looked after you and you covered my back

Our horses were tall and our guns were loaded,

I was chewing-chewing gum and the bubbles exploded

You said my dreams do not make sense

But was it any different when we were still friends ?",When We Were Still Friends
Herman Düne,"You say a doe and a buck are a couple of deer

The agent is in a room in downtown Budapest
He thinks he’s the first of the world-class spies but really he’s not the best
He’s here to sabotage some stuff and keep things tight
But his superiors really sent him out of their sight
Cause he hears strange music

I hear strange music

And on the train I got a seat right by the window
It was raining very heavy and then I saw a rainbow
It’s a wonder it’s a miracle it’s a god given sign
I’ve got a fine little woman on my mind
And she hears strange music

Herman Düne,"When I was six I saw a strange tree bearing a strange fruit
I saw a surfer he was riding a wave and he was wearing a wet suit
They say “Nature is just another miracle you’re accustomed to”
And when I see you riding a bicycle I know it’s true

And in the long long run
In the long long run
It was worth trying

I was a boy at a bar-mitzvah and I was losing my voice
The kids kept turning into men and they had no choice
They were through with playing video games and hide and seek
And they were reading in a new language they couldn’t speak

And in the long long run
In the long long run
It was worth trying

And on the top of the hill there is an old man driving a tractor
He says when I was fifteen I thought that I wanted to be an actor
But I missed the fruit in the field in the valley so green
And the movies were dull on the other side of the screen

But in the long long run
In the long long run
It was worth trying

But in the long long run
In the long long run
It was worth trying

And in the city where you don’t need a car and where you hate the train
You were trying to write a new song but you couldn’t find a refrain
Some sounded too shallow and others too deep
You were sitting at your desk at night and you were falling asleep

But in the long long run
In the long long run
It was worth trying

It was worth trying

Herman Düne,"We were stuck in traffic for forever it seemed
What was going on I wondered
A car-crash a fire or a beast on the loose
Or maybe some construction worker

Some construction worker a beast or a fire

I went trying my luck on the seventh day
I got on the bus like a runaway
I bet a five on the red and another five on the black
My baby isn’t coming back

She’s not coming back
I bet a five on the red
And another five on the black

I heard a star on the rise from Ontario
She said “I love singing but touring is a bummer”
And “when I get to go home it feels just like summer”

Herman Düne,"We passed a truck carrying a heavy load
And then I drove you off the main road
Down to a lake of silver
You were cuter than ever
Then we went to swim for a mile or two
We did the breast-stroke and the butterfly too
The sight was amazing
Although the water was freezing

I’m not wearing an iron armor
So if you want to feel a little warmer
Anytime be my guest
Lay your head on my chest
If you feel cheated
Lied to or mistreated
What is good could be the best
If you lay your head on my chest

Then I fell silent and it was silly
I guess it must be running in my family
When we are bothered
We should tell each other
Then I felt a cramp in my leg and tears in my eyes
You told me the words of men who were famous and wise
They say “One who forgets is one who is smart”
And “you should never go swimming with a heavy heart”

You’d be sinking like a stone
Sulking in your corner all alone
Put your grudges at rest
Lay your head on my chest
Let me drive the car yo
And play good music on the stereo
From one town to the next
Lay your head on my chest

Give me a phone-call I’m not hard to reach
Give me a crack pipe and I will take a hit
I’ll do whatever drugs if we have to split

You say you’re dead-drunk but you just took a sip
I’ll buy another round and I’ll leave a good tip
You say “David, I really thought you’d quit”
But I’ll drink like a sailor if we have to split

And in the morning when you open your eyes
You do the training and the exercise
I’d rather cuddle with you but you don’t feel like it
It will kill me baby if we have to split

In your vision you saw a magician
He pulled you to the bottom of the ocean
Don’t be scared magicians don’t exist

You were a hunter chasing a crow

Are they playing with your child or are they running in the wild

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

""Mijn arme kind, 't is droevig maar het moet
Beter is het heen te gaan"", ik zweeg en jij schreide

Weet je nog? dat mijn hand de jouwe
Zachtjes drukte, omdat jij spoedig zou zien
Dat ik niet de beste was
En dat jij door je tranen lachte en zei: ""Misschien!""

Schuil ik onder 't lover, denk aan jou en - ween",Weet Je Nog

All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh, what a lovely couple they made

Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy who's silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes

Lost control and rang your bell I was sore
Let me in, or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
Said, to my shock, ""you're on the wrong block.""

Rushed out to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you, my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade

It's the mums and dads and kids and love that give it life

Oh, it's nice to be out in the morning
When you've got somewhere to go
But seeing the same old places
That can make you feel so low

United's ground where the champions score
A hundred goals to the reds stand's roar
And Bobby Charlton, Best and Law
It's a most fantastic day
When they play

It's nice to be out in the morning
When you've got somewhere to go
It makes you feel good when you're riding
To the places that you know

Beswick, Hulme, and Harpurhey
Whalley Range where the tomcats roam

Herman's Hermits,"I drink sweet wine for breakfast
I sleep but an hour or so
I smiled a little in the silence
Deciding on where to go 
Meet me under the whale 
At the Natural History Museum
I think that's where she said
A little bit sad about having to leave them
Yawning in the sun
It's like a child I run

Don't do it if you don't want to 
I wouldn't do a thing like that
No, don't do it if you don't want to 
I wouldn't do a thing like that

So little do you think of beauty 
Isn't it a shame what ho
Maybe you should go get your flowerin'?
And make all your troubles go 
There she stood in drag
A looking cool in astrakhan
She's huggin' a little white dog
Said I looked like Peter Pan 
And yawning in the sun
It's like a child I run

You gotta make way for the homo superior

Wake up you sleepy heads
Put on some clothes, shake up your beds
Put another log on the fire for me
I need some breakfast and coffee

I look out my window and what do I see?
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they’re here to stay

What are we coming to?
There’s no room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the golden ones

Written in pain, written in awe
By the puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they’re here to stay

Oh, you pretty things, don’t you know
You’re driving your mamas and papas insane?

Their faces in golden rays
Don’t kid yourself they belong to you
They’re the start of the coming race

The earth is a beast, we’ve finished our news
Homo sapiens have outgrown their use

En las mugrientas esquinas de Liniers pierdo los dÃ­as
Pues no me toca escapar.
El gran apego a lo ilusorio se refleja en la vidrieras
De un trucho centro comercial.

La idolatrÃ­a populosa se dibuja en largas filas
Para adorar why no pensar.
La piedra muerta del desvÃ­o falsamente milagrosa
Sigue ocultando la verdad.

Insatisfechos, renegados que se niegan a si mismos,
Faltos de calma why de piedad.
Buscan el triÃ¡ngulo en las niÃ±as para alimentar su morbo,
Why masturbarse en soledad.

Ellas tambien gozan mostrandose inocentes,
Son arpÃ­as, esclavas del televisor,
Viven pensando en lo externo, son adictas a la vida
Buscan billetes why pasiÃ³n.

SÃ³lo transmito lo que observo,
No es una invenciÃ³n de mi mente, no.
Esto acontece cuando contemplo el presente
En las calles de Liniers.

Mas cuando el sol, mi fiel testigo, da de lleno en el asfalto
Why derrite el alquitrÃ¡n
Los fermentos nauseabundos de la basura estancada
Entorpecen mi pensar.

En la esquina un policÃ­a estÃ¡ peleando con su hembra;
Pues esta nunca le fue fiel
Bajo el paso de las vÃ­as los mendigos se revuelcan
Muy pocos los quieren mirar

why la inverbe horda humana que desciende de los trenes,
Desesperada why alocada
Contamina mi cabeza why busco amarlos como sea
Para no volver jamÃ¡s.

SÃ³lo transmito lo que observo,
No es una invencion de mi mente, no.
Esto acontece cuando contemplo el presente
En las calles de Liniers.

En las calles, en las calles, en las calles de Liniers.

RobÃ³ un auto para trasladarse
Hacia las soledades vivientes.
Sentirse, muy cerca de eso
Era su sueÃ±o mÃ¡s ardiente.

Aprovechando el apagÃ³n
De la ciudad capital,
Why renunciando a las amargas sales,
Para nunca, para nunca volver.

JamÃ¡s se estacionÃ³ en su suerte,
Por eso no lograron detenerlo
Las autoridades camineras,
Ni los mecÃ¡nicos desperfectos.

SÃ³lo el cielo de la pampa lo vio,
Como un rayo cruzar el desierto,
Why a una simple joven sin planes,
De un pequeÃ±o gran infierno arrancar.

Condujeron sus propios destinos
Por el sendero que el mundo esquivÃ³
Why pudieron sentirse su estado,
Su patrÃ³n, su Ã­ntimo Dios.

No pudo doblegarlos el invierno
Con el azote de sus vientos,
Mientras refugio levantaban,
En las vivas paredes de un cerro.

El amor hijos les dio al nacer,
Why al Dios vivo agradecieron
El no permanecer prisioneros
Del urbano acostumbramiento.

Por el sendero que el mundo esquivÃ³
Why pudieron sentirse su estado,

Time goes by
I know there's things to be done
Time goes by
I know there's things to be done

Living on a time bomb
You know we're living
Living on a time bomb

You need a lift, they pull you down
The system's got it wrong
I'm a working man and I'm proud of it
So let's get something on
We blow things up and knock
Things down
And make some people sad
It's quite a world in which we live
When good things turn to bad

Time goes by
I know there's things to be done
Time goes by

No time to pause, let's break the rules
Let's break out while we can
Achieving all one's destiny is beyond
Our mega hands
What to do when you're pushed around
Led neatly by the hand
Your life's made up
You're a working man
So make a final stand

Our favorite song was on the radio
I thought I'd call you just to say hello,
Hello
It didn't really matter
You weren't there

The thoughts I'd had for such a fine
Romance
In all my dreams I always get the chance
I wish it were forever
Do you care

Friends keep saying that I'm wasting
Time
I'm not the type that listens
This heart of mine gives me my vision

My heart beats
To the beat of love
My heart beats
Baby you know it should
My heart beats
To the beat of love for you, for you
My heart beats
To the beat of love
My heart beats
And baby you know it should
My heart beats
To the beat of love for you

All of my thoughts I try to sublimate
It's only you that makes me hesitate
It didn't really matter
At the start

I get so cold inside when I'm alone
But then I see you in the world of my
Own, alone
I wish it were forever
From my heart

Friends keep saying that I'm wasting
Time
I'm not the type that listens
This heart of mine gives me my vision

That is love

Looking through a magazine
I find a picture of you, girl
A photograph I'd never seen
I see my fears have come true, girl
Looking at a face I knew so well
Hiding your emotions all too well
It's not surprising the things you've
Been through
I know you were so lonely for a time
But now I hear that all your life's in line
This feeling's got to be true for you
Girl

That is love
That is love you're feeling now
That is love
That is love
That is love you're feeling now

Holding on to all your dreams
Must have been hard on you
It could've gone the way you dreamed
If only I knew what to do
And now I hear you've finally found
Someone
There isn't any reason, girl, to run
It's not so easy, I know, to relax
Now that I've grown I sympathise
Understand and realise
My intentions are from the heart
Girl

That is love
That is love you're feeling now
That is love
That is love... girl
That is love you're feeling now
That is love

The time was right to say goodbye
I'm not sure you understood
Your love for me was clear to see
You did everything you could
I felt ashamed, I was to blame
For all that I did wrong
Now your heart has a place and I'm
Sure it's in haste to re-start

A sentirme así
Están tras de ti ...

Héroes del Silencio,"Es el opio la flor de la pereza
Hasta que llego a ser sólo existencia
El humo de leche muge lento
Extendiendo el sabor del universo

El que nada hace nada teme
Y de terrenal sabrás lo celeste
Un oscuro derecho a la delicia
Será un sueño o será mentira

Las cosas más triviales se
Vuelven fundamentales
Eliminando los moldes del azar
Como se agita el viento sin alimento
Escucha mi canto abierto de par en par

Es el opio la flor de la pereza
Hasta que llego a ser sólo existencia
El humo de leche muge lento
Extendiendo el sabor del universo

Replegado en la madriguera
Como un animal acosado
Bajo el efecto de la adormidera
Y el peso de mis pestañas

Las cosas más triviales se
Vuelven fundamentales
Eliminando los moldes del azar
Como se agita el viento sin alimento
Escucha mi canto abierto de par en par

Esquirlas de aire
Arcano indescifrable
En el jardín de mis delicias
Pertenezco a la brisa

Inhalo la niebla
Que flota en el Ganges
El aceite de incienso
Nos servirá de consuelo

Nunca desprecié una causa perdid
Nunca negaré que son mis favoritas

ésta es mi flor de loto

Tanto vagar para no conservar nunca nada

Nunca una llama permanece encendida
Nunca aguanté su calor
Nunca más, nunca más de un día
Nunca soporté ser un alma invadida
Hasta que vi frente a mí por quien yo moriría

ésta es mi flor de loto y yo era su sombra
ésta es mi flor de loto
Mi mundo no se aclarará
Tanto vagar para no conservar nunca nada

Las líneas de mis manos?

Acht Atzen eine Bong, MDMA, Koks und E's
So geht’s ab in den Ostblocks, was passiert werden wir sehen

Na die üblichen verdächtigen
Fick mal auf Holland denn das Mekka liegt in Tschechien
Prag alles gibt es hier und das beste Bier
Staropramen auf der Autobahn nichts kann passieren
150Kmh, Linke Spur, überholen
Blinken Kurz, wiederholen und im Rückspiegel Polen
Wir sind da, in null Komma nichts
Zirka vier Stunden Fahrt für ein Kurztrip ist ein Witz
Der Weg ins Paradies, kostet lediglich Benzin
Prag ist schon bald die Coolste Stadt nach Berlin
Mit den Liberalsten Drogengesetzen in der EU
Über die grenze rüber Brüder, komm wir Ballern uns zu

Atzen Bauen Joints, Cannabis Rauch
Schein drehen, Line nehmen, wann ist man drauf
Psychoaktive Substanzen zum Spaß

Wir ziehen durch die Prager Innenstadt, Berliner sind immer Straff
Heute wird der Vollbluthustler Merchandise Gewinn Verbrast
Touristyle, und wir schmeißen Kronen in die Moldau
Die Atzen sind am Durchdrehen, fordern Drogen für den Vollrausch
Und obwohl wir von gestern noch auf Tasch sind
Streut jeder MDMA Kristalle in den Absinth
80% Es geht runter wie Hustensaft
Wir haben nichts mehr, doch zum Glück bunkert Varak im Schuh noch was
Der Abend ist gerettet, aber Nutten Bangen wir später
Thc Joints, 80/20 Endlos Paper
Ich mach die Mische und Taylor rollt endlich Holländisch
Türkische runde aber mitmachen muss jeder
Nur einer fehlt, er kippt Wermut in den Tee
Selbst in Prag kommt PTK aus der Merkur Spielothek
Danach ins Laufhaus, ein Paar Atzen sind dagegen
Drauf geschissen ich muss Ficken sollen sie an die Bar ein heben

Stoff unterm Tisch, Wodka im Glas
Shots pur doch nur mit MDMA
Trinkfest, Links rechts, von hier wird das Gras

Wir sind wieder auf dem Rückweg, den Verstand lassen wir dort
Die Köpfe sind gefickt, und die Lungen sind am Pfeifen
Stoff ist wie ein guter Wein, denn er ist am Reifen
Polizei Kontrolle, zum Glück ohne Drogenhund
Speichelprobe und der Atze hat 'ne Kapsel Koks im Mund
Er schluckt sie runter, doch die Bullen peilen nichts
In Seinem Magen geht die Post ab, denn die Kapsel ist nicht dicht yeah
Wir fahren weiter, er Kotzt in den Wagen
Die Atzen die eben noch ganz hinten saßen
Wollen nun schnell nach Vorne
Fenster auf, Rasthofpause, Absturz aufm Parkplatz
Ein Opfer kommt dahergelaufen, fragt ob einer Gras hat
Leider haben wir nichts mehr und die Stimmung ist beschissen
Den Rest der Strecke ziehen wir durch, keine zeit mehr zum Pissen

Some of the busiest rhymes ever made by man
Are goin' into this mic, written by this hand
Are comin' out of this mouth, made by this tongue
I'll tell you now my name, my name is Young
But so you think that it's your destiny
To get the best of me, but I suggest to be
Quiet, bro', don't even try it from the east and west of me
Takin' it and never breakin' it or even shakin' it
Groovin' it and always movin' it, 'cause I'm not fakin' it
Pullin' out rhymes like books off the shelf
Born in England, raised in Hollis, taught to go for myself
This is stone cold rhymin', no frills, no fluffs
And it's no accident that these rhymes sound tough
I'm goin' off, baby, there's no turnin' back
I'm on your TV, on your album, cassette and 8-track
And when the show is finally finished I'll be takin' my bow
My name is Young, and yo I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people, I got know...how
I kick it just like this...

Verse 2
-------

I got juice like the president, I'm makin' rappers hesitant
Invite me to your house and I'll be chillin' like a resident
Yes, 'cause I'm that type of man
'cause I make myself at home no matter where I am
I got it rollin' like thunder, makin' y'all wonder
Why I'm on top with all the other rappers under
I make no errors, mistakes or blunders
It's like a wedding, let no man put asunder
My name is Young MC, I like to rock mic well
'cause when I get up on the mic I just release my spell
It's no hocus-pocus, I'll just get you into focus
And swarm all over you just like a horde of locusts
Smooth operator, female persuader
Spot a fly girl and in a week I'm gonna date her
I got the kind of style for the here and the now
And I can do it 'cause I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people, I got know...how
Bust it!

Verse 3
-------

MC's I'll ruin, 'cause I know what I'm doin'
I'll treat 'em like doublemint gum and start chewin'
I spit 'em out when the flavour's gone
And I repeat the chewin' practice 'til the break of dawn
'cause I'm tough like a bone, sly like Stallone
Rockin' and clockin' on the microphone
Smooth like a mirror, in hearts I strike terror
Rhymes like runs and hits with no errors
Cold like a blizzard, on the mic I am the wizard
With the funky fresh rhymes comin' out of my gizzard
Never sneezin', never coughin', I rock the mic often
Hard as a rock and no sign I'll soften
Makin' sure I get respect, on my mind rhymes connect
I start to build like a builder from a architect
Movin' all around, above and under the ground
You see my face, and then you hear my sound
Comin' atcha with the mic in hand
I'm gonna take command just the way I planned
'cause I'm a one-man band and you are my fan
Don't you understand? I'm like Superman
Yeah, the Man of Steel, don't you know the deal?
You better be for real, I got sex appeal
This is what I feel, and this here's my vow
And now you know the brother with know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how...and I'm chillin', never illin'
In my mouth I got two fillin's...whatever!
I'm on the mic, cold stone gettin' over
My name is Young MC, known as the fly casanova, kick it...

It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy

Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""You want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

Bezpowrotnie elipsa ma

Obrastam w sile, bronie sie
Nie zloszcze sie, nie zloszcze sie
Lubie chleb wiec sobie zjem
I po brzuchu sie poklepie

Wczoraj zdolalam
Wrócic do lona matki 
Pamiec wraca dzis
Co w niej jest 
Czego nie mam ja
Pelnia czlowieczenstwa 
Wiele kosztuje mnie 

Obrastam w sile, bronie sie
Nie zloszcze sie, nie zloszcze sie
Lubie chleb wiec sobie zjem

Hey,"In my mind 
I still need a quiet place to go 
Oh I really know 
That some of you don't understand 

And I wish, I could live 
In the dream, oh yes I do 
I want to be as big 
As a mountain 

I sing this song 
Because I love a man 
Tell me is it strange 
That I do not hope to turn again

Came to some pearly gates holy land (and all) 
Could of earned some grace

Hey Marseilles,"Hold your map upright so the clouds and coast align
They’ve got old wars won, a bright brown sun, the crowds to sing alright
The lion’s share can rest as we sit in café lights
In a neighborhood where all that should may or may not be right

Make your way back home again. I am here still
These sideway streets are straight and true by strain and will
Make your way back home again at a slow pace
Promise me from sound to sea you’re mine always

Untimely make your way to the tarmac baggage claim
It’s all for naught if we forgot. I hope our hope’s the same
Sing praise to stars aligned. Rejoice that love is blind
To the end of days we’ll have to say you are the best I’ll find

I am leaving harbor if you cannot remember
Take me where you’re going in the light shade of December
The plains I see are floating. The grains I see are growing
Take me to the only place I see you’re going",Cafe Lights
Hey Marseilles,"We would like to resign somewhere along a wide mountainside
Sleep the street and sound of marching feet away or hide
We’ll give up on this town, the people who fill the air with their sound
Hear the noise of girls and boys abound. Rejoice
I love you for your wit, not for the shit you spout in your dreams
Brace the ground and love you finally found in me or leave
The wind won’t wait to blow you down
And leaves can change only so slow
So keep your legs on the concrete ground
The truth to find is in what we don’t know",Elegy

I'll follow 'til the sun won't rise

Summer skies don't shine the same
Winter cold won't numb the pain
But autumn air has filled my lungs
Enough to follow you for months

After all these years you are leaving here
DesWite what should be otherwise
In our future dear, so long as you're near
I'll follow 'til the sun won't rise

When I go so far, you leave me in the dark
I just want to be your light

Why'd we ever mean to try

What a shame we're standing here
Breathing in more than our lungs allow

I can promise you more than these crowds

Watch the walls fall away
Let the road lead the way
We don't need a host to make a home 
We will be all that each other owns

Go along the beaten path
Where no one ever needs to ask
What separates this from the day before

Higher rise and water views
Don't just fall in front of you
The less we have will mean there's always more

Watch the walls fall away
Let the road lead the way

We will be all that each other needs

I'll lead you into the standard ground

Hey Marseilles,"I've been walking in the dead of night
Looking down, looking right
If the morning's red
Then I'll be alright

I've been sailing on a dozen seas
Searching for that elusive breeze
If my raft won't sink
I'll have some time to think

I am sailing in winter
We are slowing down, we are going down
Ocean waves are to die for
Endless blue and gray, endless

Lines we trace of a thousand ends
We'll count the ways we can't begin
Stay in our homes
Remain on our own

Lie everyone, says you should believe
That the map you draw shows the life you'll lead
Stay the course
And that world will be yours

Where the light is low, and the lake below
Calls my name to jump off it

Shorter days and long nights
For all that was holding us back
From people we knew we would find

But love's an equation to them
Get out what it is you put in

I will look back
I will hold fast to this

Your heart beats for another day
I still believe you love me but in a different way
The night falls, the city lay asleep
Among the crowds, we both know you're my only dream

I'm starting to see where we went wrong
The lives we lead will leave on their own
You can't climb so high and still see the ground
You're on your way, I'm on my down

Looking back where we were
There's no way to be sure
Things could've gone other ways
That you'd follow me to today

We'll take up separate lives
And in the space that divides
I'll reach for the best of what was

All together, for worse or better the drops will fill the boat

You're one less call to make
One less fall to break
Hold your head on straight
Hold your head on straight

The perfect pattern of love and laughter is no reason to stay

We will set our sights

Through wired window panes

That you've been hanging
And over awaiting your reply.

Aren't we chuckling through our curls?

Over family and over friends

Lies a lonely heart
That only ever pumps

Taken back to the sidewalk where we met

Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart for you

Descending, I'm spinning, lost all defense
How could you swallow me again?

Never mind a single word I said
Carve out your name

Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know

If I'm falling, falling apart

You've got control of me, is this the end of me?

I'm coming back for more, don't let your heart go
Please don't walk away

Homecoming, I'm coming
I'm coming back

Hey Monday,"You were talking to her
But messing with me
It's finally clear
You're blurring the lines

Are you disturbed?
Oh, now you care
Why do you race

Here's the flood flash

The whole night ends with a blur
She's got no limit, she thinks she's so tough
Can't walk a straight line

That night starts now
And she slips on her necklace

Josey, don't you worry
It's just a phase you're going through
Some day you'll know just what to do
Josey, it's alright
Slap the hand that just keeps pouring
It doesn't matter, just do something

She'll start it off slow

Through our fingers, it feels insane

Unfolds on the screen
Stop stalling

Suddenly colliding into me.

How can this feel so bad when you seem so good for me?

Still in my bed.
Tell me how I'll ever make it through
It's the short hellos, and the long goodbyes
The shake in my lip from the look in your eyes
Makes me want to die, I've got the worst hangover from you.

Swimming in the deep end trying to keep from turning blue
Danger danger hoping not to drown
Sinking in the quicksand just to walk right up to you

Blond hair to brown and brown to white
My ma is buried beside my dad
But I was asleep for all of that
For all of that","I've Been Asleep for a Long, Long Time"
Hey Rosetta!,"Get your things
We're leaving
When the morning birds are singing
We're sailing

Cause its time to go
What's to come only fate can show
See her move like a toreador
Wielding her cloak and sword

But I believe
If we run into red full speed
Then there isn't a blade beneath keen enough to pierce our skins
Cause we won't let it in
(In)

I've carried this preconceived false belief
That secretly everybody's fooling me
Just acting sweet

But I'm not taking it anymore
Cause the only thing that I ever learn
Is when trusting a stranger your trust will be returned
(Return it)

So we're taking the boat tonight
We're taking our aging lives
And we're waving a new goodbye
Our arms open wide
(Wide and wide-eyed)",New Goodbye
Hey Rosetta!,"Open arms
I was starved
White desert ground
I was dry
A hungry child

I lived my life dotted 'I's
Knotted fingers toed the line

I lived my life dotted 'I's
These knotted fingers toed the line
Then your open arms, your open arms, your open arms

I've been crying all of my life I guess
And all my smiles were just cringing and tired
Now your sleeves are drying my eyes
I find these bleary sights are cuff polished and bright

I've been crying all of my life
But here entwined in sinew and fire",Open Arms
Hey Rosetta!,"But often it happens you know
That the things you don't trust are the ones you need most
So it's cautiously into the dark
But you see before long that your eyes will adjust
And under the night you can hear
The full moon rise like a psalm in the air
And the air goes into your lungs
And around in your heart and on through your blood
It goes cautiously into the dark
And you see before long that we all have a part
And under your skin you can feel
That the fear that you feel is what will set you free

And under the night you can hear
The full moon rise like a psalm in the air
And the air goes into your lungs",Psalm
Hey Rosetta!,"Were you born in water,
A fish so cold?
Were you born in autumn,
As the river froze?
Cause you shut up
And you're shut in
And I know that
You've got your reasons
But even still, listen:
Honey, let your red heart show

Won't you? won't you? can't you?

Were you born a closed book,
Full of secret lines? (and bound so tight)
Or did you learn to lock it,
As not to break your spine? (oh! you were bound so tight)
Cause you shut up
And you're all shut inside
And I wanted to get you smiling
And maybe once in awhile you could try
And maybe let your red heart show

Come on

Won't you let your red heart show?
Won't you let your red heart show?
Don't you let your red heart go cold
Don't you let your red heart go cold
We were given so much and we let it go
We were given so much and we're getting old
We were promised so much but we let it go
We were promised so much and it's going I know
But you look so good when you're laughing you know
Yeah you know you look so good when you let it show
Honey you look so good when you're laughing",Red Heart
Hey Rosetta!,"Don't you swing like a child,
In a tree, on a tire, in 85?
There's an arc that your feet will ride
On the way between hate and that Sunday fire

You look so serious
Oh, you look so serious
The night is serving us
But you look so serious

And this could be our reward
This could be it

This simple Friday night
Where you're loosening your tie
But there's a tightness in your eyes

You look so serious
Why do you look so serious?
The night is serving us
And we're deserving it

And this could be our reward
This could be it
(this could be all we're owed)
(All we're owed, all we're getting)

Cause if we swing like a child
Then we're always colliding this time of night
But our arcs, they could align
(We could align! we could align!)
And over gravity up comes this kicking child",There's an Arc
Hey Rosetta!,"Everyone around wants to give you their thanks
Everyone around wants to give you their hands
We want to thank you so much! we want to thank you so much!
May every breath you breathe be built on sacred things

And I don't wish for this alone

These are twisted times when trust and truth collide
When a stranger's love could make your heart explode
I want to give it all back! if I could give it all back
I'd send a thousand suns to warm your worthy lungs

And I don't wish for this alone

Everyone around wants to give you their hands
Everyone around puts their hands on your back
And they say: we want to thank you so much! we want to thank you so much!
Cause all you did for them, you also did for us

What you've done is not yours alone
What you've done echoes on and on
(On and on and on)",A Thousand Suns
Hey Rosetta!,"I raised my head from the riverbed and I tasted the air
I built my home of oak and stone and I feasted on the animals and earth
I raised my kids in modern beds and I taught them to take what's theirs
I built this town on god and doubt and science (an economy of fear)
I drained the pond and the woods beyond for dinner, and the river for a song
The more I've got the more I want. I'm blinded but I'm waking up!

Tired eyes, open wide
Blossom iris into lily white
Tired eyes, open wide
Salty brine, bluest sky
Tired eyes, open wide

Hey Rosetta!,"You
You and I made a pact
A deal that as we lay dying
We'd think about each other then
And smile as we're taken in

I
I listened like a little child
To the story of your earthbound pilot
He plummeted so violent
A parachute not opening
And rushing to oblivion
He broke into that knowing grin

I
I think about that a lot
Cause a lot is what I've not got
And a smile is what I least expect
In the clutches of this darkness

You
You I was surprised to hear
Your birdsong velvet in my ear
The phone broke its silent stint
I pulled the cord and I needed it
You billowed like a bowl of silk
And slowed me from my ruining",We Made a Pact
Hey Rosetta!,"It will come around
But everything is now
I know everything is right now
The loneliness is a lot
But the nothing weighs a ton
I mean the nothing weighs a fucking ton

That half of the bed
Empty like a page
Of the curses claims you've yet to make
Oh, the promising light
Bending like a spine
Or the whiteness that your pen could write

Get these bandages off
You cant stand, you can walk
Leave these towels apart
You get up, you get out
Into the sun

That's where we belong
Been a bit too long
All our weaknesses are growing strong
And winter always ends
With water on your limbs, the April rain comes swinging in

Leave these towels apart
Let me up, let me out,

Hey Rosetta!,"Just feel them multiply
Like hungry flies in the sweet summer night
In the woods they were waiting, in a word they arrived
One doubt from your red mouth, and armies align
And once you say it you can't take it back

It was a beautiful home we had, built with our own two hands,
And the amber years we got left, gone in a single breath
They put their eyes to their rifles
There was a quick fist of light
And we were bricks in a pile
Cause once you say it you can't take it back
Oh once you say it you can't take it back

Feel them multiply
Like a hundred eyes aiming at the words in your breath
And then the flies break the flesh and go into your chest",Bricks
Hey Rosetta!,"we begin downstairs and we end up up here.
(well see you grew everything that you needed to live on. that's what it amounted to. mostly the main crop was potatoes. but then you grew carrots, you know, cabbages, lettuce, tomatoes...and we had cherry trees, big cherries, you know, almost as big as the ones you can buy in the store now. we still have some here as matter of fact. if you're around in the summer, late july, drop in! yeah, you had to grow your vegetables. i mean we had to. you couldn't go out to the stores and buy vegetables in those days. you had to grow it to live. yep, we had big gardens .and you had to work hard b'y, 'tis a lot o hard work. everybody worked-when you're old enough to work you had to work. that's....that's it. everyone had to help you know. but you managed to get enough. usually. we did anyway. you kept from...you grew enough to have seeds for the next year. and people traded seeds back and forth. some had more than others. they just shared with one another. everyone had to grow vegetables if they wanted to live. that's what it amounted to. lots of poor people too, who needed help you know. people who had a little more helped. everyone helped everyone else. that's the way we lived. if you needed something you had no trouble to go next door, if they had it, you got it; same way in reverse.)",Downstairs
Hey Rosetta!,"Oh see the great citizens
With all their white sticks tapping brick
They can't see the wire strung in between them
And all that young scum reeling

But oh you do your blinded best
With all these arrows through your chest
Feel em forcing through and they're forcing you
To follow through to where they want you

Was it a trick of light? shook my head from side to side,
I seen a million lines, the finest thread strung spine to spine

Animals run on the sidewalks
Animals run in the national parks
And all the bankers and all the beggars and all the bears are brothers.

Is it a trick of light? I shake my head from side to side
We rub our eyes and shake our fists at the passersby
We scare the kids but mama it's all for the best

What is the new sum, us tied up? with no thumbs?
Is it a noose hung? and us tied up? with no thumbs?
Yeah but in the new sum you gotta count us, we see the lines run

Can you see them?",New Sum (Nous Sommes)
Hey Rosetta!,"Couldn't shake the cold away
A year alone, stock still and stuck in snow

Two black eyes, this phony smile
My senses dead, my body bent in ice

Then you took off your winter clothes
And you leaned against with your eager innocence

My brittle knotted wrists twitched
Reaching out for it

When we're running from the hospital, don't stop. don't stop.
Though the guards'll call, and the cops'll come, don't stop. don't stop.
They do not know us. we don't stop because of our love. our love.
And we don't need their law, like the paper it's written on, it will fade. it will melt away.
Like snow, it runs to the river below",Parson Brown (Upirn Gaangutuq Iqalunni)
Hey Rosetta!,"The road bends long, like mother's arms
Reaching for these four black tires
And through the night, our knuckles tight
We knock off miles and yellow lines

And when it all comes in it's the biggest thing
It's the blooming night in the white of your bright blue eyes
And when it all goes past, it's the fastest wind
And we make it, we make it, we make it

And we don't look back, cause we don't need that
And we're going too fast, and we don't want to, don't want to

The road comes round, it's a curving crown
And our tired temples try and wear it proud
Cause you get away from all you made
All the kid's mistakes you were taught to make

But we don't look back, cause we don't need that
And we're going too fast, and we don't want to, don't want to

At last we stop when the night comes on
And I drive into you, like I'm driven to do
And when we then lie still, I still feel
The road go, and them spinning wheels

We go by a million lives, we go by a million streets, million silent buried seeds...)

Hey Rosetta!,"We watch the land
And imagine our bodies buried within
All the blurring green
Imagine our bodies hovering

We're always on the edge
We're always on the edge of something bigger than this.

Said: I ain't married yet,
Not some marionette,
I cut my strings and I went wandering

Between two poles
One was dirt and the other was gold
They push and pull
If one is evil is the other one good?
Is it good?

We're always on the edge of something bigger than this
Cause we're always on the edge
We're always on the edge of some impossible trick

Hey Rosetta!,"In the wet grass out back
We spread the sheet
And with one last easy laugh
The night released
We breathed the dark, the shaking stars
The distant, constant cars
Breathed the sweet

What was it like?
To be young, strong, stupid and drunk
Soft in the jagged night
My open, rosy throat
Dekeing secret knives
Now we close these petals
To the oncoming ice

In the falling leaves, looking awful green, in the whipping wind
My love, my love is dead I buried it
And it's better hid, all the shit we sling into the whipping wind

Just an honest kid, I always did everything they said
My love, my love is dead I buried it
What a senseless thing! this heart in shreds in the whipping wind!",Yer Fall
