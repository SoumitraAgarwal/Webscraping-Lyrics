Ben Christophers,"I'm thrown it's like your still here
In among my heart
I'll always sleep on my side
Even though your gone
All we tear is each other
Stay
Love will weave the deepest stitch
Don't cry your underwater smile
Just stay
The silence is unbroken
Draws upon my lips
I'll be the one that let you down",Stay
Ben Christophers,"If there maybe more to this I don't know I only got here
Whatever you feel I'm sure you'll be the only one
Truth is I've never felt sure until right now
All too much too soon how can I get by without

Can't wait, can't wait to see you after Sunday
'Cause your smile is shining 
Like a razorblade
Don't say, don't say
See you after Sunday
Cause it seems too long to
Waste away the time

There maybe more to this I don't know I only got here
What ever you feel I'm sure you'll be the only one
I hear you feel
The same way how can I escape, escape without you",Sunday
Ben Christophers,"Racing into town
Bicycles in line
In your raid
In your raid I was
Crazy inner feeling flows in here
I'm a child sweet liberty

Heaven knows you thrilled them too
You raid my senses sunny vale

Am I really safe with you
If I don't know you I don't know myself

Heaven knows you thrilled them too
You raid my senses sunny vail

We'll never fade apart
Evergreen and everclear
Welcome in those sunny days
Heavely in Love
Even if it's getting dark
Pretty one we'll stay home
Heaven knows you thrilled them
You raid my senses



",Easter Park
Ben Christophers,"Falls into view
And you find it's not the right way round
Unfolds a stare I'm homeward bound
And draws on tomorow
Deep city soul
Does she walk with you between the aisles
You're flying high over the groves
Devils heart is broken

All that we are
We cried ourselves dry
Everyone sees
The sweet light of change

Night time came in hooded cloaks
Slides through starlight and eyelids
A crushing smile into me goes
The last wish
Falls into view



",Falls into View
Ben Christophers,"A deep river flows of weathered sins and weathered souls
A kiss a hooded kiss in the seeds of desire
So grief heavenly grief my love you're bringing to me
But you've got shipwreckers eyes and all a cutting stingray smile

I heard the wind has blown a blessed lie and lovers pains
Over streets and wires underneath alien streams
So sweet heavenly sweet my love you're bringing to me
But you've got shipwreckers eyes and all a cutting stingray smile

A river flows
Of weathered souls
But I can see shipwreckers eyes
And all that cutting stingray smile
A kiss a hooded kiss for the one I love

I crossed a lonely road a beggar with sullen clouds in my head
And these lines in my face for every tear you're away
So sweet heavenly sweet my love you're bringing to me
But you got shipwreckers eyes and all a cutting stingray smile

A river flows
Of weathered souls
But I can see shipwreckers eyes
And all that cutting stingray smile
A kiss a hooded kiss for the one I love
Sweet heavenly sweet bringing my love you're bringing to me
But you've got shipwreckers eyes and all
A cutting stingray smile



",Hooded Kiss
Ben Christophers,"Birds flying down
Come the morning
Wakes you up under the sky
Leave my sorrow behind
It only weighs me down
I feel so bad inside

Birds flying home
Come the morning
Raise you up under the sky
Leave my sorrow behind
It only weighs me down
I feel so bad inside

Tell me why Lord
I must learn how to cry
Before I can see where I'm going
Lord why does my sorrow make me feel so good



A new day dawns
Loneliness has been silent enough 'round here
Sunlight blinds our eyes
Everything is coming home to stay for good this time

Tell me why Lord
I must learn how to cry
Before I can see where I'm going
Lord why does my sorrow make me feel so good


Birds flying home
And I'm leaving my sorrow behind




",Leaving My Sorrow Behind
Ben Christophers,"The trees are swaying in their pink noise up on the hill
Today's the day to remember always
It's three o'clock and the sun is as warm as warm can be
And I hear the church bells over the city

As if by magic you and me were there again
Then I remembered how you smiled if I was mocking you
Someone's playing music
And it's swimming from that window sill
We stood there listening
But I was thinking more about holding your hand

What does it all come down to
I'm losing myself
There's scissors for voodoo in my mind
I'm doing it my way
I'm doing it my way

The record player plays a lost soul for everyone
And all the sirens fill the dead street thrillers
Bring out the freak shows and the loveless for tomorrows news
And I heard the church bells over the city
And I said

Are you shading in my mind?

What does it all come down to
I'm losing myself
There's scissors for voodoo in my mind
I'm doing it my way
I'm doing it my way



",Losing Myself
Ben Christophers,"Honey swept away her skin
Oh my god they're lining up
Spoonface Jesus spitting rhythms
Sweet abandon smells expensive
Eat each finger eat each other
Watch myself there on the bed
Oh my god you're ugly now
Suck me from the outside in
I have changed my reflection
Hollow deep the food's so pretty
Silence is deceiving me
Close your mouth she is the victim
Honey swept away her skin
Watch myself there on the bed
Watch myself they're lining up
Have you everything you need
Oh my god you're ugly now
Spoonface Jesus spitting rhythm
Oh my god you're ugly now
Watch myself there on the bed
I have changed my reflection
Hollow deep the food's so pretty
Silence is deceiving me
Close your mouth she is the victim
Spoonface Jesus spitting rhythm
Eat each finger eat each other
Watch myself there on the bed
Sweet abandon smells expensive
Oh my god they're ugly now
Oh my god you're ugly now
Oh my god
Honey swept away her skin
Spoonface Jesus....Spoonface Jesus spitting rhythms
Watch myself there on the bed



",Spoonface
Ben Christophers,"When you drove your car into the stream
That was weird you seemed so phased by it
In a moment your life turns
Like a carousel inside

When you found your daddy's heart in you
All those things you hated were your cross
In a moment your life turns
Like a carousel inside

Bring on new soul
Can't escape it
Can't reply
For today

Down she goes and glitters as she moves
Strands of hair on water burned your eyes
Bring on new soul

Can't escape it
Can't reply
For today

When you drove your car into the stream



",The Stream
Ben Christophers,"Fallen angel in the crowd
Drags her heels over the noise
Lays down at the roadside of regard
A canyon in my broken mind
Echos deep inside the vale
There's dustcarts for the dead birds in the trees

Trans-atlantic shooting stars over mainline
Here they come suburban gods
To bless desire

Heaven hopes you find her here
The raincatchers
The devils blades
There's karma for the misfits of our times

Take this really you take my soul
Take me down when you laugh I fall
All this pity has broken me
But my survival lies with me

I'm going to love you as best as I can
I'm going to hold you close when I tremble
I'm going to love you as best as I can
I'm going to see you rise

I won't ever let you fall out of my senses
Fall out of my own hands
No I won't ever let you let you

Will I find my way home?



",Transatlantic Shooting Stars
Ben Colder,"[CHORUS]
Oop shoop moogi mushy doggy, oh
Oop shoop moogi ay
Means son, don't go near the Eskimos
Please do what I say

My daddy was working
For the weather station
A little bit North of Nome
And I grew up in that frozen country
Where the nights are six months long

I used to play like I was an Eskimo
I put whale oil on my hair
And every night I would beg my folks
Let me sleep in the frigid air

I was seventeen and my voice was changing
But the girls didn't thrill me none
'Cause I longed to go see an Eskimo
On the banks of the old Yukon

One night I slipped from my daddy's house
A little bit north of Nome
I knew that I could get back by morning
'Cause the nights are six months long

And there she was
Sitting on a chunk of ice
Eating a frozen fish
And dipping her friskies
In whale blubbe

And I said, ooga shooga mooshka
Which means the love in my heart
Is a burning

And she said, ooga mooshka nooshka
And that means, back up, buddy
You're melting the ice

I went back home and I told my daddy
About this maiden fair
And how I felt I'd love to melt
Them icicles in her hair

Dad's trembling lips turned purple
And his breath began to freeze
It was then he told me
I could never rub noses
With pretty little Um Shog Nee

He said, son, when you were born
Well, the Eskimo and the white man
Were having a lot of wild parties, see
The Eskimos always brought the ice

Well, they's having a lot of fun, you see
So one night, this Eskimo named Pie Eye
That's right, son, a pie-eyed Eskimo
He stole my little boy and made
A icicle out of him

So I stole you to get even
I was gonna make a
Fudgesicle out of you

But I loved you like you's my very own
And I treated you just, you know
Just like the cold blooded
Little Eskimo that you are

So you see, son, you can never
Rub noses with Um Shog Nee no more
Because, excuse me, see, Um Shog Nee
Has the coldest nose in Alaska
And that's why I've always say

[repeat CHORUS]",Don't Go Near the Eskimos
Ben Colder,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me","Don't Worry 'Bout Me, No. 2"
Ben Colder,"We're just goin' through the motions       
Of the parts we've learned to play         
Never quite together like before           
But somehow darlin' something good         
Got lost along the way                     
And our song ain't nothing

Let's try it one more time                 
With feeling darlin', take it from the top 
Let me feel those tears a fallin' babe     
I don't want to miss a single drop         
Darlin' make believe your makin'           
Me believe each word you say               
Try it once more with feeling

Ah you're reachin' out to touch me        
Darlin' just the way you used to do       
An you're lookin' everywhere but          
In my eyes                                
Well that's an oldy but it's a goody babe 
But them words ain't ringin' true         
And you don't seem very sure of your life 
                                          
So try it one more time with feeling      
Darlin' take it from the top              
This one is the big one baby so give      
It everything you got                     
Darlin' make believe your makin' me       
Believe each word you say

Ben Colder,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Ben Colder,"I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend,
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns,""
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin'
In a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars
Well I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison

Ben Colder,"(Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)
There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around

How those eyes could flash at you (How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung 'round her by the score
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store

She had everything it seems
Not a care, this teenage queen (Not a care, this teenage queen)

But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store

Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store

Very soon she was a star

But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town)

All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame

Ben Colder,"My baby makes me proud, Lord don't she make me proud 
She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk, Lord, how they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights, 
I know she'll be leaving with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.

My baby makes me smile, Lord don't she make me smile
She's never too far away or too tired to say I want you
She's always a lady, just like a lady should be

She's still a baby to me.

Ben Colder,"(Big John, big John)
Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six-foot-six and weighed two-forty-five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, you just said hi to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John
(Big John, big John)

Now, they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it

At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man

Please stay away
Son, don't go near the Indians

Since I was just a little boy
I liked to roam the hills
And to hear wild stories about the Indians
Was my biggest thrill

I'd shout and yell and holler like heck
I wore moccasins on my feet
And I'd make believe I was under a teepee

Twas then he said I could never take
This maiden for my wife

And a brave called Yellow Sun scalped my little boy

Ben Colder,"The old hometown looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa

And down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

Yes, they've all come to meet me
Arms areached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

Down the lane I'd walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At these four gray walls that surround me
And I realized that I was only dreaming

For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home

They'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green green grass of home

I said I'd laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another waiting
And I'd wave goodbye as you go.

A little bitty tear let me down,
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown,
But a little bitty tear let me down.

Everything went like a planned it
And really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
Till you walked with your grip through the door.
A little bitty tear let me down,
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown,
But a little bitty tear let me down.

A little bitty tear let me down.",A Little Bitty Tear

Ben Colder,"On the banks of the river stood runnin' bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid
Little white dove was-a her name, such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other so their love could never be

Runnin' bear loved little white dove with a love big as the sky
Runnin' bear loved little white dove with a love that couldn't die

He couldn't swim the raging river 'cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach little white dove, waiting on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her blowing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster, waiting there for her brave

Runnin' bear loved little white dove with a love big as the sky
Runnin' bear loved little white dove with a love that couldn't die

Runnin' bear dove in the water, little white dove did the same
And they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met, the ragin' river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together in that happy hunting ground

Runnin' bear loved little white dove with a love big as the sky
Runnin' bear loved little white dove with a love that couldn't die

Ben E. King,"Granada, I'm falling under your spell
And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada
For soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Habanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again

And I feel like I'm growing old much too soon,
My love for you, I just couldn't convey,
And the keys to my happiness, I let slip away.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims
I got distracted with meaningless games,
For just an illusion, I traded love that was real,
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate,
Doomed to find out things a little too late,
And so I must play this broken man's role,
Unless you come home, girl, and bring back my soul.
'Cause I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,

She was a lover and a friend
Came out of nowhere

She made me a man
Every thing is alright
How sweet it is",Out of Left Field
Ben E. King,"Walking out
Didn't talk it out
Now she's gone so you can't ??? it out
I'm all alone
And I must do without
All her love that I can't live without

Played along
Did her wrong
And I don't blame the girl
For being gone
I was cheating on her
All along
I can't really seem to stay here long

When a man is being loved
He takes it for granted
He can't see ?????
He thinks he's on top
Oh but it's not her fault
Let her ???? it all
It's a sudden stop

Suddenly
She stopped loving me
Caught me running 'round and set me free
Now my misery is my ????
And I'm missing her touch constantly

Ben E. King,"I found a woman 
I felt a true love
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me

Took her home to mama
Mama, wanna see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing

But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and he called me to his side

Take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

But it looks like every thing's gonna turn out all right
But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand

She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

If he were president now
But he's not!

He knows that in a moment they'll be

A fifty minute lecture
Tobacco juice rolling down his chin

I'm sure you don't remember me
And now it's been ten years

Show me the mosh pit

Who's got the brains?
Who's got everything?
I've got this pain in my heart
That's all
Hey you, with the long
And lonely face
There's gotta be something else
Let me tell you something else
There was a girl who passed me by
She gave a smile, but i was shy
And looked down, so down
Don't look there no no
Go go underground
Now now there's a place to go
It's the morning now
It's the evening
It's everything
I click my heels and i'm there

Underground, underground, ooh
Everything's happy underground
You been kicked around
Did life bring you down here?
Everything's heavy underground

And we'll be decked
In all black
Slamming the pit fantastic

Got a mohawk
And he knows just where
We're coming from

When I can't relax

I can't wait 'til the future gets here

And of sense of humor
Can there be any doubt
Yeah, that natural selection
Has weeded it out?
Just to keep me from laughing out loud

Sort of die
Or just turn into whatever

And I nodded 
""No one understands me"" 
you said 
And I nodded once again, 
As if to agree that all men are indeed the same 

Somehow, you said, I was different 
For months on end I maintained 
A veneer of sincere interest 
As if I were listening 
As you re-lived every page 
Of self help and new age that you had read 
And 
I went in for the kill 
I'd read the same books 
I learned to ape the motions of a 'sensitive' human being 

And we were 'oh so happy' 
But you found things to fix 
And I knew it was time 
To move on 
So now you have me completely figured out 
You feel sorry for me 
I can't express my feelings 
I can't tell the truth 
We are all alike 
At puberty I was sworn to secrecy 
By the international brotherhood 
Of lying fickle males 
I can't tell you anything

I can't commit 
You're right 
I can't commit, to you

Sweet baby 
The world has more for you

Goodnight, goodnight 
Let the moonlight take the lid 
Off your dreams 
We took a small flight 
In the middle of the night 
From one tiny place 
To another 
And my parents they remain 
At the shack with Lorraine 
And my aunt and my grandpa 
And brother 

We walked past the tarmac 
And boarded the craft 
The rain had me chilled to the bones 
Just the three of us 
Took flight that night 
Uncle Richard, me, 
And James Earl Jones 

And the pilot 
He gave me a blanket 
And the tall dark man 
Sang to me in deep rich tones

Of those who had the guts to try and fail
And then I ended up in jail

Seems the police had made a computer mistake
Said there must be thousands like me with the same name

""Good morning, Mr. Ben. 
It's about 6:30 
Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 

Um, just laying here in the bed, 
Half awake, half asleep, 
Thinking about you. 

I was 
Wondering if you were looking after your 
Most valuable 
Possession
Your mind. 

I was thinking about 
John Glenn, 
His space journey and all. 

They said that 
When you're in space you lose 
Muscle mass 
And the body 
Mass 
And I wondered if there was any 
End to it. 

Or whether, 
If you didn't exercise in space, 
How long it would be before you were just 
A head, or a mind,
And have no body or arms. 
You'd have them but you couldn't use them. 

I was wondering if 
If your body mass would drop to a certain level, 
And then it would stop right there. 
And keep whatever you needed to 
Use your mind 
Because it would still be working."" 

(30 seconds remaining) 

""Anyway, I was just pondering that. 
What do you think about, that? 

I hope everything is going alright. 
I may well wake up here in a little while

Being male, middle-class and white
It's a b*tch, if you don't believe
Listen up to my new CD

I got sh*t runnin' throught my brain
It's so intense that I can't explain
All alone in my white-boy pain

I can feel that someone's blasting me with hate

Dad said, son you're fucking high
And i thought, yeah there's a first for everything
So i took my old man's advice
Three sad semesters
It was only 15 grand spent in bed
I thought about the army
I dropped out and joined a band instead

Got a job at chick-fil-a

On the eve of my election

And my ex-wives all despise me

To lose my southern accent?
Did I make me up
Or make the face 'til it stuck?

You gave me was fine
I liked the theories about
My little stage
And I swore I was listening
But I started drifting
Around the part about me
Acting my age
And now if it's all the same
I've people to entertain
I juggle one handed
Do some magic tricks and
The best imitation of myself

Maybe I'm thinking
Myself in a hole
Wondering who I am
When I ought to know
Straighten up now

Fool somebody else

East with them
And west within

But I can't help it
With you the good and bad

Don't want you hanging out
With no one but me
Now if it's all the same
It comes from the same place
And if my mind's somewhere else

Are part of me, come out from time to time 
Probably no one I know now would notice

And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up, I've landed

The daily dramas she made from nothing
So nothing ever made them right
She liked to push me and talk me back down
Until I believed I was the crazy one
And in a way
I guess I was

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye I tried
Treading a sea of a troubled mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye, goodbye I tried

Because I've been on some other planet
So come pick me up

I told her I would not be down with that

And hope to god the friends at work don't see us.
Tonight she if I'd ever seen jesus
''cause she had backstage passes for the three of us

Ben Folds,"Why do we frown?
Is it something within us
Or in the world at large?
Maybe it's both, y'all
Sadness deep inside
Something we can't hide
We yearn for the past but it's not there
And it makes me frown
Yeah, it makes me frown

You look at the news
Always giving me the blues
War, death and chaos
All around me now
And the media's controlled
People do just what they're told
Just want to stand up and yell, ""Is anybody out there?""
'Cause it makes me frown
Yeah, it makes me frown

It's hard to find hope
But maybe we can learn to cope
By listening to one another
It's a trust thing
'Cause I know that you have feared
'Cause I know the end is near
But just lend an ear
And we can make it happen
'Cause it makes me frown
Makes everybody frown

Oh, I know it can get hard
When you look out your backyard
See the ozone falling apart before you
And recycling's a bitch
I've got just one wish
(That his children won't grow up in a freakin' trash can)

A piano's all I got
And I know that ain't a lot
Music has the power
To change the future
So what do you think
'Bout my message of hope?
Better get with the program
Before it's too late, y'all
So if you wanna start right now
You better take that fuckin' frown
Better turn it upside down

Just give in to love
Yeah, give in to love
Give it up for love

It's gotta be love

Gotta help me doc, I don't know where to start.
When she walked right out that door
Left me cryin on the floor
She said she's only going to the store

Dr.Yang, What's the lovesick diagnosis?
Cause she said she cannot cope with my neurosis
You would think I had chronic halitosis
Dr.Yang

Dr.Yang, now her voicemail box is full
And she won't call me, I'm feeling like a fool
The last time I saw her in her car
I threw her shit out in the yard,
Locked her out and headed to the bar

Dr.Yang, What's the lovesick diagnosis?
Cause she said she cannot cope with my neurosis
I could always hurt myself, doctor she knows this
Dr.Yang

All the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldn't get back my girlfriend

Dr. Yang, if you can't fix my heart and head (heart and head)
Actually there is something you can do instead (do instead)
Call my girlfriend from your number
Explain that you're a doctor
Tell her that I love her so
She hurt me more than she could know
And even with all your degrees
There's nothing you can do for me
She won't have to block my number any more

Don't leave me, I need you""

He tried to stop a while back
But what is he without her?
A one hit wonder with no hits is what he is

And anyway
He always hears how much it means to people
There's a lot of forty-somethings 
Who wouldn't be in the world without it
So now he does it with this lyric in his head

Belinda, I loved you
I'm sorry that I left you
I met somebody younger on a plane
She had big breasts
A nice smile
No kids either
She gave me complimentary champagne 

No one ever wants to hear the song he wrote for Cindy
""Cindy, I love you
I need you, don't leave me""
And he can't blame them, they can tell
His heart was never in it
And Cindy never liked it but
She never much liked him

Belinda, I loved you
I'm sorry that I left you
I met somebody younger on a plane

He feels the old self-loathing
While the old folks in the audience sing along
And he smiles and waves the mic at them
So they can do the chorus
But he's not there, he's somewhere else
He's with Belinda

Ben Folds,"So she stands and waits and waits at the school gate
They're late, they come, so dumb
In two cars when they agreed one
And it's gone wrong on her birthday
So they go to Joe's for pizza and ice cream
They sit and stare and Claire just wants to be 9 and a half
Next year she'll tell them she only wants world peace

But Claire, Claire baby
I wish you knew how this all got twisted
I wish you could see right inside us
'Cause all of this stuff, the best of us that we can't get out

What's the point of this
What's wrong with two birthdays
It's cool at school 
Her friends, they all have two birthdays
Oh geez, he just asked the waitress out on a date on her birthday

But Claire, Claire baby
I wish you knew how this all got twisted
I wish you could see right inside us

Goodbyes outside; it's cold in LA

Lobby of the forest
With freighters, hustlers, hard up millionaires

Mobsters, cops,
Whores, pimps, and Marxists
All human life is there
In the forest all you need is eyes and ears

Man in a wheelchair listens to the chatter
Writes down all the insane crap he hears.

He can't move around but it doesn't really matter
In the farthest stall you needed his eyes and ears

And out they pour the hits and the misses
Turn me loose, lonely avenue
And down in Nashville, Elvis sings ""Suspicion""
Pomus, Shuman, 1962

And he could never be one of those happy cripples
The kind that smile and tell you life's okay.

He was mad as hell.
Frightened and bitter,
He found a way to make his feelings pay.

Back at the forest in the steakhouse of a lobby
A diner gets 3 bullets in the head.

Doc looks down eating his linguine
Thinking up a lyric for the dead.

Turn me loose, lonely avenue
And down in Nashville, Elvis sings ""Suspicion""

Damon Runyon Junior and the ? orchestra

He was with Martha, she was with Tom
Neither of them really knew what was going on
A strange feeling of never, heartbeats becoming synchronized

It's been that way forever but most of the time it's just near misses
Or kisses once at a bookstore, once at a party
She came in as he was leaving and years ago at the movies
She sat behind him, the 6:30 showing of ""While You Were Sleeping""

He never once looked around

Lost and sad and small
But there's nothing to be done for them
It doesn't work that way
Sure we all have soulmates but we walk past them every day

And it's not like they were ever 
Actually unhappy in the lives they lived
He married Martha, she married Tom

An ache, an absence, a phantom limb

An itch that could never be scratched

Three thousand cameras pointed at me.

""Well, you just knocked up the VP nominee's daughter.""

So I tell him, ""No, you got it wrong, mister,
Already got a girl, and her name is Bristol.""
And they all laugh and say, ""Where you been, sonny?
Your mother-in-law's a heartbeat from the presidency.""

And I say, ""Mother-in-law? No, we ain't getting married!""

And sex outside marriage is against our religion.

Their useless luck makes her want to cry

Another mom deserves some sparkling wine
And she nearly gives into the moment

Hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you, kick its backside

Ben Glover,"I can't form a sentence
To save my life
I try to coin a phrase
But I can't make it sound right
I feel helpless
A little dumb
I'm an educated fool
With a brain gone numb
All I wanna do is let you know that you
You had the heart to change the heart of me
You took me to a love I never knew

26 letters is all I got
To tell you how I feel about you
26 letters and you know I'm never ever
Gonna write the perfect paragraph
I try to express
With adjectives of thankfulness
But, I don't know if I can do it
With 26 letters

I could be a scholar
I could be a sage
I could write a million books
And be the latest rage
I still can't say enough
For what you've done for me
With this limited vocabulary
All I wanna do is let you know that you
You had the heart to change the heart of me
You took me to a love I never knew

On and on and on I go
With limited descriptive prose
And I give up 'cause I've said it all before",26 Letters
Ben Green,"Oh, it's a cold
Cold stone wall
One hand
One face against the wall
I watch the people and they're 
Each weighing their private losses
And the cold sweet morning air
Surrounds a crop of blank white crosses
I'm reading 
I'm not believing
they're all just names on a wall
They were once living hey were
Once breathing now
they're all just names
Names on a wall
Oh, I press my ear against the wall
I hear a helicopter, a bomb explode
I hear the echoes of a thousand souls
And then one young face
He says to me
Please remember me
I want to set him free
But all I see are
Blank white crosses stretched out to infinity
Chorus
Hey Johnny
Can you hear your momma call?
Hey Johnny
She leaves the light on in the hal

Ben Green,"I sit at my window watching the rain
Counting the cars on Riverside
I wish we were on a plane in the blue skies baby
Looking down on the clouds and the rain
From the other side

[Chorus]
Take me to paradise
Let’s go away
Take me to paradise

Somewhere someone is taking it slowly 
Someone is lying under the sun
I wish we could get away to those blue skies, baby
Maybe we could forget all the reasons we wanted to run

I wish we could find a place 
Where you and I would be the only ones
It’s just you and me, It’s just you and me

Ben Green,"Do you think that I would love you if I were famous
How 'bout if somebody made me king
Why can't you say that I already rule the world
And no one else could give me anything

Do you think that I would leave you for somebody better
Do you think that I want someone new
Why can't you see that I've got everything
And I can't go any farther without you

Without you there's no finding joy in sadness
Silver linings don't appear on any clouds
And there ain't no finding any sense in madness
Without you only emptiness surrounds me

Do you think I don't hear you when you're calling
Have I given any reason for concern
Why can't you see that I hear everything
What I don't understand I'll try to learn

Without you I've got nothing to go back on
'Cause this house could never really be a home 
And there ain't no one to light up this darkness
Without you I just stand alone

Just me baby
I only want to give you everything you need
Don't you know when you go that I'm the one who bleeds

To be around when it begins
But forever never seems
To be around when it ends

Every single day
Runnin' 'round all over town
Givin' their forever away
But no not me, I won't let my forever roam
And now I hope I can find my forever home
So give me your forever

We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray

Than you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you
Than live in this pain and misery

They say time will
Make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows
And turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is droppin' on down
And once again you my friend are nowhere to be found

I know the devil prays

And you're working your way
From the ground on down

Because it means that I
Will be with you forever
Or will sadly say goodbye

I love to say I hate you
Because it means that I
Will live my life happily without you
Or will sadly live a lie

And you're working your way

With your time
You had best do well

Slowly turned in to a scream.
Searching for an answer
Where the question is unseen.
I don't know where you came from
And I don't know where you've gone.
Old friends become old strangers
Between darkness and the dawn

Amen omen,will I see your face again?
Amen omen,can I find the place within
To live my life without you?

I still hear you saying
""All of life is chance,
And is sweetest,is sweetest when at a glance""
But I live,
I live a hundred lifetimes in a day.
But I die a little
In every breath I take.

Amen omen,will I see your face again?
Amen omen,can I find the place within
To live my life without you?

I listen to a whisper,
Slowly drift away.
Silence is the loudest,
Parting word you never say.
I put I put your world
Into my veins
Now a voiceless sympathy
Is all that remains.

Amen omen,will I see your face again?

Now we're left as silent witnesses 
We don't know quite what this is 
Other than a war that can't be won 

I feel like I'm crowded, I can't get out 
World keeps on filling me up with doubt 
When you're trapped you got no voice 
Where you're born you got no choice 
Other than to go and take you some 

One dimensional fool 
In a three dimensional world 

Politics, it's a drag 
They put one foot in the grave 
And the other on the flag

Than struggling every day until you're done

I just wish you'd pin a rose on me
Now you won't even come out and take a bow
Crying won't help you now

Crying won't help you now

So now your poets have all put down their pens
The only songs to sing are those sung again
Lonely just doesn't look good on you somehow
Crying won't help you now

Crying won't help you now

Now I just keep on staring
Into the black eyes of truth
We'll have to learn to live on somehow

Love's the longest promise 
That you're ever gonna break 

I wish I could yell sorry 
Louder than I screamed 
All of those other things 
I said but didn't mean 

Some days I'm the lord's servant 
Some days I'm Satan's pawn 
Some days I just wish 
The voices in my head were gone 

The sun's a moon that warms you 
The moon's a sun with no heat 
The sky above is to remind you 
What's under your feet

To leave all this time we've been wasting",Engraved Invitation
Ben Harper,"You're too young to know 
That you're too young to go 
There's no freedom to be found 
Lying face up in the ground 

Ashes from an unfinished life 
Are all that's left 
In a tear-drop-shaped locket 
Hanging from his mother's chest 

You whip the back of freedom 
'Till it bleeds an oil stream 
Then you sail down upon it

And scream out loud I'm free 
Cause wrong is the new right 
So we can cut loose tonight 
It costs a lot to look this cheap 

Fire makes it burn and water makes it turn 
We must still be here living on earth 
They keep telling me Jesus walked on water 
He shoulda surfed 

In 1918 the great bambino 
Kicked a piano into Willis Pond 
But Johnny Damon swung a bat 
Grand slam that was that 
An eighty six year curse is gone

Ben Harper,"The morning sunrise spread her wings 
While the moon hung in the sky 
Held the sea in your hands 
And happy ever after in your eyes 

Couldn't leave you to go to heaven 
I carry you in my smile 
For the first time my true reflection I see 
Happy ever after in your eyes 

Every star in the night 
Promises the dawn 
I will be there if you fall 
To ever so heavily rest upon

Hasn't been so good to me 
Stepped out into the night 
Back against the moon 
I saw ten thousand hands with candlelight 
We all think that we're right 
It's hard to tell 
If the night is full of hope or doom 

My eyes 
Burn with unshed tears 
My body is weak 
From so many silent years 
Too many people say goodbye 
Before they say hello 
Step into the morning 
And disappear 

What more than sorry can I say 
What more than sorry can I be 
Before our love fades away 
What more than sorry 
Do you want from me",More Than Sorry

It's a morning yearning 
Pull the curtains shut, try to keep it dark

The world awakens on the run 
And will soon be earning 
With hopes of better days to come 
It's a morning yearning 

Another day, another chance to get it right 
Must I still be learning

Like a summer rose, I'm a victim of the fall 
But am soon returning

My morning yearning",Morning Yearning
Ben Harper,"Like an old man 
Sitting alone at a lunch counter 
Like a small town girl 
A big city devours 
Some of us laugh 
Even in our darkest hour 

Never leave lonely alone 

Unspoken rules of solitude 
Wound without a trace 
A lifetime of dreams roll down your face 
All that we can't say

Here with me tomorrow 

So many wasted days 
The past is so hard to get out from under 
So many words that I wish I could say 
The future rattles my bones weak like thunder 

I wish you were here 
So we could walk and talk

You walk into the temple 
And call it a church 
I try to keep things simple 
But you always need the works 
Your life is marked by numbers and symbols 
Excessive drinking from out of golden thimbles 
Just a moment of silence I'm needing 

So let's not talk about murder while I'm eating 

You get all hot and bothered 
At the strangest times and places

All you ever wanted was someone to run to you 
There's more to life than what makes you cry

I look into the mirror

They all want you to serve them 
But the only one you got to serve 
Is your soul 

So much time 
And at such a cost 
We spend looking for what we've lost

And brightest sunrise ever to touched my eyes.

And through it all,
I stood and stumbled, waded through my thoughts and heart
Yeah through it all,
I fooled and fumbled, lost to the poet's frown.
I fought the wolves of patience just to let it lie down.

See these waters they'll pull you up,
Oh, now if you're bolder than the darkness.
My my, let these songs be an instrument to cut,
Oh spaces 'tween the happiness and the hardness.
My my, spaces 'tween the happiness and the hardness.

Oh, out the door,
The touch of morning, the burning of the frost
Out the door
My, strong hands to hold, good friends that I never lost.

And what we found
Down these coves of limestone and cockle shells,
What we found
Down these roads that wander as lost as the heart,
Is a chance to breathe again, a chance for a fresh start to you
My my a chance to breathe again, a chance for a fresh start to you
Oh my a chance to breathe again, a chance for a fresh start

Oh, no, see these waters they'll pull you up,

Stood here watching my own death
But a few things going my way this time
Got a woman at home
She treats me well

Slumber
Not in my lifetime
Won't spend my days in my bed
Make a whole scene, gather round come see it my way
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well

Well she's alright
When everyone is wrong
Well she's alright
Let's me waste another song
Stumble through the years
I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next
And now it serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well",She Treats Me Well
Ben Howard,"All in my mind
I walked down Mayflower Road again
The wailing sound
Echoes from the park seems so absurd
The bird stained towers
I knew it would but I can’t shake the sting
Can’t spend my time on everybody else
If buildings fell at least we’d be in matrimony
I can't control the words
Kaleidoscope inside my head

Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me
Is it all so very bad?
I can’t see
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me

Saw the police
Screaming something trivial like
'Keep the peace'
The world moves on and
You can’t shake the sound
I know she’s home
Waiting on somebody holding life
All in my mind the anvil and
The weight upon my back

Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me
Is it all so very bad?
I can’t see
All these small things they gather round me
Gather around me
And I can’t see my love

Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me
Is it all so very bad?
I can’t see
All these small things they gather round me

Ben Jansson,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April

looking out
looking back across the sky,
Trying to find a meaning,
knowing that I just left it all behind
Still I smell a lingering softness
Where did she go,
how did she go,
I want to know
I want to know that she'll be coming
here to me

Come on,
without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on, come on, come on

Thinking back before her,
I never knew the meaning of alone
Still the flag is feeling foreign,
I live the day to escape into a phone
Speaking of a world not real then
where did she go
how did she go,
I want to know
I want to know that she'll be coming
here to me

desiring to kiss her now,
I'm living for her,
breathing for her,
singing for her fairytale.

Ben Lee,"On the tv there's a picture frame with two separate photos in it
My two sisters that's just about the closest they've been
My folks will tell you they've been that way forever
I can't remember the last time they were in the same room together

You'll hear stories about how they used to fight
Screaming slamming doors keep the neighbors up at night
And me their evil baby child brother
Just about the last thing they have in common with each other

Two sisters everything is awkward, tense
Don't know each other and it doesn't make sense at all
Two sisters both led lives extreme
Tried to erase any similarities

Married, single, secure, a floating balloon
Tried to forget the fact that they both came from the same womb
Two sisters a deadly combination
Avoid it at all costs it's not worth the frustration

Maybe a brother and a sister would be best for all
Two sisters had so much in common
Now they don't know each other at all
You thought that they'd grow closer with age
You were mistaken, they'll go to their graves apart
Not regretting what they didn't do
Never missing the sister that they never knew

Maybe the friendly sibling myth is a scam
I don't know any siblings that walk around holding hands
Maybe we all expect too much of them
Not only to be sisters but also to be friends

Maybe two sisters need to fight scream and weep
Maybe if two sisters don't fight
Then two sisters will never speak
Keep your theories and parent psychology
It doesn't hold with me

When I was a kid I was smart, at the top of the class
When I was a lad I was sure I had the world in my hands
I was my own teacher I had my own plan

I could have been an athlete could have trained all the time
Been just like the others could have left them behind
But I was too lazy I could not see ahead
All I thought of was music that was filling my head

I could have been a painter painting life in a rush
All I saw in a day on canvas with my brush
But I was just painting my life in a song
Getting all the chords right getting all the words wrong

I could have been a writer with a back catalogue
Full of stories of crimes, sex and beer, girls and drugs
But instead I was writing my first song so bad
On the cheapest guitar that the music store had

Cause instead I strummed on guitars
Instead I wasted my time
And I strummed on guitars

I could have been a lawyer defending some guy
With a paycheck so big for my heart paid to lie
But instead I was keeping the truth to myself
In the records I placed one by one on my shelf

I could have been a champion, man of the year
Wave to the crowd as they scream and cheer
But here I am playing to people sat down
Nursing their beers while I play the clown

And instead I strummed on guitars
Instead I wasted my time
And I strummed on guitars

I could have been a racing car driver speed mad
Seeking the thrills that my youth never had
But instead I was busy enjoying my age
With teen punk rock anthems and hearts paid to rage

I could have been a scientist, doctor or man
With a stethoscope diagnosing ladies' old hands
But instead I built fret-callous fingertip scars
On my ten year old hands meant for toy ships and cars

And instead I strummed on guitars
Instead I wasted my time
Strummed on guitars

Ben Lee,"I didn't see it coming
I just thought that you were friendly
But here we are passionately embraced
I suppose it's kind of funny
But it's also kind of scary
That your kiss brought back a feeling I'd erased

When you said that you were lonely
And I said I thought you would be
Then you took me to a darker holy place
Then I said I liked to kiss you
And you said you loved to kiss me
Then kissed the sweetest kiss I'll ever taste

But you're growing like a flower in me
I've known you for a lifetime
Or we're soul mates from a past life

It's all mixed with indecision
And a painful soulful spilling
Of everything I've ever felt or known
And you know that they're all looking
So you kiss me even harder
Then hold me and I just feel right at home

Your touch is soft and tender
So I raise my flag surrender
Then say I feel you staring at my soul
And it makes them all feel awkward
But our time here's more important
So we sink into our closed eyed painful hole

I'm scared of what will happen
So I kiss you, say I'll call you
Then I tell you so much I don't understand
Then you kiss me with an answer
And my question seems invalid
And I go to bed with daisies in my hand

I call you there's no answer
But I know I have to see you
So I call and call and call and call again
But you never get my message
Or you choose not to return it
Because you shouldn't, needn't, wouldn't or just can't

I'm lonely and I love you
For the moment that is what's true in me
I've known you now forever
Joined at the soul together
Daisy

There'll be no way to avoid you
When I see you in the movies
And I realize right now you're not here with me
If I'll see you in my lifetime
If again I'll feel you kiss me
I suppose that I'll just have to wait and see

But for now I'll just be grateful
To be touched by such an angel
And put it down as life experience
That my muse is just a daisy
With the most beautiful nature
Will one day fall back in my flower bed

And I know you said you love me
And that's the only memory left for me
Cause I need you more than ever

Sometime in 1995
The other half of the world
The other side

It might have been warm outside, maybe cold
Who could tell? 
Three of us stumbled into room 421
At the grammercy park hotel

It's 3 am in new york
We sat for a while
We started to talk
We started to smile

Then he played a song I knew very well
3 am in new york
At the grammercy park hotel

He passed the guitar around
Over and over and over again
Till one of us broke a string
It was probably him

But the songs came out strong
They were loud, they were long
There were songs about girls, about boys
Sung a lot, screamed a lot
We made lots of noise

It's 3 am in new york
It's the time of my life
Minstrels and maidens and heartbroken songs
Made me cry

And we were anonymous, androgynous
Bearers of truth
And the indie rock columnists would have freaked out
If they knew

It's 3 am in new york
And I knew we were right
We were young, not so young
And in love with our lives

3 am in new york
I went back to bed
Three lone true prophets
With songs in our heads

It's 3 am in new york
And I just felt god
Lying awake in the dark
I was in awe

And I know in reality
It might not be true
But for three of us here in new york
It's all we could do

I know it's just songs, played on guitars
It's not rocket science, flying to mars
And I know it's not much, but it's all that I have
To be sure that I'm real
Again and again

And if there comes a day
When my fingers don't work
Or my voice loses sound
Gives me grief, gives me hurt
Well, I swear on that day
When I lose what's worthwhile
From that day forth I never shall smile

Seen through the window of a train
A boy and girl stand side by side
The train arrives, she kisses him goodbye

She turns away then steps on board
He thought he'd die but now he's sure
But as he thinks of one last thing to say
The train just rolls away

I pass a station with no sign
An old man gets on the train just in time
He used to love this town despite the rain
But since his wife died it's not been the same

He curses himself, he was weak
At his wife's grave he could not speak
But as he thinks that maybe he should stay
The train just rolls away

The driver likes his coffee strong and hot
The train he drives is everything he's not
He watches the sad people board the train
Then laughs as he pulls out and rolls away

Hits a hundred, no holding back
Then his dear train comes off the track
The news report said instant death, no pain
But who's really to say?

But who's really to say?
The train just rolled away

Ben Lee,"I've been looking for some kick
Looking for one trick
To get through the day

I've tried watching the time pass
Watching the hourglass
Do you ever get the feeling that you just don't want to play? 

I'm finding it strange such
That people don't change much
'til they're torn apart

Keep one eye on the object
And don't change the subject
Do you ever get the feeling that this is just the start? 

[Chorus]
Sandpaperback inside me
Sandpaperback inside me
Sandpaperback inside me
I've been saved by
I've been saved by you

It's just another thing that I'm wanting
Time that I'm wondering
If I could bend

And I don't believe that things just repeat
Do you ever get the feeling that history must end?

And dearly departed
You leave a city broken-hearted
Or you were never never really there
And dearly departed
You leave a city broken-hearted
Or you were never never really there

Ben Lee,"So glad you're coming
I've nothing on my mind
If I could only visit
The places that you hide

It's blurred against the background
It vanishes as soon as you tell
I know this feeling
I know this feeling well

Despite these complications
There's nothing on my mind
Turn and face it properly
If you have to look behind

It's buried in the chaos
It vanishes as soon as you tell
I know this feeling
I know this feeling well

You're broken and I want it
You're broken and I want it

I got a weakness
Can I beat this?
The autumn leaves
Falling in the breeze
Are not my fault
There's a storm over yonder
You gotta wonder
What it's all about
Destiny was never up to me
And it's not my fault,
Your love's like salt

The aftertaste is gonna break my heart
Feels like it's over before it starts
The aftertaste is gonna break my heart

And I really didn't need this
Don't want to be this
Don't want to see this
I'm fallin' in,
I'm going there again
And it's not my fault
Are you sick of pretending?
That all this trouble is really ending
The way things break
Every step you take
Is not my fault

Another ship sunk, family tree trunk, deep scar diving, I look for you,
And we're hoping and we're choking, something borrowed, something blue.

Ben Lee,"I'm walking down Broadway
Each foot step is a new love letter
I'm trying to make eye contact
With each and every stranger that I pass
Thinking about the city
It's living proof people need to be together
I'm thinking about how I just want to open up
And give and give and give
And it's OK for you to care
Cause I can feel you in the air
And while you wonder ""how's this gonna end?""
I only want it to begin

I'm thinking about desire
I've had to learn how to sin successfully
I'm thinking about bliss
And bliss is all dressed up
And there's no one to dance with
Remembering her smile and the nuclear bomb
And the reasons I loved her
Walking through Central Park
I'm in a foreign country and I'm waiting for a sign
That it's ok for you to care
Cause I'm not going anywhere
And while you wonder if you should let me in
I only want it to begin

I'm still singing
Twisting new melodies, breaking arrangements
Thinking about my heart
I guess you've heard, sometimes it's heavy
But I just keep moving
When I hit a wall, I look up at the sky
I'm thinking about my maker
In spite of all this I know she won't give up on me
And it's OK for you to care
Cause I can taste you everywhere
While it's true
All straight things must bend

Then we're kissing
Finding out what I've been missing

Heaven's above
Sex without love
I thought you wanted me
I thought you wanted me
Heaven's above
Sex without love
I thought I wanted you
I thought I wanted you

To lay down
Lay down beside me
But here we are and it feels weird with you
I wish someone would tell me
Where is my baby
And how I found myself right here tonight
This is not my kind of danger
Taking candy from a stranger

[Chorus]

This whole thing is getting strange
I sorta wish I never came
All this talk and playing games
Is slowly driving
Me insane

In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You (Now It's Your Turn to Cry for Me)
Ben Light,"All our friends keep knocking at the door
They've asked me out a hundred times or more
But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom""
And here I stay within my lonely room
'Cause

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that
I don't want to walk without the sunshine

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,

Ben Light,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

Ben Mazué,"14 ans, limite 15
Ce soir elle a de grands projets
14 ans mais très bientôt 15
Ce soir, elle abordera le grand sujet

Comme elle a une grande sœur, elle sait qu'avec l'âge viennent les excès
Et prendre de l'âge à 14 piges c'est
Comme un gage de qualité
Elle s'était coiffée 17 ans, sapée genre meuf qui 17 ans,
Maquillée je te, non,je te raconte pas comment

Pendant que de l'autre côté de la scène un type collégien
14 ans comme elle, vient de..partir la rejoindre
Quelques mois qu'ils se pratiquent, qu'ils se connaissent
Par milliers, ils s'en laissent des messages, trempés dans le sucre

Pratiquent ce numéro pour déverser l'amour
Quand des flots d'hormones inondées et
En un quart de tour
Brûle en comique
Parfois quand ils s'enflamment pour quelques heures 
Quand pour quelqu'un que tu connais pas,
Tu donnerais ta mère et ta sœur

L'amour adolescent, adossé dans les sens
Virevoltant, déhanchant des innocences et dans le sens
C'est toujours dans mes pensées, c'est tellement beau,puissant
Si tu le sais pas, elle te rappellera que Roméo avait 16 ans

Alors le voilà dévalant l'avenue du 11 novembre
La voilà l'attendant, docile et tendre
Elle aime qu'il l'aime, il aime grandir, 
Il aime qu'elle vienne de loin juste pour le voir sourire

Qu'elle dit à ces mains qui traînent
Presque au dessus des fesses
Il tremble comme une feuille à chaque caresse
C'est pas le stress,non, c'est pas l'excitation, c'est juste un test
Allez vas y mon garçon

Mais rien n'y fait, rien ne s'estompe
Un peu plus tard, pour réduire les effets
Il se cachera pour faire des pompes
On lui a tellement dit, faut pas forcer la main des filles, il faut les protéger
Qu'a l'heure de faire l'amour il réalise qu'en fait, c'est lui l'objet?

Alors toujours bouche contre bouche, 
Touche contre coucher et elle se débrouille 
Pour que ses yeux sur ses seins viennent loucher
Elle retire son soutien-gorge
Après qu'il est tout tenté
Tout entier dévoué à une seule cause

Il regrettera le temps des toges parce que là, c'est compliqué
De retirer à une seule main ce genre de chose
Les chaussettes aussi, c'est vrai, c'est le passage délicat,
Elle y arrive qu'avec les pieds
Mais lui, il arrive pas

C'est l'aventure et c'est laborieux
Mais c'est le temps et sa cambrure
Qu'ils tiennent dans leur petit jeu
Maintenant qu'on en est là, sous les draps, le reste n'est qu'animal
Elle sera courageuse, il fera tout pour qu'elle n'est pas mal

Il a les yeux plus ouvert que jamais, pourtant c'est le noir complet
Deux fois en dessous, trois fois au dessus
Elle pense a sa sœur qu'il l'a fait
Elle se dit qu'elle, ça y est

Elle constate qu'il ne tremble plus.",14 Ans
Ben Mazué,"En soirée appart', y'a deux types de dragueuse
Celles des salons, les danseuses
Et celles des cuisines et des balcons, les parleuses
Elle, c'était une parleuse

Elle avait de la bouteille,
C'était très agréable d'ailleurs de parler avec elle
Le genre elle était jamais vraiment loin de toi
Pendant toute la soirée
C'est la coïncidence heureuse des filles
Qui provoquent l'occasion sans trop la provoquer
Abordent sans déborder
D'une façon prudente et silencieuse

Et tout s'accélère quand elle parle
C'est comme un appât qu'elle vous tendait avec ses cils
Elle vous a ferré et son arme réside dans sa manière de vous relancer
Sa cible, vous séduire
En commençant par vous faire rire
Quelques naïves confessions vous permettent de penser
Qu'elle n'est pas maladroite en talons compensés comme simple tenue
Et que vous seriez sûrement très bien tous nus
Et même si c'est déjà vendu,
Même si l'évidence est rendue,
On traîne souvent longtemps sur le palier de la séduction 
Avant de se hisser vers un enlacement salivaire
Quand on est une dragueuse de cuisine et de balcon, on préfère

Les danseuses, elles, sont plus franches du collier
On se séduit, d'accord, mais pour vite s'embrasser
Et là je sais qui y'aura rien
Jusqu'à ce qu'en trois minutes j'ai entre mes mains ses seins
Et au bout de ma langue, cht
Elle connaît tout le monde, elle a quelques rires, vagabonde
Le corps joliment dessiné, elle est bien habillée,
Elle a 35 ans, elle me l'a dit mais ça se voyait,
J'ai pas été surpris
35 ans ça fait 10 ans de plus que moi
10 ans de plus
Imagine, moi, si je draguais 10 ans de moins que moi?
N'importe quoi

J'ai pas de passion pour les filles plus vieilles en particulier,
Loin de moi l'idée de penser que c'est un défi ou une case à cocher
Mais elle n'a d'âge que l'expérience en plus, elle a pas changé de vie,
Pas de marmots en bas-âge, de maison dans le Vaucluse, et, surtout, pas de mari
Donc ça me fait une raison de plus de pas reculer alors vas-y continue de parler, continue
Je n'ai qu'une seule et même idée

La soirée se finit
Et la soirée continue, rejoins-moi tu m'as dit,
Et j'ai pas répondu
Mais je te garantis
Que c'est marché conclus",25 Ans
Ben Mazué,"Allô? C'est lui-même, ouais. Oui, je veux bien, ouais, j'ai le temps
Oh, vous savez, moi, je suis à la retraite depuis vingt ans donc, euh

J'allais dire, c'est de mon âge, hein
Je regarde les séries pourries avec les pubs
Pour les fauteuils électriques qui permettent de monter à l'étage. Voilà
Trois heures par jour à peu près, je sais pas, je compte pas hein non plus
Il m'arrive de rester longtemps dehors, surtout l'été
Je profite mieux qu'à la fenêtre
À l'affût d'un événement qui me sorte d'un quotidien pas trop dégueu du reste
Moi, j'ai pas peur là, comme vous, les jeunes
De tomber, de me planter, de l'avenir et du reste
J'ai fait ce qu'il fallait quand il fallait
Et ce qu'il manquait, je l'ai digéré depuis des lustres, alors!
Sans ceinture de sécurité, sans casque!
Sans souci de la ""biodiversité""
On a su tenir. On avait d'autres problèmes
Et pas moins gros d'ailleurs mais j'ai le souvenir que quand même 'fin bon
Ce qui est sûr, c'est que là, entre vous et moi, le plus près de la fin
C'est pas le moins serein
Et vous avouerez que c'est bizarre
Ok, j'ai plus rien à prouver mais c'est pas la perte d'un emploi
qui m'attend au bout du couloir là
C'est la Mort, connard, et je te le dis franchement, je l'attends
J'en ai moins peur depuis quelque temps et, si jamais ""au delà"" il y a
y'aura plus de potes là-bas que dans mon appartement
Ça va, la vie, je l'aime bien quand même, hein!
J'irai pas me foutre en l'air volontairement
J'apprécie pas grand chose mais c'est devenu beaucoup parce que
Des pas grands choses, dans la vie, y'en a plus que des gros coups
Un café, un peu de soleil, sérieux, c'est juste ça
Je m’émerveille, sobrement, mais je m'émerveille
Voilà, j'ai gagné cette série T avec des épreuves, mon petit, t'as pas idée
Si je te les raconte, je te donne pas trois minutes pour décrocher!
Et raccrocher

Pourtant, je suis pas de l'époque des grandes guerres
Moi, c'est les Trente Glorieuses et le plein emploi!
Et je te garantie qu'on avait de quoi se faire de la bile
Alors écoute un peu le vieillard et lâche un peu la bride
Je suis pas de l'époque des grandes guerres, moi
C'est les Trente Glorieuses et puis le plein emploi
Mais je te garantie qu'on avait de quoi se faire de la bile
Alors écoute un peu le vieillard et lâche un peu la bride

L'occident décline, la croissance recule? C'est vrai
Mais, sans croissance, pas de perspectives
Sans perspectives, des jeunes comme vous, désœuvrés
Maintenant, peut-être qu'on a arrêté de croître parce qu'on est déjà très haut
Et il serait temps d'inventer, je sais pas moi, des trucs nouveaux!
Le monde de demain, tiens!
Parce qu'on va pas sans cesse compter sur le fait de grossir
C'est pas la peine
Il est mort dans l’œuf
Le rêve qu'on finisse tous par atteindre la classe moyenne américaine
Mais tant pis, vous, au lieu de dire ""venez, on invente""
Vous dites ""venez, on reproduit""!
J'ai rarement vu moins rebelle que votre génération d'abrutis
D'individus individualistes, vaguement divisés sur des sujets futiles et vains
Mais unis comme jamais dans la peur du lendemain
Ce qu'il vous faut? Je vais vous le dire ce qu'il vous faut
Pépère, ce qu'il vous faut
C'est une bonne guerre",73 Ans

There's no sense reaching out

For a cause or a remedy
I've done all I can 
I just don't understand
Why it's all got to come down to me

Ben Nichols,"Born under a south Kentucky sky
He’d come west to Mexico to fight 1842 at Mier 
The gutters filled with blood and fear
Barely made it back to Texas alive

With Missouri Volunteers when the war began 
In ’46 they crossed the Rio Grande
There he met his dark-eyed love

But said good bye when the war was done
He swore that he’d come back for her again

Oh oh novia
Oh oh your man is gone
Maybe he’s in Texas
But we’ll take what God has left us 
And we’ll leave for California with the dawn

Worked his way back to Old Mexico
To reclaim the love he’d left two years ago 
Back to those same city walls 
Where he’d watched copper cannonballs 
Like wayward suns roll down the cobblestones

They put him in a prison left alone
With other yankee fools so far from home
Parade them through the square in chains
‘Till in rode Captain Glanton’s gang
Apache scalps for bounties paid in gold

Glanton’s men were killers all by trade
And through the prison bars a deal was made 
Glanton needed three new men 
Hired the lovelorn veteran
The killers rode out through the governor’s gates

The Veteran left camp ‘fore the rising sun
No killer he’d left other work undone
He was not yet two days out
When Glanton’s naked native scouts
Brought back his empty horse and his brand new gun",Chambers

You worked the flat boats and walked the streets

And costumes of war 
Hell ain't that full boy hear me

we set out as men of reason armed with navy colts 
Look away
Look away
Work paid in gold 

but you stood witness to yourself our trial you did betray

we killed in the dessert we killed in the streets 
We choose what shall and shall not be 
We stood with pistols fought back to back
Now you've stood your ground but what ground is that

There's a light yet to be found

And I don't see nothing but the light

The devil, he knows how to write
Killer of men, no way to save them
Hey now we all have to die

You wouldn't think that out here
A man could simply run clear
Out of country, but oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, nothing but the light

They took my ears in Omaha
I thought me dead but I weren't at all
And I left them bleeding in the mud
They ran in me for horse thievery
Between my eyes for all to see
And I left them bleeding in the mud

When this wall was made
It was never meant to save everyone in kind
I don't believe God much had me, had me much in mind

You wouldn't think that out here
A man could simply run clear
Out of country, but oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, there's nothing but the light

So tell the barkeep, ""What is there to drink?""
Just a minimal risk of blindness or death
It all taste of ashes, seems that's always what we get
It's all they have to give

Now I hunt heathens 'cause it pays better than the Lord
I ride with Demons, The Devil at my side
Be it us or the heathens, we must all pay a heavy price

I've seen
The hoof prints cloven in the stone
Now tell me what kind of devil
Trod there long ago
With a sack of sinners souls

There must be a place
Where this world and grace
Are made to meet

Judge Holden is the Devil and his Hell this Mexico
If Apache don't kill us, Judge Holden will for sure
Holden's more preacher than I ever was before
He preaches of reason, he preaches of war

Ben Perowsky,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Ben Perowsky,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,

Ben Pollack,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

It's been a real long time since I seen you girl
It's been a real long time in another world
I got scars to prove that I don't need you but the heart knows that I always do
You and me, could never be
We're forever leaving, you and me
And I couldn't tell you what I needed
But it's hard to speak when you're barely breathing
Does it take a broken heart to find that your all I needed all this time
You and me, could never be
We're forever leaving, you and me
You and me
You and me
Been giving up on the feeling, been giving up on believing, been giving up on you and me, woah

Qu'ils auront le souffle coupé

Ben Ricour,"Comme tout ce qui est grand
Au début ça n'a l'air de rien
C'est qu'une formule, une vision
Un coup du destin
Que l'on abandonne

Une hérésie, une erreur
Un manque de calcium
Qui révolutionne
En douce

Je me réveille
C'est pas trop tôt
Je me réveille
J'suis pris d'assaut
Ca me réveille
Faire ce qu'il faut

Un seul souci
Sous un si grand ciel

Je me réveille

Laisser passer
Les idées nouvelles

Je me réveille

Quelle heure?

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Ben Sidran,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street

Rain, your powers are astounding
When I lift this shell to my ear
I can hear your voice crying out
Rain, your magic's all around me
When you bring the heavens down
I can fly until I dry out

Maybe I'm only dreaming
Maybe I'm only foolish
Maybe I'm only deceiving myself and I'm not really ready to do this.

Rain, come down upon my ceiling
Wash my sorrow for me until I find some sleep
Jay, come haunt me while I'm healing
Remind tomorrow for me so I can get some peace

Maybe I'm only dreaming
Maybe I'm only foolish
Maybe I'm only deceiving myself and I'm not really ready to do this.

Rain, your voice is like the water
Wash your wisdom on me

Until my mind is free
I can see
All you have to do is to believe

Maybe I'm only dreaming
Maybe I'm only foolish
Maybe I'm only deceiving myself and I'm not really ready to do this.

He only lied and always had to pick a fight
He spends most of his time abroad now-a-days
So, now she's mine and I'mma get her back on track
I've drawn the line and I'm not looking back 
Because it's long past time and even if she's been through hell
With scars and lies she's still so fine, my America

Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky

Every man his daydreams 
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of 
Sticking to the soul

Rain comes after thunder
Winter comes after fall
Sometimes I think I'm not after
Anything at all

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)
Oh, I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner, yes I do
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky",Corner of the Sky
Ben Vereen,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis.
Your chance, finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.

And watched the sea take them away

'Cause you make me feel as right as rain

I wish I'd studied harder now, make something of myself
But instead, I'm just a shopkeeper but I mustn't blame myself
Oh, Hendra, oh, Hendra, there's still so much to gain
You make me feel as right as rain

All the self-help books, like the dance of life
Like the feel the fear and do it anyway
Sometimes, I have them right here in my hand
And think it's easier for you to say

But I must allow these feelings and let them fall
But sometimes I just turn the radio up so loud, I just drown them all
Oh, Hendra, oh, Hendra, where love is plain
You make me feel as right as rain, as right, not as wrong as rain

All the self-help books, like the dance of life
Like the feel the fear and do it anyway
Sometimes, I have them right here in my hand
And think it's easier for you to say",Hendra

I'm selling flowers round the pavement, made it nice up the place
I'm up the selling of business, my heart is an ended 
Without your face over the counter, without your face

Some nights I'm out there on the levels
Through the village, pass the church where we got married
And I can see for miles

Now, there is the future, what's it standing in my way?
Right now it's my past, and it's not moving forth

Some nights Im out there on the levels

And everybody has wounds that heal in time

Ben Watt,"There in a parking space, on the side of a trailer on the toe
On letters of five foot height, so simple against this hurragan sky
It says ""Nathaniel, we'll always love you! Nathaniel, we'll always love you""

I turn on the T.V. news, another disaster for a lonely multitude
The lingering rolling feet, candles and toys and
A sea of flowers, all from strangers, I think of Nathaniel,
""We'll always love you"", ""Nathaniel, we'll always love you!

At first, you deny it, and ten you get angry that they've gone
You try making a bargain, and then you accept it and you go on
I think of Nathaniel, ""we'll always love you!""
""Nathaniel, we'll always love you!""

You won't be the first, you won't be the first to loose control
Oh, but it's hard, it's so hard to feel the hole

Where the clouds just seem to linger over the hill side

Ben Watt,"I'm not as good as I used to be
at the late nights, but just look at me
I'm staking a claim in a young man's game tonight

Is it something that my old heart fears?
Missed time, chances, lost years
That means I'm taking aim at a young man's game tonight

One more chance to leave a mark
Imagining the answers in the dark
Such a simple step into the smoke and the light tonight

But who'd have thought I'd have turned this page?
Should I act this out or act my age?
Am I happy I came to the young man's game,
Where the bouncers know me by my name, tonight?

Oh I could I work this room
I could make some noise
Let's hear it for the girls and for the boys
For a moment be the same in the young man's game tonight

We're drinking Jaeger bombs but we're still on our feet
Heroes in a wild conceit
Fingering fame in the young man's game tonight

But every mirror just tells the time
Can you name a good fighter over 49?
I should douse my flame for the young man's game tonight

Take off this paper crown
And put these violins down
And renounce my claim on the young man's game tonight",Young Man's Game

And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?

I look for my heart
It`s perdido
I lost it way down in Torito
The day the fiesta started

Bolero,
I sway that they play the Bolero

Low, was the moon when we said, ""Adios""

A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

So early, early.

Ben Webster,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Shy little he and she
Were declaring love's old story
In the shade of the old apple tree

On a bicycle built for two

Hear the past, the song is old
The summer days are through
With silver threads among the gold
They still say, ""I love you""

Are true to this very day
For he loves her in December
As he did in May

Ben Westbeech,"There is a more humanizing element at working music
And one of the manifestations of this
Is the return to the association of the individual
And his own feeling, his own emotions

Welcome to the best years of your life
Welcome to the best years of your life
Welcome to the best years of your life

There is no release
In this faithful sky
I don't wanna do this, live and die

And if I am wandering
Through the loneliness inside
It's hard to even see the light

And in my dreams, your recurring lines
They tried to ruin all my eyes
And if we wanted to be inside
I dig a hole inside my mind

Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life

Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life

From there I would see all I wanted to see
Instead of all this misery
Surrounding me everywhere I'd be

Oh, they hated coming home from sea
And if I wanted to be all I have to be
To be with you for you to be with me

And in a crazy
Hazy mounting my mind
I thought that loving you I truly define

Welcome to the best years for your life

A heart isn't made out of clay
Not something you shape with your hands
Understand

I am who I am, and you can't change me
I've done what I can, now I'll stand my ground
You're tying my hands if you re-arrange me
It all falls down,
It all falls down

Is the reason you ask me to change so that you'll stay the same?
Well I'm sorry if I keep disappointing you again and again
But

I am who I am, and you can't change me
I've done what I can, now I'll stand my ground
You're tying my hands if you re-arrange me
It all falls down,
It all falls down
It all falls down
It all falls down
It all falls down
I am who I am",I Am Who I Am
Ben's Brother,"You sit and you stare and you wait and you wonder
You think ""Maybe it's me and I'm being a fool.""
You start to believe it's a curse that you're under
And you're just a doll for a girl who is cruel
With a pin

(Chorus)
So let me out
Or let me in
And tell me how, we can win
Cause I really wanna know now
Before I begin
To let you go (to let you go)
So let me know

I'd rather be wandering hungry and homeless
Than here in the warmth of a silent defeat
You've gotta be honest with me and be ruthless
?stead of shifting uncomfortably there in your seat
And your skin

(Chorus)

And who'd've thought I'd have the strength to say
""Let me out or let me in""
But as the words are pouring from my mouth
I wanna say them again, and again and again

So let me out
Or let me in
And tell me how, we can win
Cause I really wanna know now
Before I begin
To let you go (to let you go)
Oh
Let me out, or let me in,
Oh no no
And tell me how
We can win
Oh no I really wanna know now
Before I begin
Oh to let you go, to let you go
Let me know

Missed the start of the show

That the sooner you sign up
The quicker the world turns

so take it from me
Hold on

So much better

So close
And there's more than one way

Make it simple, make it starting from today
You know I wouldn't want it any other way

Je m'lève déjà pour fout' le camp
Mais l'infirmier dit : Au suivant !
Je suis debout devant le dentiste
Je lui fais un sourire de crétin 
I'm'pouss' dans l'fauteuil et me crie :
En piste il a des tenailles à la main
Oh oh oh oh Maman
J'ai les guiboll's en fromag' blanc

Avant meme que j'ai pu faire ouf
Il m'fait déjà sauter trois dents
En moins d'un' plombe
Mes pauvres molaires sont r'tournées
Dans leur tombe
Oh oh la la
Voilà qui m'plombe mes deux plus belles dents
Celles que j'ai par devant Mm Mm
I'm grill' la gueul' au chalumeau
Et il me file un bon verre d'eau
Il me dit faut régler votre dette
Je venais d'etre payé la veille
Ce salaud me fauche tout mon oseille
Et me refile cinquante ball' net
Oh oh oh oh maman
Et il ajoute en rigolant
J'suis pas dentist' je suis pomblier
Entre voisins faut s'entr'aider oh oh
Et moi je gueul' ce soir

Bénabar,"A cinq dans la cuisine
Face à l’évier face à la mer
Week-end en Bretagne
C’est mon anniversaire
Où sont les assiettes? Où sont les couverts?
Elles sentent pas un peu bizarre les praires?

Encore deux bourriches d’huîtres à ouvrir
Ce qui nous fait soixante-douze bonnes raisons
D’avoir des points de suture
Les filles sont dans le salon
Parce que écaillure c’est masculin
Où sont les féministes 
Quand il s’agit de s’ouvrir les mains?

Bon anniversaire
Petit trentenaire

Et le temps passe d’hier en demain
Ça me tragique ça me cruelle
Mais j’y peux rien
Même les pompiers au regard si franc
Sur un calendrier n’ont rien de rassurant

Voilà c’est fait je les ai soufflées
Ces putains de bougies
Je suis pas amer
J’ai juste les nerfs, j’ai pas dormi
Comme vous avez tous annexé
Les jolies chambres d’amis
J’ai somnolé deux heures
Façon trappeur sur le tapis

C’est parti pour la balade sur la plage
Le sable dans les chaussures
Ça me gêne et ça me démange
J’ai mis quatre pulls pourtant j’ai froid en plus il bruine
Et j’ai mal au ventre c’est officiel
Les praires elles étaient pas cleans

Bon anniversaire
Petit trentenaire

On entame l’éternel foot tout bidon
Avec les poteaux de but en blousons
On va discuter le score
En crachant nos poumons
Et jurer de s’arrêter
De fumer pour de bon

J’ai besoin d’être seul
Je marche face à l’océan
Pour faire le point
Au contact des éléments
Mais tout ce que j’en conclus
Je dois pas être un poète
C’est que ça doit être chiant
Très chiant d’être une mouette

Bon anniversaire
Petit trentenaire

Il était un foie
Deux reins
Trois fois rien
Qui prenait sa tête dans ses mains
Minuscule
Terrien
Ou pas grand chose

Bon anniversaire.",Bon Anniversaire
