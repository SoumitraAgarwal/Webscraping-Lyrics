Shania Twain,"It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily

Even my skin is acting weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots
Not play connect the dots
I just want to disappear

Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up,
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up,
There's no way but up from here

Even something as simple as
Forgettin' to fill up on gas
There ain't no explanation why
Things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to have a laugh

And up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up,
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up,
There's no way but up from here

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When everything is goin' wrong
Don't worry, it won't last for long
Yeah, it's all gonna come around
Don't go let it get you down
You gotta keep on holding on

It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way
It just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily, oh, oh, oh

And up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up,
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up,
There's no way but up from here
Up, up, up

Oh I'm going up
Oh I'm going up
Oh I'm going up, up, up
I'm going up
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah",Up!
Shania Twain,"He took me to,  our favorite spot
A place we go to hang a lot
Something seemed to catch his eye
Oh, oo, oh over my shoulder
Oh, oo, oh over my shoulder

I turned around to see what's up
A pretty young thing sure enough
She was new,  he wanted to
Kno, oo, oh, oh,  oo, ow her
Kno, oo, oh, oh,  oo, ow her

Oh, yeah,
Then she flicked her hair (yeah!)
Oh, yeah, he began to stare

Waiter! (Waiter) Bring me water!
I gotta make him keep his cool
(Waiter) Bring me water!
He's acting like a fool
(Waiter) Bring me water!

Uh, oh, I did my best, to block his view

There's gotta be a way to cool this clown,
He's starting to embarrass me
I may even have to hose him down,
Bring me water
I don't know what he finds so distracting,
What's so hot about her

Shania Twain,"I don't want to wear that
It only makes me look fat
Time to tone my thighs,
Gotta lose another size,yeah!

Exfoliate,look great!
Feel guilty 'bout what you ate
You're buyin' all the books,
To learn the latest looks, teah
What a way to want to be

Moisturize, exercise, erase the
Rings around your eyes
Cover what you can,
Get a Coppertone tan, yeah
What a way to want to be!

Stabilize the mood you're in,
You're back on diet food again
Bigger is the best, but only
In the chest, yeah!
What a way to want to be!

We like to buy, we like to spend,
To keep up with the latest trend
But we don't get no satisfaction
Living like a slave to fashion
No more thinking for yourself
Just get it off a shelf

It's so very, unnecessary
Yeah, how insane, to be so vain
It's so synthetic, I just don't get it
I don't get it, baby, yeah, yeah

Don't be so obsesses, c'mon gice it rest
This is not some contest, just do your best
Cause no, oh body's perfect

(Ooooohhhhhh)

Oh,no, oh body's perfect
No, oh it's not worth it
Don't be obsessed
(No, oh body's perfect)
This is not some contest

Perfect! What a way to want to be",What a Way to Wanna Be!
Shania Twain,"This could be it, I think I'm in love
It's love this time
It just seems to fit, I think I'm in love
This love is mine

I can see you with me when I'm older
All my lonely nights are finally over
You took the weight of the world off my shoulders
(The world just goes away)

Oh, when you kiss me
I know you miss me
And when you're with me

The way you hold me
The way you show me
That you adore me, oh, when you kiss me
Oh, yeah

You are the one, I think I'm in love
Life has begun

I can see the two of us together
I know I'm gonna be with you forever

Shania Twain,"It must be Monday! What a dumb day!
Can't drag my butt outta bed
Somebody stop me--I need another coffee
Like a hole in my head

When everyday begins this way
Gets you down and can drive you mad
The daily grind can freak your mind
But life isn't all that bad

Don't let it get to you
C'est la vie! That's life,
And that's how it's gonna be
C'est la vie! Hold tight,
It comes right eventually. Oh--ho--

If only I could sleep in--
And wake up on the weekend
Oh, what a dream that would be, yeah
But fat chance for that one--
It ain't gonna happen
Better get back to reality

I could be a slob or keep my job
That is the choice we have
The daily grind can freak your mind
But life isn't all that bad

Everybody's got to do it!
Everybody's got to earn their way
Uh, come on now
You gotta work your own way through it
Everybody's got their dues to pay

Shania Twain,"Yeah, if I were the moon I could catch your eye
I'm jealous of the moon
If I were the wind I would make you fly
I'm jealous of that too, yeah yeah, oh

I wish I were the sun shining on your face caressing like a lover
I would wrap you up in a warm embrace
We'd be holdin' one another
I'm jealous of the sun, oh I'm jealous of the sun

Oh, I don't wanna share you with nothing else
I gotta have you to myself
Oh, I can't help it I'm so in love
I just can't get you close enough, no

When the sun's on your skin
I can't hold it in and I know it's a sin
But I'm jealous of the sun

I wish I were the rain runnin' down your neck
And drippin' from your fingers
Then I could be the drops rollin' off your back, I'd love to let it linger
Oh, I'm jealous of the rain

Oh, I don't wanna share you with nothing else
I gotta have you to myself
I can't help it, I'm so in love
I just can't get you close enough, no

When it rains on your face
I almost can taste your beauty, your grace
I'm jealous of the rain
Yeah yeah, jealous of the rain

When the wind's in your hair
The way it blows through the air
It seems so unfair, yeah

When the moon's in your eyes
You seem to light up the skies
And I realize, I'm even jealous of the moon",I'm Jealous

It's such a waste of time, uh, uh, uh
Won't find me on the couch, uh, uh

Shania Twain,"Hope life's been good to you since you've been gone
I'm doin' fine now, I've finally moved on
It's not so bad, I'm not that sad

I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain, I'm free again

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath to forget

Don't think I'm lyin' 'round, cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really all right
I've never looked back as a matter of fact

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath to forget

It only hurts when I breathe

Mmm, no, I've never looked back as a matter fact

Shania Twain,"We live in a greedy little world that teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly then turn around and
Spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So it's shoppin' every Sunday at tha mall
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

[Chorus]
Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing- Ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

When you're broke go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when 
You get bored

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Dig deeper in your pocket

Dig deeper in your wallet

And there ain't no way
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day

'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning
To your sweet face, always

Ooh baby

In your heart, I can still hear a beat
For every time you kiss me
And when we're apart
I know how much you miss me
I can feel your love for me in your heart

And there ain't no way
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day

'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning
To your sweet face, always
Wanna wake up every morning

In your eyes
(I can still see the look of the one)
I can still see the look
Of the one who really loves me
(I can still feel the way that you want)
The one who wouldn't put anything
Else in the world above me
(I can still see your love for me)
I can still see your love for me in your eyes
(I still see the love)

And there ain't no way
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day

Shania Twain,"We live in a greedy little world
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly
Then turn around and spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So it's shoppin' every Sunday at the mall

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store
Can you hear it ring
It makes you wanna sing
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

When you're broke go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when you get bored

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store
Can you hear it ring
It makes you wanna sing
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Let's swing
Dig deeper in your pocket
Oh, yeah, ha
Come on I know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Oh

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store
Can you hear it ring
It makes you wanna sing
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching!

Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
Can you hear it ring
It makes you wanna sing
You'll love to dream
With lots of money and things
Ka-ching!",Ka-Ching

Shania Twain,"I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long
No one can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't goin' down

I had a baby at fifteen, Daddy never did forgive me
I never heard from the guy again
I had to drop outta high school, everybody treated me so cruel
But I didn't give in and giver her away

I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long
No one can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't goin' down

Her smile got me through the day and every night I'd pray
I could give her enough
At night I'd lie awake and cry, hopin' we'd get by
'Cause you can't live on love

I worked night and day to keep us goin'
Through the sweat and tears without her knowin'
It was worth it just to watch her grow
Oh, oh, at least I was able to hold her
Whenever she needed my shoulder
I'm so glad I never let her go

I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long
No one can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't goin' down

Her smile got me through the years
Dried away the tears and filled me with hope
At night I'd lie awake and cry, prayed we would get by
And for the courage to cope, oh, oh, oh

Her smile got me through the day
Every night I'd pray I could give her enough

I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long
No one can tell me I'm wrong

I trusted you so much, you're all that mattered
You no longer love me and I sang like a sad bird
I couldn't move on and I think you were flattered

Oh! Life’s about joy, life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away

Oh, life's about to get good
Oh, life's about to get good
Oh, life's about to get good

The longer my tears fell, the wider the river (I love you baby)
It killed me that you'd give your life to be with her (I love you baby)
I had to believe that things would get better
It was time to forget you, forever

Oh! Life’s about joy, life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away

But soon as I got home
I wish I'd bought you instead,
I got it bad,
I'll take the black, take the navy and red
No other man has ever, ever had quite this effect
I sleep alone 'cause there's no room in my bed
For any other lover

With no gun to my head!
Your kisses hold me hostage
And I don't wanna stop it

'Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do
Ooh

I came before this digital ocean
Where folks only move in digital motion
But you're so classic I want you more than my Adidas,
All the bees are getting at you cause your honey is sweeter
I need you

With no gun to my head!
Your kisses hold me hostage
And I don't wanna stop it

'Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

Can't let this go, what can I say?
I just don't know
My love ain't no trip for the weekend,
Here to stay for all of the seasons
You're the weakness that I can't control

Baby you all I need to get by,
You fly so you all I need to get high
You got it, uh.
So put your number in this camera phone,
And we can live like the camera's on, *no script though*
These boys claiming they ball,
Got no grip though
My flow switchmode, it's so skitzo
So I'm the one that your girl blows kiss for
Gotta love me, Cole World, no snuggie
Baddest girls hug me, my mind on you though
You're hoping I'm the one,
But I already knew though.
It ain't no secret that I get around,
True
But girl you make me wanna settle down, with you
Get a crib with a view
Lay up in the bed, make a kid maybe two.
All my ex-girlfriends gone have to get a clue
'Cause the rumors that you heard about is true

'Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

Just can't get enough of your lovin'
But he's pagin' me
You too blind to see
Now you roll your eyes at me 'cause I stay on his mind

Just so happens that I'm still all alone
Know that I've turned you down before
But I won't turn you down no more, baby

Ever since the day you began to mention
That you wanted me oh so very long
Never really knew you were feeling that strong
It could be confusion wit you and your boy
Far as I'm concerned I ain't there no more
My love it's been waiting enough time
When I can't get you off my mind

If you check me out
You can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so

And I can't stop thinkin' 'bout the way I feel boy
Never thought of it as right before
But I can't let him keep me unhappy no more

Didn't think it would happen to me 
Makin' a decision over history
Is it wrong to be into you
What am I supposed to do

Shanice,"There's a right or wrong to know for everything
And the truth is written somewhere in between
But there's always something missing in the dark
There you will find the true condition of the heart

Well I can visualize the pieces of a dream
And it's not as far away as it may seem
But if truth be told it's you that holds the key
To the question that defines my destiny

[Chorus]
I've been in love a time or two
I've seen the world but not with you
I want to fly and spread my wings
Don't want to cry, I want to sing
I want to live and take a chance
I'm not afraid to love again
I want to fall, fall for you
And I want you to fall for me too

I've had plenty conversations my heart
'cause I want this thing to work, not fall apart
Oh, I ask my heart how can it be so sure
And it answers me because your heart

I have every expectation that it's true
'cause my heart won't lie to me, much less to you
But if truth be told it's you that holds the key

To the mountain snow that melts into the stream
My heart flows like that river to the sea
To the heavens above

I gave me all to you
And you made it easy to fall in love

Don't you come back running
Now my heart is aching
I cannot find a reason to love you now
And don't you come back crying
Now that love is dying
I cannot find a reason to love you now
How can I love you now?

I thought my life was over
And I thought I'd never get over it
All the tears I cried were tears of pain
Tommorrow promises the pain will fade away

Now, It was just a game to you
What you put through will come right back to someday
Don't think I'm wishing bad on you

Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon

Of your chocolate, your chocolate..

A candle light (dinner) and a dozen roses just to name a few (few,few,few)
You always seem to know the things that I'm feelin'

Wishing you were with me 
I used to wonder about your day

I needed to feel like I was loved 
I needed you desperately 

But I'm thankful, I'm grateful 
And you will always be to me

One so beautiful 
A symbol of love that I can hold 
Your petals shower me 
And I can feel your presence all around me 
Forever like a rose 
You're so incredible 
I can feel it still so powerful 
I finally believe 
That I can have your presence all around me 

I never was able to understand 
Why both of you chose to be just friends 
Thought we were a stronger family 
I guess I was wrong 
I was left with just holidays 
Maybe a Saturday or a Sunday 
Never had much time to spend together 
And I felt so alone 

But I'm thankful and grateful 
And you will always be to me... Forever

Let whoever broke your heart fade into the past, and give tonight another try.
This could be a brand new start;
Don't you let it pass you by.

When you're feelin' down;
Go meet somebody.

Sweet somebody.

Come on baby dry your eyes, wipe your tears.
Never like to see you cry, please forgive me.
I wouldn't ever try to hurt you, I just needed 
Someone to hold me, to fill the void while you were gone.

That I got you by my side with the cherry red kiss
Hit me off make it soft hold me tight throughout the night
You know I'm gonna fight cos the thing we had was right
But if you go all I know I can't go a day without you
Here in my arms hypnotized with your charms now
I'm feeling for you baby ain't you hearing the alarms
You can't stop all that love that I got
Wanna rewind time to better days that were hot check it
Bring back the better days for me baby
You gotta bring 'em back cos I'm going crazy
I go insane with your name up in my brain
Things will never be the same you ain't up in my frame 
So what you gonna do what you gonna say
Tell me that you're gonna push your loving back my way.

Like a ball of fire giving off heat
And I was standing there in my lace of flames
My fingers on fire embers all around

As the walls fell your hands found me in the fog
I heard people talking in that secret dialogue
More's going on than meets the eye
And I'm trying to decipher the lies 

Bah bah da da da 
'Cause I was going under and you saved me 
Now I owe it all to you 
I was going under and you saved me 

My bittersweet my bitter blue 
And oh they do get mad baby don't they get angry
When you tell them that you just don't agree
They tell you that you're hard to please

That your naïve and you're gonna be very very sorry
But I feel so sure and I feel so new
And then there you are in your jeans of blue
Making it all seem so easy

You make the gale winds nothing more than breezy

Shannon McNally,"Some things are basically beyond the vision of doubt
Some things I understand that I'm better off without
Like dingy walls painted clean
Broken words unseen
I said maybe the world's as it should be and you disagreed
Bolder than Paradise and longer than goodbye
I carry your name around with me
Like a wish I sometimes untie 
Wide open spaces and amber waves of grain
That's where I used to live
In the kingdom of my youthful reign
Before I was a prisoner to the silo
Walled into the shadows
Shy to the sky 
Bolder than Paradise and longer than goodbye
I carry your name around with me 
Like a spell I sometimes let fly",Bolder Than Paradise
Shannon McNally,"When I die and lay me down 
Cast my body to the sea
But bury my heart on the Jersey Shore
And every time you think of me
Know my mother was a beauty queen
My father tended bar
And they made me beneath Leo's rising star
With Elvis on the radio singing love me tender, love me true 

[Chorus]
Bury my heart on the Jersey Shore
Bury my heart yeah
Bury my heart no matter where I run
Bury my heart yeah 

As soon as I could walk I ran
Stayed about as still as sand
And when I stopped and turned around
Said man oh man how far I've come
Look at all these things I've done
Now you know I just want to go home 

[Chorus]

Sha la la la la la
I never have stood still in the sun or the rain
Like that old littering pine tree
When time moves on 

I move along but the images will always be
With each passing year the lines will grow deeper
My memories will grow sweeter
The laughter will grow fainter
And I'll remain the painter of a love song from 1973

No one gets hurt but me
Put the goods in the bag
Lay it down easy

The horses want to run up Fifth Avenue
And I'd run too but I'm wearing these high heeled shoes
Someone trip the alarm

Let the sirens come screaming Colorado 
Everyone put their hands on their head
And their eyes on the ground
No matter what you hear

Don't turn around
'Cause it's likely to get messy
And it's likely to get loud
And I'd prefer to spare everyone but me

The sight of it all falling down 
Cats in the bag 
So lay it down easy
Colorado 

Never knew how I felt till I felt that gun in my hands
Never know the sound of my voice till I heard it with a pistol in my hands
I'm going out those front doors like Butch and Sundance
Gunning straight up the middle with the sun in my eyes

Wanting for nothing but one bold moment in a fearful life 
Today is a May day with a fair wind blowing
Today no more May days, it's a good day to die 
What else could I do?

You see how it goes
You're left with no front door
And a back door that's closed
So when they ask

Is

Shannon McNally,"I'd love to have you with me almost all the time
But life just isn't like that at least not mine
There's no need for hello, little reason for goodbye
I never need to miss you cause you're always on my mind
No exchanging numbers or promises to write
I know I'll see you somewhere, sometime
I'll always be around
When you're running down
You can call me out
I'll always be around
It's too much like confession to say your name out loud
So I guard our little mystery by leaving things out
If you want me just whistle put your lips together and blow
I know I'll see you somewhere but where I just don't know
I'll always be around
When you're running down
You can call me out

Shannon McNally,"Hey Joe have you seen my friend Flo, I was with her last night I thought it was all right for her to go. Put her in the car, guess she didn't get very far, cause they found her shoes and her purse by the off ramp. Don't know why she stopped but I am sure she had a reason, some creep took it as chick open season. It doesn't look good, no it doesn't look good, I doubt she'll get up and walk out of those woods. 

But it could have been me, oh, it could have been me And that strikes me like a baseball bat across my knees 

One night my car broke down on the turnpike, I was stuck in Northeast Pennsylvania. It was after midnight and it was gonna snow, I didn't have nowhere to go. I thought to call for help but when the cars passed me by my cries fell silent. For how many times has the devil walked among us, wearing the face of the savior. So I headed out alone not sure whether to stay in 
the light where I could see or in the darkness where they can't see me 

Because it could have been me, oh, it could have been me 
And that strikes me like a baseball bat across my knees.

Shannon McNally,"All this dreaming will drive me crazy
But is it dreaming if it's all I ever do?
The days are bleeding they just run together
The nights are cold in the deep of Minnesota
From where I lie I can see the airport
I watch them land and I see them leave
So many things that I've never done
So much ends before it's begun 
And I'm so tired I could cry
I'm so tired I lie awake at night 
Watching the moonlight circle my head
It's just about as blue as blue can get 
When I get out of this bed it's gonna
Start all over again? 
Mississippi sun doesn't shine this far north
I'm dreaming of peaches and bare tanned knees
A place that's warm where they just let you be
Where you can stay forever cause the rent is free 
And I'm so tired I could cry
I' m so tired all I can do is sigh 
Watching the moonlight circle my head
It's just about as blue as blue can get

Start all over again?",Start All Over

Gonna sing it river flow
I've been thinking 'bout it in my thoughts alone

When I hear that voice it's like soup to the hungry
Wanna be the teacher, gonna be the kid
I'm gonna get inside
Find out where it's hid

'Cause, baby this is it babe
We're on the miracle mile
Trying to give it up and do it with a smile
'Cause, I'm not alone and I'm not giving in
Till I find out where this miracle begins

Some days I get so mad, still I get out of bed
Put my shoes on and push on ahead
L look for something good to say

Gone are the days that I'm surprised or bewildered
By what they're calling quality
Most of it sounds like bullshit to me

Someday is here and tomorrow never comes

'Cause, this is it baby
We're on the miracle mile
Trying to give it up and do it with a smile
'Cause, I'm not alone and I'm not giving in
Till I find out where this miracle begins

Throw your old skin to the curb
Go and get a match
It's time to light it up and let it burn, oh yeah now

Bet you got a woman to keep you warm
Don't mind me, I'm over here trying not to do anything wrong
My enthusiasm tends to come on too strong

Everybody's shakin' it for the camera
Yeah, you're beautiful but isn't there anything else to say uh
Like how does it feel now?

'Cause, this is it baby
We're on the miracle mile
Trying to give it up and do it with a smile
'Cause, I'm not alone and I'm not giving in

And never seem to get it right 
But I guess it's better than drowning 
I'm just treading water here tonight 

Searching for something that is more 
More than you, more than you and I combined 
If there's a lesson here I have lost it 
Or maybe its just me I needed to find 

Wrapped in the ease of omission 
I am the casualty of unspoken fears 
Let the tears tell a tale I am too weary to speak 
Let the silence weave a web for you, for you and I dear 

They say that home is where you'll go 
When you have nowhere else to turn 
These string, of this thing, these songs 
Carry me along when I have memories to burn 

Wrapped in the ease of omission 
I am the casualty of unspoken fears 
Let the tears tell a tale I am too weary to speak 
Let the silence weave a web for you, for you and I dear 

I called you up to start a fight 
Because resolution is my favorite motif 
Love is just a cheap disguise for compromise 
What you get isn't always what you need 

Wrapped in the ease of omission 
I am the casualty of unspoken fears 
Let the tears tell a tale I am too weary to speak 
Let the silence weave a web for you, for you and I dear",Casualty

I'm just a little shy of knowing the differences between me and them 
I wake in the light of another gray sky sunrise 
One more faded shade of tragedy to transcend 

I'm calculating the distance between bed and bath 
The benefits of good oral hygiene and the uselessness of math 
I'm a willing heiress to my own demise 
I trespass on bits of sorrow lashed end to end 

I want to feel like there is more to this 
Than a pocketful of days strung up 
Like cheap tinsel on a dying tree 
Cheap tinsel on a dying tree 

God skipped town with a suitcase full of deodorant spray and chewing gum 
So it's hard to have faith in anything even the saviors on the run 
Ever since that day we looked into the sky 
Heard buy canned cream corn, plastic wrap, bottled water and bb guns 

I want to feel like there is more to this 
Than a pocketful of days strung up 
Like cheap tinsel on a dying tree 
Cheap tinsel on a dying tree

But I was born to privilege just like every white everybody else 
And now I am beginning to see that old argument's not so convincing 
But hey hey no way, you know it wasn't me 

Because the system is set up so the system can take all the blame 
Then you and I can breath deeply and feel a little less ashamed 
Because the system took their land, it took their lives, yeah it took their pride 
But hey hey no way, you know it wasn't me

Who we gonna blame for our mistakes 
Tell me who we gonna blame for our mistakes 
Yeah who we gonna blame for our mistakes

Because everything that I have was stolen from somebody else just for me 
If we could just stomach the truth then maybe the truth would set us free

Cause it's hard to write a song for you 

Standing at a crossroad, looking back this way again 
I've met a thousand people but I'm back where I began 
Living in a daydream where no one ever gets me down 
Your face beyond description, your voice the sweetest sound 

Now I'm sure what I want you to see 
But it's hard to find the words to bring you closer to me 
I sent my heart in a letter to you 
But the pages are torn in two 

I lost my head staring at a photograph 
Cause it's hard to write a song for you 
Impossible to to say to you 
Gone are the rainy days 

Without you I'd be lost and I'd just drift away 
Come so far just to be with you 
Now I'm not letting go no matter what you do 
It was you, I had to work it out 
Now you know it's true, I can't do without 
I sent my heart in a letter to you 
But the pages are torn in two 

I lost my head staring at your photograph 
Cause it's hard to write a song for you 
I'll say it in a letter it makes me feel much better 
But the pages, the pages, the pages are torn in two 

Now I'm staring at your picture, it makes me love you deeper 
And it's so hard to write a song for you 
To tell you how I feel for you",Letter to You
Shannon Noll,"I know you're hurting
Feels like you're learning
'Bout life the hard way
And it ain't working

Seems like forever
That you've been falling
It's time to move on
You're life is calling, yeah

This was never meant to be the end
Close the book and start again

'Cause I know how hard it can get
But you gotta lift
You gotta lift
And sometimes that's how it is
But I know you're stronger
Stronger than this
You gotta lift
You gotta lift

When you can feel your
Whole body's aching
What's left of your heart
It won't stop breaking
You gotta let go
You took a hit
Time to pick up now
Move on from this

Close the book and start again

'Cause I know how hard it can get
But you gotta lift
You gotta lift
And sometimes that's how it is
But I know you're stronger
Stronger than this
You gotta lift
You gotta lift

Lift yourself up above all the hurt
Don't give it
Wipe your eyes and remember
You're better than this
Let them know
That they took their best shot
And missed
C'mon and lift

This was never meant to be the end
Close the book and start again

'Cause I know how hard it can get

Thought that this cold be my happiness
I look at the phone and pick it up

Do you ever get lonely baby
Don't you ever get tired of living that way
Don't you ever wonder whether there's a better life,
out there yeah
Do you ever think about what we had
How you'd give anything to get it back
Don't you wonder if you'll ever love that way again
If only you could hold me
Do you ever get lonely

I look around the room and wonder
When and why and how my life has changed
I'm surrounded by so many so called friends
And I don't even know their names
When all that you love is gone
Just keep on holding on
Oh tell me

Do you ever miss me
Wishing you could kiss me
If only you could hold me

Shannon Noll,"Been outside, walking in circles around the 
Truth
Just trying to find one road that doesn't 
Lead back to you 
And there you go painting the walls up around 
Your heart 
So go on, run away

It was raining out 
We should have learned by now 

I know it feels like fate 
Like these are mistakes we're meant to 
Make 
But I've walked that road before 
Searching for more and losing it all 

So you're thinkin about giving it up 
Just to try and find 
Something else, something like
What we would leave behind 

I know it feels like fate 
Like these are mistakes we're meant to 
Make 
But I've walked that road before 
Searching for more and losing it all 

Sometimes it takes a lie for us to see the 
Truth 
The reasons why we try to run to something 
New 
I know someone could break my heart apart 
From you 
But I don't need them to 
I'd rather be with you

There's no beginning 
Everything that came before 
Will come round again 
And I look in the mirror

He gave me freedom 
And I pray I'm strong enough 
To walk in his shoes 
And I hope that I become 
Half the man he'd want me to be 

Cos I feel you guiding me 
Showin' me the way when I'm misdirected 
I know your not here but I feel connected

Comes from a better man 
And all that Ive said and done 
Cant rewrite my history 
Right there for all to see 
Im just my fathers son 
Taught me to walk, now I run 
Now I run 

Sometimes when I lose myself 
In my weakness 
I can feel the touch of his 
Unmistakable hands 
And they're pushing me forward 
Back into the circle again 

And I hope my son sees in me 
The kind of man that he was to me

Shannon Noll,"When you feel the dream is over,
Feel the world is on your shoulders,
and you've lost the strength to carry on.
Even though the walls may crumble,
And you find you always stumble through,
Remember never to surrender to the dark.
'cause if you turn another page,
You will see that's not the way, The story has to end.
If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,
Give it time, Learn to fly,
Tomorrow is a new day,
You will find you're own way,
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry,
Then you'll learn to fly.

In you're head so many questions,
The truth is your possession,
The answer lies within your heart.
You will see the doors are open,
If you only dare to hope and you,
Will find the way to fight the fears that kept you down.
'cause if you turn another page,
You will see that's not the way,
The story has to end.

If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,

You will find you're own way,
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry,
Then you'll learn to fly.


Looking at your situation,
There's so much that you can do,
Now's the time to make your stand.
This is just an observation,
In the end it's up to you,
The future's in your hands.

If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,

But I'm looking forward now I'm trying to find my way. Looking back I see only yesterday. Time is moving at least I know it's real and I'm singing about the way that I feel.

Laying on a deck chair just trying to catch some rays, thinking 'bout this thing that they call love to me it's just a maze. Is it in the trees the breeze or do you see it in a new born's eyes?

Well Yeah

He's been waiting down there, waiting half the day,
They never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground,
He gets to his feet and he says

What about me? It isn't fair
I've had enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I want to live
But you just take more than you give

Well, there's a pretty girl serving at the counter of the corner shop
She's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream,
Her dreams walk in and out, they never stop
Well, she's not too proud, to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams

More than you give

Take a step back and see the little people
They might be young, but they're the ones that make the big people big
So listen as they whisper:
""What about me?""

And now I'm standing on the corner, all the world's gone home
Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot

And no one ever got under my skin
I thought I had it all together but somehow
Something about her sucked me in

Everything I thought went out the door
I never dreamed that I'd get caught, get caught

'Caught in the afterburn, totally lost control
The moment that I saw her, I knew that I was gone
I'm caught in the afterburn, nowhere I can run
She's bringing me under now
Can't tell which way's up now
Caught in the afterburn
I'm caught in the afterburn

I almost lose it every time I'm near her
I'm so hung up I can't believe
And she has me wrapped all around her finger
So damn tight that I can't breathe

I don't think I can take this anymore
I wish that I never got caught, got caught

'Caught in the afterburn, totally lost control
The moment that I saw her, I knew that I was gone
I'm caught in the afterburn, nowhere I can run

Can't tell which way's up now

Does it to everyone she needs

When it all comes crashing down

And turn the other cheek

Into my heart where its scared

And your mother she never calls
Says you're the cause of all her pain
But all these things don't carry camelot
Through the betrayed all these things
Don't hold form with a stout cord and chain
You are out of sorts and ready to retire
On the brink of my answer I fell asleep
For a little while



",All These Things
Shannon Wright,"I'm rushing a lamppost fevers got me
I'm thawing my best jokes but I sat alone
With the captain of the quarantine
I chewed my way through my boat
I paddled with feathers I fell snug in a fish snare
My faulty fins fell impaired
You boasted about your coins
I seared back your wooden charm
You shelved my affections



",Captain of Quarantine
Shannon Wright,"I stood inside your pool in some palm setting reel
A picture on a screen there sat you and me
And I comb the wire for a lock of papier-mache
I build a tower for you to portray
You let go of my hand and acted like we never touched
Like some harbour a ship never brushed
I am the floor pile walk over me
My light has grown tired paint over me
All at once I just can't abide I fear
On the cobble swims a king with a hearty smile



",Floor Pile
Shannon Wright,"I'm never gonna live in that room with you
Weathered from seeing the upside
Choking on my own smile
I float around with my heavy crown
Grease the coil to watch it unwind
It feels so fitting to cover things with gauze
Sever the from the outcome
When what's existing subsides



",Heavy Crown
Shannon Wright,"You eloped with a bout of slurs
Flew the hedge with a pace
I must convey when I feel good then I pay
Keep quiet about my lane
Lost you through distaste



",Hobos on Parade
Shannon Wright,"( Instrumental )



",Holland
Shannon Wright,"I croon like a lumber crane
Sank quick inside your snare
Her fellow steps across my head
I'm her colt and she's my mare
Dense falls across my face
That's the source I won't contemplate
You can't tear my shell away



",Rich Hum of Air
Shannon Wright,"Shade calls the bone marrow she left a stage so bare
And everyone clapped to see you rise so gracefully
What a fright on such a beautiful night
The soldiers rang around my head
The flies ate the called cabs
Everyone says I'm scared not you you believe I'm dead



",Twilight Hall
Shannon Wright,"He's a man of the grain
Wears his robe of burly pain
Bowls the town for alcohol
Chewed up his name and he sold it all
Perched it up for sale
He turned the light out
He turned the sign down farewell goodnight
The awning falls flat and the clocks are spinning
Bowl the town for alcohol you are what I need
He resides in a carnival turns the pages
And mocks it all he's a martyr with a wide rope
Turns his head to watch it fall
Hacked his hand through the toil
He's a product of failed love



",William's Alabama
Shannon Wright,"Built a house made out of blood
Fought the serpent and his thugs
Played the game fought the fought
All wrapped you astound me living life through
Your sleep
Yard grass in flight on the ledge we fly
Yard grass in flight the serpent has moved from sight



",Yard Grass
Shannon Wright,"Up the hill to a vacant lot
There's nothing to see
Walk the pillars to settle in
And find that you've turned from me
You're the cup and you're the drink
That keeps swimming up north through the stream
I'm the raft that got filled with sand
That keeps knocking about in the drain
My hands are laid out to persuade a gathering
Hair is polished and shiny trim
Just keep a friend in me



",You're the Cup
Shannon Wright,"Mend the sea on this floating tin can
On the branch I bend
This swollen page is a yawning friend
Through the straw I stem
Reframe and cut this, ailing theme
In the lenses I tame
How can I conceal this woven outline
How can I fray from this lane of you



",Absentee
Shannon Wright,"This background is so vague
This falter much too strong
A slew of reluctance
Makes the focus warble on
For every laden vein
Is a grim pail of prey
The true are open
They wrestle with this state
What a dirty facade
The coming of an ugly file
Every guide is ill-timed
Purely lit for the lofty kind
What a dirty facade
The coming of an idle qualm
And everyone is so still
No one ever is pure",Dirty Facade
Shannon Wright,"So stark is this burrow
So void is this valley
So bare is this vessel
These emberdays have grown grey
So vague is this refuge
So wide is this pattern
So clean is this tassel
These emberdays have grown grey



",Ember Days
Shannon Wright,"This drone you sound alarmingly meek
Is inside my head and plummets my bed
It rallies and summons me in my sleep
The sun is groggy and upon your plate
Arms do fumble they're out of their frame
Luster has moved and opted your space
When you call a caddy
I'll be the kind you use
The sagas pose their levee
That's the kind that floats to you
And after all I idle to carry on
The clocks married the dated
Operas sails salutes
The planks are calm with boredom
It's the kind you tend to coo
Every gala's a blanket in flight
And I'm the kind you use
And you with all your ready is a horror
The recital is staged and ready to recite
Stating the flaws and running you wild
But I'll be any stable you like
The radius is starting to stumble and fright
The loveliest station is wailing from sight
But I am ready to part from you



",Fences of Pales
Shannon Wright,"Long before this deserted map
You use to dim to light
The person you show one use to believe
The facet has blurred the link
You boil the greatest of lakes
You lid the envelope of monsoon
Your mar hushes my frame
You lid the envelope of monsoon
Your gilded eye
Your sharpened speech
You use to lend the light
A flask welder
Your jaunty trade
You use to pry the weight



",Flask Welder
Shannon Wright,"The hover is ajar
My worth has fled
Be certain of this empty tray
Do we maintain that there is no one
For me to ring
This stale sight of you
Your spotted eyes
They're soiled through
These fragments I skew



",The Hover Is Ajar
Shannon Wright,"Doldrums badger the hum
Flapping about for everyone
These limbs they do ring
Stagger with frugal means
Hector pillars within
Choking the laughter thin
This checkered timely place
Your babble swells the complaint
Carry the cost
But what will turn this noise down



",Noise
Shannon Wright,"I'm the bagpipe that is bursting
I'm the shuffleboard at night
Your eyes they swim like oceans
Every word is a lovely rhyme
You're sporadic and so lovely
Every room is so alive
I'm laughter and a fake
My bulb is an ugly shrine
Pay no mind to me
I cannot show love



",Pay No Mind
Shannon Wright,"These bloated veins have climbed hillsides and airlines
Looking for a limb to reside
This eager scheme has turned, lathered up your bottled smile
But the notice just passes the tether by
In storms the coils do fail and I will paw for air
You buckle and stir my brittle hand
Oh, this empty glance of you folds only to consume
How they fray away, these ribbons of you",Ribbons of You
Shannon Wright,"What could hinder this haste
Calm strewn the isle of this tattered grain
In all this muzzled distaste
I brush the vial hoping to misplace
Cover me with soil and tread
Drape me with flames this frock of disdain
Stop this sunken ravine pull out the slate
From under me
This kingdom in the quilt of demand
Forces the conquer of the plan



",Within the Quilt of Demand
Shannon Wright,"Your presence howls inside my ear
You lifted the ark from me
Now there's nothing I cannot see
A wooden tin, a hidden sleet

Throw the matches upon my bed
In this boiling light
It swims through this
Hollowed bin to me
Now you ring the bells



",Bells
Shannon Wright,"There goes your body in a box
That is all I have left
Now this odor lines my shaking bed

There's no order to you
Come with me you dirty wretch

How does this duty send me relief
When I've been cheated of you



",Dyed in the Wool
Shannon Wright,"Come let's probe these blackened eyes
Come let's smear this spectacle
Come let's slam on the light
This must soon be revised

Hinterland, I shall descend
Hinterland, I crumble within

I shall feel nothing
I shall be rinsed



",Hinterland
Shannon Wright,"Why is this delight
Excused as nothing?
Is this the vigor
A vast decay?
This ugly state
I shall not answer
This nausea
I delve to slain

This only takes one moment
Could you explain your meaning

This majesty is no longer
A replica with no taste
May I admire
Your tinted cheek
This lobby of worth
I urge to keep



",Less Than a Moment
Shannon Wright,"There goes your mother and her plague
What a terrible display
Of a charcoaled tongue
That wouldn't lend a hand
Though this dead was a thoughtless act
With alcohol intact
Quietly she seeks the day to pass
With those stitches that you clean
You hold your flag of your doleful plea
Now there's nothing left to recall
A fruitless title bestowed
Amongst someone you could never know
In this plight of this dismay
This thickness of your plague
She's a realm that's lost her way



",The Path of Least Persistence (Figure II)

You cover your mouth
Hoard your lovely breath
For which not to speak

For seeing through
The day with fresh eyes
Try to lick these bits
Back into place
These tanks bore there wintry weight
To wake to these scraps of morn
It bears a stone
And that's what I've become
These legs are built upon a surly demise
We all reach for a hand in which we will guide
Let's sit quiet and we shall not stir
Your mouth is fragrant
And lassoing this room
And never is too long to date
Your crusty petals are prying away
Pails of cheer have become stains",Surly Demise
Shannon Wright,"This frost you stand in
It draws on wobbled legs
This sway is stabled
I gnaw through your gate
You sort what I bend
You jar me for relief
This canter is guided

And fasten it in
You idle my forfeit
My dire you mend
The uproar is cautious
The error absent
This order is frantic
For the marvel you'll send

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Frozen their veins.
Still closing helplessly afar,
Waking the creatures within.

Awaiting to sleep eternally.
Under those cold woods,
As my fall brings them.

Shadows of their wings,
As howling their pleeds.
Wounded, I lay on ground
Listening their needs

It's dark and cold
And they fly slowly
The way they were told.
To feast mine fleshly dreaming.
And they know surely,
They raped mine soul.

Shaquille O'Neal,"I was born three six seven eighteen with ???? on the wisdom
Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go
Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro'
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys are Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin' push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I want to' be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, ""Good, now you gotta' go
""Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole.""
Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, ""I can't let them down.""
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding

I'm outstanding

Now let's skip to the time when I was fifteen
Shaq is in the house... no, Shaq is on the scene!
Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors
Kids look up to me like a skyscraper
Now, a role model... I mean a role figure
Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger?
My dream is coming through, but coming through slowly
Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me
""Remember this, son, do all the runs
""Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from
""You're young, gifted, and Black
""If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, 'Shaq!'""
Like the fam' do, in the stands who
When I freak the funk on a dunk they, ""Ahhh! Oooh!""
From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge
Make that gift and now it's
Time for me to fulfill my dream
To be in the [leaders' game?] like Dakeem
I'll make the backboards shatter, 
Fans chit-chatter
Even make the other [sen-tails?] get madder
That's me. Who can it be?
The master of disaster, seven foot three
Brother, ain't no other in the nation
I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation
I'm outstanding

I'm outstanding

Cause now I'm outstanding
Wave your hands and pump your fist
When I'm on the court you know it's strictly ""Swish!""
Cause there's some things that I gotta' do:
Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq-shoe
And now it's time to take care of business
To run up the court with Nick and Dennis
Scott, but I won't stop
Gotta' keep striving until I reach the top
Gonna' take a peek over the mountain
I flow like a fountain
Peace, I gotta' go! And I'm out and... 
But before I go, wave your hands
Peace to all my family, friends, and fam
I'm outstanding",I'm Outstanding
Shaquille O'Neal,"[Chorus]
Can we rock?
Yeah, what's up doc?
Can we rock?
What's up doc?

[Moc]
Cha cha cha cha cha
What's up pa, yo who poop?
Your ma dukes or pa dukes?
There's two scoops a raisin in the sun
Brothers try to rally up, then dilly dally for some room
Bird peckin', doulbe deckin', rubber neckin' in my tomb
Check it out yo, I smile like Groucho Marx
I make a joke, hokey pokey, and slide by like egg yolk
Play me like a punk like Penguin and the Joker
Snoopin' in my biz like Tom and Roxie Roker
So bust the freaky freaky freaky ways
The brothers with the Asian guise making G's
And now we're sellin' records overseas
Holy smokes, oops, your whole plan goofed up
Now you get kicks, 'nough licks, plus cuffed up
'cause you can catch a quick drop for tryin' to take the Schnicks' props
So tick tock around the clock and shock while we lick shots
(Boom!) for goodness sakes the stakes are high
I'm out (you out?)
ABC-ya, bye

[Chorus]
[Chip]
I thought I saw a putty cat, I did
I did the humpty dumpty bashful grumpy quaker nabisco crisco kid
'cause my style's figaro figaro figaro figaro like Pinochio's
Big Digital Underground humpty dumpty camel hump nose
So play dosey doe, sufferin' sucotash my mistletoe is gone
Snow White is after my seven dwarves, my styles, and after me Lucky Charms
So leapin' leprechauns, be glad I'm pushin' my pedal to the metal
I'm rugged and rough for Cocoa Puffs, and yes, I love my Fruity Pebbles
So howdy, my partner, I starts to get meaner
So ask Bob for hope, nope, not Mr. Bob Dobailina
Oh were has my mic gone? Tell me, have you seen her?
I stretch like a condom and gets plump like a weiner
Or a sasuage, but of course it's, time for Chip to wreck it
But before my intro I gots to check it
So who is the nicest in your neighborhood?
Lyrics are merry, merry, quite contrary, and Captain Crunch berry good
So rah rah, sis boom bah
Chip Fu is coming again, give thanks and praises to jah
My lyrics are smooth like the head on Terry Savalas
My tongue starts to quicken like Speedy Gonzales
Take up your pen, your pad, your lyrical bag and run go whole a fresh
Touche pussy cat, put down that mic 'cause you can't rap
'cause I'm dip-dip-divin', so socializin'
Clean out your ears, yes, and open up your eyes and
I kick like Bruce Lee and Jean Claude Van Damme
So dunna nana nana nana nana nana, Batman!
I hip-hop, hop-hop
Don't-don't, stop-stop
I'm harder than a Flinstone and much bigger than a Chub Rock
Our types of lyrical styles? yes the Schnickens can pick 'em
I burp, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em

[Chorus]
[Poc]
Rippin' the program, slow man, hot damn
I grand slam, swingin' things again and again (whoo)
Golly ha-chooey, macho like Roscoe
Randy Savage manwitch, swingin' the ding-a-ling with damage
Pauish not antoinish nor monetego
Spanish like que for the nine two lingo
Next, a new hex, commentators stand aside
Stringin' emcees like a bikini or panty line (ha ha)
Nut you might bust, but you can't even come right
Spite the strokin' or hopin' or pullin' a peace pipe
Huff and puff so what the fuck is happening?
On the lyrical, miracle, spirutal
but everybody's rockin'
Flip a new hit, catch wreck to the nine ship
Equipped, never slip with tongue twister
All my styles that's buckwild
No fake rap, I push pounds
I flip mad scripts and hips, I hit
So bring the goya oh boy-ah, as I say hasta manana
Soft and chewy Honky Kong fooey, reggae not rasta tough stuff
Can I rock?

[Chorus]
[Shaq]
I'm the hooper, the hyper
Protected by Viper
When I rock the hoop yo, you'd better decipher
In other words you'd better make a funky decision (whoo)
'cause I'm a be a Shaq knife, and cut you with precision
Forget Tony Danza, I'm the boss
When it comes to money, I'm like Dick Butkas
Now who's the first pick? me, word is born and
Not a Christean Laettner, not Alonzo Mourning
That's okay, not being bragadocious
Supercalifragelistic, Shaq is alidocious
Peace, I gotta go, I ain't no joke
Now I slam it (what?) jam it (unh)
And make sure it's broke

Shaquille O'Neal,"Yo, Yo
I want to dedicated this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he's my father cause my biological didn't bother

[Verse 1]
Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but your not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from York to Jersey City
Women and child alone now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
cause my biological didn't bother

[chorus] He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father 
cause my biological didn't bother. (4x)

[Verse 2]
January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort mamth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and that's the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
but a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
but father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it
cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
cause my biological didn't bother

(chorus)
[Verse 3]
Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
and if your making big dope be materialistic
cause you'll end up another statistic
everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I won the ring like hakeem
Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
cause my biological didn't bother

(Chorus)",Biological Didn't Bother [G-Funk Version]
Shaquille O'Neal,"I want girl like my dear, that's my mom dukes
Someone to kick back with no fake no juice

Ahhh a brand new verse to smoke as I'm ??? all the way
'cause this DJ is kickin up dust from the urban Eastside
Twenty-First street and Louis that's where my funk ride
Chillin with my man Shaq Diesel, cock diesel

Yes it's me Warren jiggy jiggy G'z
So G-funk, we funk till the end of our lives
With respect for our mamas Miss Dee is right

I'm glad I found that significant other
She remind me of my mother 'cause yo there ain't no other
I treat her right like father MC
'Cause I check Ralph Tresvant for ""Sensitivity""

Behind every great man is a great woman
I keep it commin baby baby I keep it comin
And you don't have to worry about a thang
'Cause living in the fast lane just ain't my thang

Peace to Lucille and Miss Ola May
'Cause women of today like to play what can I say
I'm glad I found me a girl that's real
She reminds me of my number one baby Lucille yea

all my nines down the line kick and lead it too 

rugged never smooth with this move as I flow 

on and on this track, my papes stacked in the back 

step up to get funk in your face 

'88 was Runs house, but '95 is Shaqs place 

cracked up like Boogie, from New Jack City 

high with the clowns, but down with the nitty gritty 

fool, child, with the high profile 

style kind of hoop-hoppa-listic wild 

come, get some 

from the one that freaks the fees, the foes, the fies, the fums 

I flip my style like a pancake flipper 

dive-dive dipper 

let me pull up my zipper 

I'm sick and tired of pissin' on this track

I greet ya defeat ya

I'm gone

Verse 1: Shaq  Peter Gunz 



I was born to raise hell and cause havoc when I enter 

have the pin back hands up white flag surrender 

what I'm into pulling stocks and bonds and cheddar 

gauaranteeing the world you can't find nuthin better 

so whatever 

bring it the front and put your money by your mouth 

find your teeth and cash coming out 

I bring drama to your momma if she want it

Peter tell 'em how I want it 



aiyo Shaq the world is yours 

but can I get a city 

gritty blocks shitty cops 

broads with tingo bittys 

hit 50 in the ruckus mutha 

is I happy 

you callin me fraud but your broad's calling me daddy 

while you pumpin dollar bottles on the floor looking funny 

I'm going drop hits with Shaq kid 

and dirt getting money 

sunney days is made the pain it rains no more 

the cash will last from now the guns hits the floor 



Chorus 



Verse 2: Shaq 



check it 

Enrico dope like perscriptions from pharmacys 

injecting through speakers with no limit slash no mercy 

the ill beat seaker 

I mystify minds like I'm a preacher 

when I meet ya start convulsing like a seizure 

you best believe I got more tricks up my shirt sleeve 

expidisouly I get loose like hair weave 

which mc out there want to come test me 

put footprints in your chest like Kareem did me 

I run rhymes like drunk drivers on stop signs 

I change my name to Deon cause I'm mutha freaking prime time 



Chorus 



Verse 3: Peter Gunz 



out the alleys of the ghetto there echos a voice sweeter 

the melon a felon under the first name Peter 

looking out the hour glass what do I see 

Guliani with tacky at me with death penalty 

I dodge the cops bob and weave to the left 

young gifted and black but yet I'm still marked for death 

my breath and oxygen is limited 

they did me in with it 

they took my lungs my heart they kept my brain and headed with it 

I live alive to see my seed breath airs 

in and exhale but please breath clean air 

runnin 'round killin people with sex you flex 

spread in the bed ask me dread who's next 



Chorus",Best to Worst
Shaquille O'Neal,"Yo yo
This jam right here dedicated to all the little bad knuckleheads runnin'
Around
Gettin' in trouble
Just follow your dreams and you'll be aight

[Chorus: Peter Gunz]
Yo it was all a dream
Deprising and uprising my schemes
But surprising realzing that
Yo it was all a dream
I kept my head above the water for cream
But now I'm turnin' all heads when I step on the scene
(yesterday it was just a dream
 never thought this could ever happen to me)
It was all a dream
(how a change came around in my life)

[Verse 1: Shaq]
I went back and forth from ??? to chilltown JC
At first it's just me and mommy
Then Phil came along, he bought a basketball go to the park
Get your game on Shaq but have your butt back by dark
I was acting like the doc, my game was the joint
Dribbilin' between my legs like Norm Nixon at the point
Materalism kept them other kids biz'm
While I was selling my game they was sellin' izm
Words by Phil be a leader not a follwa
Don't let the masses of technolgy swallow ya
La-d da-d we all likes to party
I'm followin' my dreams I'm gonna be somebody

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Shaq]
Now check it, commodores was my favorite joint
Til I heard Planet Rock on the bop, that jam's on point
I used to rhyme in the mirrior, like I was down with UTFO
Doug E. Fresh singin' a show
For a big kid I had crazy rhythm
Size 13 suede crews with thick shoe strings in 'em
I was the baddest popa, baddest rhyme dropper
Bustin' more mills than Superman to helicopters
I had the name buckle kids used to jock
Public Enemy came out, I had the clock
My favorite jam was by Big Daddy ain't no half steppa
My mic sounds nice check 1-2 by Salt N' Pepa
Heavy D, Rakim, Eric be	, Ricky D
Scott LaRock and BDP
I never knew 'em but I used to look up to 'em
Battles in the park in the dark I ran through 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Shaq]
Somebody wake me up this can't be real
Lookin' in the paper, Shaq's about to make a hundred mil
Somebody smack me, it's gotta be fake
20,000 square foot crib on the back of a lake
Five movie deal with Disney
Damn I'm getting busy like Dizzy Calepsi
20 mil check from Pepsi
Let's see, red benz and black porsche
??? room suburban with roof-top hole and of course
Boat with my name on the side so I can ride on the water
With my wife and my baby daughter
I oughta write a book so why'all can see
How easy it is to be who the hell you want to be
This is a message from Shaq, react bring it on back
Follow your dreams and it's like that

Why'all want to riot?
It's like a rifle without the firing pin
In the hire wiring in to all my men's
Who retired from the Spiring Inns 
Better call your next of kin 
They recommend me to wreck men's 
Not one or two clips I stretch ten 
My weapons my game, my world, and mind alone 
And you couldn't be hard if you wrote your rhymes with stone
Any criticism take it to the crib for some ism and twist em 
I shine like ?pea-fogs? in prison that's T.W.IsM.

Matter-a-fact why'all, I take advantage, I'm taking chances making advances 
While you sit, waiting for answers, wha-wha

It's like I strike again blow you away like kites in the wind 
And hard men with my sharp pin 
Who rock the spot?
I've done it, you hollering about 
Want the war but none of why'all worth the dollar or amount 
See chicks want none of this if you do confront it 
I peel hundreds while you things only keep one stick it blunted 
So why'all gorilla looks I don't fear those 
Cause I go thirty-two rounds like a Tech with air holes 
So t-knock your z-rocks you can't rap with me

I know a kid with four albums but don't get know respect 
No matter what he do his life's always a test 
He got stress on his chest and the world on his back 
They say he's greedy he do too much he raps and acts 
Then try to play ball and dominate the pros 
I don't know why why'all mad he's just followin those 
Who paved the way, cream and Dr. Jay 
When they did a movie girl didn't have nothing to say 
So can he play, can he claim the world is his? 
Can he do the right thing instead and set example for kids? 
Reach for the sky he's tryin to hold glitramatis 
Handle your biz Shaq know what time it is like what 
Be mad at the players be mad at the game

And get the lotion out cause the sun out

Lookin at the Lexus it's about that time to call my baby girl
Got to protect what's mine the ladies are squallin by the fox

The pool's heated you want to be conceited ? beat it!

Throw my grub down gettin rubbed down 
There's no time for attitude my days shatter proof
Just push up your hands at the pool jam boogie with me

And fixin plates the ladies too fly to swim 
And Kenny's on the air with the poolside basketball rim 
While dirt belly flapper swam guy

Try to tell me lies, but you're so sloppy

At times you had me speechless, you made me feel so loved
At first you were an angel, but then you turned so cold

This situations getting heavy
Up in dis double life, so phony
I'm tryna keep in on da down low
But the way you actin that's impossible
I thought we had an understandin
No strings attached, you had a girl
That's what you told me
Now we both are catchin feelins
This don't seem real, this can't be right
We have to end this

Sometimes I wonder, my life couldn't be
If I had no man, then where would we be
This creepin and cheatin is gettin to me
Temptation is killin me, we're gettin too deep
Sometimes I wonder, my life couldn't be
If I had no man, then where would we be
This creepin and cheatin is gettin to me
Temptation is killin me, we're gettin too deep

Now from the jump it was a mistake
But neitha of us wanna walk away
Oh God, please tell me that I'm dreamin
The way he got me, like an addict boy I'm feenin
Damn I hate I eva met you
I love my man but he is not you
See its time fo some closure
No midnight calls, no creepin out
This fling is over

Sometimes I wonder, my life couldn't be
If I had no man, then where would we be
This creepin and cheatin is gettin to me
Temptation is killin me, we're gettin too deep
Sometimes I wonder, my life couldn't be
If I had no man, then where would we be
This creepin and cheatin is gettin to me
Temptation is killin me, we're gettin too deep

Now its time for me and you to call it quits
Hate to say, I'm so ashamed this has to end
Can't describe what I feel, this can't be real
My man can't do me like you do
Now its time for me and you to call it quits
Hate to say, I'm so ashamed this has to end
Can't describe what I feel, this can't be real
But sometimes I wonder

Sometimes I wonder, my life couldn't be
If I had no man, then where would we be

On my way to the doctor, boy today is not my day
Got some mornin sickness, and my period is late

Said we'd make it through the stormy weather
But ya locked up now

U told me don't wait on the floor forever
Said I gotta look for something better
'Cause ya locked up now

I shoulda known from da corner of da block
That you were wrong
One day soon you'd be leavin' me alone
But I gave you da digits anyway

Ooh, I had my doubts
But you know how I like 'em thugged out
Thought for sure
I could change a thugs route

But a mans gonna be what a man wants to be
No matter what ya say sometimes

You gave me fancy cars, diamonds and pearls
But without ya here what is it worth?
Not a damn thing
Sometimes I cry in the rain for you

Ya wishin' things could be the way they were
'Cause all the joy of love turned into hurt
And I can't take the pain

Said I gotta look for something better

I understand that in the game sometimes you lose ya man
But 25 to life wasn't in the plan, how do I pick up the pieces?
I keep fallin' to pieces, every time that I see you caged up
I kept prayin' everyday you'd wake up

But all the money somehow wasn't enough
I guess you had ya own reasons
Now it's only teasin' your all

You gave me fancy cars, diamonds and pearls
But without ya here what is it worth?

U told me don't wait on the floor forever
Said I gotta look for something better
'Cause ya locked up now

I've been gain it all, there's no need to fall
As long as I knew you'd come home
A simple 9 to 5 and some quality time
instead of catchin' up on the jail phone

I tried to let go 'cause ya tellin' me so
But I don't wanna move on
I'm down for mine but I'm tired of cryin'
I gotta face the fact that you're gone

U told me that we would always be together
Said we'd make it through the stormy weather
But ya locked up now

U told me don't wait on the floor forever
Said I gotta look for something better
'Cause ya locked up now

But I can't say nothing
The accusations you gripe and you complain
You always mad about something

You'd be wilding out if you knew I had packed my things
But I ain't saying nothing
The decision of a lifetime, I'm having second thoughts
About you for the last time

Maybe it's all good that it's come down to this
(Maybe it's all good, yeah)
Before we bought the house the cars before we had any kids
(Don't need to bring no kids into this mess)
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
(For you to think out)
What it takes for you to be my lover

If you gonna love me, love me all the way completely
Baby, no half stepping, give me, give me what it takes
To make me feel, if you gonna leave me baby leave today
Ain't got no time to waist this love on no one
Who don't need it, don't know what to do with it

You're checkin' my pagers scrolling down my caller ID
Like trust ain't a factor
When all the while baby you were cheating on me
Did you regret the morning after?

Even though you had these tendencies from the start of this thing
I thought I could change you
You made it easy to decide, there's no way
That I could never be your wife

Maybe it's all good that it's come down to this
(Maybe it's all good)
Before we bought the house the cars before we had any kids
(Don't need to be taking no children into this abuse no, no, no)
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
(Boy you ain't the one that I wanna take)
What it takes for you to be my lover

If you gonna love me
(If you gonna love me, yeah)
Love me all the way completely
(Yeah, yeah)

Baby, no half stepping
(No half stepping)
Give me, give me what it takes
(Give me this love to make me feel it's real, yeah)

To make me feel
If you gonna leave me baby leave today
(If you leaving, leave)
Ain't got no time

To waist this love on no one
(No half of you)
Who don't need it
Don't know what to do with it

Uh, Sharissa where you at?
Sharissa where you at?

If you gonna love me, love me all the way completely
Baby, no half stepping
(Yeah)
Give me, give me what it takes

To make me feel
(Keep it moving)
If you gonna leave me baby leave today
(Oh, yeah)

Ain't got no time to waist this love on no one
(No, no time for you)
Who don't need it
Don't know what to do with it

If you gonna love me
(If you gonna if you gonna if you gonna)
Love me all the way completely

Sharleen Spiteri,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I
""You do not know, silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said 
""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence",Sound of Silence

Let me captivate you, listen to my tune

Never tell me dreams come true

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

You woke the sleep of my life from gray into red 
Made the weary wonder of Wall Street rise from the dead 

Could bare held his body my entire life

So I left for the terminal where I began

So here I am this morning where love had asked for the dance 
Here within this terminal where I passed on a chance 
Lord, I'll never find him though I've truly tried 
Probably he's found another bus to ride and

Sharon Fisher,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Sharon Hayes,"Look at how she looks at me
I can never look at her that way
Full of all the feelings and the soft
Unspoken words that lovers say
In all the words, in all the books
I wish there were a way to say that
What she's taught me
Isn't written anywhere
And I'm supposed to be the one
Who's wise
One thing is certain
I can never be what she 
Expects of me
I've wanted the shadows
I don't anymore
No matter what happens
I won't anymore
I've run from the sunlight
Afraid it saw too much
The moon had the one light
I bathed in
I walked in
I held in my feelings
And closed every door
No matter what happens
I can't anymore
There's someone who must hear
The words I've never spoken
Tonight if he were here
My silence would be broken
I need him to touch me
To know the love that's in my heart
The same heart that tells me
To see myself
To free myself
To be myself at last!
For too many mornings
The curtains were drawn
It's time they were opened
To welcome the dawn
A voice deep inside
Is getting stronger
I can't keep it quiet any longer
No matter what happens
It can't be the same anymore
I promise it won't be the same
Anymore!

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Near the relief office - I see my people

I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I'm old fashioned, I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This years fancies are passing fancies
But sighing sighs, holding hands
These my heart understands

I'm old fashioned but I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me.

I'm old fashioned but I don't mind it
That's how I want to be

Sharon Ruben,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Sharon Ruben,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening

Without a song the road would never bend

A man is born but he's no good no how
Without a song        
I got my trouble and woe but, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll        
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all

Sharon Shannon,"Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk 
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay 
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk 
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay 
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do 
Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl 
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl 

We were halfway there when the rain came down 
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay 
And she asked me up to her flat downtown 
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay 
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do 
Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl 
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl 
 
When I woke up I was all alone 
With a broken heart and a ticket home 
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do 
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
I've traveled around I've been all over this world

Nothing but a bottle in his hand
She sat in her apartment lonesome to the bone
Wondering what had happened to her man

Love, love, love, love
Nobody ever understands
All the things that go,
Between a woman and a man.

When they'd walk down the sidewalk the street would shine
With the kind of love no human heart can fake
And they vowed to stay together till the end of time
Like the couple that stands on top of the wedding cake

[Chorus]

If I should live to a ripe old age
The only lesson I may ever learn
Is to not stand so close to the flame of love
Unless you are willing to get burned

I bid farewell to old Kentucky, 
The place where I was born and raised. 
(The place where he was born and raised)

For six long years I've been in trouble, 
No pleasures here on earth I found. 
For in this world I'm bound to ramble, 
I have no friends to help me now. 
(He has no friends to help him now.)

It's fare thee well my old lover. 
I never expect to see you again. 
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad, 
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.

You can bury me in some deep valley, 
For many years where I may lay. 
Then you may learn to love another, 
While I am sleeping in my grave.

And he wondered what in heaven who invented such a joy
But the question got the better of his scientific mind
And to his blind and dying gaze
He looked up high and often sighed
And sometimes cried

Who puts the rainbow in the sky
Who lights the stars at night
Who dreamt up someone so divine
Someone like you and made them mine

Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then
But just remember the alternatives for I remember when
I was lonely and unhappy
And my lips were cold as ice
But you kissed me, and good heavens
Now I'm here in paradise
So if ever I'm not kissing you or looking in your eyes
I won't be blind, and I won't cry
I'll look up high and gladly sigh
And thank the guy

Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine?

I'm on my knees,

I can't lie on my pocket trout

So I sit back in the easy chair
And a woman of middle age
Licks and thumbs another page

From her greyhound skirt (and all the boys go)

And fountain water gush
Through the thick bull rush (everybody)",July

Will it get better?
And all the cracks inside this love
Will they heal in the bright weather

And she saved me
All the stupid little crimes
A thousand million different times
And she forgave me
Promise me this will get better
And it will heal in the bright weather
And as long as were together 
I don't mind?

And if we go to Mexico,
Will it be a new leaf?
We'll watch the evening disappear
Into the arms of the night thief

You know it's always been my heart
You know I always fall apart
It's not my fault, it's just my flaw

You turn me in to a museum
You kept me from the growing weeds
When all you wanted was the best
From me, that is the test
Can you keep me from?
You can't explain me

You know it's always been my heart
You know I always fall apart
It's not my fault, it's just my flaw
It's who I am

I can't believe the way I've been
I've been resentful and I've sinned
I need you now just as a friend
I need a hand held, not a pushing
I need a way to help me to stand only to crash

Don't know what I'd do but when
I look to my side I'll be a friend

Tell me that I’m somewhere you don’t want to go
Tell me that I’m someome you don’t want to know
Like the back of your hand
I don’t understand
Undone, disarmed
Well I don’t know and you don’t mind
This time there’s no time
Well I don’t know and you don’t mind
Deep inside of the day, anyone else would fall in your arms
But I do not
Do I, do I, do I want that
I was something that you just couldn’t feel
I was something that you couldn’t feel that was real
I believed you when you shut your eyes and dreamed a dream without me
Mmmmmmmmm
Sometimes I don’t think about you
Hmmmmmmmm
Sometimes I don’t think about it

Falling into thoughts that turn to colours
The colours are the colours of my thoughts and they’re painting you

I didn't want to see the light

Waves all around
And they're smashing down
Take my hand, shut your eyes
And hope you remember
You like the position
Watch that change 'fore we drown
We ask ourselves, where we are now
Who we are, what that means

You shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Just like blood

Disappear when the sun goes down
Acid spills as you breathe
Turn around, stare at the wall
Bone to my mouth, and read it out

You shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Just like blood

Sharon Van Etten,"It took me years to find
True mind at peace
And now you treat me like
They approve me
You're my poem, yes you know
Yet you stole my way
Just to know this, you told me
You were late
When you would call, I would hold
And I still remain
Then you led me to believe that's what you wanted

Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away

True love, but I'd see you
Treat me more like you
And I'd try to heal it
But I feel so thrown back
Take my hand, in the cold
In the snow, but you do not break
But they told you, convinced you
Think I'd play
But I know myself better than you do

Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away

May, May calling slow
Finally in a dress that meant money in the bank
Drinking hard so you can't feel the warmth of the arms
So you dreamt, fade away
Take my hand, I paid my fine
In the park, in the dark, when you said my name
On the bench, when I felt that you smiled
And you said there, that child

Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away",Pay My Debts

Shaun Cassidy,"Over worked and underpaid
The husband carries on his trade
Working hard nine to five
A corporate example of the middle class staying alive

Safe at home his lovely wife
With whom he shared a simple life
Suddenly finds she's needing more
Longing for the love that died so many years before

She was seventeen, he was twenty one
A virgin till the day that she was married young
So incomplete
Break for the street
Oh break for the street
Oh break for the street

And so she runs into the night
Believing all that once was right
Trying hard to understand
She finds herself collapsing in the arms of another man

She was thirty six and he was twenty one

Shaun Cassidy,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her, whenever it starts
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll

If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah, do you believe in magic
Yeah, believe in the magic of a young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of rock and roll

Hey, Deanie, you're the one I'm dreamin' of

I was a fool for your love from the moment I saw you
Like a vision in the darkness of a thousand lost and lonely nights
But my heart threw away the key
I was blind as a man could be
Oh baby can't you help me see the light

I stand accused I'm in league with the forces of darkness
An incurable believer in the magic of the midnight sky
And the love that I found today
Oh I can't let it slip away 
Oh darlin' can't you read between the lines

I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you had your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
The heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired, you're lookin' kinda  beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Halfway home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was givin' what she got

I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby

Oh, woman you're a mess, gonna die in your sleep
There's  blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messin' around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town

You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet

I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby

Alright!  I didn't know you had a rock and roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's as dark as it's gone

I'm sure that you could manage
Then just take your time
And don't let them take advantage of you""

Shaun Groves,"My cup is never empty
My eyes are never dry
I'd be drunk by now if
Selfishness were wine
Seems like a million years
That I've been standing here
Holding on to all that holds me down

Come and move me
In a holy dance
Through my circumstance
Come and move me
From my hiding place
Into Your embrace
Where the whole human race sees You
Move me

Let the sun burn brighter
I'll run into Your shade
Dip the sky in darkness
I'll cry out for Your day
Use bitter and sweet
To move my frozen feet
Far beyond all that holds me down

I know it's true
When I'm destitute
You come running to me
But sometimes
I believe you simply

Shaun Groves,"Walking with you is not without hazards
Trippings this traveler's curse
Price paid for falling is more than my stumble
In a world that is watching and waiting for words

But I listened when You said to go
And I set out in spite of my fears
About truth mixed with my imperfection
And the question of what to say when I got here

And now that I'm here
Should I tell them that
You are the one who has made me
And saved me and set up a home there inside
Should I tell them that I am a perfect example
Of all You can do with a life.
What should I say to them?
What if I'm failing them?
What should I tell the tonight?

Now don't get me wrong
I'm thankful to be here
With this song to sing and a spotlight on me,
But lately I'm wondering if you are mistaken,
If you're seeing all of me there is to see.

Cause on every face I detect
The same questions I've posed to you
Like do you speak through the imperfect
Are we too dirty for your light to get through?
I want your light to get through.

What should I tell them when
They're thirsty Lord
My cup is empty Lord
Come and lead me here in this place
'cause I'm unashamed, but I'm unprepared
And I'm just plain afraid

Welcome to this heart of mine
I've buried under prideful vines
Grown to hide the mess I've made 
Inside of me
Come decorate, Lord
Open up the creaking door
And walk upon the dusty floor
Scrape away the guilty stains
Until no sin or shame remain
Spread Your love upon the walls
And occupy the empty halls
Until the man I am has faded
No more doors are barricaded

It's not my own
Make it home
Come and take this heart and make it

Forgive me for the disrepair
And the souvenirs from floor to ceiling
Gathered on my search for meaning
Every closet's filled with clutter
Messes yet to be discovered
I'm overwhelmed, I understand
I can't make this place all that You can

I took the space that You placed in me
Redecorated in shades of greed
And I made sure every door stayed locked
Every window blocked, and still You knocked

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Suits from our birthday shinin' in the moonlight
You and me skinny , dippin' 'bout midnight
Squeezed each other tight 'til our clothes dried

Shawn Camp,"Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart

Act 1 was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came Act 2, you seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I'll never know

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

On the dead of the night

When I was young

I brought it here, and now for years
The streets of London keep it safe and warm
Every morning it dies and is reborn
In the dead of the night

I keep a pencil and a book
I say this is how a life can look
Russian roulette, French-kissed cigarette
And the silence like an anvil

The things that you learn, but now all that burns
Is a candle
And the fog melts over the night, and it softens the edges

A bead of sweat runs down my arm
And I drink it from my skin

It is communion

Fortunate son

For the bomb scare
He would hide from us under the kitchen
Where she simmered so soft with
Her weapons of tin
And like so many suppers she just
Gave us to him
And he never did guess in her cast
Iron dress
She was burning beyond recognition

And I seem to be nobody's daughter

On my chest
The heat of my pride
The lips of a bride

And the flag of youth
And blood that is thicker than water

These Canadian plains
And their windblown hair
Jane the bruise colored clouds
The smell of the ground
In the ripening air

In your fluttering dress
And your dry face of steel
As you're dragging your red rowing boat
Cross the forever fields

Inside my head
There's nothing but fear
Jane the rivers of grief
The tears of relief
Seem ages from here

Sometimes the beauty of life
Hits like lightening washing everything clear
And these dimmers of doubt flicker
Fade out and disappear

But Jane that is a luxury
There are those of little faith it seems
And they beg for truth like charity
And I see them on every street corner
They are holding out one righteous hand
While the other leads the marching band
In the shadow hymn of the scratchman
Heed the message, kill the messenger

Wriggling up from the mud
On the shores of Granville
But Jane in the wink of an eye

Like hounds at your heels
Jane they'll whisper your name
And you won't feel the chains
And you won't see the moss
Oh, Jane there's an art to the game
The aesthetics of love
The athletics of loss

Sometimes someone drifts by
And our nets get entwined in the sea
And in time I might find
They still mean something to me

But Jane that is a luxury
There are those of little faith in me
And they pull me down like gravity

 Pages fill up the days
 Between him and me

 From bedrooms to business-speak
 Make me remember how cheap
 Words can be
 And the letters I wrote you of
 Were those of the desperate stuff
 Like begging for love in a suicide threat
 But I am too young to die
 Too old for a lullaby
 Too tired for life on the ledge

 But I had a dream last night
 Of lovers who walked the plank
 Out on the edge of time
 Amidst ridicule
 They laughed as they rocked and reeled
 Over the mining fields
 Coming to rest on this ship of fools

 Of her smile in the light
 Of the dawn of the menacing sky
 And before they went overboard
 She turned and held up a card
 And it said Valentine",Polaroids

We set the prairie on fire
How hard will the wind blow
How far will it go

When the feeling burns down
To one solitary color
The velocity of longing
Melting into each other
It's a song our fingers play
All at once and together
You can bet we never learned it
But we've known it forever

Oh I dreamed that we were flying
Carried up from the ashes
Black silhouettes of velvet
Against the crimson of passion
We can almost hear the echoes
From the smoldering meadow
It's the rapture of the angels
And the rage of the devil

Through the rusted wires of sleep
With our arms around midnight

I never heard such rock and roll
As on your back roads
Tennessee

Now I know you're not to blame
But you know that you should have told me
That I would never be the same
After riding down your back roads
Tennessee

Somebody held me tight
Somebody tried to fight
Somebody raced out in the night
Runnin' down your back roads

Oh you kissed the soul of a rebel
In a Yankee girl
You got to me
I heard you callin' 'round the world
From your back roads
Tennessee

I saw somebody standin'
In a field with a crutch
Behind his rich southern daddy
With a Midas touch
They said be outta here by sundown
They said good luck
You might say I was the stranger
Who knew too much

Somebody took a hope lock from my heart
And threw it down your back roads
Tennessee

Oh you feel the north wind blow
That's only me
I want to hear some rock and roll
On your back roads

I'm not the bad city girl
Come down to rape you
I'm not the hometown queen
Who wants to save you
I heard you callin' to my soul
From your back roads

Of the feelings I have for him
In my heart

Every time that I come near him
I just loose my nerve like I've done
From the start

Cause every little thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

Do I have to tell the story?
Of the thousand rainy days
Since we first met

Its a big enough umbrella
But its always me 
Who ends up getting wet

Cause every lil thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

I resolve to call him up
A thousand times a day
And ask him if hell marry me
In some old fashioned way

But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reached the phone
Long before my tongues tripped me
Must I always be alone

Cause every little thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

We lay in the tall grass, til the mornin' light come shining
If I had my way I'd never get the urge to roam.
Sometimes to serve my country , Sometimes I stay at home.
Just don't put me in the frame upon the mantel
Where memories turn dusty old and grey.
Don't leave me alone in the twilight.
Twilight is the loneliest time of day .
Never gave a second thought, never crossed my mind.
What's right and what's not. I'm not the judgin' kind.
I could take the darkness and the storms from the skies.
But we all got certain trials burnin' up inside.
Don't send me no distant salutations.
Or silly souvenirs from far away.
Don't leave me alone in the twilight.

Don't put me in the frame upon the mantel.
Where memories turn dusty old and grey.

 Of the loving that I've missed
 I would wrap myself around you

Shawn Colvin,"The streets of my town are not
What they were
They are haloed in anger, bitter
And hurt
And it's not so you'd notice but
It's a sinister thing
Like the wheels of ambition at
The christening

So I went out walking on the
Streets of the dead
With a chip on my shoulder
And a voice in my head
It said you have been brought here
Though you don't know what for

Well the mystery train is coming
Right to your door

And I hear you calling, you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can cry like an angel

There were high school night dances
When we played stump the band
We were raising each other
In a strange land
There were hard pills to swallow
But we drank 'em all down
Oh the nights were too short then
And now they're a little too long

I hear you calling and you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can shout out in anger
You can laugh like a fool
You can cry like an angel

So look homeward baby
Keep your eyes on the sky
They will never forgive you
So don't ask them to try
This is your party, I know
It's not your ideal
May we all find salvation
In professions that heal

I hear you calling, you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can shout out an answer
You can laugh like a fool

You can call up to heaven
We'll be listening to you
You can sing hallelujah
You can fly like a bird
You can cry like angel
When there are no words",Cry Like an Angel

Than to bury that jewel when it was mine all along

To live it again I would believe a lie

Shawn Colvin,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the windows of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streaks
To England where my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day

And the song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There before the grace of you go I

It was never clear what would come but that's the risk and that's the test

Or how long you sit alone before you stop looking back 
It's like you're waiting for Godot 
And then you pick your sorry ass up off the street and 
Go... 

And what the hell is this? Who made this bloody mess? 
And someone always answers like a martyr 
Is it something you should know, did you never do your best 
Would you be saved if you were brave and just tried harder

God  I swear it's good to be back home 
Waiting for the newest Rolling Stone 
All the other girls are still at war 
The best and worst of 1994 
Sometimes I see the half and not the whole 
Sometimes I see the face and not the soul 
Sometimes I think this place has no part 
For anyone who ever had a heart 

This is your new thing now 
And it looks so good in print 
Just a poet and her pimps 
But not quite 
This is your new thing now 
A prom dress and a sneer 
The woman of the year 
But not quite, not quite 

Gee, it's good to see a dream come true 
People smile and bless all over you 
Mixing up those latest junkie-isms 
With all the pretty terms of religion 
And don't you love the leader of the band 
Equal parts Butthead and Peter Pan 
All the other kids are sad again 
A legend's not a legend 'til it ends 

This is your new thing now 
And it makes the whole world spin 
It's as least as old as sin 
But not quite 
This is your new thing now 
And now you're turning grinning 
But maybe no one's listening 
And you might lose it all my darling, yes you might 

This is your new thing now 
And it feels so good to doubt you 
I could almost live without you 
But not quite",New Thing Now

There ain't much hope

You got nothin' on me
I got friends uptown
And they don't talk down
They be keepin' me safe and sound

We got somethin' to be
So in case you hadn't noticed
I'm alright
Not like it was before

Things used to be so hopeless
But not tonight
Tonight I'm walkin' out that door
I'm not gonna cry

When wavin' goodbye
And I know this time
You got nothin' on me
Well it ain't that tough

Just more of the usual stuff
One heartache is more than enough
There ain't nothing to see
Nothing

I got friends uptown
And they still come 'round
They be keepin' me safe and sound
We got somethin' to be

So don't you try to save me
With your advice
Or turn me into something else
Cause I'm not crazy

And you're not nice
Baby if you do
Keep it to yourself

Let me be your wailing companion 
Pass 'em on by  don't look 'em in the eye

You could wake up dead 
And you'll never know what's real 
All this damage is runnin' loose in your head

Oh  no  baby don't go 
Walkin' down Suicide Alley 

Downtown baby it's a million to one 
You might as well name your poison 
And stand in line by the exit sign 
Suicide Alley is waiting 

You're a loose cannonball on a sinking ship 
From the belly of the beast, shot from the hip 
But you don't have to be going down the dark hall 
You're not tied to the chair, you're not nailed to the wall 

Oh, no, baby don't go 
Walkin' down Suicide Alley 

Sitting naked by the window in the middle of the night 
I can see you wearing your halo 
If only in the daybreak of the dirty street light 
I know baby wasn't born to follow 

You know I wasn't born I was spat out at a wall 
And nobody even knew my name 
The sun hatched me out, cradle and all 
On the corner of First and Insane 

For the souls of the departed and the renegades of love 
You and me we gotta be all we dreamed of 
In the ruins of mischief through the ravages of time 
You got a place in this world of mine

Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission
She says days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
It's time for a few small repairs she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance
She says days go by I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it
Oh days go by I'm hypnotized

You need someone to walk with in the dark  well 
I'm your man 

I go to the trouble like a magnet 
That's where I'll be 
Trouble is just a place to sing 
It's what you need 

I swear you look like you're in jail 
And all at once you're halfway out the door 
One foot dancing, one foot nailed 
To the floor 

Chasing those circles in the ground 
The same old shit is still the same old lie 
Just when you think you've got it down 
Watch it fly 

I go to the trouble like a light 
Or like a dare 
Trouble is just a friend to me, I know 
It'll always be there 

It's really hard to make your peace 
So give me some credit for the hell I've paid 
This world's a blessing and a beast 
Everyday 

So come on baby let me show you how 
The less you know the more I comprehend 
You don't have to drag me down 
I descend 

I go to the trouble and I like it

Shawn Colvin,"Down at the train they go to Independence everyday 
But anywhere else now seems like a million miles away 
And I must have been high to believe that I would ever leave 
Now I'm just a flat fine line like the Wichita skyline 
I rode on the airstream across the great lonesome afternoon 
I wished hard enough to hurt  drove fast enough to catch the moon 
But I must have been dreaming again 'cause there's nothing around the bend 
Except for that flat fine line, the Wichita skyline 

As far as Salina I can get that good station from LaRue 
I'm searching the dial while I'm scanning the sky for a patch of blue 
And I watch the black clouds roll in chasing me back again

Always giving up the ghost 
In your own private conversation 
You're a sweet mystery

You and the Mona Lisa 

Nothing in particular 
And everything in between 
This is what you mean to me 
Only you and only me 
Climbing in the right direction 
On the way to everything

And no one thought to try 
But I was the one to blame 
And it was just a mirage 
So I hid in the garage

Fun for all that children call their favorite time of year.

Olden times and ancient rhymes and love and dreams to share.

Beauty every where;
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there.

Oh that we could always see such spirit through the year.",Christmas Time Is Here

I sit up some
The lambs were coming homeward one by one
I heard a sheepbell softly calling them
Along the little road to Bethlehem

Beside an open door as I drew night
I heard sweet Mary
A lullaby
She sang about the lambs at close of day
And rocked her tiny boy among the hay

Across the air the silver sheepbell rang
The lambs are coming home sweet Mary sang
You're a star of gold
You're a star of gold
Is shining in the sky
So sleep, my little baby
Go lullaby

The lambs were coming homeward one by one

A weary beat flipper
Is curled at thy knees
The storm shall not wake thee
Nor shark overtake thee
Asleep in the arms of this slow swinging sea

And ships are tossed at sea

Atlantic nine miles off shore
And every single black car that goes by just
Might be yours
I haven't moved from this spot I sit here
Watching TV in bed
I wanna see if the crash was sabotage
I wanna know if everyone is dead

I remember when I was fifteen me and Liz
Would ride around
We liked to smoke in the car in the winter
With all the windows rolled down
I had a dream a plane exploded over my lake
One afternoon
I still remember the feeling when I woke up
I can't describe the magnitude

So many other dreams
The one that I had today
You and the Italian woman naked
Your fingers between her legs
She lay like a body in the water
She barely made a sound
She fell as quiet, as quiet, as a leaf falling
To the ground

Meanwhile back on earth I told you to
Fuck off and go away
I've gotta call my friend who moved from 
New York to LA
Five days before Christmas last year his
Girlfriend died in a plane crash
He says the way that it happens is your heart
Is so heavy it rips away upon impact
And then you just bleed inside
You don't even feel a thing
They found her on a hill in Colombia
Intact among the debris

So many other dreams

The ones where I don't know why
The ones where my parents drove

Shawn Colvin,"You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so, I'm the one who wants you
Yes I'm the one who wants you

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show
That I'm not trying to pretend

'Cause I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I've got a big surprise

And I wanna go, but I hate to leave you
You know, I hate to leave you
You if you break my heart, I'll go
But I'll be back again

Shawn Colvin,"I might go to the mountain to spy,
And I see all the pretty snow,
And I dream that dream I dream no matter where I go,
We were still young like when we met,
And I hadn't fucked it all up yet,
And you wanted me to be with you like before,
What I like about time is it don't ask why,
What I like about love is it makes me cry,
What I like about the bird is she don't need nothing but sky,
And I know you tried to tell me then,
No one could bear the shit I put on them,
And I guess you wonder why you even let me in,
Well so do I,
And in my dream I never make you pay,
For all the things you did and did not say,
I was ready to be good to you,
And make you stay,
And you took me to the carnival town,
And we rode the rides up and down,
And we watched the birds watch us smile,
And then they flew away,
What I like about time is it don't ask why,
What I like about love is it makes me cry,
What I like about the bird is she don't need nothing but sky,
And I know you think my life's a crime,
And you talk about it to your wife sometimes,
You all shake your heads and sigh,

But mark my words you will

You heard your story told
You felt you were getting old
You thought it time to go
But you couldn't find no share of gold
That set you back on down the road

Take your bruised ego

Immovable Rock, Omnipotent, Powerful,
Awesome Lord.
Victorious Warrior, Commanding King of Kings,
Mighty Conqueror and the only time,
The only time I ever saw him run,
Was when

He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to His chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice He said
""Son, do you know I still love You?""

He caught me By surprise, When God ran

The day I left home,
I knew I'd broken His heart.
And I wondered then, if things could ever be the same.
Then one night,
I remembered His love for me.
And down that dusty road, ahead I could see,
It was the only time,
It was the only time I ever saw Him run.
And then

He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to His chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice He said
""Son, do you know I still love You?""

He caught me by surprise.
And He brought me to my knees.
When God ran, I saw Him run to me.

I was so ashamed, all alone, and so far away.
But now I know, that He's been waiting for this day
I saw Him run to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to his chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice
I felt his love for me again.
He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to his chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice
He said ""Son""
He called me Son.
He said ""Son, do you know I still love You?""

All this time is was she mackin' me
Yo Yo! Yo Yo!

My girl said she gonna to chill tonight
That's cool because I worked up an appetite
Called up my boys and said let's get together
The time couldn't be any better 
Let's hit the club and do whatever
Stepped in, straight to the V-I-P
All good, all the honeys were up on me
But then, I looked across the room
Saw my girl working her groove 
Dancing with some other dude

All of this time, she's been playing with my mind
And now I know, what you reap is what you sow 

I thought I knew what I was doing
Didn't stop to think but it was just so plain to see
That she played me like a Yo Yo
All this time it was she mackin' me
I thought I was on top of my game
Everything was running smooth, It felt so easy
I thought I played her like a Yo Yo
But all this time it was she mackin' me 

She said pick me up at eight o'clock
Drove up, damn she was looking hot
Took her to this spot that I knew in town
Where no one would be around, and where we could get down
All good, spending all of this crazy dough
Thinking she would go were I want to go
Next thing, she started to give the eye
Smiling at this other guy, that's when she said bye bye 

All of this time, She's been playing with my mind
And now I know, What you reap is what you sow 

I thought I had her spinning like a Yo Yo
On top of my game, doing all the things I wanted to
I thought I had her spinning like a Yo Yo

No spokes on the motorcycle bike ma like some Lorenzos.
See somethin' nice in the window
I throw the car down like a football spike in the end zone
Depends on if your friends gone
Mami, I'm the one with the jims and the peanut butter timbs
Just ask me when, and I ain't frontin'
We can stunt like Jet Li and Jackie Chan
And I ain't screamin I need space

Always figured you'd be back some day.
But it's over and I know that
It's All because of mistakes that I've made.
And I'm going crazy for trying to deal with all of this pain.
But played it off like everything's okay.
But the truth is that it isn't, so
And what I'm tryna say, I hope it's not to late for us.

I know I hurt you a thousand times, (a thousand times)
But I want you back and that's the bottom line. (the bottom line)

Sometimes it's even hard to breathe. 
And it's different without you,

Don't know what I was thinking when you said ""I'm leaving"",
Then I told you to go, and you walked right out the door.

Shawn Desman,"I guess I fell in love too quick
Kinda got burned up by a red head chick
So I ain't tryin' go that route again

I was rolling through a stop sign
Lookin' at a red light when I seen her ass walk by
That's when I found my new friend

And she had blonde hair, bright blue eyes
Looking like a flower child
Top down, music loud
Jamming to her favorite song

I'm down, she was down
So we really hit it off
And I know she could never do
Do to me what them red heads do

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

Got a girl whose a real knock out
Got me all turned out but I still have doubts
Why she gonna get her hair done again?
(She's gonna get her hair done again)

She did something kinda strange the other day
I was looking at a picture of her family
She came and snatched it away, it away

And I don't know why she would hide it
But I let it go
And there are certain things about her
That I still don't know

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

My girl walked in today
But there was something strange
I still recognized her face
But something else had changed

She had bright red hair
I just stopped and stared
Walked by me like she didn't care
That hair was always there

See I know I'ma be okay
I got rid of Miss Red today
Tryna cover up behind my back
But I knew that red would come right back

See I know I'ma be okay
I got rid of Miss Red today
Tryna cover up behind my back
But I knew that red would come right back

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head

Down to the corner and I saw a man
Sitting with a cup in his hand
Saying, ""Hey won't you give me something
Won't you give me something to eat?""

I took a look into his eyes and
I saw he had a story to tell
But I walked away with my pockets full
Full of change
And I said, ""I got nothing for you""

That I need a little more

Walking from city to city
Teaching people how to love
Giving them grace and mercy

Now, Jesus was a friend to the friendless
Loving on all the outcasts
Teaching them that there was more
More than what they're living for
More than what they're living for

That I need a little more

So many things pulling and tugging you from what is true

By taking out the competition
They like to yell and such
I like the softer touch
All they do is talk so much when all we need is change
Not monetarily, the end of the world is approaching scarily
Well, not to be personally
But to a friend, I mind this terribly
Caught off guard, when he realized that our love is hard
Then he realized that day to day, he could find a better way

My heart is losing control over you

Lost in everlasting love's amorous glow
Set aflame despite the rain and seven seasons of snow
I got accustomed to white knuckles from all the time I spent alone
When I gave away my heart I was neglected and disowned
And then you came to me and took the time to speak in poems
And whispered that you'd like for me to make with you a home
And now from the ashes, like a phoenix, this new love has flown
Despite the greatest hearts
I'm afraid to lose control

My heart is losing control over you

Of the plans and demands that will maintain control
Of your heart and your head and your spirit and soul
I'm a lovesick man and my love makes me bold
And I'll crawl through the wire, through the fire and the cold
And I'll whisper your name down every desolate road
Until I find you again and I make sure you know
That my love will never die, I love you

Shawn Mendes,"She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on

But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way, sing with me

But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

She would use no help, it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus

Where to stop

That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go

Shawn Mullins,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down 
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below; 
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors 
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul. 
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying 
Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain. 
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes 
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains. 

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!"" 
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!"" 
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!"" 
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?"" 

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown 
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone. 
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men 
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home. 
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter 
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by 
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason 
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye. 

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me, 
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""; 
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!"" 
""Lord!"" she said"" ""Casey it's a shame to be alone!""",Casey's Last Ride

""Do I look so different than anyone else?""

A mission for a love lost long ago. 

I welcome its return.
Years gone by, no time to cry a prayer for me
As I watch my bridges burn.

I was like you, I never knew 
How I could be a victim of our red, white, and blue.

There's a photograph from my childhood.
It was taken in the desert, early light

With a Mexican vest and a red hippie hat on.
Maracas in my left hand, stick in my right.

There are canyons; there are caverns
There are border roadside taverns.
I am held captive by the big, blue, sky above me.

She naps with the TV on.
I smell the June cut grass from my pappy's lawn.
I play alone in the little room upstairs.

There are Lincoln logs and cookie tins,
Colored blocks, and wars to win.
I draw, and I dream, and beat my drums up there.

There are circus lights and maple leaves.
There are daffodils and dogwood trees.
I am held captive by the big blue sky above me.

Now the coffee's strong,
And the fruit's all wrong,
And my wakeup call's for somebody else.

And the TV's hoax and neurosis jokes
Always keep my laughing at myself.
And I laugh a lot; that's what I do,

And I learn the things I never knew.
And I see canyons I see caverns
I see border roadside taverns.

And I cannot lie I'll tell you how but I can't tell why
And everything I feel I don't know if it's real it comes and goes

It all went wrong 
So keep in mind 
Keep in mind you're not to blame

Bitter tears can fall like rain 
On your fields 
And those fields need that rain 
So look away 
And think ahead 
And live your life 
And cry those tears

Shawn Mullins,"As the lights go down 
The drumming clown 
Whistled a melody 
And as the rain pours down 
His happy face 
Turned into a sad one 
The autumn wind reminded him 
That the circus had come and gone 
So he opened a pack of swisher sweets 
And whistles down the first one 
His clothes are ragged 
And his hat is dusty 
His drum is missing snares 
He maybe laughin' and he may be cryin' 
But no one knows nor cares 
His belly's empty 
But his heart is full 
He knows where he belongs 
So he steps aboard that lovely train 
And he whistles his favorite song 
And as he sleeps 
He dreams of all the pretty girls he's seen throughout his life 
And though his dreams are sweet 
His aching feet 
Awake him in the night 
He wakes to the sound of thunder 
And he thinks of a reason why 
Then he hangs his head to cry 
Then he drifted off to a deeper sleep 
That no one could disturb 
And when he woke 
He was at a place that was higher than the birds 
He said my God I'm here at last 
Is this meant to be 
I've lived the life of a hobo clown 
Whistle tunes for money 
And his Lord spoke up 
And said my friend 
You are not alone 
You've lived a good life my drumming clown 
And now you have a home 
And somewhere a stock boy opens a crate 
And finds the butt of an old cigar 
He hears a distant whistling 
Then he gazes as the stars",Drumming Clown
Shawn Mullins,"She sleeps with the windows open 
Yet she's still locked safe inside 
And to block out the sounds of the city's commotion 
She turns her fan up on high 
Yea she lives just far enough away from home 
To see the whole scene 
And down the street the kids throw sticks and stones 
And end up on the the TV screen 
Yea they throw their sticks and stones 
And end up on the TV screen 
And she used to walk on these gracefully 
But now they crunch beneath her feet 
I guess she must be changin' 
There's just no way to keep it neat 
And her father still barks like a soldier 
Returning from victory 
But now he's much older 
And that bark isn't as scary as it used to be 
Yea she watches his self torture 
No one left to abuse but himself 
But still her memory scorches her 
And she struggles to love herself 
Her memory scorches her 
And she struggles to love herself 
And she used to walk on these gracefully 
But now they crunch beneath her feet 
And I guess she must be changin' 
She never was to good at stayin' in her seat 
And this town grows hungry and restless 
Hungry for what I ain't sure 
But they're sweepin' the streets of the trash and the homeless 
And raisin' the rent 
And breakin' the poor 
And I used to walk on these gracefully 
But now they crunch beneath my feet 
And I guess I must be changin'

Shawn Mullins,"Joshua was an old man 
His beard like mountain snow 
And when I was a boy we'd have jam sessions 
I'd sneak off to old Sharptop 
With my guitar I would go 
When I should have been at school 
Learnin' my lesson 
And I'd sip a little moonshine 
And I'd smoke a corncob pipe 
And we'd pick all day until our fingers bled 
And right around supper time 
I'd run home in the night 
Just in time to get a whippin' from my Dad 
Oh way back when 
He was 65 and I was 10 
And I will never be as free again 
Oh way back when 
The summer flew by quickly 
And Josh and I spent out time 
Writing words to songs from memories of his past 
He'd tell me bout the way it was 
And I'd find the perfect rhyme 
And I couldn't believe how we wrote our songs so fast 
I never knew an old man 
Could be so full of life 
The love we had was so hard to explain 
And I remember how the tears fell when he spoke of his late wife 
And I'd give him my 6-string to ease his pain 
Oh way back when 
He was 65 and I was 10 
And I will never be as free again 
Oh way back when 
And then in late November 
I knocked on his cabin dor 
I knocked and knocked but Joshua never came 
And I still remember 
How he laid there on the floor 
And I went home cryin' in the rain 
Oh way back when 
He was 65 and I was 10 
And I will never be as free again

Shawn Mullins,"Mormon's are everywhere 
Battalions of bicycling bachelors 
With dark suits 
And well cropped hair 
We're Mormons too 
Have been since '72 
I'm riding between my brother and sister 
In the back seat of a '67 Buick station wagon 
With red vinyl seats 
We stick by each other 
And to those seats 
We've been eating cheese and bacon sandwiches 
Our mother made for thirteen days straight in the August heat 
And both my siblings are wakin' on those eggshells 
As I will soon learn how to do myself 
They play their quiet silly games 
With their peashooters 
As I sip luke-warm Sprite from a tin can 
Sold to me by a hunchback silly bastard old woman 
A hundred miles back 
Who is probably the only person with good sense 
In this part of the country 
I still don't know what to do god-awful bacon and cheese sandwich 
But your body is your temple 
God tells us so, 
So drink up your milk 
And reap what you sow 
I mold the cheese and bacon sandwich into a ball in my hand 
It kind of reminds me of Play-dough 
I look around to see who is watchin' 
And stuff it between the red vinyl seats 
No one will find it 
At least not for a couple of weeks 
We're in this big place now 
It's kind of like 1/2 of an blue plastic Easter egg shell 
And there's a hole in the top 
Where the sun cuts through 
And lights up the room 
And I hear all these male voices 
Telling me that black people are inferior 
And it's ok to have more than one wife 
And as the dry dry breath of the Utah sun warms me 
I stand before a statue of Jesus that is far too big 
And has held these folks hostage for so so long 
And I gaze up at the nostrils of the sandstone savior 
And wonder if it 
Can smell all this bullshit 
Cause I sure can 
And I'm only 5 years old

Like a hummingbird to cane 
Just following desire

Throw shadows across the room

Not far from cannery row 
He beats on his guitar 

And does his little show 
And all the people say 
You got balls to play the game this way 
It's one in a million 

So he fills all the holes 
With good wine from mussel sholes 
And the cencemillian 
These streets were bound to cross 

Maybe lifetimes ago 
Whenever innocence is lost 
We got a long way to go 
We got a long way 

Watch the firelight throw 
Shadows across the room

I just turned 16 yesterday
I'm gonna get the nerve one day to get outta here
My ma passed on 3 years ago, they said it was cancer and it took her slow
And ever since then I've been sayin' no to my daddy and my tears
Now when you come down our road
You gotta watch the bump right there across from the garbage dump
You can find me out back
Jumpin' on the trampoline
And in the springtime
We'll be skippin' scholl
We sneak off to the Cantrell's swimming pool
Man, you can't get much cooler than me and my friend Darlene
Now my grandaddy's hands are worn from 50 years of growin' corn
Back behind the house where I was born before he had to sell
And my cousin Eddie,
He got shot in the Walmart parkin' lot
Yeah this little town's changed a lot,
He said it hurt like hell
My name's Billy Jo McKay
It's a hot Mississippi summer Saturday
Daddy's on the front porch with Uncle Dave drinkin' dixie beer
16 years of being bored
My window's open, forget the door
Hope there's some gas in the
Old man's ford cause I'm outta here
I'm outta here, I'm outta here

Reading your autograph
Pages of green in seventh grade
Now like an epitaph alone in your room
With an artist inside of you
You died way too soon,
But I can still feel you warm in a circle of friends
How have you all been
We'd never die, just go through hell and re-group again

And pass it around
Like champagne on a holiday

On a train ride down the west coast while 
On tour. 
Hadn't ridden a train since I was a kid

September in Seattle 
Waiting on a train 
I smoked my last cigarette 
Standing in out of the rain 
There's a cool wind blowin' 
Down the alley by the depot 
Amtrak down the coastline 
To the city of the roses 

Mama's hangin' hand me downs 
Daddy's in the hotel bar 
Kids reciting mother goose 
Running naked through the yard 
You see the best and the worst here 
The richest and the poor 
From the mansions on the hilltop 

To the red dirt floor 
Pull into the station 
The sun's settin' outside 
The pushers and the pullers 
Tryin' to take you for a ride 

Portland is a small town 
With a bitter city smile 
And as I walk these streets around 
I might just hang here for a while",September in Seattle

Smoothed over by a stream
No ticking of a clock
Truly measures what that means
Truly measures what that means
And this thing they call our time

She said you know it's crazy
How I want to try to capture mine
I think I love this woman's way
I think I love this woman's way she shimmers, the way she shines
The way she radiates
The way she lives, the way she loves
The way she never hates
Sometimes I think of all of this that can surround me
I know it all as being mine
But she kisses me and wraps herself around me
She gives me love, she gives me time
And I feel fine I feel fine
But time I cannot change
So here's to looking back
You know I drink a whole bottle of my pride
And I toast to change to keep these demons off my back

With no way to hold my head 
That didn't hurt 
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't 
Bad so I had one more for dessert 
Then I fumbled through my closet 
For my clothes 
And found my cleanest dirty shirt 
And I shaved my face 
And combed my hair 
And stumbled down the stairs 
To meet the day 
I'd smoked my brain the night before 
With cigarettes and songs 
That I've been pickin' 
But I lit my first and watched a small kid 
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin' 
Then I crossed the empty street and 
Caught the Sunday smell 
Of someone fryin' chicken 
And it took me back to something 
That I'd lost somehow 
Somewhere along the way 
On the Sunday morning sidewalk 
Wishing Lord that I was stoned 
Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone 
And there's nothing short of dying 
Half as lonesome as the sound 
On the sleeping city sidewalk 
Sunday morning coming down 
In the park I saw a daddy 
With a laughing little girl 
He was swingin' 
And I stopped beside the Sunday school 
And listened to the song 
That they were singing 
Then I headed back for home 
And somewhere far away 
A lonely bell was ringing 
And it echoed through the canyon like 
The disappearing dreams of yesterday 
On the Sunday morning sidewalk 
Wishing Lord that I was stoned 
Cause there is something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone

He held in his hand
That he waved around a lot
To make his point

Of wine and women and county jails
And we finished off that bottle
And smoked a half a joint

Disappear into the ocean
It's been years
Since I smelled this salty sea""

I look a lot like a leprechaun
With a Mexican vest and a red hippie hat on
Maracas in my left hand, stick in my right
There are canyons there are caverns
There are boarder roadside taverns
I am held captive by the big blue sky above me

I smell the June cut grass from my pappy's lawn
I play alone in the little room upstairs
There are Lincoln logs and cookie tins
Colored blocks and wars to win
I draw and I dream and beat my drums up there
There are circus lights and maple leaves
There are daffodils and dogwood trees
I am held captive by the big blue sky above me
Now the coffee's strong
And the fruit's all wrong
And my wakeup call's for somebody else
And the TV's hoax and neurosis jokes
Always keep my laughing at myself
And I laugh a lot that's what I do
And I learn the things I never knew
And I see canyons I see caverns
I see border roadside taverns

Oh, what I'd give to hold you in my arms
Can't you see how much I need you tonight
I'm going crazy girl, can't get you off of my mind

Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go 
And after all the love that I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go, I get that feeling

It's hard to be so far apart
When thoughts of you keep coming on so strong
I picture you in every face I see
Now I know I left a part of me back home with you
There's nothing like falling for the very first time
I won't forget you girl, for the rest of my life

Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go
And after all the love that I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go

I get that feeling
Everywhere I go
I get that feeling
You're with me everywhere I go 

Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go 
And after all the love that I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go 
So when you're feeling lonely baby keep on shining
You'll always be here right beside me

Shawn Mullins,"We are the children of god 
Wherever he may be whoever she may be
We go through life feelin' odd like a bird 
Inside a cage nowhere to pour the rage

Its a mystery I know
To try and figure out what life's gonna throw
We've been around for a while
I know I'll never go as long as I can see you

Hold on to what we got
Cause what we got is all we got
We are the future they say
Whatever comes your way you gotta make it yours today

And when you got nothin' at all don't be sorry
If you fall you keep on standin' tall
You've got to pave your own road
And I will carry you if you got a heavy load
We've been around for a while
There's nothin' you can do to make me want to lose you child

What we got is all we got
Hold on to what we got

I was feelin' very much alive
And if I don't come back read a little Kerouac
It would be good for you, yeah

I loaded up my van and left the promised land
For a different view and I'm still lookin'

So tell me where did we go wrong
And give me one more chance to prove you wrong

I saw a monarch butterfly
Spread its holy wings and fly
Beneath the velvet sun
I watched her come undone and then disappear

So I got out my old guitar
And I dug down really hard
And then a voice inside said
I gotta ask you why you're still comin' here

And tell me where did we go wrong
And give me one more chance to prove you wrong

It's hard to say where love turns cold
We never thought that we'd grow old
We filled up fast and went down slow
Enough to fake us out and make us fold

Tell me where did we go wrong
And give me one more chance to prove you wrong

And tell me where did we go wrong
And give me one more chance to prove you wrong",North on 95
Shawn Mullins,"She was sitting in the corner of a cafe
In the burning heart of downtown Santa Fe
Picking on a Gibson and singing ""Baby Can't You See""

She was buzzing like a battlefield tracer
She was grinding like gears on a Pacer

She said I'll sing you any song that you wanna hear

They had puttered here from Boulder covered in dust

If I don't see my little lady it will break me
Another 24 hours here, I think I might just explode

Crank up the tunes and meet the full moon and the Carolina corn

It never fails

They go,

Shawn Mullins,"Well Johnny Mae And William J 
 Hitched a ride from sunny L.A. 
 With a soldier who'd gone AWOL Stockade bound 
 And they got off in the Texas rain 
 And they hopped a southern diesel train 
 Headed to Atlanta 
 My hometown 
 Where she danced all night 
 In a go-go bar 
 And he tried his best 
 To play bass guitar 
 In the absolute worst punk bar ever heard 
 Yeah, but she got tired of that Georgia clay 
 And a drunk musician 
 Who couldn't even play 
 So she took a bus to Boston 
 Without a word 
 He never got to say goodbye 
 And he has to wonder why 
 It keeps him up all night 
 The way she wore her hair 
 It keeps him up all night 
 Her voice is everywhere 
 It keeps him up all night 
 She's out there 
 Searchin' somewhere 
 For somethin' of her own 
 Well old Will kept makin' bad music worse 
 But the whiskey and the pills 
 Wouldn't quench his thirst no more 
 So he stuck a needle in his arm 
 Then he lost his band 
 He started liftin' shops 
 It didn't take long 
 To get cuffed by the cops 
 And right about now 
 He's workin' on the county farm 
 It's never easier to say goodbye 
 And she has to wonder why 
 It keeps her up all night 
 The way he held her hand 
 It keeps her up all night 
 He was her only man 
 It keeps her up all night 
 She's out there 
 Searchin' somewhere 
 For somethin' of her own

I say these words with freedom on my tongue
I give to you all of me, 
In this crazy world, life has just begun
No one can take that away, 
It just keeps pourin' out like juice from berries on the vine

Nowhere is where I will be, 
Without you and me, valentine
Don't mind my preciousness, 
I sing these words cause that's the way I feel
Men, men have killed for less, 
I'd do the same if harm was ever hurled your way
I, I'll try to explain, 
It just keeps pourin' out like juice from berries on the vine

Shawn Mullins,"In the town that I was born in
There rides a boy and a girl in love
And the answer came without warning
Just like an angel from heaven above 
They run down Moreland into the neon night

They left the others far behind
But they can make believe,
Even if it's for just one night
And if it's only in their minds
When they run, when they run,
They run in the look
Love is familiar, It warms just like a summer rain
One moment falls into forever 
We got the power to melt away the pain
When we run down Moreland into the neon night

We left the others far behind
But we can make believe, 
Even if it's for just one night
And it's only in our minds 
When we run we loose our way
We run so hard,why don't we stay 
And I don't know where we will go

To find our way
We run down Moreland into the neon night
We left the others far behind
The land of make believe seems to be in everybody's sights
But it's only in their minds
So they run, so they run, so they run",We Run
Shawn Mullins,"There is a young man
Driving an old man's car
Down the Pennsylvania Turnpike
Where the treetops meet the stars
There is a warm wind
Blowin' down the lost highway
And he don't know where he's goin'
It don't matter anyway

Cause the dreams pass through his mind
Like the years he'll never find

There is an old man
Night shift at the Stop-N-Go
He reads his dirty magazines
And mops the bathroom floor
He's lived a hard life
He lost a digit in the war
He keeps one hand on the shotgun
And both feet on the floor

And the old dreams fill his head
When he lays down in his bed
(Sometimes that's all you got left)

There is a pretty girl
Walking a yellow dog
Right down Dekalb Avenue
Where the Marta meets the fog
There is a wild wind
Blowin' down the old railway
And I wonder she's goin'
She walks by every day

Yeah I wonder where she's goin'",Yellow Dog Song

Shawn Mullins,"I once had a true love, her name was Maggie Brown
Her eyes they were the color of the sun burning down
And she had hair that smelled like jasmine, I loved her from the start
How was I to know she?d have a cold black heart

Well Maggie was my true love, the only kiss I knew
I?d meet her at the oak tree in the cool evening dew
Where we would walk beside the levee our fingers intertwined
While the crimson moon gazed through the needles of the pines
We?d lay beside each other, staring at the sky
Listenin? to the whistlin? of the train blowin? by
As it was on it?s way to Macon The town where I was born
We?d make love in the darkness, ?til the hours of the morn

Waterfalls and rainbows, sweet salvation sin
As I lay there sleeping against her golden skin,
My friends now gather around and listen close
The story takes a turn I wasn?t fair young Maggie?s only lover I did learn
I went down by the oak tree lookin? for my lass
And walked east towards the levee with the sunset in my past 
And then I ran through briars and brambles, until I finally found
My Maggie and her true love there lyin? on the ground
My eyes they filled with fire, they didn?t see me there
I watched as she made love to him, caressed him with her hair
I don?t remember how it happened I guess I just saw red
I drew my pistol from my belt and shot them graveyard dead

I once loved a maiden her name was Maggie Brown
But now I?m riding on a boxcar back to Macon town
The setting sun will never let me forget what deed I have done
Until the day they hunt me down,
I?m livin? on the run

Shawn Mullins,"Sixty miles from El Paso
Feelin' lonesome as can be
Driving further from the heartache
That was slowly killing me

I left at 4 am last Monday
Filled my tank at luther's store
I might be checking' in come Sunday
'cause I know by then she'll walk the floor

She has it still inside her skull
That I am hers and she is mine
She's dead on empty and I am full of
Broken dreams and homemade wine

There's a kid who plays the squeesebox
On the border bridge on the juarez side
He dances to the beat
With no shoes on his feet
To the music that he makes as I drive by

And I felt just like the devil the whole night's pull
But right this second I feel fine
My tank is dead on empty, but I am full
Of broken dreams and homemade wine

Now the gulf wind she sings to me a love song
I can hear her from the boxcar that I ride
Her voice is in my brain
Making music with this train
That will soon take me to the other side

And she might think that I'm coming back
To hold her close and stop her cryin'
But this freight train's
Traveling down a southbound track
Full broken dreams and hommade wine
Just broken dreams and hommade wine
Broken dreams and hommade wine

Right here next to me
A constant glow with eyes that know
Where I always long to be

Now Iâ??m in my head once again
What I need right now is my friend
To hold me near, â??til I see clear
One more day begins
Let me one more day begin",Kelly's Song
Shawn Mullins,"""Lay Down Your Swords, Boys""

Well lay down your swords, boys, lay down your guns
A new day?s a comin? first sight of the sun It?ll shine like a beacon on whoever shall love While sweet baby Jesus rides the wing of a dove
Now our color filled country is a giant strip mall It?s a joke in the men?s room misspelled on the stall
But when it?s all over, ain?t no colors anyway Like an old silent movie, only black, white and gray
Lay down your swords, boys, lay down your guns A new day?s a comin? first sight of the sun
It?ll shine like a beacon on whoever shall love While sweet baby Jesus rides the wings of a dove
Well the bad guys are gone, boys,
We run most of them down
When we flattened the hillsides
And we pummeled the ground
And speaking on bombs, boys,
You'd better believe
That it?s better to give boys,
Than it is to receive
Lay down your swords, boys,
Lay down your guns
A new day?s a comin? first sight of the sun
It?ll shine like a beacon on whoever shall love
While sweet baby Jesus rides the wings of a dove
Now Old Glory?s still flyin?, just like before
And your kids ain?t believin? in nothin? no more
And you can?t really blame ?em,
Same shit we were fed
From the pages of schoolbooks
To the Bibles we read
Lay down your swords, boys, lay down your guns
A new day?s a comin? first sight of the sun
And it?ll shine like a beacon
On whoever shall love
While sweet baby Jesus rides the wings of a dove

Shawn Mullins,"Baby, don't you know
I hate it when you cry
When your tears fall down
I feel like I could die

Or disappear
And that's the fear that you have
But you've gotta follow you own path

I've always been told
The tighter that you hold,
You might just squeeze the life

Right out of your own soul
Love can take its toll on your heart
Why can't you finish what you start?
Love is cruel, Baby, love ain't fair

And there ain't no map
Or book of rules to get you there
It's just a friendly game of solitaire

Baby, can't you see
To love a man like me,
You gotta be crazier
Than any girl could ever be",Solitaire [*]
Shawn Mullins,"I'm goin' to Alaska Where nobody knows my face
I'm goin' to Alaska Where there ain't no rats to race
I'm headed to Alaska Where a song is still a song
I'm flying to Alaska Where I done nobody wrong

I'm goin' to Alaska To a good size little town
I'm headed to Alaska Where Michelle's friend was anchored down

Maybe when I get there I won't feel so freakin' lo",Talkin' Goin' to Alaska Blues
Shawn Mullins,"It's a feelin' you ain't had since your school days 
One that blows off dusty memories 
And the one voice of the faded and forgotten 
Is screamin' like an eagle through the trees
It sings to you a song that you remember 
It whispers like the softly fallen snow 
On a Pennsylvania farm in late December 
Is there somewhere like that left where we could go?

We could go and start again
We could go and start again
Shine some light on the shadows of our sins 
We could go and start again

When the devil tries to drag you through the darkness
And the self-hate rakes you through the burning coals
Take my hand and we will stand together 
We'll ride another cycle of our souls. 

Of our souls, on our way
Of our souls, on our way
Trade tomorrow for another yesterday
Of our souls, on our way

The day that peace will come won't be mistaken 
It'll sing a song that everyone will know 
And the holy train that leaves this worldly station
Will take us anywhere we wanna go

We could go and start again
We could go and start again
Shine some light on the shadows of our sins 
We could go and start again",We Could Go and Start Again
Shawn Mullins,"Old Miss Johnston lived all alone
On the sorry side of town
Broke down cars and burglar bars
On the windows and doors
In case danger comes around

Sittin' in her yellow kitchen
Listenin' to bad news on a Radiant radio
It used to be Louis Armstrong
Then Martin Luther King
Where did everybody go?

Out the window where her garden was
It's not safe to go outside
Old Miss Johnston in the eye of the storm
It was the safest place to hide

And life's a gamble for the broken and the weak
Dealin' with the bangers and the drugs
The whinos weave and amble
And shuffle on down the street
Steerin' clear of all the thugs

And now my city hangs her head in shame
You can't tell the truth from all the lies
Everything changed forever and everything stayed the same
On the night Miss Johnston died
",The Ballad of Kathryn Johnston
Shawn Mullins,"Now my old friend Harry
Never slowed down to marry
He's in sales
He's gone most of the year

And he smiles through all those lies
With dollar signs in his eyes
He orders himself another beer

Now Harry, he's a dreamer
And a scholar and a schemer
But he'll be there for you
When push comes to shove

His mama called him Harold
She was one of only two women
That Harry ever loved

The other was a waitress
In Cave Creek, Arizona
That broke his heart
And tangled up his mind

My old friend Harry
Looking kinda scary
Wonders if he's runnin' out of time

Now Biloxi, he's got a sadness
Like a dark day in December
But Harry recognizes
An old forgotten southern times

Thumbing through the phone book
For a name he can't remember
Lookin' desperate like a junkie
Waitin' for a fix to come around

Sittin', playin' blackjack
With a hooker and a tourist
And a one eyed dealer winnin' every hand

Harry sips Black Label
Slumps down at the table
Feelin' like a fraction of a man
Feelin' like a fraction of a man
",Fraction of a Man
Shawn Mullins,"The funniest girl I ever knew
Had hair as orange as Halloween
The bluest eyes that saw right through
All the BS and everything

She was an artist from the start
And she always sang from the bottom of her heart
And though her road was so long
She finally made her way back home
Yes, she finally made her way back home

The loneliest kid I ever saw
Owned to an old man's calloused hands
Sitting barefoot in front of a dime-store
In a place some called, 'The Promised Land'

He had hollow sunken eyes
But he was smiling big like he'd won some kinda prize
He was ragged, he was rolling like a stone
In the dirty city streets that he called home
Yeah, the dirty city streets that he called home

Hobos, tramps and troubadours
Don't ride in box cars like they did before
Seems like most of my heroes
Just ain't around no more

Yeah, I know I'm lucky to sing my songs
If you want to, you can sing along
As you been on this road so long
Won't you help me find my way back home?
Help me find my way back home

Won't you help me find my way back home?
Help me find my way back home

From fifty years of growin' corn
Back behind the house where
I was born before he had to sell
And my cousin Eddie
He got shot in the Walmart parking lot
Yeah this little town's changed a lot
He said it hurt like hell

With uncle Dave drinkin' Dixie beer

It's been the ruin of many a poor girl me, oh God, I?m one

My mother was a tailor She sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, way down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk

He filled his glasses up to the brim and he passed the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is ramblin' from town to town

Go and tell my baby sister, not to do what I have done
Go and shun that house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

Now it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train
Now I'm goin' back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain
Now I'm going back to New Orleans my race is almost run
I'm goin' back to spend my life beneath the Rising Sun

The children of the stars 
In the Hollywood hills and the boulevard 
Her parents threw big parties 
Everyone was there 
They hung out with folks like 
Dennis hopper, Bob Seeger, sonny and Cher 

Now, she feels safe 
In this bar on Fairfax 
And from the stage I can tell that 
She can't let go and she can't relax 
And just before 
She hangs her head to cry 
I sing to her a lullaby, I sing

Outside the city 
Down that street about a half a mile 
And all her friends tell her 
She's so pretty 
But she'd be a whole lot prettier 
If she smiled once in a while 
`cause even her smile 
Looks like a frown 
She's seen her share of devils 
In this angel town 

But, everything's gonna be all right

Of twin rocks, oregon

For 15 years

Drawin portraits
To keep his belly full of beer
And it looked to me like he'd died
And missed the plane to heaven

But he was a nice old guy
For a younger man
He had a bottle of mad dog
He held in his hand

That he waved around a lot
To make his point
And I listened as he told his tales
Of wine and women and county jails

And we finished off that bottle
And smoked a half a joint

Disappear into the ocean

And the smoke went south and the drink went dry

Somewhere out there someone is living my old dreams
Hope he's happy, I wouldn't change a single thing
I'm living a new dream

I never did think I'd be here with you
I'm worse ? but I'm tried and true

Somewhere out there someone is living my old dreams
Hope he's happy and wouldn't trade for anything
I'm living a new dream",Murphy's Song

No one is calling no one is at the door

Blinds pull to the floor.

There is no blue sky in my town lately 
Everybody looks at the ground 
Where I am is making me hazy 
But the sun has never looked so pretty going down.

So many changes I start keeping score 
And if you want me you want me 
You'll know where I will be 
I don't get out much any more.

Everybody looks at the ground.

Oh the sun never looks so pretty .

The sun never looks so pretty

Cloud and rain smoke and smart here 
Won't see many too stars tonight
Bad in time waiting on the sunset

I come in late
Just to find if you were there
Just to look at your long brown hair

And dream a dream out in the hall
Was that my name that's just been called?
I don't know, it could be
Have you got something to tell on me?

If you got something to tell on me, babe
It better be good
Even though you hate me so much
I'm still comin' back

Like you knew I would
You can't believe
What I been through these last few months
It's very difficult to tell the difference

Between the trumps and the down home dumps
Only one thing I can say to you
Even if you don't believe it's true
It's true

It's our turn now
To find out where we're going
It's our turn now
To find out where you've been

It's our turn now
To keep the new direction
It's your turn now
To cast off all your sin

Fellatia, Fellatia, how do you plead?
You don't have to plead
For anything that you really need
Plead, have mercy

When the wind starts blowin' hard
And this cardboard world we're livin' in
It ain't forgotten, out in the yard
Out in the yard

Where the air is cold
And there ain't no leaves to fall
He's lookin' hard at the ground for somethin'
Somethin' that won't show up

I keep lookin' back over my shoulder
Couple of good friends goin' by
Pour some wine over their fire
Don't let the tears stay in your eyes

He's not gone so very far
I know he's very near
'Cause every time I call his name
I know that he can hear

It's our turn now
To find out where we're going
It's our turn now
To find out where you've been

It's our turn now
To keep the new direction
It's your turn now
To cast off all your sin

Hey, Mr. Roberts, don't you tell me no lies
I don't mind you being vain
Pick up the phone in your whitewashed house
Simpering that same refrain

Three to five more years
Is all you got
For you to do your nasty thing
Making rain, suffering pain

Telling everybody that it's in his name
His name, whose name
What are you telling me?
I don't believe your tales

Too many people in this world
Don't like being snails
If you gonna do it
Better get it together

Better go and make the change
Do it right now
Do it while it's warm
Do it while it's there within your range

It won't be so very hard
You better have no fear
'Cause by the time you get it done
It'll be so clear

It's our turn now
To find out where we're going
It's our turn now
To find out where you've been

It's our turn now
To keep the new direction
It's your turn now
To cast off all your sin

Shawn Phillips,"Oh, archer with your bowstring tight
Won't you let fly with your shaft of light
Are you hunting your quarry now?
Are you leaving me, babe, leaving anyhow?

But I will remember you when the rain pours down
And I see you standing there in your bright blue gown
Fyodor's there, still he doesn't care
You're gone

Tell me you don't want to travel
To go back amidst the noise and babble
But you hear me when I tell you that
You know it won't be so long, babe
You know you're coming back

And I'll wait right here till the sky is clear
And I'll keep looking into that endless sphere
And then you're gonna know
There really wasn't nothing to fear

So don't cry, baby, in the dark of night
When you know I ain't there to hold you tight
And I can't answer any of your questing glances
Like when we woke up in the morning
And we saw the dawn was storming

And the clouds were there love
Outside the window so fair
And the sun came rising, it was surprising
Cast out all your dark surmising
And then the car came, you spoke my name
And left me

But I'm not alone on this earth so fair
There's something else beside me here
Something keeps me ever looking forward
And it's brighter than the sunlight
And it's purer than the moonlight
And it's drawing me toward it

Like a moth out of the night
And I know I'll arrive where there ain't no time
Non-dimensional plane of joy sublime
Keep on being free, Lord, it's gotta be
Infinity, hey",Song for Sagittarians
Shawn Phillips,"I talk to the lady with the steel gray eyes
While the sun is going down
And we talk of the things that we wish to know
But she's really not around

And the sunset on the mountain is the same color
As her cascade chestnut hair
And now loving is in living for forgetting your past
So now why the distant stare?
Could it be there is someone who remains
In her heart and she cares?

And the ice of her kisses lingers on and on
And the image of her body live
Yet you walked on black sand by the sea's turmoil
In the dark of a velvet night

Then you sat down and gave your hands to be kissed and loved
Could not you hear a gentle sigh?
And by the stars part control of your wandering life
Do you believe in not telling lies?
But it was good that you were warm
On your way back home, short love, goodbye",Steel Eyes
Shawn Phillips,"Lightning slaying shadows
In the tremors of the night
While he creeps among the alleys
Bringing fear before the fright

She sleeps in tattered trousers
In the ballroom's decadence
Moaning gently of her dreaming
By escorted precedence

Antiquated babblings
From a constant stream of thought
Sensitively wringing out
The rags that he has caught

Patting yet her bulging belly
She so slowly cries a smile
In anticipated suffering
Of her slowly growing child

He is speeding in a vacuum
Going nowhere, but, of course
He might believe in discipline
Of a bloody kind of sort

Naturally a state of race
A never changing spate of hate
While everything in some weird way
Does manage to relate

To her it doesn't matter more
Its chasms have been leapt
And she leans upon the skepticism
Of her chosen fate

Stand tall, you spittle-smattered son of man
Stand up, you hear them say
To slap you down and kick your teeth
And smile across the bay

Irrelevant eloquent pleading
Wasn't what she did this year
She passed it by and told a lie
And shed a crystal tear

For him to see, from valley's edge
From plateaus in the sand
And yet he has beshit himself
For being just a man

A bragging crowing sort of twit
A cast-off shade of pink
Who's brought himself and all the rest
Unto the very brink

Yet that magic urge
Continues on and plays continuum
A song of pleasure and of pain
Until that will be done

Shawn Phillips,"Once in Royal David's City stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her baby.
You'd do well to remember the things He later said.
When you're stuffing yourselves at the Christmas parties,
You'll laugh when I tell you to take a running jump.
You're missing the point I'm sure does not need making;
That Christmas spirit is not what you drink.

So how can you laugh when your own mother's hungry
And how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?
And if I messed up your thoughtless pleasures,
Remember, if you wish, this is just a Christmas song.

Hey, Santa... pass us that bottle, will you?",A  Christmas Song
Shawn Phillips,"T'was a man of youthful features
T'was a boy of sorrowful eyes
Watching out by looking inward
Tall and stately and full of life

In his life, he spoke but rarely
In his mind he cried for light
Painting perceptions trying to capture
That which he saw in his questioning strife

Once in Lisbon, twice in London
Traveling around for all of his time
Looking for and finding a goddess
He took Diana to be his wife

Of the children, they'd begotten
Two had died without knowing life
And the third I know not whereof
But if she lives, she will yet be kind

Casey had a mark of simple value
He had a star between his eyes
In his hands he held an axe blade
The Greek symbol of thunder and fire

On a night when the heavens were crying
He went out and took his blade
Chopping wood to warm his heart side
The lightning came and my brother died

Bring him no wine from faraway vineyards
Tell him no tales of the canyon's might
But wish him peace and eternal wisdom
For he has died and he died by light",The Ballad of Casey Deiss

Shawn Phillips,"In the consecrated chambers
Of a mountain's winter day
I left her at the turning
To go on her seeking way

To pass o'er meadows green and bare
Or brown as her auburn hair
O'er all the waters on the face of the earth
To find that I really care

And the myriad reflections of myself
In her buttons on her oversize navy coat
But only reflections and never an image
In her mind's unfathomable moat

But some castles where she wanders
Are yet crumbling into dust
In this house of visions, on top of the hill
The glass has turned to rust

So never again will I look in her eyes
Nor shall she hear my voice
But I hope she will find a better man
To love him and rejoice

And he will turn the secret key
Nay, I know it's not up to him
But somehow in his words and love
Answer her every whim

So seek ye lass for what you wish
But in your troubled heart
And let not your mind race ahead of your breast
For the quicker shall you part

And wait for the click that you speak dear of
And never will you run
Light will splinter through open clouds
And you'll look straight at a face like the sun",L Ballade

She said ""hey bitch look up, I heard about you
so here a microphone let's see what you can do""
So I took the microphone, and I threw it to the bar
Cause I need no assist when it comes to going hard
When I start to rap, she start to shake
She sort of confront me was truly a mistake
So she picked the mircophone up, and I took me a shot

He got a way he want to lay me with my legs up, and
A super freak and ooh baby I ain't sayin nothing

And you can throw that thang back and make the booty pop
And we can get the freak and freakin with the oohcie-waa

And when I get on top...

Shawnna,"Hey there, hey, how are you?
Muah, everything cool
I don't know, I'm trying to see if you gon' like it
I'm gon' love it, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

My daddy told me this industry ain't what you think it is
And everyday you will be gone, you will think of your kids
No matter what they throw at you, get your biscuit and grits
Get your kibbles and bits, ain't no riddles

I spit see the devil is a shady one, he lay up in yo' crib
And just when you find happiness he run away with it
Then you back to the drawing board and don't know what to do
And feeling like you all alone and don't know who is who

But it's just like you, it's just like me, it's simply, it's 1 and 2
It's just like 3, don't try to cuff it, let it flow and let it breathe
And if you love it let it go and let it leave and if it's so
It come back running then you embrace

Don't be like any other woman and turn your face
Just shake it off like it ain't nothing and hold your weight
'cause pain make your heart toughen, it can't break you

They say 'cause you got a kid, you done did it big
What, you tryna live?
(They say)
Think you doing wrong, they don't understand
Just where you're coming from
(They say, something here)
Only people go [unverified]
They intentions show but they won't break me

It's like I'm all alone in this shit and ain't nobody
Trying to lend a hand to a bitch
My baby asking why his daddy don't love him
Yet, I swear to god it's like a bullet going through my chest

I'm trying to make it by myself but scared of breaking down
I slit my wrist and tell god to come and take me now
See it's a battle wit my body and I'm losing bad
I got a boy, dark child and don't know who the dad

That shit is sad but we pushing on through the struggle
Why bitches be up in the streets if they don't fucking hustle
That's for them knuckleheads, boy, I put that on my uncle
I'm from the side of tracks where niggas in the black'll truck you

Act like a bitch and put it down for the gang sign
(Something)
With these niggas at the same time
A thin line between the hood and the hood fad
Don't let the game take me out
I'm taking out the game that's on them thangs

What, you tryna live?

Think you doing wrong, they don't understand
Just where you're coming from

Only people go [unverified]
They intentions show but they won't break me

It's like I go too hard for the people
And every time I hit the booth I'm just promoting evil
And I don't wanna send the wrong message to tha kids
But what about my niggas lock up and doing bids?

And all my niggas on the block ducking from the feds
Just keep yo' head tied, nigga, do it how you live
And all my baby mommas, hell naw, I can't forget
Don't let no mothafucka tell you how to raise them kids

I'm on the borderline of fucked up and asses out
This remy got me spinning, think I'm fin'a pass out
Father forgive me 'cause I'm caught up in this
(Fair crout)
But I don't know no betta, see all I know is chedda

Raised int he go-getta
They say the situations drastic a cold
(Retta)
They say some nigga just got blasted was no sweata
It's unbelievable, them last days is gon' catch up
Be tryna make it through the gates but he won't let you

They say 'cause you got a kid, you done did it big
What, you tryna live?

In '96, she gave me my name, ""L-O, L-O!""
Yeah, I got it for the L-O
It ain't hard to find, still posted in the ghetto
Holla at your boy, save your money like Geico

What I get for a hold, I make more for a show
So I'm out on the road travelin', livin' the globe

So fuck a deal I'm addicted to trappin'

Shawty Lo,"It?s Okay
Tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

We all Came in the world with a sparkle in our eye
Not knowing the only thing that we can promise is to die
A promise is a lot can?t nobody guarantee it
And death around the corner can?t nobody damn see it
I can?t agree that God good at all time
But we all know shit ain't all good at all time
So I tote my strap in the hood and all time
But respect ain't just something that?s understood in our time
Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future
Police don?t wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
And that's half as bad as these hatas?ll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up they wanna shoot up
Lord forbid to kill me I bet ya nobody knew what
Suckas get shot and police come straight to us
And that jus how they do us ever since niggas blew up
I know ya goin through it know I?m goin through it too bruh

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

I?m doin this for the hood and the kid wit no dad
I was just like ya?ll don?t feel so bad
Know it?s hard when ya live so bad
They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad
For long, ya get whoopin?s and just laugh
Momma washin? clothes and find a lil? blue bag
She ask what ya what ya doin ya tell her stuntin? like my daddy
You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me
Look around ma you sent me to the store to get some bread
And I?m passin? atleast 8 J?s or mo?
Rent been late for 8 days or mo?
But slangin? blow a better habit than 8 days of snow

Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

If ya son 14 and his dad a folk criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but god with ya
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

My momma girl son 14 just got killed
Had to catch myself
Bout to tell her I know how ya feel
I?d a been a damn liar
See her tryin not to cry
She know he in a better place
But she just wanna know why
Know somebody touch mine
And a nigga gon? die
It?s goin down
How dare I tell her to calm down
I tried to convince her that he in God?s arms now
She said I don?t believe that there's a God right now
I know its hard right now and ya heart light now
But God give new begginins you can start right now
Know ya scarred right now 'cause you apart right now
But Shit you in better shape than we are right now

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain?t shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

Cause everybody know it ain't trickin' if ya got it

Long as I got rubber band banks in my pocket
Five six, rides with rims and a body kit
Ya ain't gotta downgrade you can get what I get
My chick could have what she want
And goin' every store for any bag she want
And know she ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything ya heart desire I that

I really started to wonder
If I had run out of chances to find
A spell that I could fall under
And you walked in
Like in a Elvis film
You were singing ""Love Me Tender""
I was hypnotized by your blue eyes
And the next thing I remember
You know it was...

In an unfamiliar land
You know it's a bridge you are going to walk on
And the only thing you know is
Everything you know
Will do you no good from here on

From your little cocoon
Well, you can't be prepared
For the beauty you'll find there
And you will find beauty
In the toughest of places
And I will be thinking of you out there

So pick up your bags
Look around at your friends
And you know none of them
Would ever have enough strength
To cross the bridge and lose control
I never felt this bold
Never felt this good

And the day that you spin
From your little cocoon
Well, you can't be prepared
For the beauty you'll find there
And you will find beauty
In the toughest of places
And I will be thinking of you

Stay true to your nomad skies
Keep your eyes out for coyote
A thousand secrets are lost
In the archival dust
So lay your ears upon the tracks

One day you will come back
With wrinkled hands and grey hair
And there you will stand on the spot
And you'll marvel how the place is still the same
Though you are somebody else now
Fly on butterfly

And the day that you spin
From your little cocoon

Oh please somebody tell me it's not true (oh girl) 
I'll never be over you

Why did I ever let you slip away 
Can't stand another day without you 
Without the feeling 
I once knew 

I cry silently 
I cry inside of me 
I cry hopelessly 
Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again 
I cry 
Cause you're not here with me 
I cry 
Cause I'm lonely as can be 
I cry hopelessly 
Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again 

If I could have you back tomorrow 
If I could lose the pain and sorrow 
I would do just anything 
To make you see 
You still love me 

I cry silently 
I cry inside of me 
I cry hopelessly 
Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again 
I cry 
Cause you're not here with me 
I cry 
Cause I'm lonely as can be 
I cry hopelessly 
Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again",I Cry

That something was different
So I listened for the first time

Waiting half the day

Knocked to the ground

I've had enough now I wasn't my share
Can't you see
I wanna live
But you just take more then you give

There's a pretty girl standing at the counter of the corner shop

Well she's not too proud
To cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams:

What about me

They may be young
But they're the ones who make the big people big
So listen
As they whisper

Nobody's changed
Nobody's been saved

I guess I'm lucky

I would charge in and rescue you
On a yacht, baby, we would sail
To an island where we?d say I do

And if we had babies they would look like you
It?d be so beautiful if that came true
You don't even know how very special you are

You leave me breathless
You're everything good in my life

We would meet on the very first page

I took 'em down and ripped 'em up and threw them all away
Remember on the back of one you wrote we were meant to be
That doesn't really matter now 'cause you don't mean a thing to me

Baby, you should've told me
Told me from the start
I thought that I was your only
Till you put me on the shelf and found somebody else

I never thought that you would ever do that
Everything we had is gone
You said you love me, said you'll never leave
Maybe I just heard you wrong

'Cause I'm damaged, I'm damaged
Don't know what to do
Baby, I'm damaged, so, so damaged

Got rid of those clothes you left
Like you got rid of my dreams
I don't wanna be reminded of
All of the memories

Ah yes, still have the tickets
I saved from our very first date
But it don't really matter now
'Cause you threw our love away

Screamin' on the phone over somethin' that he did
And I wonder what can I do

I used to think that if we had some problems
I always thought if there was love around
No matter what, I always thought we'll solvin'

It's like a circle that don't ever end

I don't wanna have to cry

Baby, some tears never dry
Baby, some tears never dry

Let's talk about
A way that we can work it out
Girl, we're runnin' outta time
And the thought of a break up is tearing me up inside

We can work it out, if we talk about it
We can show the world that you and I are fighting for it
We'll get through the worst and I know we'll make it
If we stay together we'll make it through alive

I don't wanna say goodbye
'Cause my heart couldn't take it
Baby, give me one more try

I don't wanna have to cry
'Cause I know if we lose it
Baby, some tears never dry

I don't wanna say goodbye
'Cause my heart couldn't take it
Baby, give me one more try

I don't wanna have to cry
'Cause I know if we lose it
Baby, some tears never dry
Baby, some tears never dry
Baby, some tears never dry

You've got me tangled up in you

I must be trippin' it's true
I'm losin' hold of my cool
And I really ought to let you go

Don't even make any sense
It's gettin' crazy intense
Why you wanna make me lose control?

I just gotta let you know
I can't seem to let you go
Now, it's gettin' personal

Girl what you do to me
It's crazy new to me
It's gettin' through to me

I can't deny that it's true
You've got me tangles up in you
I tell myself that it's wrong
That when you smile at me I'm gone

There ain't no way to escape
Trapped in this beautiful mistake
The situation ain't cool
You've got me tangled up in you, baby

You've got me tangled up in you
You've got me tangled up in you

You're playing games with my head
I should be leavin' instead
But I'm fallin' faster all the time

You lick your lips and you smile
I'm helpless just like a child
And I'm tryin' not to cross the line

I just gotta let you know
I can't seem to let you go

You know that you've got me hypnotized

Shayne Ward,"I woke up this morning you know
I had a shocker
See it finally hit me how much
I truly love ya
Stumbling out of bed
I grabbed my phone and called ya
But you were M-I-A so I decided
To stay right here
Picked up a pen before I knew I had it
Hand written letter to you
With some Vivaldi magic
See every love before this
I had was truly tragic
That's why I'm happy to say

[Chorus]
Hey I think it's time you
Be telling your boyfriend
Exactly what you and I've been doing
Tell him
The End
Don't know how much more more I can take
Hey nows the time to be telling
Your boyfriend
About all of the time we are spending
Tell him
The end
Baby hey hey hey hey

Now running catching a cab 'cause I just have
To see ya
I tell the driver to drive like
It's gon' break his meter
(I tell him don't stop)

Before I go an future I gotta tell ya
I ain't never acted quite like this
You done a number on me

I swear you're everything I ever wanted
I've got so much love to give
You don't understand
Now I'm right outside your door
Rode up forty floors gotta hold you touch you

[Chorus]

It's what you do
You're killing me
I can feel there's something different
How you make me feel no accident
Felt you girl
So please
This should come as no surprise

Something you should know
Cause its killing me
Girl are you listening
Go on and tell him
'Cause I can't wait no more",Tell Him
Shayne Ward,"Excuse me girl can I talk to you
Maybe get you name and number too
I don't mean to be blunt but baby
I know that I've got the thing you need
Say what you want and I can make sure
You get it on the count of three
We can move slow or we can move fast
To get to it right away
You must've known with a body like that
I'd go insane

You got me so
So hooked on
Every little thing you do
Has got me so
So turned on
Let me take a look at you
Without a doubt
I'm higher now
Girl I'm higher now
Every little thing about you has got me so

Girl you got me so got me hooked on you
And I'm so turned on by the things you do
It's OK to be shy but don't you deny that I got
That thing you need
I'll say what I want and you can make sure
I get it on the count of three
A pretty face on a body like that
Don't come along every day
Maybe I'm over confident but
You'll say me name

Say my name

I can tell you see it too

But you just made it better
I love the way you stand by me
Through any kind of weather

I don't wanna run away, just wanna make your day
When you feel the world is on your shoulders

Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
Baby, nobody, nobody until you

Baby, it just took one hit of you

Wasn't looking for someone, oh, until you

It seems like, for too long, we've been playing these games

When I read out to touch you, my hand starts to shake,
Cause it hurts to be this close, but so far away

It's like I'm in the shadow of his mistakes

But I don't got a lifetime waiting for you heart to melt
Cause baby can't you see it's me that you're damaging
I'm opening my heart, and now I'm risking everything
So baby don't you leave me, waiting in the wings

I know, he hurt you, but baby, he ain't me
And I hope, someday, you'll find faith in me

I'm so desperate to touch you, I'd do anything
Can't expect, that my chances, are slowly vanishing

As the lights go on and I take the stage
I gotta find the words to say

I'm making my bed so I can lie there forever
I don't know what I'm doing this for
All I know is that I'm tired of being clever

Take a win, take a fall
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all

Take a win, take a fall
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all",Never Wanted Your Love
She & Him,"You and I, we built a shadow of love
You and I, we built a shadow of love
In our hearts is where the future should be
There’s no tomorrow to set me free.

You and I, we told a story of love
You and I, we told a story of love
From our hearts, but it never came true,
There’s no tomorrow for me and you.

We were so young, we should’ve known
Love’s as brutal as a broken bone.
We couldn’t see around the bend
We surround the yard without an end, without an end.

Time goes by, it’s only shades of gray
Time goes by, it’s only shades of gray
In my heart, where the colors should be
There’s no tomorrow to set us free.",Shadow of Love
She & Him,"Well, I would rather do a lot of despicable things
Then sit around and wait, sit around and wait for the telephone to ring.
Why do you wait, what are you waiting for?
Stop looking out the window, looking out the window,
He came at your front door.

I’m so cold,
But I’m nice beneath the ice.
So deep, never doing as I’m told.
And it’s cold outside,
But I think you’ll get used to it, darling.
And it’s dark out there,
But isn’t scary.
I’m the cold, I’m the snow,
Make it hurt until you go.
I’m the dark, I’m the night,
I’m a bark, but never bite,
I’m the snow queen,
I’m the snow queen,
I’m the snow queen,
I’m the snow queen.",Snow Queen
