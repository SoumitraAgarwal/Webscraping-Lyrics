Discipline,"I guess there's no one
there's no one in this world
That I can blame,
for all the things that went wrong
I guess there's no one to blame,
for the tears that I shed
When all my dreams were taken away,
that I once used to believe

I've learned my life the hard way
I've learned from my mistakes
But like everybody else
I'm still learning, until this day

But I'm proud of all the things I've done
I got nuthin' to regret
I'm proud of the person who I am
I will be proud until the end

I've learned my life the hard way
I've learned from my mistakes
But like everybody else
I'm still learning, until this day

I've had my share of trouble
I've learned from the past
But every time when I fucked up
I got myself out of the mess

So don't you try to save me girl
'cause I've been trough higher flames
and don't you try to conform me girl
'cause I will never - never be tamed",Until This Day
Discipline,"Ruckin' on the terraces
Going out all night
Drinkin' 'till we drop
And looking for a fight

Young and reckless, for all those times
Young and reckless, who were left behind
Young and reckless, for all those gone
Young and reckless, the war is won

Skinheads on the rampage
Fighting in the streets
Earning some respect
The one thing we all need

Young and reckless, for all those times
Young and reckless, who were left behind
Young and reckless, for all those gone
Young and reckless, the war is won

Young and reckless, the war is won",Young and Reckless
Discipline,"He spends his days in misery only trying to survive.
Everyday the same old struggle, just trying to get by.
Life is hard when you got no work and the bottle is you best friend.
Everyday so many wars to fight, It catches up with you in the end.

Broken glass all over
In a life full of misery
Broken glass all over
Always trying to break free

A broken man beyond limits with no hope for better days.
He knows that time is running out, It slowly starts to slip away.
This cold an dirty world made him crack like a broken bottle on the floor.
One stop forward and five steps back, he just couldn't take it no more

Broken glass all over
In a life full of misery
Broken glass all over
Always trying to break free

With one foot in the gutter as the weight grow on his back.
He played with fire and he got burned there was no turning back.

Broken glass all over
In a life full of misery
Broken glass all over
Always trying to break free",Broken Glass
Discipline,"The place where I was been 26 Years ago.
It means so much to me, this place that call home.
No matter where my ship is heading, IÂ´m always homeward bound.
I can never wait to get back to this oldÂ´n dirty town.

ItÂ´s the City 
The City of Light

A southern working class town based on industry.
ItÂ´s the city of light and it belongs to you and me.
This city isn't famous, the streets aren't paved in gold.
This city has no class but itÂ´s still the best place in the world.

ItÂ´s the City 
The City of Light

From the main square to the freeway, ItÂ´s a side down memory lane.
When I took at those streets today some things never seem to change.
ThereÂ´s no place like home, gonna stay here all my life.
ThereÂ´s no words to describe this feeling, this is the place where I wanna die. 

ItÂ´s the City 
The City of Light",City of Light
Discipline,"I remember the times when you were living on the street.
You had nowhere to go, you didn't have a place to sleep.
Well, I know what they say, that itÂ´s a dirty world out there.
But no one really gives a damn and nobody seems to care.
Like an outlaw on the run, running in a dead end street.
Well in this world today, thereÂ´s nothing for free.

DonÂ´t think about tomorrow.
Just living your life today.
DonÂ´t think about tomorrow.
You got to make it right today.
DonÂ´t think about tomorrow.
Living your life this way.

DonÂ´t think about tomorrow.
Cause tomorrow it all fades away.
You've been gambling all your life now placed the wrong bet.
It seems that luck has turned on you, itÂ´s time to pay your debts.
ItÂ´s the price you pay for freedom, freedom in your own way.
Yesterday donÂ´t mean shit, itÂ´s all about today.
Time is ticking away as the years are passing by.
Now itÂ´s time for you to realize that you canÂ´t hide behind your lies",Dirty World
Discipline,"On the train to another town trying to make our way to the football ground.
Every weekend another game, everywhere we go itÂ´s always the same.
A few hours later itÂ´s over again a 4-1 less we didn't have a chance.
WeÂ´re leaving the stand weÂ´re on the move out on the streets all hell breaks loose.

Everywhere we go

WeÂ´re invading the town, this city is ours, tearing down fences and smashing up bars.
The smell of teargas is in the air, the riot squad is coming but we donÂ´t care.
Police try to stop us but they never will, the firm is too strong and we kick to kill.
Never surrender! WeÂ´re going all the way, the city is on fire we had a hell of a day!

Everywhere we go",Everywhere We Go
Discipline,"Forever - In our Hearts
Forever - In our Souls
Forever - In our Memories


You´ll never walk alone.
You won´t be forgotten, We won´t forget your names.
You left us way to early now, It will never be the same.
You were taken by the hand of god, It´s tragic tale of fate.
The emptiness cannot be filled, You an never be replaced.
I hope you´re looking down and you can see us here today.
Out of sight not out of mind, Just listen to these words I say.

Too young to die - Forever til the End
Too young to die - Someday we´ll meet again
Too young to die - Your time wasn´t yet to come
Too young to die - At least you´re not alone

Forever - In our Hearts
Forever - In our Souls
Forever - In our Memories

You´ll never walk alone.
So rest in peace my brother, You last journey is about to start.
Someday we meet again, Forever in our Hearts.

We'll show the world what we've got to say
Saints and sinners let's all unite,

We got stand up and fight today
Now is the time to take back what's ours,
There gonna be a hell to pay",Saints and Sinners
Discipline,"I don´t want you around, I don´t want you near.
But you just don´t seem to get it clean.
That there´s no future together for me and you.
For all these years you´ve been around.
You cheated on me you´ve tried to drag me down.
Always and always - Forever without you

Don´t want to spend my time together with you
Don´t wanny hear a word ´cuz nothing you say is true
Don´t want to spend my time together with you
I want to live my life forever without you

I took a turn, I went separate way.
Just find yourself a new toy to play.
I never want you back in my life again.
You only talk and think about yourself.
Why don´t you shut up and go to hell.
Always and alway - Forever without you",Same Old Story
Discipline,"These boots of mine helped me trough all along the way.
Through rain and through sunshine, badlands and better days.
Life can be tough sometimes, don´t know if I'll survive.
But I´ll never surrender, I'll always keep my head up high.
When I found myself in times of trouble and there was no one therefor me.
I felt like giving in but that just wasn´t me.
So I put on these boots and get back an track again.
I fought hard to make it back and I´ll fight until the bitter end.

These Boots of Mine have carried me all the way
They made me what I am, the man I am today
These Boots of Mine aren´t shiny and bright
But at least they´ve got the strength to keep the flame alive

There´s battles I lost, there´s battles I won.
These boots are old and worn out but still they carry on.
The man I am today is not the man that I´ve been.
I´m never going back to learn these lessons again.
You may think what you want, You may think that I´m wrong.
But I don´t care ´cuz in these shoes you wouldn´t last long.
I´ll be walking and walking until the end of time.
Now I know that I can´t loose with these boots of mine.

These Boots of Mine have carried me all the way
They made me what I am, the man I am today
These Boots of Mine aren´t shiny and bright
But at least they´ve got the strength to keep the flame alive",These Boots
Discipline,"I see them look at me
When I'm passing by
I see their faces turn
I see them wondering why
When I'm walking down the street
They see my scarred-up face
It's the cross I bear, I stand on trial
Every fuckin' day

When we're walking down the road,
With our tattooed arms and rings in our ears
They're just afraid of the unknown
They try to blame us for their fears
So why should I even try?
What's the use anyway?
You'll never know what it's like
To be convicted every day

You will never understand, that this is the way it's gotta be
You will never understand, what this life means to me

I see them point their fingers
They call us the enemy
The media likes to portrait us as
The rejects of society
You're just looking for a scapegoat
Someone who can easily be blamed
But I'll never except my part
To be crucified for your mistakes

You will never understand, that this is the way it's gotta be
You will never understand, what this life means to me",Rejects of Society

And all our hopes and dreams were so strong.
All the good times we always had.
Those days I never forget.

The end of the road

Now the time has come to let it rest.
I´ve had enough of you always re-living the past.
Stop thinking about those days.
The future´s now, time is ticking away.

Discipline,"Going out for days on end, almost living in pubs and bars.
Acting like a maniac, no bridge is too far.
For years this was our only goal; our only goal in life.
Didn´t have no time to think just trying to have a good time.

Boys will be Boys

But my life has been changed since those wonderful days.
Kids have to be fed and bills to be paid.
I often got other things and problems on my mind.
Work, wife and family - But I´m still the same guy.

Boys will be Boys

Well did you really think that I would ever change?!
That this troubleseeker could ever be tamed.
Boys will be Boys - I will never grow up.
Today, Tomorrow, forever - I will never stop.

Boys will be Boys",Boys Will Be Boys
Discipline,"They ask why we dress this way
Live for now, stand today
See the kids but don't hear what they say
Close your eyes and look the other way
You say the end justifies the means
They'll lock us up throw away the keys
Crucified, crucified for your sins [Repeat x2]
They don't know our feelings
Only our desperate cries
They seek protection through distorted eyes
Can't tell the truth from their lies
We've got to learn to fight to live
Before they grind us under heel
We're the targets so easy to find
We're the ones that.
Won't stay in line I find myself nailed to a cross
For something that I didn't do
It's your fault you've ruined our lives
But we're the ones you crucify
You're the ones who commit the crimes
But it's always us who do the time",Crucified [*]

As I do, the whisper turns into a shout

I tried to dismiss what you taught me

Risking everything I had
I was keen to find the worst that I could do
Throw this sanity away
Brought destruction to the people that I know

My hurt became a cage
I became a puppet on the stage
And even though we're not okay
The feeling brings me blush all the same, all the same

Qu'évitent les keufs et leurs lassos
Quand ils s'empressent de nous foutre à l'ombre
Donc on doit s'aimer
Putain d'merde, c'est la solution
Si un frère gagne, qu'il est champion
S'il est champion, on est champion

Donc prends le risque, prends le risque d'aimer
Tout ce qu'ils t'disent, c'est de n'jamais t'aimer
Depuis qu't'es petit, on n'a fait qu'te nier
Prends ce disque comme un bouclier

La la la la la la la (comme un bouclier)
La la la la la la la (prends le risque d'aimer)
La la la la la la la (prends le risque)
La la la la la la la (prends le risque d'aimer)

Pour savoir à leur avis
Alors tu veux rapper, j'espère que t'as la rage
?

Un malaise dans la pièce comme si quelqu'un venait de faire son coming out
Je vais tellement te kicker que t'auras que trois mots, c'est ""Oh my God!""
Évry Grigny Corbeil, Neuf-Un, c'est mon pedigree
J'le mets pas en avant mais tu ferais bien de pas l'oublier
J'vais fermer leurs bouches une fois pour toute, ces haineux, tous ces jnouns
Je vais les foutre à poil, les faire chanter, danser comme à Cancun
J'suis pas que cool, j'suis pas que good, torturé depuis le Poisson Rouge
Transe-Lucide, mon huitième round, j'ai pas fini donc personne bouge!
Les MC, bouches bées, me regardent rapper, aimeraient me rattraper
Me voir rater, me voir raquer, voire pouvoir me racketter
Mais j'aime la boxe, pas le tennis, j'ai les boules et l'pénis
Rap Génie, j'veux être béni, avoir la Foi comme en Tchétchénie
Me cassent les couilles, me rendent vulgaire, Rap Game, Rap Game de merde
En plein Djihad contre mon nafs, j'pourrais tous les foutre à terre
Mais j'veux pas hahahahahahaha, j'me rabaisse pas hahahahahahaha
J'fais de la musique for the people, pas besoin d'intermédiaire
Leur industrie, c'est l'âge de pierre, j'suis comme un ordi', je rappe en binaire
Voulaient que j'fasse partie des rappeurs oubliés
Ces gros malins se font des gros billets
Étaient certains d'avoir tout pillé mais j'ai un putain d'flow, j'suis bien outillé
J'suis mon patron, mon ouvrier, j'me suis affranchi, Scorsese
Pendant que les MC ont des dossiers classés X, MarcDorcel
D.I.S.I.Z, j'ai gagné mon respect à coup de gros tracks et de gros textes
Tu t'es pris une droite quand t'as press play!
Fuck les Elvis Presley, les pilleurs de Memphis
Je vaux bien plus qu'une Bentley, j'suis Chuck Berry en Stan Smith
J'suis un assassin en solo, note mon nom sur ta liste
Je fais de la musique for the people, pas pour des journalistes
Des pigistes, des pongistes, parle pas de rap, c'est pas ton registre
T'es qu'un tout petit babtou, un tout petit bourgeois
Tu fantasmes sur les cailles-ra et leurs couilles que tu n'as pas
J'suis sûr que t'es négrophile, tes darons sont négrophobes
T'aimes les noirs comme Claude Guéant, dans ton lit pas pour un job
J'suis trop Sear, j'suis Get Busy, j'suis un In-Rapuptible
Fuck le rap conscient, le rap Bling-Bling, vive le rap utile!

OK, ça parle de rapper, 15 ans que j'fais ce métier, teste pas ma longévité
J'ai pas que réussi, j'ai aussi raté
OK, mea culpa, pour certains trucs j'plaide coupable
J'étais super dupe, super duper, mais toujours Supa Dupa
Guidé par ma niya, ça partait d'une bonne intention
J'aurais pas dû montrer patte blanche dans certaines interventions
Mais la musique dans la peau, c'était facile de m'instrumentaliser
Mais, si t'étais dans ma peau, t'aurais du mal à t'organiser
Vingt-quatre sur vingt-quatre et sept jours sur sept
J'ai mal au cœur, je pète un câble les frères partent en sucette
Pour ça que je fuis le succès, que j’sabote ma propre recette
Tu l'savais pas?
Maintenant tu le sais!
J'suis cul nul, prêt à tousser
Et ma question préférée ""Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire de toute cette jeunesse?""
Qui vit en accéléré, veut faire du chiffre à toute vitesse
C'est le retour de Disiz La Peste, sur ce son c'est Disiz la Tess
Ma question préférée ""Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire des mecs de tièks?""
Rendus sourds à l'amour, des balles en guise de Boules Quiès
Ma jeunesse pète les plombs pour des grosses fesses, des grosses caisses
Et c'est comme au grec, le système au-dessus de nos têtes
Avec son fusil à aiguiser, aiguise nos épées de Damoclès
Mal aiguillés au début comme le train fou de Denzel
Dans ma rue RedBull et Vodka, donnent plus que des ailes
Ils se transforment en gogols, font des tractions avec leurs auréoles
Les petits disent au juge ""Donne-moi ta peine de prison qu'on rigole""
Je n'ai aucun plaisir à rapper ce que je rappe
Pourtant, c'est triste à dire, faut bien que je propose un contraste
Je reviens du pire, j'me suis sorti d'un contrat
J'suis pas tout seul, mon nom de famille pourrait être Sonacotra
Plus que vrai, j'suis transparent, comme ça la vie est plus belle
Mon cœur est gros et rouge sang, le leur c'est du Babibel
Penser que je copie quelqu'un, c'est l'hôpital qui se fout de la morgue
Personne n'invente plus rien, juste l'agonie qui s'fout de la mort
Les signes extérieurs d’richesse cachent des preuves intérieures de pauvreté
Je défoncerai vos palais comme un joueur de hockey
L'État manipule le diable comme un magasinier
Et j'ai bien peur que pour changer ça, faudra plus que s'indigner
Ah yeah, aveugles comme des cyclopes borgnes
Font des coupes gorges au destin et rêvent de comptes off-shore
Je fais partie de ces MC qui se sentent obligés
Je répands l'amour comme le Sida, sans me protéger
J'fais pas d'oseille sur la misère, leur rap est fratricide
Mauvaise influence sur les frères ont oublié que par ici
On te monte en l'air et te descend du bout de doigts comme une chaise de bureau
Donc j'envoie du love, c'est ma part du boulot

Donne-moi mes lettres de noblesse, donne-moi mes props, motherfucker

J'ai mérité cet oseille, donne-moi mon chèque, motherfucker

Donne-moi mes lettres de noblesse, donne-moi mes props, motherfucker

J'ai mérité cet oseille, j'sais quoi en faire, motherfucker

J'vais tellement tous les crever, croiront qu'leur nom de famille c'est R.I.P
Si c'est l'nerf de la guerre, j'ferais pas de l'oseille, j'ferais du P.I.B
Mon style de rap est prohibé, j'ai trop d'idées
J'suis pas trop intelligent, c'est juste toi qu'est trop te-bê'
Ils disent ""Disiz, c'est du rap intello"", eux ne font qu'des jeux de mots
Les initiales ""MC"", chez eux, ça veut dire ""Maître Capello""
Des punchlines Carambar, tous convaincus que c'est bien
Avec vos jeux de mots tout nazes, des MC Patrick Sébastien
Rappeurs débiles dans ma ligne de mire
C'est ma bataille de Badr, y'a pas de débat, c'est dead
Et, de rap en rap, c'est de pire en pire
J'ai pas une barbe pour rien, j'ai pris du poil de la bête
Et rappeur solo, j'ai la force d'un groupe
Pendant que tu les bois, moi, je mets des coups
Prends soin de ma sape, soin de ma coupe
Prends soin de ma femme, soin de mon couple
Et je fuis le succès, je sabote mes propres recettes
Tu l'savais pas, maintenant tu l'sais, j'suis cul nu, prêt à tousser
Plus rien à cacher, j'suis détaché dans le sens où je n'ai plus de tâche
J'me suis fâché, auto-clashé, je ne suis plus en otage
À tous les étages, le building brûle, putain j'ai la Raging Bull!

Quoique parfois les parents sont pires que les gosses
J'ai trop de maux sur la conscience c'est pour ça que je me force
Je m'autocensure par peur que mes dires soient pris à l'envers
Je suis pas là pour légitimer les petits cons dans leur merde
Je ne suis pas là pour faire le prêcheur encore moins l'engraineur
Pour faire ma pute dans mes textes vous divertir sur le bonheur

Je suis allé au quartier je crois bien j'ai salué ça va bien
On m'a répondu ça va bien
Mais c'est quoi ce flash après je ne me rappelle plus de rien
Je ne bois pas je ne fume pas putain j'y comprends rien
C'est pas un rêve j'en suis sûr je n'ai pas dormi

J'suis qu'un mulâtre
Ma critique est âpre
J'appréhende les autres
Tout ça, c'est bien, mais c'est après
J'fais peur aux gueuers et j'effraye les nègres
On veut pas d'moi dans c'monde, paraît-il, faut qu'j'm'intègre
J'suis l'mélange dans l'shaker
J'ai pas ma place dans les échecs
Et chaque fois que j'jacte sur l'son du Cheikh
J'sais que j'provoque la question du siècle
A savoir s'il faut vivre en mosaïque ou en secte
Pourquoi pas comme les insectes?

Un gueuer avec son pinard ou un nègre avec son argent?

Philosophe du ghetto range tes bagages du gars qu'à tout vu
Qu'à tout fait mon cul, t'as trente ans tu glandes encore
Tu vis toujours chez tes parents et pour les aider tu dors
Pourtant c'est pas d'ta faute, c'est à cause de l'État
Si on t'écoutes bah t'es un modèle faut faire comme toi
Pas être esclave de cette société de consommation
Mais tous les jours t'achètes la Heineken pour ton biberon

C'est récurent, c'est trop courant, toute la France est au courant
Tout n'est pas tout beau tout rond, mais arrête de jurer sur le Coran
Tout le temps, toutes les cinq minutes, c'est un automatisme
Pour une barrette de shit, dire walaï c'est le traumatisme
C'est l'tisse-mé, je tise pas mais je peux te comprendre
Tant que tu légitimes pas, t'emprisonnes dans ton rôle

Tu parles de la rue et des rôles qu'on y joue
Quoi d'neuf à part ça?
Ça me tape sur le systéme ""ya"" ""ah-gah""
Tu parles des cages d'escaliers, mais quel âge t'as?
Tu veux qu'j'achète ton bédo mais t'es H.S

T'es H.S., t'as plus de pile, tellement tu bois, t'as plus de bile
T'exploses ton foie, tu me parles de foi mec, t'es débile
Faux anarchiste en carton, tu t'égares donc gardes ton
Modèle de vie bidon plein de conneries et de bifton

C'est Disiz la Peste qui caracole pendant qu'toi tu planes
À la U.L.M. et là c'est E.L.O.Q.U.E.N.C.E sur le B.P.M

Disiz la Peste,"J'me fous du monde et prépare ma libération
Je suis le nouvel observateur en pleine expansion
T'as le droit de savoir ce qui me révolte
Je suis un envoyé spécial remonté à 3000 volts
Les complaintes de la reconnaissance c'est ce qui m'a blessé
Toute mon enfance à me chercher je l'ai passé
Avec ce manque de reconnaissance ce qui m'a décidé
Y'a une faille dans ton système putain c'est que j' t'ai percé
Disiz la peste j'prône la paix tout le monde le sait
Avec j'pète les plombs j'ai eu tout ce succès
On m'a invité à faire des émissions pour que je joue ce rôle
Essaye de me faire croire que mes paroles ne sont que drôles
Quand ils veulent du sensationnel ils appellent Joey Starr
Quand c'est du negro peace and love c'est Mc solaar
Essaye de me coudre sur la peau cette étiquette
Avec des points de suture en fer pour que jamais je ne l'enlève
L'étiquette du rappeur casquette basket misogyne et sans hygiène
Pas grand chose dans la tête
C'que je viens annoncer à cet auditoire est effroyable
C'est que depuis le départ je joue leur jeu c'est vrai mais incroyable
Je suis parfait prototype qui contrecare tous tes clichés
L'antithèse du rap de base avec qui tu nous a lynché
Depuis Olivier Cachin et paris city rappin
HIP HOP ce cliché fut rapide
Je suis ton nouveau prof d'histoire j'te remémore ses éléments
C'est grave aujourd'hui les cd sont les livres de demain
Wesh mon frère, laisse cette pierre, laisse cette innocente vitrine
Si c'est toi qui tires tu transformes le tireur en victime
Je souffle sur ce molotov que tu mets sous ce coffre
Quel cadeau tu leur offres ils ont rendu ton âme amorphe
Pose ce molotov pour eux j'ai mieux que du héros j'ai l'étoffe
J'écris des textes sur des feuilles qui tombent partout comme en automne
Retranscris notre histoire à pleins livres en plusieurs tomes
Grossiste j'te vends d'la vérité j'peux t'en livrer des tonnes
Métisse donc pas monochrome c'est un homme au cromi
On m'a promis pour trop me le mettre
Depuis la petite école et ces maîtres envoie-leur ce sms
Maîtres et maîtresses pour moi le monde est une bibliothèque
Merci de m'avoir appris à lire maintenant gardez vos cours
J'apprenais plus vite dans la cour merci beaucoup
Pire qu'un pavé pire qu'un molotov
C'que j'aime c'est apprendre et ensuite je le rap et des gens m'entendent
J'me cultive lis des livres fais des noeuds avec mes racines
On nous a pas tout appris donc j'vous envoie un signe
Personne ne m'a dit d'où je venais j'ai dû chercher moi-même
Et ça y est je me suis retrouvé
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire, est-ce que tout le monde est présent
La tâche sera dure, 5 minutes pour parler de 500 ans


Ah ouais t'as toujours pas compris que j'ai repris ce que tu m'avais pris
Avec ceux-ci je reconstruis ce que tu as détruit
Dans les librairies j'ai appris ce qui n'a pas de prix
Je prie pour que ces écrits portent un jour leurs fruits
Maîtresse tu m'as rien appris sur mon Afrique
Est-ce que parce que t'as honte ou bien parce que t'as tout pris
Tu m'as pas dit que la guerre d'Indochine c'était de ta faute
Tu m'as pas dit que la guerre d'Algérie c'était de ta faute
Tu m'as pas dit que si l'Afrique est pauvre c'est de ta faute
Tu m'as pas dit que l'Occident a fait un puzzle avec le monde
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire, le cours d'aujourd'hui c'est sur thiaroye 44
Tu m'as parlé de Molière, Flaubert, Baudelaire
Moi c'est Senghor, Saizère et Martin Luther
Tu m'as parlé de De Gaulle et de Napoléon
Moi c'est Mandela, Loumoumba et Steeve Biko
Où sont les discussions à Saint Germain de Boris Vian, Sartre
Tu as oublié de nous dire qu'ils nous ont fait du bien
Maîtresse tu m'as pas dit qu'après la seconde guerre mondiale
10 ans fut le temps de l'embargo contre l'Allemagne
10 ans pour un pays qui a embrasé le monde
Alors que déjà 12 ans pour l'Irak et ses puits de pétrole
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire
Je prépare mes cours très tard le soir
Contre les politiques qui devant le pupitre se lèvent et mentent
Je bois un thé à la menthe et là je rappe avec véhémence
L'icône que tu me donnes me pousse à être stupide
Ta culture de masse m'asphyxie et j'la suicide
J'suis pas communiste j'suis pas islamiste je suis juste lucide
Et je sais ce que je sais
Je suis le nouveau prof d'histoire dans ce Etat français
Monsieur le prof, les Egyptiens étaient des négroïdes
Où je l'ai su ? C'est Cheikh Anta Diop qui me l'a dit
Les caucasiens ont un passé assez sombre
L'apogée de vos anciens empires a ses ombres
Nous ne sommes pas assez nombreux
Ce cours d'histoire aujourd'hui c'est pour comprendre
Adopter le mot prendre, oublier le mot rendre
Garde ton argent, tu penses payer nos cendres
Mes connaissance augmentent de janvier à décembre
Attention je ne discute plus en bas d'un hall
ni au pied d'un baobad tard le soir au Sénégal
Pas autour d'un bedo ni autour d'une teillbou

C'est plus dangereux qu'un noir qui fait des tournantes

Disiz la Peste,"La fin de l’enfance, la fin des rêves, la fin des temps
A Dieu ma jolie reine, ma jolie zique que j’aimais tant
Que je le veuille ou non, je suis passé dans le can des grands
J’avais pas le cran de crever, je voulais crever l’écran
J’étais tout seul le temps
Mon premier crime fût de tuer le temps
As-tu lu le dernier article qui dit que Disiz quitte le ring ?
En ça il n’y a rien de dramatique, c’est juste la fin d’un cycle
Enfin t’y peux y voir un signe, je partage ton opinion
Les m éandres sont magiques et c’est la sortie que nous fuyons
Nous vivons à reculons, les yeux rivés sur le passé
Puis on recule , on voit que la vie s’est tassé
Les yeux d’enfant sont cassés, rêves de cristal
Que je le veuille ou non, mon destin fait du freestyle
La fin d’un jeu, la fin d’un son, la fin d’un titre
Pourquoi la fin d’un flow, alors que j’en ai encore des litres ?
La fin d’un verre, la fin d’un joint, la fin d’un spliff
La fin d’une prière un matin, la fin d’un livre
La fin de Marvin, la fin de Bob, la fin de Big
La fin de Pac, la fin de X, la fin de King
La fin de Tony, j’ai bien vu la fin du film
Enfants des taudis, ce sera bientôt la fin des ruines
La faim décide, pas pour bientôt la fin des crimes
La fin du monde, la fin d’un cycle, la fin du titre",Disiz the End
Disiz la Peste,"Je viens de l’île des enfants perdus, je ne veux plus grandir
Car là d’où je viens, on m’a fait grandir trop vite
La nuit je chasse mon ombre en essayant de me trouver
Pouvoir me définir si seulement je le pouvais

On est plein d’enfants perdus, peu importent les frontières
Pénuries de rêves dans un monde imaginaire
Alors la nuit on danse comme des tarés, la journée on est égaré
Au fond ce que l’on pense, on aimerai se barrer

La fée Clochette a plusieurs rôles, pour certains c’est la drogue
Dures ou douces, peu importe, pour d’autres c’est l’alcool
Pour d’autres c’est le love, les jeunes font ce qu’ils peuvent
Mais ce qui est sûr, c’est qu’on veut s’échapper de ce monde

JE NE VEUX PLUS GRANDIR ET LE TEMPS PASSE TROP VITE
IL FAUT CHERCHER L’HORLOGE DANS LE VENTRE DU CROCODILE
JE NE VEUX PLUS GRANDIR J’AI ENVIE DE PARTIR
CALME TOI PETIT BONHOMME IL FAUT PAS FAIRE DE BETISES

On m’a infantilisé, on m’a aussi utilisé
On m’a souvent divisé et toujours diabolisé
Alors je me suis mis en marge et je me suis pris en charge
Mais malheureusement, je suis devenu mon propre otage

Comme une impression de faire tache, dans la rue quand je marche
Je me sens comme un punk que l’on croise et que l’on toise
Il y a trop de jugement, trop de capitaine Crochet
Tous ces anciens profs, ces keufs et certains parents proches

Tout un tas de reproches, à leurs désirs tu t’accroches
Et t’oublis les tiens pour être sûr que dans tes poches
Il y ait toujours ce qu’il faut, alors tu vis pour les autres
Mais au fond de toi t’aimerais t’échapper de ce monde

JE NE VEUX PLUS GRANDIR ET LE TEMPS PASSE TROP VITE
IL FUT CHERCHER L’HORLOGE DANS LE VENTRE DU CROCODILE
JE NE VEUX PLUS GRANDIR J’AI ENVIE DE PARTIR

Straight up, now tell me,
Is it gonna be you and me together,
Oh, oh, oh, or are you just havin' fun

To young and old, meek and the bold

With joyful ring, all caroling.

From everywhere, filling the air
O, how they pound, raising the sound
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale

Gaily they ring, while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here!

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good Morning, Belle
'Morning, Monsieur
Where are you off to
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre and a
That's nice. Marie, the baguettes hurry up

Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Good day
How is your family

Bonjour
Good day
How is your wife

I need six eggs
That's too expensive

There must be more than this provincial life

Ah, Belle
Good Morning. I've come to return the book I borrowed
Finished already
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new
Ha Ha! Not since yesterday
That's all right. I'll borrow, this one
That one? But you've read it twice
Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring sword fights
magic spells, a prince in disguise
If you like it all that much, it's yours
But sir
I insist
Well, thank you. Thank you very much

Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three

Now it's no wonder that her name means ""beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle

Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston, You're the greatest
hunter in the whole world!
I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you. Ha ha ha and
no girl, for that matter.
It's true, LeFou. And I've got my sights set on that one
Hmm the inventor's daughter
She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry
But she's
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but
That makes her the best. And don't I deserve the best
Well, of course! I mean you do, but

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston
Oh he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute

Bonjour
Pardon
Good day
Mais oui

What lovely grapes
Some cheese
Ten yards
One pound
'Scuse me
I'll get the knife
Please let me through
This bread
Those fish
It's stale
They smell
Madame's mistaken

There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife

Look there she goes a girl who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

And we'll have some fun

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when

See it's no problem, hon

Can you hook up some seats
For my friends and my parents?

So I said to myself, well heck, why not?

How'd you get in this mess?

Hold your breath
I know the rest
Guess you better get yourself a whole lotta money

Give a little whistle!

Long ago there were three pigs
Little handsome piggy wigs
For the big, bad the very big, very bad wolf
They did not give three figs

Number one was very gay
And he built his house with hay
With a hey hey toot he blew on his flute
And he played around all day

Now number two was fond of jigs
And so he built his house with twigs
Hey, diddle diddle he played on his fiddle
And danced with lady pigs

Number three said, ""Nix on tricks
I shall build my house with bricks""
He had no chance to sing or dance
'Cause work and play don't mix

Ha, ha, ha, the two little do little pigs
Just winked and laughed ah, woo

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra la la la la

Came the day when fate did frown
And a wolf blew into town
With a gruff huff puff, he puffed just enough
And the hay house fell right down

One and two were scared to death
Of the big bad wolf's breath
By the hair of your chinny chin I'll blow you in
And the twig house answered yes

No one left but number three
To save that piglet family
So when they knocked, he fast unlocked
And said come in with me

Now they all were safe inside
But the bricks hurt wolf's pride
So, he slid down the chimney and oh, by Jiminey
In a fire he was fried

Oh, oh, oh, the three little free little pigs
Just winked and laughed, ah, woo

Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free

Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land

That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? burn?

Love to explore that shore above?

Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?

To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent

What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?

Your heart is pure, you're thoughtful
Surely princess, you're almost there 
Why just putting on a tiara
And you aren't the same old you

For a moment, all of me is alive and at home in the sea 
I'm swirling and twirling so graceful and grand 
Not stubbing my toes, getting stuck in the sand

And truer to life than before

For a moment, I can shine

My fingers are wrinkly 
I really don't care, 
If all of my curls have curled out of my hair 
For a moment, I can feel 
All the dreams I'd been dreaming are real 
Wish my mother could hear it, the sea is my song 
For a moment, just a moment, I belong 

I will find you, my darling 
And the moment that I do 
I'll hold you close, my Melody

Disney,"What I love most about rivers is
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing

But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing

What's around the river bend
Waiting just around the river bend

I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for what I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend for me, coming for me

I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming?

For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?

Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend

I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend, just around the river bend

Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, dream giver
Just around the river bend?",Just Around the Riverbend [from Disney's Pocahontas]

I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
I'll play guitar and knit
And cook and basically
Just wonder when will my life begin?

Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking
Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb
Sew a dress!

I'll paint the walls some more

Bottoms up boys, this is the last call
Happy hour doesn't last too long

And a bucket full of rye

In the brig don't yield to the mighty
You got your own dirt to dig

Lose me if I don't lose you

Anyone of you to condemn
So make your decision and choose you
Side or let us begin

Steeped in knowledge
I'll step from the board
Down to the speak easy
With my double-edged sword
You know the deal
You got to spin the wheel

Holds the jackal's truth

Awaiting the final moment

All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally my soul will rot

Trying to say
What I've always wanted to know
You want me to know that you're mine, mine

A lonely time

When I try to rebuild I see my humble shelter
Just fall to the ground again

Take heed my friend lest you be torn asunder

Every day brings on
A hundred ways to fight
Constant scrutiny
I can feel you judging me
Resurrecting every demon that's inside

Too many hours spent in darkness questioning
""How and why""?

I can't remember many moments in the light

An execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why!

I was a boy who had to live his own way
I never fit into the model they had designed
I chose a path less taken
I stood with others who had often felt the same

We got stares from passersby
Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away
And when the three young boys died
They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie!

No hope in sight

I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!

Why was everybody so damn afraid?
They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime
And to justify their own faith
We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time

The three of us were attacked and disgraced
For many hours we were questioned and someone lied
One of us couldn't take it
His simple manner was manipulated in kind
Fear made him lie

I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!

Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?

Barely even remember when
There was nothing left to hide and
She has found a way inside, then
I was forced to walk alone
Living in an empty home
All I wanted was to hide and
Try to numb the ache inside
And I'm still afraid of the light
And a thousand voices share their laughter at my demise

Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive
The infection must die

Nothing left but a broken man
Terrified of everything
Nothing left of his foolish pride, his
Fond memories slowly die, then
As he wakes again alone
Still a prisoner in his home
Ready to allow the dark to
Penetrate his broken heart
And I'm still afraid of the light (of the light)
And a thousand voices share their laughter at his demise

Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive
The infection must die

Now if I am to survive (now I must survive)
The infection must die
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive
The infection must die

This is where I draw the line (draw the line)
The infection must die (This infection must die)
Give me release from this demon of mine (demon of mine)
This infection must die

Disturbed,"When I need to spark a bit of inspiration
And the melody feels like it's trapped inside
All I need is a bit of illumination
So the rhythm can no longer run and hide
Well, I take a puff from the leaves of the devil
And it carries me on the other side (fire it up)

I like to fire it up and it feels so right
Fire it up
'Cause when I fire it up, I feel like serenity (I feel like serenity)
Is mine

When I need a little bit of relaxation
My medicine isn't too hard to find
When I'm looking for a bit rejuvenation
I only partake of the finest kind
And then the mystery begins to unravel
It helps me break through to the other side (fire it up)

I like to fire it up and it feels so right
Fire it up

The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight, but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
Turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You're waiting, hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow reckoning
Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all is not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light

An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't' where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid, don't turn away
You’re the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind and
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (all is not forsaken)

Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

Fools, said I, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Sound of Silence

Little Shorty from G-Roll
On the hustle to see six figures or more
Whether rappin' or pimpin' hoes
I'm high capping the gold
And I know I made them boys sick when I popped up on 24's

You see me diggin' in my gold
I'm a ghetto bastard and when I'm smokin' on 'dro
I get the munchies directly after
I made doe by offing hoes in transactions
You see I stay on Riverdale Road
But I'll meet you up on Naston

'Cause in the south side partner we break you off proper
And the doctors can't help ya when the guns go block-ah
Time to notify the pastor ya family you'll mourn after
Yea the day after your ashes get scattered
You're all out next batter

I don't need no approval for poodles 'cause I'm a fool dog
Get to fighting in clubs and swing with pool balls
Shorty raw, walking by I try to grab sumthin'

Verse 1: Tity Boi
Ay yo. since I was a youth, I pumped weed out and I been had cash money fa real
Off
Wit expectations and fare time faces
When I was hangin' wit this kid named Jason wit an accent from Jamaica
Our only concearn was diggits and comsumers 'cause we had athis lil city down in
Alabama Boomin' so we just do it
Did it like Nike
And even wit this wifebeater on
I still got somethin up my sleeve
It sounds so hard talkin bout guns
'cause I got a 3-5-7-9 and a Mac11
Get drilled, tip toein by the minute
When 6 wit the clip showin
Nicca where ya click gone
They spreadin out like bugshots
Ain't nobody dyin still alive around here but caught
Exscure me your honor, can ya holla at my nicca

Chrous:

Penatentury*.

Dolla Boy and I would like to say that I'm the hardest nicca from around
My way

Verse 2: Dolla Boy
Well I'm the dolla boy got gam gallure*
You may have a lot of game but I got much more
And it all brew coo parked run and shoot
Or late night throwin rights, shootin
Dice wit tru and that diamond in the back
Sunroof top, I'm hangin out that bitch
Bout to shut down the block MMMMMMM
AK music, bombass trap wit put the deadanator to it
Niccas get rolled put the mask on and shoot
Street court nicca tell his fam that we sued 'em
Used to run the trap 1-5 on the ruler
But now I'm droppin off like I'm down wit the Cubans
Straight A grad in the Hard Knock Schoolin
Intern work year round brick movin
Get to this money shit real in this music
So get it how you want it lame nicca don't confuse me

Verse 3: Dolla Boy
Niccas wanna know how Dolla does it
Bangwell gram need all of my 'causeins lame nicca?

Got enough heat to cook the hams and the stuffin'
Take 22's knock the berries out ya muffin
Momma said her son was 6 short from a dozen
Message to my peers man get to this money

Verse 4: Tity Boi?
A hundred miles of runnin ain't no stoppin us
My communtiy service is pickin paper up
If the drought end its glocks and mad men
Tracks and glass mixed wit a macs and mac10s?

Stayed in the statepen
Don't think I ain't bigger

On 22's is how I carry myself
I'm like EWWW I might marry myself, YUP

Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,

Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,

It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
Don't be mad cause I can't hold my 500 horses
Lamborghini's and Porsche's, Ferrari's and Vipers
I'ma wipe the seats with you drool then rub the hood with a diaper
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank
I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap your seat-belts on, go put your money up
Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
Time to play or better yet it's time to bring out them toys

Yo, one of my ways of releasing tension while I'm releasing some steam
Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on I'm making sure the slippers is clean
The 26's is mean, shut down the block, nigga picture the fiends
My system supreme, you can feel the knock, just picture the scene
The chickens just scream, whole crew balling they sick of my team
We getting the cream, I'm through hollering, I'm living my dream
I'm black with a scheme, won't stop until that fat lady sings
And yeah it's actual and factual what my faculty brings
A car show for whatever we slide and wherever we glide
You can keep your rules and regulations man cause we don't abide
And we looking alive, Mercedes Benz, 6 or the 5
In a Beamer, Lexus or Ac', we don't know how to act when we drive
And I fiend for the ride, I lay back and lean to the side
Onlookers and turning heads is all that's seen through his eyes
I'm breezing on by, and no doubt, it's easy to fly
But it's even better when you slow down or ease to the side

Bye, bye love, bye, bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness, I feel like I could die

Diva,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Diva,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I'd set my foot on a steamboat and sail the ocean 'round 
Sailing 'round the ocean, sailing 'round the sea 
I think of handsome Molly wherever she may be 

I am a beggarman and a beggin' I have been 
For three score or more on this lil' isle of green 
I'm known from the Liffy on down to Segu 
And I'm known by the name of Little Johnny Doo 

Of all the trades a-goin' sure a-beggin' is the best 
When a man gets tired he can lay his head to rest 
He can beg for his supper when there's nothing else to do 
Or go sit 'round the corner in his ol' rigadoo 

We slept one night in a barn in Clairebon
We went naked all night and slept until the dawn 
Holes in the roof and the rain a-pourin' through 
And the cats and the rats they were a-playin peek-a-boo 

Who should awaken but the woman of the house 
In a white spotted apron and a calico blouse 
She began to frighten and I said ""Boo!"" 
""Don't be afraid ma'am, it's only Johnny Doo!"" 

Over the fields with a pack on my back 
Over the hills with a creak in me sack 
Holes in my shoes and my toes peekin' through 
Singing ""Shinkle and a wrinkle it's only Johnny Doo!"" 

Well, it's getting late at night and it's time to go to bed 
And the fire's all out and whoops goes the light 
Now you know the story of the old rigadoo 
So good night and God be with you says Little Johnny Doo

With her lights, buzzers, whistles and bells

I see her running round this town in her fancy car
A girl who can't afford your hopes and dreams
But darlin' all those pretty toys won't help your broken heart
When she's through and sends you packin' back to me

Whistles and bells won't ever bring you love and happiness
She's never gonna give her heart the way that I would give
She's got you spinning round in circles, I can tell
With her lights, buzzers, whistles and bells

I cried those lonely tears until the day I realized
That you were hurting so much more than me
There are some things in this world that just don't have a price
Like the love that waits here for you patiently

Such a long time ago
If I found you with another
Well  I'd walk right out your door

Woah  you might call me crazy
There's one thing you should know
Oh honey  if you want me to love you
Got to give it up or let me go

I know it's useless to be jealous
I couldn't tie you if I tried
When I'm thinking you're messin'
Around my back

It sure brings a pain I just can't hide
Oh baby, I've been true to you
And if I can make that sacrifice
Honey, you can do it too

Well, you come home drunk and nasty
You won't tell me where you've been
Just when things are nice and sweet
Your going back out again

Why do you want to mess up a good thing?
I'm gonna find me another man
One that wants to give me everything

I should have to be so alone
I'm smothered by this emptiness
Lord  I wish I was made of stone

And it paid me back in change
God help me am I the only one
Who's ever felt this way?

A heart that's worn and weathered
Would know better than to fight
But I wore mine like a weapon
Played out love like a crime
And it wrung me out and strung me out
And it hung years on my face
God help me, am I the only
Who's ever felt this way?

Now my sense of humor needs a break
I see a shadow in the mirror
And she's laughin' through her tears
One more smile's all I can fake
There is a wound inside me
And it's bleeding like a flood
There are times when I see a light ahead
Hope is not enough
As another night surrounds me
And it pounds me like a wave

So many hearts get broken in the push and shove

To the one who took my place

So tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see

She's the best he's ever known
The way he told me ev'ry night
When we were all alone
She'll find out when the new wears off
He'll find somebody new
She'll learn what heartache's all about

To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the high stakes

She traveled this road as a child
Wide eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the high stakes

She knows the high stakes

As her folks drive away, her dad yells, ""Check the oil!""
Mom stares out the window and says, ""I'm leaving my girl""
She said, ""It didn't seem like that long ago""
When she stood there and let her own folks know

She needs new faces

Dixie Chicks,"Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

Well, it wasn't two weeks after she got married that
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well, the weeks went by and spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
We need a break, let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch, and stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Is that alright?  Good! Let's go for a ride, Earl, hey!
Ooh hey hey hey, ummm hey hey hey, hey hey hey",Goodbye Earl
Dixie Chicks,"Hugged your friends
Kissed your mama goodbye
Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why
From me

Me and the baby and you side by side
We all knew we was in for a long hard ride
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed
We honked the horn when we crossed the
State line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must've known
What we were going to find

This ain't nothin' but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancin' without the sound
It ain't nothin' no nothin'
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're gonna climb
Pat on the back and better luck next time
It ain't nothin' no it ain't nothin' but a heartbreak town

Stardust well it's a funny thing
It can make you cuss
It can make you sing
And the need to touch it gets hard to explain some days
I've seen 'em rise
I've seen 'em fall
Some get nothin'
And lord some get it all
Some just run
While others crawled away
Hold my hand baby don't let go
I've got some front money
And I've got a next show
And I'm, I'm gonna need you

We were all getting ready to go

And his veins began to show

Live it up when you get the chance
'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense

Over a small glass of tea
He asked the loaded question
He said now how do you feel about me
My mind was racin' I was pacin'
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing
Left to do I feel it commin' on

From so called friends quick to advise
Though your touch was telling me otherwise

Somehow I saw you as a weakness
I thought I had to be strong
Oh but I was just young
I was scared, I was wrong

Not a night goes by, I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been a home

Guess I did what I did believing
That love is a dangerous thing
Oh but that couldn't hurt anymore
Than never knowing

Not a night goes by, I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been a home, a home

Four walls, a roof, a door, some windows
Just a place to run when my working day is through
They say home is where the heart is
If the exception proves the rule I guess that's true

Down on its knees true love did fall
After 31 days of sleepless nights, she woke up to end it all 
With ""I love you"" on a fresh tattoo engraved upon his chest
She tore her name right off his heart 
So here's to the unblessed 

Oh love, oh love you fickle thing 
Such pretty words and golden rings 
It was a broken dream right from the start
Bless their tortured, tangled hearts

Well a blast of confusion coupled with delusion
Makes the best made plans sometimes fail
They wined and they dined, had peace of mind
She bought a gown and he rented tails
But the mighty cloud of destiny came driftin' through the gates
And busted up what could have been a perfect, hopeless case

Oh love, oh love you fickle thing
Such pretty words and golden rings

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation 
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer 
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam 
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

Earl had to die, goodbye Earl

We'll pack a lunch, and stuff you in the trunk, Earl

You say that I lack the proof
Well baby that might be so

I might get to the end of my life
Find out everyone was lying
I don't think that I'm afraid anymore
Say that I would rather die trying

Who oh, swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips, all the love from my lips

This time when he swung the bat
And I found myself laying flat I wondered
What a way to spend a dime
What a way to use the time, ain't it baby?

I looked at my reflection in the window walking past
And I saw a stranger
Just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
Why the world's dangerous

Who oh swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips, all the love from my lips

You don't like the sound of the truth
Coming from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well baby that might be so

Tell me what's wrong with having a little faith
In what you're feeling in your heart
Why must we be so afraid
And always so far apart

Who oh, swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips, all the love from my lips",Truth No. 2 [DVD]
Dixie Chicks,"Every step of the way
We walk the line
Your days are numbered
So are mine

Time is piling up
We struggle and we scrape
All boxed in
Nowhere to escape

The city's just a jungle
More games to play
I'm trapped in the heart of it
Trying to get away

I was raised in the country
Been working in the town
I been in trouble since I
Set my suitcase down

I ain't got nothing for you
I had nothing before
Don't even have anything
For myself anymore

Sky's full of fire
And the rain is pouring down
There's nothing you can sell me
So I'll see you around

All my powers of expression
And thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice
Reason or rhyme
There's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long

The devil's in the alley
The mule kickin' in the stall
Say anything you want to
I've heard it all
I was thinking about the things that she said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in you bed

Walking through the leaves
Falling from the trees
Feel like a stranger nobody sees
So many things we never will undo
I know you're sorry, well I'm sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won't
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind

Well I got here, following the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
There's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship's been split to splinters
I's sinking fas
t I'm drowning in the poison
Got no future
Got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothing but affection for those who've sailed with me

Everybody's moving if they ain't already there
Everybody's got to move somewhere
Well stick with me baby anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

My clothes are wet
Tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

The emptiness is endless
Cold as clay
You can always come back
But you can't come back all the way

Well there's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Yeah the only thing that I did wrong
Was stayed in Mississippi a day too long
The only thing that I did wrong
Was stayed in Mississippi a day too long",Mississippi

They still ring in my head

We say goodbye
With a tear in our eye

It's alright, you can sleep tonight
Knowing you'll always live on in a song

Farewell to old friends
Let's raise a glass to the bitter end
Farewell to old friends
Will you be the same when we see you again?

Remember the days
When we'd laugh as you played
Who would have known
The water would come and just take you away?
Oh, where'd you go?

It's not alright
I can't sleep tonight
Knowing you should have played on
On and on

Farewell to old friends
Let's raise a glass to the bitter end
Farewell to old friends
Will you forgive me when I see you again?

You had a good time
Drinking all of our wine
After the show
We all rode the wave
Of that crazy parade
Oh, where'd you go?
What happened to
The ones we knew?

Dixie Chicks,"When the calls and conversations
Accidents and accusations
Messages and misperceptions
Paralyze my mind

Buses, cars, and airplanes leaving
Burning fumes of gasoline
And everyone is running
And I come to find a refuge in the

Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay

Monkeys on the barricades
Are warning us to back away
They form commissions trying to find
The next one they can crucify

And anger plays on every station
Answers only make more questions
I need something to believe in
Breathe in sanctuary in the

Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay

Children lose their youth too soon
Watching war made us immune
And I've got all the world to lose
But I just want to hold on to the

The easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me

Would you lay me down beside you
Tell me everything I want to hear
Like that was your favorite year

We search for someone else to blame 
But sometimes things can't stay the same

Of when we were younger 
I can't forget

Thinking no one can see
The secrets you hide behind
Your southern hospitality
On the strip, the kids get lit
So they can have a real good time
Come Sunday they can just take their pick
From the crucifix skyline

Dixie Chicks,"Back when we started
We didn't know how hard it was
Living on nothing
But what the wind would bring to us
Now we've got something
I can imagine fighting for
So why is fighting all that we're good at anymore?

And sometimes I don't have the energy
To prove everybody wrong
And I try my best to be strong
But you know it's so hard
It's so hard

It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard when it doesn't come fast
It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard

It felt like a given
Something a woman's born to do
A natural ambition
To see a reflection of me and you

And I'd feel so guilty
If that was a gift I couldn't give
And could you be happy
If life wasn't how we pictured it?

And sometimes I just want to wait it out
To prove everybody wrong
And I need your help to move on
'Cause you know it's so hard
It's so hard

It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard when it doesn't come fast
It's so hard when it doesn't come easy

When all these clouds open up for me to see
And show me a vision
Of you and me swimming peacefully

Last night you told me
That you can't remember
How to feel free

Dixie Chicks,"Hello mr. Heartache I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passin' through
So hello Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you

When I don't feel like company
You make yourself at home
Even though you know
I'd rather be alone
Love walked out on me
And didn't even close the door
Next thing I know I'm starin'
At your shadow on the floor

So hello Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passin' through
So hello Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you

I wish that I could say it's nice
To see you back again
We're not exactly strangers
But we're not exactly friends
You know you're not invited but
You keep on comin' round
The last thing that I need is you
To kick me when I'm down

So hello Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passin' through
So hello Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you

I've been expecting you
I've been expecting you

Dixie Chicks,"My friends from high school
Married their high school boyfriends
Moved into houses in the same ZIP codes
Where their parents live

But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow

I hit the highway in a pink RV with stars on the ceiling
Lived like a gypsy
Six strong hands on the steering wheel

I've been a long time gone now
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
But I've always found my way somehow

By taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around

I met the queen of whatever
Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
Moved with the shakers
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to

No I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow

It's been two long years now
Since the top of the world came crashing down
And I'm getting' it back on the road now

But I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Oh I just take my time, I won't lie down
And take the long way around

Well, I fought with a stranger and I met myself
I opened my mouth and I heard myself
It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
Guess I could have made it easier on myself

But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow

Well, I never seem to do it like anybody else
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
If you ever want to find me I can still be found

Dixie Chicks,"You don't like the sound of the truth
Coming from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well baby that might be so
I might get to the end of my life
Find out everyone was lying
I don't think that I'm afraid anymore say that I would rather die trying

Woh-oh
Swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips

This time when he swung the bat
And I found myself laying flat I wondered
What a way to spend a dime
What a way to use the time, ain't it baby
I looked at my reflection in the window walking past
And I saw a stranger
Just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
Why the world's dangerous

Woh-oh
Swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips

You don't like the sound of the truth
Coming from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well baby that might be so
Tell me what's wrong with having a little faith
In what you're feeling in your heart
Why must we be so afraid
And always so far apart

Woh-oh
Swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips

Dixie Power Trio,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
And you got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Real deal, you can see it in my posture
I feel like Leo with a Oscar
The price just changed, no sour, it'll cost ya!
And I'm not an imposter
My style don't borrow or foster
My enemies will not prosper
Seems like every time they take a shot they hit the crossbar
And I move like Neymar
Them boys ain't even on my radar
I do my own stunts, no saviour
That's why I gotta stunt so major
They say I go mad for the paper
I think I need a shrink and a tailor
But I do not think about failure
I'm a star, I should get my own trailer

Ain't no love ting here, it's just one big cycle here,
Ain't no friendship here it's just one big cycle here.
Round, round, round we go
Round, round, round we go

She used to love him, he used to love her, she used to kiss him, he used to hug her, call it
Deep love or puppy love, they bunked off school.
Now there's no flame, things ain't the same,
Look's like she's change, thinks it's some game, he's left in the rain, trying to point blame,
Talks for a fool.
She moved on quick, he's still love sick, she's not having it, thinks he's some prick, he won't
Believe it, wants it just how it was in school. 
He keeps calling, night or morning, break of evening, break of dawning.
He keeps ringing up, she
Keeps hanging up, oh what a fool.
She is the best friend, of a ex girlfriend, of a old school friend, who is the close friend, of
This best friend, best friend likes this boy called BLUE.
Best friend loves him, best friend needs him, but the ex girlfriend, of the old school friend,
Who is the close friend, of this best friend, likes him too. 
So the ex girlfriend, of the old school friend, who is the close friend, of this best friend,
Sits with best friend, who by now has slept with BLUE.
Now the ex girlfriend don't want to pretend that she ain't slept with that boy blue, coz we was a
Friend of an ex man too. Listen

Dizzee Rascal,"Hey, listen, take nothing
I don't want to hear anymore talk, you get me, no more talk
I've heard their talk, that Dizzee Rascal's so rude
People talking don't even know me
I do what I want, you get me (and ask no one for nothing)
I ain't everyone's friend
Ok, I don't want to get vexed
That's why I'm just trying to keep my cool, you get me
I don't want to lose it, I can't believe I got people chattin' shit
I'll never watch what I say
I say what the fuck I want, I don't care who you are
I don't care who I offend or nothing
I won't be silenced!

I'm showing you my life's more deep than you think (uh huh)
At nights, I get a little less sleep than you think (really)
Something keeps me up, I can't even get a wink
And there's no point in trying, so I lay there and blink

I'm showing you, I feel more stressed than you see
But my business is my business and I keep it all to me
I've done a lot of work for you to see me where I be
But lately I sense you don't want to set me free

And lately, there's been controversy seen around my name (ok)
But fuck you cause I ain't playing your game (naw)
I ain't chewed my language, they ain't used to it (ok)
But I ain't, you can't get me so (get me) get used to it

Cause I was raised an only child, not a brother, not a sis
And raised around hate, not a hug, not a kiss (naw)
Before this I was just a failure in the mist
And I made it through the front, I can't let you take a piss, so...

[Chorus]
I don't want to get vexed
And I don't want to lose my cool
But I ain't gonna let that boy come around, try take me for no fool
I ain't gonna let that boy come around, I'm reaching for my tool
I ain't gonna let that boy get flash, I'll smash his head on the wall

So, I don't want to get vexed
And I don't want to lose my rag
But I ain't gonna let that boy come around try to take me for no slag
I ain't gonna let that boy come around and run his gums you're mad
I'll probably have him thinking I'm fake, I'll make his family sad

I do the fuck what I want, that's how I got here
And I'll be damned if I let you fussies interfere
And if I had my way, you wouldn't even get near
I don't need your help, do I make myself clear?!?

I know it sounds rude, that's because it's meant to be (okay)
I plan to be the rudest boy in this industry (okay)
Ain't two-faced, and I ain't known to gloat (okay)
If I don't like you, then I'll tell you to your throat

I don't know what you want, I don't know what you expect
But if I don't know you, don't ask me for respect
I don't give it easily, I don't give it much
And I ain't got a heart, so don't ever try and touch

All these pigs runnin' â??round like I owe them (okay)
Before I got big, I didn't even know them (okay)
I'll be doing this for a whole lot a' years (okay)
And I'll be standing tall and straight when the smoke clears
So

[Chorus]

Yo
I'm the type of boy that takes the bump with the grind (okay)
And I'm the type of boy to take your girl from behind (okay)
I'm the type of boy your girl wants me to be (she told me)
So don't act a prick, cause it don't suit me (okay)

You could boil me up and you can even shoot me (okay)
But if your girl's lettin' up, then it's my duty (okay)
I ain't trying to keep your wifey, truthfully (okay)
But it ain't my fault your girlfriend's a groupie

Be careful what you ask for, you could change your mind (okay)
And what you're looking for, you won't like what you find (okay)
If you're looking for the pussy, if you're looking for the chat
I'll remind you that curiosity killed the cat (okay)

Plus
Girls are telling lies, and they spreading like the plague (okay)
What else can I do except keep myself made (okay)
I don't know why these girls are trying to attack me, (okay)
But I'm a rude boy, I won't let nobody trap me, so

but its your own fault you said three magic words (i love you)
when that's the one for the birds
when you said that she forgot other boys
its over you better start buying the toys
there was no intention in front of your wife
that she knows this that she's ending your life
its a real shame you got hacked by the whores
its a real shame that kid probably ain't yours

Looks like I'm losing friends there's a lot of hostility in my endz
We used to argue always make enemy friends
Now we settle disagreements with the skenz
Looks like I'm losing mates there's a lot hostility near my gates
We used to fight with kids from other estates
Nine eight millimetres settle debates
Looks like I'm losing site cause I'm looking at the future it ain't bright
So I look out my window and pray every night
I thank God for my friends but they ain't tight
Looks like I'm losing hope cause I climb this mountain without rope
But I know I'm the captain of my boat so I steadily sail and hope not to float

I'm certain of life I mean this is real
Mad thoughts skip around my head like dance themes
I know it's long to question but I need answers
The who's, the what's, the how's, the when's, the why's
You can at look in my face and see the pain in my eyes
Tears ready to fall like the rain in the skies

Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for ever
I spend my whole life tryna' pull myself together
Tryna' reassure myself that I ain't going mad
I've gotta come to a conclusion it's now or never
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for years
I've been through anger pain blood sweat and tears
You think that any kid in my position would be glad
Its quite the opposite more worries more fears
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for days
It's like I've lost the love I'm only in it cause it pays
I find myself back on road things are getting bad
More and more I'm going back to my old ways
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for good
And if I had the guts to end it all believe I would
It's getting boring always being miserable and sad
Shit I would love to be polite I really wish I could
But lifes pressures often get me down
Sometimes I feel there's not a lot to smile about so I frown
And I talk a big whole heap of badness
Because my life's a big whole heap of madness
I've seen a lot maybe more than I can take
Under pressure everyday trying not to brake
But I'll survive cause it's what I do best
I'm a challenger put me to the test

[Chorus - 2X]
Sleep tight everything will be alright
By the end of the night, will be the day, just
Pray that you see, strong you got a be it
If you want to get through it, stretch your mind to the limit
You can do it

[Verse - 2]
It's almost like I've got no world on my shoulder sometimes
Yo I struggle sometimes, you know I'm hating petty crimes
But we live in hard times
No one to turn to and no one to talk to
Life's like a door way everybody walk through
Everybody's talking but nobody's listening
Everyday some new shit, week out and week in
All this negativity, why you tryna get at me
All up in my life rahhh, where do you get the energy
I don't feel well, but you still bother me
Your giving me a headache man you might aswell just clobber me
Blud lately I've been lonely, but you only fone me
When you want a favour then you wonder why I'm moany
Don't really ask much so I don't own much
Don't receive a lot of love, so I don't show much
But that little that I do I put it in a song for you
Handle your business cause I do, listen

[Chorus - 2X]
Sleep tight everything will be alright
By the end of the night, will be the day, just
Pray that you see, strong you got a be it
If you want to get through it, stretch your mind to the limit
You can do it",Do It
Dizzee Rascal,"Oi!
Ha ha ha ha ahaha ahahaha
Yea!

Stupid!

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat, Dizzee Rascal
I get on down rolling deep

I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're trying to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me
Fuck the glitz and glamor
Hit em with the Blitz and Hammer
Because they're talking bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing
Flushing MC's down the loo
If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate cos I ain't tryna be your mate
Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe
It's an Air Force One
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the ton
Don't be dazed when I catch you by your J's
Chump, best to act like Forest Gump, best to run

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat,
I get on down

I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana
When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana
You're not ready for this boy
You better send your best soldiers, this is Captain Roscoe
More destructive and troublesome than ever
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever
Fellas wanna stop me they'll probably come together
Its probable they'll stop me, probably never
Yo topboy, topman, or top a topper
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper
And a First Aid kit and some antiseptic, this could get hectic
I'm a don accept it, you gotta bright future
Don't let my gun affect it

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark

If I switch I won't act sensibly
I'll make you care intensively
You'll be in a coma for a week

And I really can't come to grips
With how these fellas act just like chicks
But now I retaliate with clips
And now I retaliate with force

You should come to grips
With how you really should watch your lips
You better know we're some lunatics
And that we retaliate, of course

Yo If that girl know's where you stay that's poor
some whore banging on your door what for
pregnant? what're you talking about this for
fifteen, she's underage that's raw
and against law 5 years or more
and she wants a score and half of a draw
some kind of friend that you try and ignore
that whore got you pinned down to the floor
but its your own fault you said three magic words (i love you)
when that's the one for the birds
when you said that she forgot other boys
its over you better start buying the toys
there was no intention in front of your wife
that she knows this that she's ending your life
its a real shame you got hacked by the whores
its a real shame that kid probably ain't yours

[CHORUS]

[Dizzee Rascal]
That girl' some bitch ya know
she keep calling my phone
she don't leave me alone
she just moan and groan
she just keep ringin me at home
these days I don't answer my phone

[Girl]

big feet for the force with my big toe
I got no chaps, no chains not much doe
get juiced but you don't get love though
don't slap or you might get a ho-hoe
jambo coming through like rambo
love ting takes two like tango
but she ain't my wifey she can go

[CHORUS]

[Dizzee Rascal]
listen, I like your girl so you better look after your girl
or I might just take your girl and make your girl my girl
switch your girl with michelle
switch michelle with chantelle
play chantelle with shennele
lyrical clientelle but I ain't a bow cat, I don't like the smell
I'm gonna go through a shell and make a boy feel unwell

that girl's from school, that girl's from college
that girl gives brains, that girl gives knowledge
that girl gives head, that girl gives shines
that girl gives bj's at all times
she looks decent, she looks fine
but don't talk about wifey she's not mine
she got batches, 6 in a line, believe me that's not a good sign

[CHORUS]",I Luv U
Dizzee Rascal,"Yo, look, look, look
They call her Jezebel
You might find her in your neigbourhood
Always in some shit
Up to no good
Constant boasting, bragging to her friends
Juiced every boy in the ends
Gettin' outta school
She would truant every day
Always on the link
Different boy every day
Missed mathematics, she was doing acrobatics
But not gym class
She was gettin' doggy fast

Yo, they call her Jezebel
Friends call her sket behind her back
She never knew the plot
She was born of track
Tight top, short skirt, thinks she's too nice
Hates love but she's been deep in twice
Pass with, ho's can't keep her legs closed
Always on the creep
Now she's in too deep
Now she faces neglect, abuse and rape
Man said that he'd kill her if she tried to escape

[Chorus]
What's your name?
I've seen you about
I think your tromp (Boom ting)
I really hope your not a grim
I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy
Where you from?
Hot stuff (Buff ting)
I really hope your not a grim
I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy
I've seen you around
I think your tromp (Boom ting)
I really hope your not a grim
I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy
I know your face
Where you from?
Hot stuff (Boom ting)
I really hope your not grim
I really hope your not a jezebel

You might find her at a house rave
For the fifth time
She's gettin' whammed from behind
Had a bit to drink
So she's acting kinda slow
She came with Natasha
But she's leavin with Joe
Ricky loves jezzy but jezzy loves willy
Ricky means well but Ricky ain't got a thing
Joe's got a name
And jezzy loves fame
She wants a man to show
So it's all about Joe

They call her jezebel
On her way to get wocked out
Get battery
And get kicked out
Jezzy weren't expecting more then four
But what could she say
She just did it anyway
Messed up, caught a kinda STD
Gonorrhoea, Herpes, No VD
Left bitter, left angry, left vexed
But still loves sex
Passed it on to the next

[Chorus]

Pretty but
Ain't got a brain
Got no shame
Got juiced on the train
Went from daddy's little girl
To daddy's heart attack
House reck a side
She could never go back
Raised in the church
Not knowing anything
Then, Learned about boys
Ruined everything

Aged 16
She was never full grown
She was in a family
Now she's got one of her own
Two kids
Even worse
Two little girls
Two more of her
That's two jezebel's
Two fatherless kids
One single mum
No longer young
But the boys still come
Yo, wishin' she could take it back to the old school
And make better choice's
Oh what a fool
Bottle by her side
She wonder man
If only she was six years younger
Damn",Jezebel

I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I just think
And my eyes don't move left or right they just blink
I think too deep, and I think too long
Plus I think I'm getting weak 'cause my thoughts are too strong
I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I just gaze
I'm looking in to space while my CD plays
I gaze quite a lot, in fact I gaze always
And if I blaze, then I just gaze always my days

'Cause it's the same old story, shutters, runners, cats and money stacks
And it's the same old story, ninja bikes, gun fights and scary nights
And it's the same old story, window tints and gloves for finger prints
Yeah it's the same old story, police investigate around the area
'Cause it was only yesterday we was playing football in the streets
It was only yesterday none of us could ever come to harm
It was only yesterday life was a touch more sweet

It's funny 'cause I haven't bust a smile for a while
I'll smile for a minute, and I'm smiling for an hour
I'm scared 'cause it's sweet, but it could turn sour

'Cause it's the same old story, chung intelligent yaps in hospie flats
And it's the same old story, benefit claims and cheques in false names
And it's the same old story, students truent, learn the streets fluent
Yeah it's the same old story, strange, there's no sign of positive change
'Cause it was only yesterday, we was standing firmly on our feet
It was only yesterday, girls were innocent they kept us calm
It was only yesterday, there was less bobbies on the beat
Now I'm sitting here thinking wagwan. (Wagwan, wagwan)

I'm just sitting here, I'm just sitting here, yo
I'm just sitting here, yeah I'm just sitting here, yeah

I'm just sitting here I ain't saying much I'm just vex (shame)
I seen a lot of bullshit, wondering what's next
I'm vex at humanity, vex at the earth
I keep getting vex, till I think what's the worth?
I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I feel to cry
I'm sitting here depressed and I don't know why
I try to pull myself together, tell myself fix up
And I keep myself from bawling but my eyes they erupt

'Cause it's the same old story, crazy boys keep getting on my nerves
And it's the same old story, police don't give me no peace
Yeah, it's the same old story, friends slowly drifting from the ends
Yeah, it's the same old story, I've sussed, there's nobody I can trust
'Cause it was only yesterday after school we'd come outside and meet
It was only yesterday, it was all love back then
It was only yesterday, every sunny day was a treat
Now I'm sitting here thinking wagwan. (wagwan wagwan)

Cruising' in the Porsche I want to to Bentley 
Evidently far from gently eatin' up da road 
We act immaturely in a hurry to be old
In fact we'll leave you poorly catch a beatin' like a cold
Go ahead profile and flex like you're big, bad and bold
Go ahead go round your next to get hit, had and showed 
Stay out the paper chase
Floppy fella's fold
Neglect da rules, expect da codes, follow the guide lines
Life's been ugly so far but these are fine times
I write below the belt I bust average fine rhymes
I always want to be a star my city or the sands
I try not to be stupid with my fame
But constantly I sense fassies bein' clever wiv my name
Indirectly call my name like they're callin' my bluff
So sadly I often sense the need to get rough.

Jack me and get what? Jack me and get where?
Get zilch times zero, times nofin' plus air!

Hate me or love me try not to stare 
Your thoughts and your opinions try not to share
I show interest on an occasion that is rare
Plus I ain't in the hype, I'm above it and I cause it
Can't put a stop to da track but I compose it
So play your role

Claims he's tight wiv mega man, cool with romeo cousin of kaish, 
Said he knows neeko breder hypes, said he had lunch at lethals place

I ask them to get out of my face,

He looks at my face, 
I look for a way to move him clear from out of my face 
But I leave him there

Pissed 'cause' it's one past business hours
And the clocked this number don't look local
This is why I don't answer the phone
Twenty missed calls in total,
Plus 8 voicemails and about 14 text messages
People can't take hints and messages,
And the message is leave me alone

People got a problem,
(act like) I can make (dubplates) for them,
So they can look (good and tell tales)

Can I get a little space or what?

All complaints aside because I appreciate my love
I know you feel the vibe,
I understand what it takes to swallow your pride
And give a boy ratings and (props)

What up man, what are ya this week?
He thinks he's rough, and he's always got a screw-face
He's stush and he thinks he's heavy
I've heard, I've heard it all man
Same thing, same shit
I can't believe it
I'm just being me
I work... I'm not doing 'cause I got the money or 'cause I'm famous
This is what I was, you get me?

[Dizzee Rascal]
You can say I'm too rude, you can say I think I'm heavy
You can say I think I'm all that, I've heard it all already
You can say I think I'm rough, you can say you can't wait
Till the day you meet me face to face and swear to set me straight
You can say I sideswipe, you can say I'm overrated
You can slag me off to every female I've ever dated
You can say I'm kinda meek, you can say I'm just a prick
Just say you what you want and what you will but say it quick

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
'cause I'm flyin, I ain't got time
You must makin moves, why you watchin mine?
You got so much to say about my grime
You must be UP THERE, I see you up there

[Dizzee Rascal]
You can I'm arrogant, you should probably say I'm vain
You can say my head swole since I see a little fame
You can say I left the hood, my success was a mistake
You can say I'm under pressure, you can say I'm bound to break
You can never say I'm fake, 'cause I always keep it real
You can say ""so wot?"" I can say ""so chill""
You can say I'm too cheeky, you can say I make you sick
Just say what you want and what you will but say it quick

Fellas acting bitchy lately quite unsurprisingly
They would love to cut my face but they just cock their eyes at me
Like little ladies would you wish you could express yourself
But violent silences from ya, stops ya so keep your feelings stealth
And wondering if I'm gonna laugh I'm saying don't worry
I weren't invited here, I ain't leavin in a hurry
So any preconceptions that you've got of me, forget them
Please don't let em, confuse you-- I'm gully
And rude, and blatant, no time, in a hurry, impatient
Don't make no more inquiries, fuck you is my only statement
The only answer I'm about to give you:
Fuck you and whoever came with you
Fuck them and anybody related, fuck if I get me frustrated
'cause I ain't the type to hype and rare
Hope I scare em, make 'em fear me
I'm pretty certain you're not near me
There's no need for that
I'm taking time, away from the ? and ? and grime serious grime
Leave the microphone alone, strap and spray some verses with the 9

moneys been around but its never been enough
most ain't givin no choice but to hussle
some break down when the going gets tough
deep in the manners all kinds of different people
mines over east still struggle to be equal
so many characters, 4 main types
the good, the bad, the ugly, and the evil
deep in the manner where the povertys visible

[Background] West London, South London
I'm the London hustler a golden grind, grind. Young hustlers we graft all the time dawn or dark
Non stop UK walk

Yo as a hustler in the city before I came to stack Lord knows I got the devil on ma back so call
When I gotta stay on track dog e god and I'll stay if you like in the LD and what I done to attract
Calm that I can show you where its at first things first get a block n a flat next up get a black
Hoodie n a hat livin' in the big brothers camera view givin' my axe to the boys in blue. straight 5
Years gettin' caught that's you, sittin' in the cell still wonderin' who don't keep quiet n keep it on
A diet ask you're self wot bout Steve *** not Stu. pissed off with not a lot to do and the word on the
Street don't ever seem new and resistin' arrest don't even seem true endless heart who do you believe
N will it ever relieve the lonliness lets see if you remain convinced on my you know what the
Streets are like a few more words a couple more rages other than that not a lot else changes

London city wish they graftin' 'cause were gritty
*hustle hustle hustle, hustle hustle hustle 'cause there means 
Sky looks green
London city wish they graftin 'cause were gritty

I used to roll your money up against the wall whenever I played hopscotch, well I'm clinical
Parkin' life 'cause I'm back in the white mans cotch I'm bein' doin' this since papa ? I don't want any
Boy in my face invadin' my space or bring on star and watch!
I'll end your hours on the clock I'll end your days you'll think I'm crazed when I give you big black
Clock end you're sentence...full stop.
Now what you gonna say about gats I kno you're platinum or not you're fought all you're rhymes on spot but
I'm probably everythin' that you're not. you're totally mad you've lost the plot do you even consider gettin'
Me gone carried off to a hospital like a shot ontop of a table ? I'll dictate n relagate who's

Dillan's on a hype now
I see you doin' quite alright
I see your video da other night
How did he get a record deal

Chattin' like he's super-real
I see you roam around market
On Saturday there you go
Better Dillan days standin' in da park

What's da word on da street
Did he really slap her?!?
Is true Wiley skipped da country left him?!?
Did he punch Mega in da face for tryin' to test him?!?

I know he won a mercury award and brought it back to da estate
I know some broad's in da manner hate and frequently debate
Da way he makes moves
How's he steppin' is he reppin'

'Cause dey know he goes to Hackney
And dey wonder what he's getting'
Plus I know he had dat Wall St. gat
Da other day I see him leavin' Natalie's flat

He used to work dat south girl
Da mouthy one
What's his name's cousin
Still I know a couple girls are on it

I could name a dozen
But he ain't no player
He be getting' all da gash
'Cause now dey know he's got a little

Cash and a stash
Dat will keep him looking' pretty for da future in a flash
But little do dey know he's only looking' for da lash
'Cause Dillan's on a hype now!

Got his face on his tee-shirt name on his trainers da edieah!!! 
He got a new era cap wit his logo 
My bredrin's saw him tryin' on tracksuits in soho
I'm buyin' jackets from Benenni in LA

I heard he went to broadway
Limo drive him through Queens 
Is he livin' out his dream is he ballin' be truthful
'Cause he ain't sittin' on da wall like he used to

He was on a far tip at one point
He used to peel on Volvo to take da flows to Bethal Green
Next thing I hear him on da pirate radio scene
He used to do deja writ an evil flavour

Bought records off target and mix an a-Dub
Then worked his way to A list
It's funny cause da older's used to dismiss
Dey never for a second anticipated this

Not guts no glory
Dillan took a risk took da piss now
Fella's want to act nigga
If I reminisce on days when Dillan weren't all so crystal

Dey know Dillan put da game on a twist and
Dillan's on a hype now!!!
Worldwide interviews and business trips
Invitations to premiers and new flicks

And all da chicks got his name on their lips

Dizzee Rascal,"Imagine if I showed you one day I was leaving the hood
Would you call me a sellout?  Would you say it's all good?
Would you follow if you could?
Or would you just tell me get the hell out?
And imagine if I showed you that I found another way
of getting dough without doing dirt-- let's blurt
Would you love me for giving me some hope
Or resent me 'cause your pride got hurt?
Imagine if we never grew up on a council estate
And was country manor raised with a spoon in our mouth
Would we still be making fuss about the East and the South
Would we shiver at the robberies, murder and the crack
And thank god that we didn't have to live like that
Just the image on the TV as we're comfortably sat
Sipping wine, room lit by the summer sunshine
Not a worry in the world as we casually chat
Oblivious to how we would be living on the flipside
No experience, not a clue about a rough ride
No harassment, no boy dem (?) on our backside
That would be *amazing*, still
I know you wonder would make you any less real?
What's the corresponding standing in (?), offering
If you had a better offer would you go for the kill?
Snap out of your daydream, how do you feel?
Does it all seem worthwhile for ya?
Try and put it in perspective
Retrospective of your profile and your honor
Do you want to hang about, or are you a goner?
Come along, think fast, decision time
You've been living in the grime, don't you want to climb?
The ladder of life, the wall of enlightenment
Or are you looking for the hype and excitement?
'cause with so much drama in the LDN
It's kind of hard to find legal money to spend
Generation genocide looks possible
The rate at which we draw for this game and pretend
But we don't know who the real enemy is
Who should be held responsible, instead we defend
A couple square meters of pavement, in the end
What will be achieved my friends?",Imagine
Dizzee Rascal,"[Chorus]
Knock knock who's there? Dizzee
Dizzee who? Ras
And I kick ass
Kill a MC fast
Knock knock who's there? Bad
Bad who? Boy
I'm here to annoy
Take away your joy
Knock knock who's there? Jack
Jack who? You
Your not with your crew
What you gunna do
Knock knock who's there? Big
Big who? Gun
Point me to the sun
Watch your fassy run
I'm dizzee ras nightmare from the big E A S T
I'm exactly what your parent don't want to see on your tv
I nicely, precisely intimadate anyone that I choose
Refuse to to lose
Express unlimited contriversial views
Your average boy or girl on the street might be familiar with my beat
And/or familiar with my sound, I'm formerly from the underground
And its clear, for a year, I've been turing up the heat
Made you get up and out of your seat
Shake your fists and shuffle your feet
And now I'm here
Lets make another thing clear [Overlaps here on previous line]
They didn't bun me up enough I'm still here
So what was the perpose of your little charade, your little charade was whack
Just about hurt me
You should of merked me
I was on a rampage now I'm back
Five stab wounds
Couple scratches, bruises and some pains
Four half-hearted fassies
Four poor is no brains
Did it
Two weeks before my album came out helped me sell double
But lets not dwell on that, its the least of your troubles
[Chorus]
Eh yo considering
The part I play, you wouldn't expect for me me to say I prefer the day to nights where I gotta
turn up and play
I rip-off, dusty, sweaty, clotter raised
And the audience, all screw faced, and promoters don't want to pay
And half of the boys in the croud want to blast me
And half of the girls want to show how little they care about standing right there at the front,
tryin t? look right past me
It gets depressing thinking bout it even more
Knowing that I'm gonna face the usual hassle at the door
Because as well as lippy hags, I hate cocky bouncers
I ain't here to rave I'm here to get paid look
You search me up rough like I'm any common crook
My names on the flyer man, forget the guest book
Abusing your athority you look like a fool
You faulty standard, underdog, you know your own tool
I ain't wearin certain shoes so you don't think I look right (what?)
that's cushdy mate, I'm gettin paid more than you tonight

Yeah who the fuck are you 
Is it recordin' yeh? 

I come direct when I inject and I'm expecting your respect 
I'm a baller you've been chucked I'm the kind of kid you can't protect ya know 
Out n about I put my elbow in your mouth 
You're a fassy there's no doubt 
I bet my sword will make you shout 
I'm intense you best see sense I'll have you hangin' from a fence 
Then I'll laugh at your expense and maybe chuck you 50 pence 
Snitch you make me switch you sound and look just like a bitch 
Whether you're poor or whether you're rich I'll leave you lyin' in the ditch 
Cause I'm from ragged raggo rags you wear raggo rags like me 
I'm ahead boy I ain't in tune rappin' raggo rapidly 
We easily be the worst bust academics first 
Batty crew m.c's get academically reversed 
I'm academically perverse 
Academically perverted 
Batty crew mc's get academically diverted 
Some return 
We clearly get burnt get hurt, until they realize they should academically of flirted 

You don't want the beef you don't want the grime 
You ain't got the guts I ain't got the time 
But you can come to the man and get jacked 
Come to the man n get pill 
Come to the man n get shot 
Come to the man n get killed

If you can't back that armsouse who the fuck are you 
We call it armsouse, armsouse go n get your firm

Raised in the gutter I was told I should fight 
I create and cause confusion from the left to the right 
I'm sweet as a nut, I'm doin' alright, cosy n comfortable 
Still I try n avoid the sergeant, p.c and the constable 
Raised in the gutter I was told I should bop 
I create and cause confusion from the bottom to the top 
I doin' o.k, I will honestly say this year I'm flyin' through 
I could easily find myself in jail but I ain't tryin' to 
I keep it clear in front, relax wid the pressure, 
I'm dirty, and I'm stank but ain't nobody fresher 
My haters make enquiries, make it obvious they care 
When it comes to my location they would love to be aware 
But I could be in the manor, could be overseas, could well be definiteley making peace 
Could be live at Wembley warmin' up for jay-z 
Still I'm definitely certain that you can't see me 

You don't want the beef you don't want the grime 
You ain't got the guts I ain't got the time 
But you can come to the man and get jakked 
Come to the man n get pill 
Come to the man n get shot 
Come to the man n get killed

Dizzee Rascal,"we grew up in the ghetto where summertimes short
straight action, you don't stop for a fool
most use crime as a way to pay the bills
the un-lucky ones end up gettin caught
we grew up in the ghetto where the growing gets rough
moneys been around but its never been enough
most ain't givin no choice but to hussle
some break down when the going gets tough
deep in the manners all kinds of different people
mines over east still struggle to be equal
so many characters, 4 main types
the good, the bad, the ugly, and the evil
deep in the manner where the povertys visible
there's not a lot sweet so most look misarable
most cave in to the devil, took the wrong puff
son kick the face but still pray for a miracle
soccastars emerge from the curb
up n coming mcs struggle to be heard
boy.... the next jailbird ??
*censored*s talk murder and they live by there word
shotters keep the money going round
kids goin stray most never get found
iv noticed there a ghetto in every town
the skies are empty because the stars are on the ground

(chorus)

we grew up in the ghetto saw real life pain
real life struggle with real life strain
real life kiddies with real life guns
and real life mothers lose real life sons
gang wars are ruftin on the darf flur on the seeser ??
beef after beef just to be the top geezer
big arms gas, the stratford recs
ghetto high murders gotta maintain reps
what's it all about i ask myself before i swing
more time I'm beefin over any little thing
beefin any area,region or vincity
my ghetto frame of mind makes me prone to hostility

Yeah, one two, yeah, yeah, clear, clear, yeah.

I'm a young ragga brother from the LDN, 
In my Nike air bubbles and they cost one ten.
Got these beanies on ma lap, and they all want the length, 
I'm a ghetto superstar, come straight from the ends.
An I walk it like I talk it, brother ain't just hype, 
Makin' moves for the money everyday an every night.
Best to believe I keep it tight, best to believe I'm movin' right, 
Keep my business on the low, you best to believe I'm outta sight
I like money money money, girls girls, cash cash, 
I'll let the champagne splash.
Yo, I'm not a gang banger but I'm good with a mash, 
Make you scratch your head an wonder is he really that flash
But it really doesn't matter 'cause you know I keep it movin, 
Middle of the dance floor, lean, I'm grooving.
Baby cocked her bumper out, you know I gotta wind it, 
When we leave the club I'm really gonna get behind it.

Nike air bubbles on my feet, lookin' fresh, 
Got my brand new garms on, dress to impress.
Got my phone line poppin, all these beanies gotta crush, 
Keep something in my pocket case these fellas try an rush.

Brown eyes, five ten, dark skin, Mr Dizzee rascal, why you even askin'.
Under cover lover, girls call me buff ting, but, 
Used to keep a balaclava restin' on my chin.
An it's the ends here, hustle hustle, bling bing, blow it in, 
About to hear the fat lady sing.
Don't matter what I'm sayin, it's the answer within, but, 
Life's a jungle, everybody wants to be the king.
But it's alright though, I got my eyes on the prize,
Money in my draw, bigger picture in my eyes.
Hands around my testicles, little finger risen,
Every step that I take is a step with precision.
I'm precise, precisely why my future's lookin' nice, 
The penthouse is lovely, it's a shame about the price.
But you only live twice, that's on the real, 
No matter where I am I'll always be the real deal.

[Chorus]

Education starts with discipline, I'm listenin', 
But conversations kinda muffled since I got rich and tings.
Double turn, indirectly spoke, I never heard a thing, 
Under ground or overground, what's the difference I'm the king.
Learnt devine right, its my heinsight. 
I see it all, 'cause I ain't that fake to spread my wings an fly, you're a fool.
Talkin' like you're mighty and you're high, 
But I know you're small, there's no logic in your gossip, 
Just the writings on the wall.
Over ignorant, you ain't got it, you just play far,
Far from the realist old dog, menace, you're a mark.
If you're deep, why you gotta roll fifty to the club, 
Blood, who d'you think your foolin' with that fake crew love.
The streets don't cater for no long term plan, 
These roads don't give a damn about any man.
I try an show these brothers, they refuse to understand, 
So I'll just keep doin' what I'm doin' while I can.

Dizzee Rascal,"Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Can somebody tell me what this world's about?
Can somebody tell me what this life's about?
I just can't work it out

No sense, no logic, I can't get a grip of it
I do my best to understand it but I've never got it
I watch the people slug it out and struggle in the system
But the end result's the same, whether a Muslim or a Christian

There's so much hate in the world we're fightin'
What are we fightin' for?
When the rich keep gettin' richer
And the poor keep gettin' ignored, Lord

Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

I took it there and now it's time to take it further
If a policeman kills somebody, is that policeman still a murderer?
He's got a worthy cause, I guess that gives him some immunity
Or is he just another lost soul in the community

To take a life's a serious thing and only God can judge it
Would He look at it, like it's for the safety of the public
And if you don't wanna pay the price, you really shouldn't thug it
I know I'm playin' with fire but fuck it, I love it
'Cause

Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Fuck it, ya get me?
I don't give no sh
Is it me? It must, it must just be me
You know, know what I mean?
There's no point even goin' through it, man
It is the fuck what it is, I guess
You know what I mean? Fuck it

Who's in charge of this stupid place?
I wanna punch his stupid face
Yeah, it ain't right but it's a shame
Gotta be someone I can blame

Someone's gotta have answers
Someone's written a master plan
'Cause I can't see no sign of God's involvement
This has gotta be man

So much madness in the world
So much evil and confusion
But there's so much good as well
So there's got to be some solution

So that means there must be hope
Maybe room for revolution
So that means there must be hope

Dizzee Rascal,"Summer in the city
Such a very special time
If you put aside the traffic
Air pollution and the grime

You be pleased to be reminded
That the girls are looking fine
And apart from money
That's the only thing that's on my mind

Short skirts, belly tops, fake tan
String vests with the bra underneath
So the man's getting hard off
Of half of a glimpse

I got plans to be scooping up
A couple buff tings if I can
If I can't then I'm still live
I go and check
My little yappy by the seaside

Cause I know she's live
Plus she's a dealer
She gives me hospitality
She treats me right
That's what I need right?

And if not, then I'm on
A little mission to Los Angeles
To check my Beverly Hill honey
To see I she can handle this

Pimping ain't no easy thing
And some of these chicks are scandalous
But I'm a player and I say
I gotta be the man for this, I love you

I don't believe in fate
Life is what you make it
Make it great, I'm tryna elevate
Concentrate on getting
My papers straight

Survive the great escape
From the ends I use to congregate
Until I could no longer wait
I had to find the bruvas

Otherwise I would have been worthless
Making fast on the estate
Ignorant to what the earth is offering
When I should take

Every chance and every opportunity
To try and make
Every second and every breath
Of life something to celebrate

So I been around the world now
Close to the occasional boast
Different folks, different strokes
Black, white and asian

All these ladies look incredible
Still got me gazing
Riding jet skies, on power boats
Feel so amazing

Club popping in Ibiza
I got Pacha on lock
Pull up right outside the entrance
In the Hummer, people glare

Then they stop, stare and wonder
Who I am and who I'm not
I just take it in my stride
But I ain't never felt this hot and I love you",Da Feelin'

Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

First up, it's important that you keep your shit original
Try and keep that copycat shit to a minimal
People want somethin? that they never heard before
If it's been done, leave it, they don't wanna hear no more

Secondly, here's another clever thing that you can do
Find yourself a good manager who's really got a clue
'Cause there's so many to choose from, they all look the part
But it's difficult to come across the ones that's really smart

And can stand firm and steady when the label's talkin? shit
Will respect, it keeps it gangsta but does everything legit
And dependable, you can trust to handle your biz
And can really make you sure of what the situation is

Next up, find a record label that ain't full of pricks
One that let's you breathe artistically but makes you come with hits
Congratulations now you've got your deal, you're set to go
Lemme fill you in on just a couple things you need to know

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

Next up, change your number
Change your phone and change your chip
'Cause there's gonna be a lot of people ringin?, talkin? shit
Whether bredrens wantin? money 'cause now suddenly you're rich
Or some dumb hatin? fassies tryin? to take you for a bitch

Yeah, I know it's minor and you can handle it, it's nothin?
But eventually you're really gonna wanna do somethin?
And that's counter-productive, beefin? over bullshit
You can never stop them dumb bredrens tryin? to bullshit

Plus you're in the limelight, well-paid verbalist
Which leads me onto my next subject, journalists
These are the people that could put your name about
So be careful what you're sayin? when you're talkin? out your mouth

And avoid bein? ignorant, tone down the thug-shit
Come to interviews buzzin?, tone down the drug shit
Keep your eye on the ball, mind on the job
And before you know you'll have the whole world on your knob

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

Here's somethin? that I shoulda stressed early on
Don't go spendin? all your money till it's gone
'Cause the taxman's gonna want his paper when it's due
And there's nobody above the taxman especially you

And another thing, buy your house before you buy your car
Don't tell no one where you are, even better if you're far
Everybody knows you're gangsta and that Porsche looks great
But do you really want it sittin? on that council estate?

Differently, watch where you choose to socialize
Keep an eye out for trouble, watch for devils in disguise
And please don't be fooled by no pretty females
Play it safe, never let 'em know your full details

I ain't sayin? be para', I'm just sayin? be sure
You can never know if that bitch will be braggin? what she saw
And aside from makin? money, keep lovin? what you do
I ain't saying nothin? more because the rest is up to you

I got a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?

Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

They wanna rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

Sometimes when I'm on my own
And there ain't no one around I feel all alone
Laying in my bed I'm a nervous wreck
And I wind myself up until I'm vexed

Keep telling myself they're out to get me
And I ain't sure who, so I make it up
Come to my own conclusions, I'm crazy
Start thinking up all kinds of stuff

Like, fuck my girl, I know she cheating
That gold-digger bitch just thieving
Act like I don't care but I'm grieving
Start switching up for no reason

Told myself I ain't got no friends
Fuck my people, fuck my ends
No rational fool, I'm low
I'm paranoid, all I know is they wanna

Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

They wanna rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

And then I think about beef
Over the years I've had so much grief
Whole lot of drama in and out of East
Won't let anyone take me for a chief

And mans say they got my back
But it's really all just chat
?Cause when it all gets on top
They leave me alone to scrap

And I went to the ends, heard whispers
Old friends chatting ?bout kidnapping
Now, they hurt my pride and ego
I don't care about rap, I'm strapping

But the olders told me, ignore it
?Cause I really ain't got time for it
And the ghetto, I already saw it
I'm in the world now, I gotta explore it
I can't let 'em

Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

They wanna rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

No guts, no glory, no get, no gain
No love, no pain, I'm going insane
It's all too much for the brain
I'm so paranoid, I feel strange

And it's so long-range
Been too long, I gotta make some change
Fuck the world, I'd rather take some blame
Or I could just buy a platinum chain

Diamond rings and other shiny things
Maybe the bling'll help me maintain
Or at least that it help to explain
What's my path, am I in the right lane?

Why I feel so left out in the rain?
Why's it hard, it should be simple and plain
All I see when I'm in this game
Everybody wanna

Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

They wanna rinse me out, use me up

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole

He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole

That's that bredder always frontin' like he's strong
Sneaky fake fuck always runnin' to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swingin'
First one runnin', makin' up stories, he's a chief

Bringin' bredders to the ends, actin' up
Puttin' on a show, tryin' talk funny to his friends
But he's really not a don, they know it
And you know it, so something must be seriously wrong

'Cause you're parrin', his mum calls you darlin'
But his brother has got you shottin' with no way of stoppin'
I heard you both had beef with an older brer
You took a spark and he just stood there

It started because of him and ended with you

But naturally it's gotta make room for the moon every night
Everything's got its time limit, even relationships
Everything's sunny when the friendship's tight

A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Can flip the script at a ridiculous speed
And make a best friend an ex-friend for the P

A couple of years ago in my road youth days
I was into pirate radio, I guess it was a phase
There was this one particular MC man
Was a older in my ends and I thought he was the don

So I started rollin' with him kind of like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think that it was nothin' more than jealousy
But I wish I would've listened every time he told me

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole

He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole

Pussy'ole, pussy'ole
Pussy'ole, pussy'ole

Stay away from them pussy'oles, you can have it all
Live endlessly, tremendous, forever ball
Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall
But differently, know when not to lose your cool

'Cause it ain't what you show, it's what you're concealin'
Put a smile on the deepest negative feelin'

Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin'
Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin'
Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin'
Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin'

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?

So in control, I'm chill

So I stay top on the bill

Can I keep it up? I guess it all depends

The one you can never bring yourself to hate

Can't avoid the temptation

And a whole lot more that I gotta get with
So I gotta stay and roam on my own
Gotta move on, I can't stay at home

Reckless youngsters, no direction
No sign of correction
But then I switched it up, changed my ways
Got in the area like, ""Oh my days""
But not my naughty friends, they're not fazed
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things that we've always done

Cause I really was a poor little negro
Don't need no chain or a throwback

So you might as well quit

Dizzee:
I'm moving,
Couldnt be losing
Nothing but a success
Thing I'm proving, nothing
To you half heart wasters
Standing there yap yap yapping on cruising
Nobodys dictates so I'm choosing
Where I go what I do with my life stupid
And I hold I'm own I'm [raskit]
You better watch your tone you spastic
Low it, your not heartless
Nothing but a lot of hot air your harmless
I keep getting my paper regardless
You words don't phase me I'm marvelous
Age 22 zero tolerance
And I ain't got no time for the nonsense
You wanna see me come to my concerts
Or we can do it on stage with an audience

Lily:
So you wanna be a gangster
Tell me just one thing [tell me just one thing]
What you know about being a hardman
You mum buys your bling [what!]

your pockets getting bigger 
But you couldn't pull the trigger
If you need to [no]
'cause you haven't got it [no]
So you might as well quit [ha ha ha]

Dizzee:
Beef, straps, cuts, glory
All these high bredders in the club bore me
I wish when I come through they ignore me
I really can't deal with another war story
Bredders in my face with a fist full of paper
Trying to make out they'e a big money maker
Talking all loud (but I know man I'ma hustler)
I ain't got time rude boi's see you later
And I can't forget these groupies following
Fronting, raving, ranting, hollerin
Yeah I know I shouldn't be complaining
But these jezebel do my brain in

Lily:
I ain't no groupie, who you calling jezebel?
Don't chat to me like I'm just any girl.
[nah, security somebody move her]
I don't wanna talk to you anyway loser!

Dizzee:
Let me wrap it up while I still got time
Ain't nobody telling me about no grime
'cause I know where I stand whether I'm fine
Handle your biz, I'm handling mine
Everybody chattin bout black on black crime
All I see is the blind leading the blind
I wanna leave all the pettiness behind
You don't really wanna see me cross dat line
Leave me alone or you'll be sorry
Beef ain't nothing new to me you wolly
Why don't you just kick back be jolly
Stay at home with a cuppa tea watch corrie
I'm not listening anyway man
Who rattled your cage anyway man
Ain't no slacking with this young man
Do what I gotta do everyday fam

Dizzee Rascal,"[Verse 1: Dizze Rascal]
Liar liar, pants on fire, you're not gangsta, you're not street
You just make yourself sound gangsta when you're rapping on the beat
You ain't got yourself in no life-threatening situations yet
You're no dealer, you're not balling, you just get yourself in debt
You're a fan of hip hop, wanking when you hear them rappers talk
Love to sit and listen but we know that you don't walk the walk
What's with all the fake aggression, I can see that it's not true
I know killers, I know gangsters, and they never heard of you
You ain't robbed nobody, shanked nobody, you ain't bust no gun
You ain't seen no ghetto action, who do you think you fooling, son?
You should pull your trousers up, you know it ain't your type of look
You're no playa, you're no pimp, I think that you should read a book
And seckle, find yourself a pretty girl and settle
You know that if it's on that you ain't drawing for no metal
I know them rap songs got you thinking you're some kind of g
Well if that's the case, then que sara and what will be will be

[Chorus]
Where's the G's? Where's the stars?
Where's the whips? Where's the cars?
Where's that cribs? And where's the yards?
Cause all I see is hype
Where's the dough? Where's the cash?
Where's the hoes? Where's the gash?
Where's the blicks? And where's the mash?
Cause all I see is hype
Too many moots on the TV
How many real crooks on the TV?
All I hear is dead hooks on the TV
Being real these days ain't easy
Too many moots on the TV
How many real crooks on the TV?
All I see is bare poop on the TV
Being real these days ain't easy

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well it's big Bun be and I'm back again, talking that shit on the track again
Too many motherfuckers be lying about selling, buying and trafficking
I'm like really though what's happening, you boys talk about that crack again?
Cause we don't believe you, need more people, y'all might as well just pack it in
Show me the paper you're stacking in, show me the blocks you got on hold
Show me your workers, show me your shooters, lemme see the neighborhood you control
Lemme see if you a boss, and if motherfuckers is scared of you
And if somebody trying to take your shit, let me see what you prepared to do
Are you ready to go to war? Are you ready to shoot to kill?
Are you really gon' man-up or bitch-up? Just tell the truth for real
Are you ready to take a life, walk up to 'em and squeeze the trigger
I don't think so cause you ain't built like that, so just be easy, nigga
Cause you know you ain't 'bout no drama and you know that you really don't want it
So stay the fuck out of the way when them trill-ass niggas is on it
Dizzee Ras and UGK, you know we stay connected
Trill recognize trill, so just respect it and check it
And tell me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Where the Benz and where the hoes?
Candy niggas with candy clothes
Where the cocaine? Where the o's?
Where the SoundScan, where the shows?
You's a pimp, bitch, where the track?
Where the diamonds and where the Lac
You say that you that you in hot pursuit
But I ain't never seen you with a prostitute
I got everything I say
Don't believe me, ask Lil' J
On the West ask Ice-T
Fuck good but my dick ain't free
So hood I used to whip the d
Patron and wood when I'm in the be
Sweet Jones, Tony Snow, Percy Mack, Pimp see
Bitch, I got a bunch of names
Getting head in the H.O.V. lane
Getting red, I let my nuts hang
Wear a lot of red but it ain't no gang
Chased by the feds but it ain't no thang
I guess they think I still sell cocaine
Ninety two carrots in my chain
Jumping out a red-candy thing
Never snitch, never tell, get caught up, go back to jail
Before I tell them hoes shit, fuck the law, they can eat my dick
The main niggas that pop the trunk
Go to the pen and get with them punks
Then come home trying to act tough
When they was up there getting fucked in the butt

Back in da day we both thort we'd never split past
Didn't see no definite endin to da madness n da lust
Never thort id be packin n jackin for somethin more solid
I ain't changed I just found a better way to steal ma knowledge
Runnin around hyper criminal had me locked for a while
Da studio gave me a lot, more creative style
Took me to another world beyond dat e-state
Some kind of haven from da beef n some of da stress mate
I wouldn't call it no escape, da roads are in ma heart
Makin it dat more difficult for me to climb da chart
But its da sacrifice I make, its all good star
Same reason I ain't always in da hood star
I do ma thing uno I'm graftin like I always woz
It just ain't quite like it woz, simply coz

there's a world outside of tha manor n I want you to see it

I'm gonna stay red blooded til I expire
Not caught up in da hype, I'm caught up in da scheme of things
Seen a couple figures but I still dream of things
Like da kinda shit money can't connect me wiv
Unconditional love I won't regret to give
I'm young, black, rich an ruthless I swear star
Still if you need a helpin hand you know I'm there star
I'm from da street, you're from da street, we all done dirt
Now its time to flip da script, fuck da sufferin n da hurt
Coz I've seen da bigger picture, its all good

'Nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness
'Nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama
'Nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter, cause I'm still here

[ Verse 1 ]
D-the-I-the-zz-the-e-the-e, straight from the LDN
I don't wanna hear no talk about streets and all that thug from way back when
Been a bad boy, I'll destroy your joy, gotta toy that'll put that shit to a end
That and I walk the walk cause I talk the talk, you got a problem, step to me then
Otherwise don't pretend, stop, breathe, count to ten
Keep on chatting or get the leng
I stand up tall, I don't bend
So if you got a crew, go get your men
We can meet up, say where and when
I'll be on time like Big Ben
Couldn't ever take me for a speng
And I ain't saying it again

[Hook]

[ Verse 2 ]
I like to move it, move it
You want beef prove it
You got a problem, don't excuse it
You got a 9mm, it's your prerogative, use it
You got a temper, lose it
If not just bounce to the music
That's a better choice anyway, choose it
Cause you know that you can't refuse it
Watch the beat, how I bruise it
Wild out and nod your head, stupid
I ain't cupid, no love lost
I get paid in the end whatever the cost
I'm the boss, still work with me
Don't stand looking pretty like Kate Moss
Put your hands up like you couldn't give a toss
Either way you know I'm gonna get my point across

[Hook]

Get me? 
I'm still fucking here
I don't give a shit
I don't answer to none of you pussyholes
I live my fucking life, yeah
I live my fucking life 
Fuck you

(Oi rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?)
These pussyholes don't want no war
They are just acting, I've seen it before
They are just acting, I've seen it before
(Rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?)
These pussyholes don't want no war
They are just acting, I've seen it before
They are just acting, I've seen it before

[ Verse 3 ]
Finally, fuck who's listening
The world don't owe me shit and the feeling's mutual
I just wanna be neutral but I ain't no prick
So no, I don't smile when I see you, grin when I greet you
If it weren't business I'd beat you
And I'd rather be a asshole than a pussyhole
You're a bitch and I see through
So fuck you and fuck your ego
Cause I really was a poor little negro
Don't need no chain or a throwback
I'm really from the streets and you know that
But I really would rather be touring
Cause most players on the roads ain't scoring
But now it's Maths & English, I'm focused
And it's Dirtee Stank, so take notice

Blud, when you hear the sirens coming
I can hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
I can hear the sirens coming

One to da two to da three to da four
Line my street, knocking at my door
Twelve black boots on my bedroom floor
What they want with rascal I'm not sure
Took me to the station 8:30
For a fight that I had recently
Say they got me on CCTV
And the black boys told on me
Can't understand why these boys keep snitching
Can't understand why these boys keep bitching
Now I'm hot tempered feel like switching
Can't stand still trigger finger itching
Gotta stay calm, gotta keep my cool
If I go down I'll be a dam fool
Gotta rise up, gotta stand up tall
Can't let em see the end of Dizzee Rascal

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Yo, let's take it back to that old school story telling shit
Get me!
One day I was with my bredwin 'A dot' roaming the streets
On the main road hungry looking for something to eat
Not no burger and no chips that's easily digested
That shit that if your caught, you'll be easing arrested
We was on the robin street I forgot to mention Kate
There was this Breda rolling with us he was scared it was blait,
And he was high
But, back to the story 'A dot' spotted the man
Straight ahead of us in the distance with his wifey holding hands
So we followed him through this little alleyway into the flats
And we thought the time was perfect so we crept up and we attacked
I took the first swing unexpected causing panic
We was ruthless causing agony in public it was tragic
Me and 'A dot' lost the plot, acting like we were from hell
Beat this Breda to the floor beat his wifey up as well
Clayton stood back shaking, wishing that he never came
When from out of nowhere there was Alisha screaming my name
She went my school
She saw it all

To make it worse I'm hearing sirens, I ain't even trying handle

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I can hear the sirens coming [Repeat x2]

I break the law; I will never change [Repeat x3]
Step into my soul get your whole face rearranged

See me on the tele but I ain't no actor
Running through the streets brave face it's a jack one
Real day light no shame like a lunatic
Rain, hell, sleet or snow I ain't new to it
Show me what you got betta give it up quickly
Lay them on their back if they try and fight swiftly
Better mind out when they come through the manner man
Keep em on their toes like hammer man
It's no joke man woman and child I'm seeking
See no skets no age I'm creeping
Anything through the door cold on the wheelers
Duck from the feds and I roll with the Dealers
Smile with your heart and stand on a senteence,
My last day wasn't like Eastenders
Step into my soul get your whole face rearranged
I break the law I will never change",Sirens

Got a benz on tik that they ain't paid yet

Got no money by the end of the weekend
But they don't care cause their life is a movie

Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks
Can't keep up with the cover girls
So they got bad credit livin' on day rate
Livin' in debt when they still don't get

We can do what you want to, baby

Don't watch my passport photo, I know I look a bit loco
And I know that my Spanish is so-so
But let's try keep that on the low-low
'Cause we're going to be far
I've got friends that really wanna meet ya
With champagne and a whole lot of love
It's all good darling, a Blue Marlin will please ya
And I'll never let your belly get empty
Even when your belly full you're still sexy
We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis
I'll show you the time of your life if you let me
I just want to put a smile on your pretty face
If I didn't it would just be your pretty waste
You do look like a girl with a bit of taste
So I couldn't take you just any place

If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby

I know you're really busy and I know you got plans
But are you really too busy for a sun tan?
I ain't talking about walking down the high street
I'm talking about laying on a bright white beach
With a Pina Colada or whatever you'd rather
White wine, that's fine, just give me a lager
Then after we'll take a truck to the night spot
The hot spot, the top spot, party around the clock
And when we get there it's strictly VIP
No need for ID, security know me
No waiting in line, no high entry fee
Don't worry about nothing when you're beside me
I'll get you lively and loosen you up
Have a bit of champagne it'll boost you up
I wanna move you up, I wanna take you away
So have a word darling, what do you say?

If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby

Do what you want to baby
Let's do what you want to babe",Holiday
Dizzee Rascal,"Today's the greatest day of my life 
Today they're gonna know I'm a star 
They better know I ain't having a bar 
I'm gonna take it to the next level foot on the pedal 
I'm goin' for the gold medal got my hand on my heart 
And I swear down I'm gonna go hard 
Until I'm dearly departed, I'm so excited 
I think it's bout time I had a little celebration and you're all invited 
I couldn't give a damn not even the slightest 
My swags on point and my flows the tightest 
I'll never sell my soul god helped me write this 
Plus I know what a fight is 
I been through the struggle 
In and out of trouble 
Couple of close calls 
But you can't hear the pain anymore in my vocals 
It ain't even because of the pro tools 
In total I feel so complete with life its sweet 
You gotta scream 

Scream it from your heart 
Feel it from your soul 
Scream it from your heart, if you mean it 
Feel it from your heart 
Scream it from your soul 
Feel it from your heart, if you need it 

I feel like rocky on the steps 
I coulda drowned in the blood and the sweat 
But instead I show the world I don't pet 
A world wide athletic champion on deck 
Nobody can't mess with my rep 
Nah I'm a seasoned vet 
And I'm the best I'm as good as it gets 
I'm the champion now 
So I don't care who they call next 
I've earned my respect 
Now they're loving the way I flex 
Run up in the offices they're writing a major check
So it doesn't matter about the butterflies in my solar plex 
Never the nervous wreck, cool and calm 
Keep sharp and focused and stay out of harm 
Plus I can't be rocked 
You know I'm far too hot to be given the drop 
Stay better then I'm never gonna give up the top spot 
I'm keeping the spot locked 
I'm throwing the keys now everybody sing with me, scream 

Scream it from your heart 
Feel it from your soul 
Scream it from your heart 
If you mean it (scream) 
Feel it from your heart 
Scream it from your soul 
Feel it from your heart 
If you need it, ha ha ah, ha ha ah

Boy it's lonely at the top 
But it's overcrowded at the bottom 
And where I come from's overly rotten 
I'm from the east side I ain't forgotten 
But it's bigger than that 
World wide peoples livin' is wack 
It's bigger than grime and bigger than rap 
People living in crap 
No fresh water out of the tap 
Plus they're being attacked what kinda living is that 
Look anywhere in the map 
Too many young boys stuck in the trap 
Too many young boys running round strapped, ready to clap 
Too many young girls fall in the gap 
They're fallin' for chat from dumb cats that need to fall back 
Think about life cause there ain't no re run 
No DVD no second season 
When you're the future flame maybe you could be one 
Till then let chorus be sung, scream",Scream
Dizzee Rascal,"[Chorus]
All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season

160, blink and miss me
Super nifty, riding swiftly
Rolling through the sticks
Leather extra crispy, effortlessly
Power steering, accurately, ready for action, actually
Mellow, relaxed and cocking my snapback
Not taking no God damn back chat
Just racking up fat stacks
No ring, no chain, no fat chaps
Can't get no sleep, no cat naps
And everybody wanna be on my black sack
But I don't slack
You don't really wanna see me get abstract
I'll switch up the place like have that
Don't care about none of that rap crap
Steer clear of the rat trap
Some say that I lack tact
But I'm on the map
And I'm setting the pace, I'm on track
So get out my face, I'm on slapping
I'm on scrapping, so stop yapping, what's crackalacking?
Don't follow fashion, just keeping it G
With these hoes, macking, and that's what's happening
What?
That's what's happening

[Chorus]

God bless me, nobody can't test me
Everyday life can't stress me, stay on the ball like Messi
Money and women are the only things that impress me
I stay fly and sexy
Life is a game of chess, and all the girls wanna check me
How much do you wanna bet me, that I never ever let a female sweat me?
Get me
I ain't gotta talk no more, cause soon as I walk in the door everybody stops doing what they're doing, don't know what they're pausing for, don't know what they're gawping for
Bad boy from the LDN, what the world's been calling for, been balling for
And your girl gets wet, stays up in the morning for
Don't know what you're stalling for
Get with the programme, I got the flow and I've got the dough and money to blow
And, this ain't a slow jam, ready to rock and I'm ready to roll, I'm gripping at the Trojan
Never gonna get caught slipping, never gonna get caught tripping
Never too soft on the women
If it ever gets too hot in the kitchen, I'm dipping, I ain't gonna stand there dripping, I'm missing

[Chorus]

International, flex and go
When I'm at home, I stay low
Yo, lay in the cut, they can't see me bro
And I'm living it up, they can't be me though
Get on the mic, I get easy dough
When I'm cutting the cheques, cause I'm C.E.O.
Keep on fronting, like you don't know
I stay repping the Manor, and that's E3, Bow
Stay with a brownin', get around the town, you better hold it down
I'll leave you breathing slow
Overstand, cause I ain't even clowning, I'll leave you drowning from head to toe
Wet, why you trying to put me in check?
I play for keeps, you better know I don't pet
Knock your head off your shoulders, no sweat, watch your step

[Chorus]",I Don't Need A Reason
Dizzee Rascal,"Yo, I had a hell of a night
I was out of my mind
Turned up I was high as a kite
A jolly fellow
I was showing my bright whites
And getting trippy under the strobe lights
I'm loving the nightlife
And getting jiggy keeping the vibe right
Setting my mind a light
Getting the party hype
Pretty little thing in my eyesight,
She's my type
Something's telling me
She ain't uptight
She's giving me the eyes like
What are you waiting for
I'm looking at her back like
Cool say no more
I save my jaw but I ain't playing
Are you fucking me?
I'm saying it raw
She didn't take no offence
I was straight in the door
I guess I hit her with an offer
That she couldn't ignore
It all happened so fast
Like I met her before
But I was so damn high
How could I be sure
Now we're in my hotel room taking a tour

Let's get into something really bad
Love me baby love me love me bad
I love it when the good girls act so bad
I love it when the bad girls do it like that
Let's get into something really bad
Love me baby love me love me bad
I love it when the good girls act so bad
I love it when the bad girls do it, do it, like, like that

Get freaky, let's get freaky
Get freaky, let's get freaky

Now it's totally on
Pour a couple more drinks
Put some Jodeci on
Put a towel under the door
And put the privacy on
We're stinking up the whole place
The weed's overly strong
We should be getting undressed
Now take off your thong
I'll help you with your bra strap
And then I hit you with the long and the strong
And you can make as much noise
Till your vocals are gone
It feels right coz it's totally wrong
But we're just living the good life
Like everyone should, right?
I'm giving her good pipe,
we're having a good night
I'm pretty sure one day
She'll be a good wife
And that's a good luck
But it's not in my foresight
But that don't matter now,
We're gonna fuck till the sunlight
I hit her from the back
Now I'm gripping the bumper tight
Whole lot of banging
I ain't bragging
You would think it's a gunfight
I'm happy that you've come
Now give me the light

Let's get into something really bad
Love me baby love me love me bad
I love it when the good girls act so bad
I love it when the bad girls do it like that
Let's get into something really bad
Love me baby love me love me bad
I love it when the good girls act so bad
I love it when the bad girls do it, do it, like, like that

Get freaky, let's get freaky
Get freaky, let's get freaky

Yo I come clean
You can swallow you ain't gotta spit
And you ain't gotta go home
But I gotta split
And if it's all the same
I'm really glad you came
You kept me entertained
I weren't doin shit
I got a couple things
That I gotta do today
But I'm great and I'm really glad
I woke up with you today
I probably said a couple things
I don't usually say
And I know you're not a hoe
You don't usually play
You would never just leave
You would usually stay
Never had a one night stand
That's okay
Ain't got to explain
Nothing wrong with sharing long
It's just an exchange

Get freaky, let's get freaky
Get freaky, let's get freaky

Let's get into something really bad

I love it when the good girls act so bad
I love it when the bad girls do it, do it, like, like bad

Young ragamuffin, can't tell me nothing
Miss me with that huff and puffing
You ain't ready to buck and get stuck in
You're just doing a lot of chuckin
I’m just doing a lot of talkin'
Are you sick or something?
Are you thick or something?

Dizzee Rascal,"New York, LA, Tokyo, Berlin, Miami, Rio, Milan, Ibiza
I love all these places, but there's no place like home
I love my city

I go hard in the city of London
I get a lot of love, all smiles when I step in the function
I'm a local boy, I'm from the east side
Now I'm jet settin', I'm reppin', I'll do it worldwide
When I was a kid there was a rough ride
Barely had the money for a bus ride, now I'm on the upside
Having a ball with all the breders I grew up with
A couple of women I'm in the club with
Bottle the bubbly, feeling lovely, women are hugging me
Nobody could tell me nothing and nobody can never trouble me
It's all good, pure positive vibes
For the most part everybody's just tryna live their lives
We're not afraid to die, only the strong survive
You don't know if you don't try, the stakes are high
And it's the city where I earned my crown
God knows that I love this town

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town

It's just one big melting pot
Every creed color and race, we got the lot
And I love to shop, there's not a brand that can't be copped
No more than a couple of stops
Where should I begin?
Might see me in the west side getting it in
Might see me on the north side getting a trim
South side of the river in a race car having a spin, I just win
And I'm never gonna lose with the city to guide me
Got the vibe of the city inside me and the streets are lively
Got a whole lot of love and I'm connect it
It's 7 million people behind me, don't try me
'Cause right now we're gonna rave it up
Set the roof on fire and blaze it up
And we're in it to win it
There's no limit so we raise it up
We got the dancefloor shaking like, woo

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now

Never put money over whores, maybe or it's crazy flawed, it's a myth, life's a gift
Made me pause, catch my drift, smoke a spliff and get in them draws
Paid the cost to be the boss, ball and floss, Jesus died, he nailed himself into the cross
Still couldn't please these backwards shit cunts, why would I take a loss?
Giving a toss, know your worth, hold your turf, fuck the earth, and shake it off
Breddas on my line talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, Raskit, break me off""
They’re wafer soft, I'm taking off

Three, two, one, zero, and lift off
Lift off of Mission 41b
The first flight of the Orbiter Discovery and the shuttle has cleared the tower

Ain't no point in playin' it safe
Gotta know your role, better state your case
When it all falls down, better know your place
Just gimme three feet and an ounce of
Space, space, space
Space, you should wanna embrace
Space, space, space

Alright, lift off and the clock has started
Yes sir, reading you loud and clear
Roger, Zero-T, and I feel fine, capsule is turning around
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things
Not because they are easy, but because they are hard",Space
Dizzy Gillespie,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Dizzy Gillespie,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way
Dizzy Gillespie,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,

Dizzy Gillespie,"Night and stars above that shine so bright
The mystery of their fading light
That shines upon our Caravan
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep
Across the sands so I may keep
The memory of our Caravan
This is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms
You beside me here beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert Caravan
This is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms
Night and stars above that shine so bright
The mystery of their fading light
That shines upon our Caravan
That shines upon our Caravan
Oooh",Caravan
Dizzy Gillespie,"[Instrumental]

",A Night in Tunisia
Dizzy Gillespie,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
