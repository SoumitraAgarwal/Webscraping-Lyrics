Emmylou Harris,"The very first time I ever saw my Tommy love
He came dancing into my room
And I felt the sunlight sparkle warm
Out from his magic shoes

And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
And he charmed me like a piper
When he smiled

So dance with me, dance with me, sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy, anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can

He asked me if I'd like to have my own parade
I answer yes and he blew his golden horn
Then the violins and the trumpets rang out he led them all
In a coat of many colors patched and torn

And he swung me to a loving sound
While the fiddlers played and pranced around
He spun so fast 'til we left the ground

Then the music filled the heavens with a joyful noise
The stars would dance to greet us as we'd come
Then he'd wave his hand and send them back to the morning light
And we'd keep climbing through the midnight sun

On a rocking horse with wings we'd fly
To a place where dreams can never die
Lovers little children in the sky

So dance with me, dance with me, sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy-anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can

And when it came time for my Tommy love to leave
I begged him please to stay and save my soul
And with a fading voice I heard him say as he",Waltz of the Magic Man
Emmylou Harris,"My baby never was the cheatin' kind
But it wasn't 'cause the ladies didn't try
Now everywhere we go
They're walkin' 'round him slow
Givin' him a flutter and a sigh
Now I got him past that redhead in atlanta
Lord I walked all over that black-eyed cajun queen
But outside of amarillo, he found his thrill, I'll tell you
Oh, I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine

Oh amarillo what'd you want my baby for
Oh amarillo now he won't come home no more
You done played a trick on me
Hooked him in the first degree
While he put another quarter
Push dolly and then porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine

If we only hadn't stopped in there for coffee
If someone hadn't played the window up above
He'd still be mine today
But he heard those fiddles play
One look and then I knew this must be love
Oh that pinball machine was in the corner
Well he saw the lights and he had to hear 'em ring
And he never was the same after he won his first free game
Oh I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine

Oh amarillo what'd you want my baby for
Oh amarillo now he won't come home no more
You done played a trick on me
Hooked him in the first degree
While he put another quarter
Push dolly and then porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine

Oh amarillo what'd you want my baby for
Oh amarillo now he won't come home no more
You done played a trick on me
Hooked him in the first degree
While he put another quarter
Push dolly and then porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine",Amarillo

Well I really had a ball last night 
I held all the pretty boys tight 
I was feelin' single, seein' double 
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble 
But today I'll face the big fight 
But I really had a ball last night 
When I came home from work this morning 
My baby was feelin' low 
And he told me what was on his mind 
Then he told me where I could go 
Well I didn't go where he told me to 
Cause the water was cold in the lake 
Now there's something fishy 'bout this whole deal 
I don't see where I made my mistake 
Well I really had a ball last night 
I held all the pretty boys tight 

I was feelin' single, seein' double 
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble 
But today I'll face the big fight 
But I really had a ball last night 

When I woke up this morning 
Like me, the sun was high 
Well I started walking the long way home 
Just to think of an alibi 
Well I couldn't think of a darn gawn thing 
That hadn't already been said 
So I guess I better just play it by ear 
Cause I'm already dead 
Well I really had a ball last night 
I held all the pretty boys tight 

I was feelin' single, seein' double 
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble 
But today I'll face the big fight 
But I really had a ball last night 
Yes today I'll face the big fight 
But I really had a ball last night

Emmylou Harris,"This old town is filled with sin 
It will swallow you in 
If you've got some money to burn 
Take it home right away 
You've got three years to pay 
But Satan is waiting his turn 
The scientists say 
It will all wash away 
But we don't believe any more 
Cause we've got our recruits 
And our green mohair suits

It seems like this whole town's insane 
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door 
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain 

A friend came around 
Tried to clean up this town 
His ideas made some people mad 
But he trusted his crowd

What you've seen is what I've been 
There is nothing I could hide from you 
You see me better than I can 
Out on the road that lies before me now 
There are some turns where I will spin 
I only hope that you can hold me now 
Till I can gain control again 

Like a lighthouse you must stand alone 
Landmark the sailor's journeys end 
No matter what sea I've have been sailing on

Emmylou Harris,"I was born on the bayou thirty miles of Lafayette's
My daddy was a Cajun man, Lord he thought us how to plow
I remember Mama's breakfast cush cush and a kaye
Being served on a banyee Lord, I wish I had some now

I'm a Cajun born, I'm a Cajun bred
And when I die I'm a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou

We went to church every Sunday we had a French speaking preacher man
Joked about the preacher man 'cause we thought he wore a dress, yes
After church we had a party we played the music on the phonograph
We had a man singing Jole Blon oh made a sinner out of me

I'm a Cajun born, I'm a Cajun bred
And when I die I'm a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou

When I'm ready to be married going to be this Cajun lady
Someone sort of like my Mama
'Cause I ain't know other kind, don't know other kind
Wherever fortune takes me, if it makes me or it breaks me
It's memories will forsake me, Louisiana on my mind

I'm a Cajun born, I'm a Cajun bred
And when I die I'm a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find it's way back to the bayou

How long can this go on?
You're leaving me alone
Stop running wild

You're always gone
My love you'll never change
It's more than I can bear
Stop running wild

You'll settle down someday
And find I've gone away
You'll think of what you've done
While running wild

You can't go home
You'll have to change your ways
You'll have to go or stay
Stop running wild

Emmylou Harris,"Baby brought me in out off the highway 
Poured my right good liquor down the sink
Straightened out my crooked ways of thinking 
And made it purely pleasure when I drank 

And it's all right now
I've just hit my stride 
Right off the bat 
I'm drunk on Bluebird wine 

Baby's up and running in the mornin' 
Says she's got a million things to do yeah
While I'm gone just you go get your guitar
Write some pretty song about me and you

And it's all right now
I've just hit my stride

Emmylou Harris,"Each night I leave the barroom when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight you memory found me much to sober
Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind
Tonight the bottle let down
And let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down
I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wind don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way

Emmylou Harris,"The day breaks your mind aches 
You find that all her words of kindness linger on 
She no longer needs you 
She wakes up she makes up 
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry 
She no longer needs you 

And in her eyes you see nothing 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one 

A love that should have lasted years 
You want her you need her 
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead 
You think she needs you 
She goes out you stay home 
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone 
She doesn't need him 

And in her eyes you see nothing 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one 

A love that should have lasted years 
Your day breaks your mind aches 
There will be time when all the things she said 
Will fill your head 
You won't forget her",For No One
Emmylou Harris,"(Shel Silverstein)

She arrives in all her splendor 
Each night at nine o'clock 
Her chariot is the crosstown bus 
That stops right down the block 
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in 
And the Queen of the Silver Dollar's home again 

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar 
She rules this smokey kingdom 
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne 
Now the jesters flock around her tryin' to win her favors 
To see which one will take the 
Queen of the Silver Dollar home 

Now her royal dress is satin 
It's shabby and it's torn 
The royal jewels are rhinestones 
The shoes are scuffed and worn 
Of the many roads she's been down, 
And the places that she's seen 
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen 

Now the Queen of the Silver Dollar 
Is not as haughty as she seems 
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams 
But there's a man who found her 
And he brought her to this world 
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl 

Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar 
I rule this smokey kingdom 
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne 
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors 
To see which one will take the 
Queen of the Silver Dollar home

Emmylou Harris,"My driftin' mem'ry goes back to the spring of '43
When I was just a child in mama's arms
My daddy plowed the ground and prayed that some day we could leave
This run down mortaged Oklahoma farm
Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my mama
That he finally saved enough for us to go
California was his dream a paradise wall he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so
California cottonfields
Where labor camps were full of worried men with broken dreams
California cottonfields was as close to wealth as daddy ever came

Almost everything we had was sold or left behind
From daddy's plow and the fruit that mama canned
Some folks came to say farewell and see what all we had to sell
But some just came to shake my daddy's hand
The Model A was loaded down and California bound
And a change of luck was just four days away
But the only change that I remember seeing for my daddy
Was when his dark hair had turned to silver gray

Where he got the bread to gop 
There ain't nobody knows 

Well, the poets tell how Pancho fell

Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him and he blames her
Neither one is really quite sure which way it is

And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that takes a little ring
And breaks into pieces that'll never go together again

Cheatin' is a part of lovin' that starts
When true love isn't what lovers are lookin' for
A stranger here, a stranger there
You turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more

And lyin' at night when you're holdin' him tight
Somethin' that a cheater's heart is bound to learn
Cheatin' is the thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two unhappy people to the point of no return

And the worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids
Hangin' in the middle while mummy and daddy kiss

And the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose

Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee

Emmylou Harris,"Come in as you tread life's journey 
Take Jesus as your daily guide 
Though you may feel pure and safely 
Without Him walking by your side 
But when you come to make the crossing 
At the ending of your pilgrim's way 
If you ever will meet our Savior 
You'll surely meet Him on that day 

Now look at that cold Jordan 
Look at these deep waters 
Look at that wide river 
Oh hear the mighty billows roar 
You'd better take Jesus with you 
He's a true companion 
For I'm sure without Him 
That you never will make it o'er 
 
That awful Day of Judgment 
Is coming in the by and by 
We'll see our Lord descending 
In Glory from on high 
So let us keep in touch with Jesus 
And in his grace the Love of God 
That we may be ever called ready 
When He calls us over Jordan's Tide 

Now look at that cold Jordan 
Look at these deep waters 
Look at that wide river 
Oh hear the mighty billows roar 
You'd better take Jesus with you

Oh how, how you gonna feel

When all the flowers were in bloom 
And like the flowers our love blossomed 
We married in the month of June 

Our love was like a burning ember 
It warmed us as a golden glow 
We had sunshine in December 
And threw our roses in the snow 

Now God has taken my darlin' 
And left me with a memory 
A memory I will always cherish 
Are these last words he said to me 

Our love was like a burning ember 
It warmed us as a golden glow 
We had sunshine in December 
And threw our roses in the snow 

My darlin's buried on the hillside 
Where all the wild spring flowers grow 
And when winter snows start fallin' 
On his grave I'll place a rose

Teasin' my memory teaching me how to lay low 
When I don't want to 
Well love is elusive this I know now 
It's making me crazy leaving me out 
In the open when I don't want to 

The moments of pleasures Never do last 
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past 
Long gone and in a hurry 

Baby, I can't go through this again 
I don't need to go down more then I've already been 
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town 
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now 

The second street beggars alone in their life 
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night 
Like I am They're just like I am

I don't need to go down more then I've already been

He promised her the world but they never got that far
For he was last seen in that '59 DeSota
When Sally was born in the black hills of Dakota
She was washed in the blood of the dying Sioux nation
Raised with a proud but a wandering heart
And she knew that her roots were in the old reservation
But she had stars in her eyes and graeter expectations
No rings on her fingers no bells on het toes
With bugs on her headlights
And runs in her hose
Through the valley of the shadow of Roosevelt's nose
Adios, South Dakota, adios Sally Rose
They've got a national monument carved out of stone
On the side of a mountain where her forefathers roamed
Playing cowboys and Indians right under the nose
Of Theodore Roosevelt and the sweet Sally Rose
So she left Rapid City in the blue moonlight hour
With her eye on the highway and her foot on the floor
And turnin' the dial she was pulled by the power
Of the word coming out of that broadcasting tower",The Ballad of Sally Rose

I have watched as all the green fields turn to brown

Brighter than all their streets of gold
When the burdens that I carry I will lay down

Last night I dreamed that I was a child 
Out where the pines grow wild and tall 
I was trying to make it home through the forest 
Before the darkness falls 

I heard the wind rustling through the trees 
And ghostly voices rose from the fields 
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path 
With the devil snappin' at my heels 

I broke through the trees, and there in the night 
My father's house stood shining hard and bright 
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms 
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms 

I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart 
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts 
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride 
From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light 

I walked up the steps and stood on the porch 
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door 
I told her my story, and who I'd come for 
She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore"" 

My father's house shines hard and bright 
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night 
Calling and calling, so cold and alone 
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned
",My Father's House

But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pines

Just to find what you thought true love should be
But you found a heart that you never knew ??
When you got around to the other side of me.

You say you got to go downtown
I guess there's someone else you've found
So why you're still coming round

I guess that's how it's meant to be but

But still your words they cut so deep
Lay me crying in my sleep

I don't know who's right or wrong

So why you keep me hanging on

Wild geese over the water heading north and home again
Bringing a warm wind from the south
Bringing the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way

His mother's brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

On the eve of his 21st birthday he set out on his own
He was 30 years and running when he found his way back home
Riding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start

Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a John
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
And there was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

Now some say he was crazy and they're glad that he is gone
But some of us miss him and we'll try to carry on

Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on

Emmylou Harris,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my door
Oh, hard times, come again no more

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my door
Oh, hard times, come again no more

There's a pale drooping maiden who foils her life away
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my door
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my door
Oh, hard times, come again no more

Through the streets of a town so silent and still

There'd be music playin' people make all the time 
Me and my brother we'd lie down in the tall cornfields, sir

For many long years I've played a lone hand 
I rode my horse in many strange lands 
Until one day I stopped for awhile 
For two blue eyes and a sunny smile 

So howl away you old coyote 
I hear your sad and lonesome song 
You're calling me back to old Montana 
Back to those hills where I belong 

One day I rode away from home 
I'm a' traveling back and it won't be long 
I'll see you again in a little while 
You're my darling sweet, my welcome smile

The wind is blowing across the mountain
Down on the valley way below
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die that's where I want to go

Lord send the angels for my darling
And take him to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth, love
And come to you when I die

It calls and whispers through the pines
I know it's my sweetheart a calling
I hear him through the walls of time

And take him to that home on high

I could tell a tale, I could make a spin
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night
Not only that I could tell you why

Back then I could really tel a lie
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick

I was takin' everything they had to give
It wasn't all that bad a way to live
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell
But no one's byuin' what I got to sell

I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day
But everyone just turns and walks away
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time

So I head across the road to drink some wine
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street
You're pretty good if I do say myself
But the guy that come through here last month he was sometin' else

Instead of allin' out for fire from above
He just gets real quiet and talks about love
And I'll tell you sometin' funny He didn't want nobody's money
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means

But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen
Well since that time every town is the same
I can't make a dime, I don't know why I came
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him

He has everyone convinced that he's for real
Well I figure we can work us out a deal
So he offers me a job and I say fine
He says I'll get paid off on down the line

Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done

And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul

There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost

Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear

And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I use to ride it like a rolling stone
Now just carry it alone

There's a highway risin' from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side

Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me home",Prayer in Open D

Living down Sonora way

But he says her love words over
Mostly when he's all alone

On the nights that he would ride
She would listen for his spurs
Throw those big doors open wide
Raise them laughing eyes of hers

How those hours would get to flying
All too soon he'd hear her sighing
In her little sorry tone

He ain't seen her since that night
He can't cross the line you know
They want him for a gamblin' fight
Like as not it's better so

In a bookstore on St. Clair 
While he pushed the burning ingots 
In Dofasco stinking air 
Where the truth bites and stings 
I remember just what we were 
As the noon bell rings for 
Blackhawk and the white winged dove 

Hold on to your aching heart 
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips 
A small town hero never dies 
He fades a bit and then he slips 
Down into the blast furnace 
In the heat of the open hearth 
And at the punch clock he remembers 
Blackhawk and the white winged dove 

I remember your leather boots 
Pointing up into the sky 
We fell down to our knees 
Over there where the grass grew high 
Love hunters in the night 
Our faces turned into the wind 
Blackhawk where are you know 
Blackhawk and the white winged dove 
We were Blackhawk where are you know 
We were Blackhawk where are you know 

Do you still have the ring I gave you 
On the banks of Lake Bear 
Where I felt certain that I knew you

Another cup of muscatel 
Wrapped in the strong arms of the Union

When the pool of tears beneath my feet, flood every newborn seed
There's a dyin' voice within me, reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair

Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand

Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay

I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey, I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand

I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face

I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

With your inventions your intentions, your laughter
Your forever yearning

Like new fallen snow 
I told you summer stories but outside is getting mighty cold 
I told you everything I could about me 
Told you everything I could 
How would you feel if the world was falling apart around you 

Pieces of the sky were falling in your neighbors yard 
But not on you 
Wouldn't you feel just a little bit funny 
Think maybe there`s something you oughta do

Emmylou Harris,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!""

Alone in the pale moonlight
Waitin' for a man, a riverboat gambler

While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong

With a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf

Wore his gun outside his pants

Ended up in Lefty's mouth

Where he got the bread to gop
There ain't nobody knows

Well, the poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel

You make up your mind, you choose the chance you take 
You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks 
Out on through an open road you ride until the day 
You learn to sleep at night with the price you pay 

Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies 
And then with their last breath 
They built the roads they would ride to their deaths 
Driving on through the night unable to break away 
>From the restless pull of the price you pay 

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay 
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay 

Now they've come so far and they've waited so long 
Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong 
Where the dark of night holds back the light of the day 
And you gotta stand and fight for the price you pay 

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay 
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay 

Little girl down on the strand 
With that pretty little baby in your hands 
Do you remember the story of the Promised land 
How he crossed the desert sands 
And could not enter the Chosen Land 
On the banks of the river he stayed 
To face the price you pay 

So let the games start 
You better run you little wild heart 
You can run through all the nights and all the days 
But just across the county line 
A stranger passin' through put up a sign 
That counts so many fallen away 
To the price you pay,

Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down

Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat

I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Emmylou Harris,"Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms
There's something in your voice makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've felt so low
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark there's light
If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you know how happy you are making me
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong",Feels Like Home
Emmylou Harris,"A light shines from my window
I just can't sleep no more
Lord, it hurts so much to be alone
But the real men never do admit
That it's them that might be wrong
At least that's what he told me in his song

He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind

The freedom that he sings about
I guess I'll never know
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train

He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
",He Rode All the Way to Texas
Emmylou Harris,"[Chorus]
I've been higher than the high sierra
Lower than death valley must be
I've been right, mostly wrong
Wrong about you, right about me

The way I feel, can't explain
So much passion turned to pain
The sun still shines most of the time
Did you know the sun shines when it rains

[Chorus]

I've been cussed and I've been praised
And I've been nothing these days
But I'll come back, time will see
If I'm wrong about you, right about me

[Chorus]",High Sierra
Emmylou Harris,"Trouble, we have known trouble 
In our struggle just to get by 
Many times the burden's been heavy 
Still we carried on side by side 

[Chorus]
And when we're gone long gone 
The only thing that will have mattered 
Is the love that we shared 
And the way that we cared 
When we're gone, long gone 

And when we're walking together in glory 
Hand in hand through eternity 
It's the love that will be remembered 
Not wealth, not poverty 

[Chorus]","When We're Gone, Long Gone"
Emmylou Harris,"The strange young man who comes to me
A soldier on a three day spree
He needs one night's cheap ecstasy 
And a woman's arms to hide him
He greets me with a courtly bow
And hides his pain by acting proud
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him?

Let us dance beneath the moon
I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'
The morning always comes too soon
But tonight the war is over
He speaks to me in schoolboy French
Of a soldier's life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him

He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me 'neath the Paris skies
Let's not talk of how or why
Tomorrow's soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard, too fast
He falls asleep, his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes, and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him

They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belgium and France the dead are everywhere
They die so, so fast there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory, old world fame
The old world's gone, gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh, I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing, nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them?

It was the middle of June, me and my grand mama
Had some free time, flew to Panama
I was playin' the bar, sippin' a Margarita
When this chick from Argentina, her name Armenita
She told me you could make some fast cash
You help me change my name from Vasquez to your name
Take me to your domain
Trick, you must be out yo' brain
She said it's no game, my pops got tons of cocaine
And you could have some if you get me on your plane
I said here the dealie, you sound silly
Think hard, there gotta be another way to get you a green card

Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world
It 'id be like paradise, baby

Rosalie you don't know who I suppose to be
But whatever you wanna be?  You can come go wit' me
Her last thoughts thinking I'mma get her a passport
Whatever you need ma, just ask for it
Now she lunch meat, she look at J like she home free

J, can you really get me in your country?

No lie, I can do whatever I mo' tie, so fly
Mami started offering me chochas
Certainly the way she flirt wit' me
If I get her in the US she work for free
Though she nice to me, I'm runnin' twice the G
For the right price, she could be a wife to me

I got a girl out in Asia, name Malaysia
Who was a real bad chick that owns a Bodega
She wanted me to save her and make her life greater
Cuz her dad hates her and rapes her
She tried to get some paper
When you wanna leave, I'mma take ya
In fact, pack ya things, I got a crib in Jamaica
Mami, mi casa a su casa
We could do the salsa so, que pasa?
She said she had money but it was all in trust funds
But I could get a lump sum if I can get her through customs
So bring the cake, we gon' swing outta state
I'mma make you dream when you awake
Yo Loon, sing the break, what

Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world

In the middle of Nicaragua, met a mami named Talia
Weren't plain, then I caught a boat wit' this dumb dame
An immigrant, marry her, make her legitimate
Illiterate, mess wit' Hud, she don't consider it
She said pa, llevame contigo
Lean dough and I'mma pay yo' peoples
This retard chick started looking at me hard
She gassed up thinkin' I'mma get her a green card
And she don't know that she ain't coming wit' me
And I don't stuck up for some hundreds of G's
And while I see her standing there lookin' around
Huddy took the money, slid outta town, what? uh?

Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?
I promise you, we gon' see the world

Hey girl, you wanna go wit' me?

Emmylou Harris,"All I left behind should come as no surprise
To me since I fell through the black hole of your eye
Only little things inconsequential I could say
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway
Silver earrings in Wichita
Beaded moccasins in Tonapah

But I had you, so
I just let them go
The flannel shirt I wore to keep me from the cold
When we drove from Boston all the way to Buffalo
The leather boots I bought so many miles ago
I took them off to follow you into the Ohio
Never did my armor feel so thin

Silk was all I had between me and your skin
Like Waterloo, I lost that too
And the gold bracelet with my father's name inscribed
On the back by the one who loved him all her life
The way I too could have loved you
The Spanish shawl I put across the broken shade
Of the lamp that lit the room

When he sang about the the blues in the body and soul

Yes, you who must leave everything 
That you cannot control
It begins with your family 
But soon it comes 'round to your soul
Well I've been where you're hanging

Well they lay down beside me
I make my confessions to them

And I touched the dew on their hem

That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love 
That is graceful and green as a stem
When I left they were sleeping 
And I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights 
You can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous

And to answer the distant call

And I offer it up on this altar of tears

With a scar across your shoulder
You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children
Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago

Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning
And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago

I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing
And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk about you crying
For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you

Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender
And could you hear me calling out your name
Well I guess that I will never know

I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping
And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago

Tonight I am going from Santa Maria 
Wait for me till I'm in your arms once again""

To cross on 1he mountain my fortune to win 
But a letter now tells me she died of a fever 
I'll never see her in this world again

You are my sorrow, you are my splendor 
You are my shelter through storm and through strife 
You are the one I will always remember 
All off the days of my life 

I curse the ambition that took me far from her 
For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair 
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers 
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair 

She left me a note that cried ""Do not weep for me 
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars 
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me 
Behold I am with you wherever you are"" 

I can still hear him. he calls to me only 
What once was begotten shall come to no end 
But the road is so long and the nights are so lonely

You are my shelter through storm and through strife 
You are the one I will always remember

How could I know that night in Santa Maria
I'd never see you in this world again",My Antonia
Emmylou Harris,"My baby needs a shepherd
SheÂ´s lost out on the hill
Too late I tried to call her
When the night was cold and still
And I tell myself IÂ´ll find her
But I know I never will

SheÂ´s lost out on the hill

My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly
SheÂ´ll not reach sanctuary
Just by looking to the sky
I guess I could have carried her
But I didn't even try
My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly

Oh I ran so far through a broken land
I was following that drummer
Beating in a different band 
And somewhere on the highway
IÂ´let go of her hand
Now sheÂ´s gone forever
Like her footprints in the sand

Toora loora loora lo
First the seed and then the rose
Toora loora loora li
My kingdom for a lullaby

My baby needs a pilot
She has no magic wand
To help her part the troubled waters
Of the Rubicon
But in my soul I know sheÂ´ll
Have to go this one alone
After all that is only way sheÂ´s ever known

But there is no lamp in all this dark
That could chase away her shadow
From the corners of my heart
I pray sheÂ´s ride a dolphin
But sheÂ´s swimming with the shark
Out where none can save her
Not even Noah and his ark

Toora loora loora lo
To the cradle comes the crow
Toora loora loora li

To love her till the end

And down every road that bends
Sometimes I hear her cryin'

We can go out swimming in the high tide
Just wear your shorts and your long hair 
Don't forget the lawn chair 
Everybody's gone to the movies 
Everybody's gone and its groovy
They went to the one about the big war 
I didn't, I'd seen it before

I guess I'm taking my chances 
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances 
Trading in my things 
For a couple wings a little white dove 
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love

Everybody do like a monkey

No need to talk like a hero 
Talk a walk count down to zero
No sense defending your honor 
Just go on and kiss him if you want to

Emmylou Harris,"O the dragons are gonna fly tonight
They're circling low and inside tonight
It's another round in the losing fight
Out along the great divide tonight

We are aging soldiers in an ancient war
Seeking out some half remembered shore
We drink our fill and still we thirst for more
Asking if there's no heaven what is this hunger for?

Our path is worn our feet are poorly shod
We lift up our prayer against the odds
And fear the silence is the voice of God 

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

Sorrow is constant and the joys are brief
The seasons come and bring no sweet relief
Time is a brutal but a careless thief
Who takes our lot but leaves behind the grief

It is the heart that kills us in the end
Just one more old broken bone that cannot mend
As it was now and ever shall be amen

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

So there'll be no guiding light for you and me
We are not sailors lost out on the sea
We were always headed toward eternity
Hoping for a glimpse of Gaililee

Like falling stars from the universe we are hurled
Down through the long loneliness of the world
Until we behold the pain become the pearl

CryinÂ´ Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah",The Pearl
Emmylou Harris,"Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian.

She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.

She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound

She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian

She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in.
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't know end.
At least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only twenty seven and she had five kids.
Coulda' been the whiskey,
Coulda been the pills,
Coulda been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Names Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian.

Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt ground",Red Dirt Girl
Emmylou Harris,"Some say it's destiny
Whether triumph or tragedy
But I believe we cast our nets out on the sea
And nothing we gather
Comes for free

I would have paid down through the years
A price beyond rubies beyond tears
To keep you safe with me
But your suspicion and your fear
Your vow to let nobody near was your trinity
Such a tragedy

I drew the best hand you'd ever hold
Then cashed my winnings in long ago
Settled for silver how could I know
You were waiting with the gold

I could have caused your heart to yield
But I was only a disturbance in the field
Of your dreams
And I will never see you cry
You won't be with me when I die
A waste of you and me
A tragedy

We took the wrong train to
Kingdom come now
No more damage
Can be done baby
It's just what the world don't need
It's another stinkin' tragedy

We are history
But I will always think of you
Every day until my days are through
You made me believe

Just you wait until tomorrow when you wake up with me
At your side and find I haven't lied about nothin'
I wouldn't trade a tree for the way I feel about you
In the mornin', anyhow I love you

Everyday it gets just a little bit better
And half the gettin' there is knowin' where I been before
I'm sure you understand 'cause I ain't your first man
So when you feel like runnin' for the back door, don't

She's a won't be long friend till she's gone friend

Doin' time in Babyion
Cluster mansion on the hill
Another day in Pleasantville
You don't like it take a pill
Doin1 time in Babyion

In the land of the proud and free
You can sell your soul and your dignity
For fifteen minutes on TV

Fill it up with silicone
Everybody must get cloned
Doin' time in Babyion

Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
The crows are in the corn
The morning sky is red and falling down
The piper's at the till
He's coming for the kill
Luring all our children underground in Babyion

We came frorm apple pie and mom
through Civil Rights and Ban the Bomb
To Watergate and Vietnam Hard times in Babyion
Rallied 'round the megaphone
Gave it up, just got stoned
Now it's Prada, Gucci and Perron
Doin' time in Babyion

Get results, get 'em fast
We're ready if you got the cash
Someone else will be laughin' last
Doin' time in Babyion
So put that conscience on the shelf
Keep the best stuff for yourself
Let the rest fight over what is left
Doin' time in Babyion

Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
The crows are in the corn
The morning sky is red and falling down
Let your song of healing spark
A way out of this dark
Lead us to a higher and a holy ground",Time in Babylon

Emmylou Harris,"When I saw you standing there on the street 
I found myself by your side 
I started wanting you again 
There's just no way to hide from that old 
Loving You feeling again 
It's really got me reeling again 
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you 

I remember how you'd always been 
That certain look in your eyes 
Your not easy to resist 
But I just walked on by 
With that loving old feeling again 
It's really got me reeling again 
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you 
Loving you feeling with you 
We were so close we were too far apart 

I gave you my love 
I wanted your heart 
Without yesterday haunting the way 
Maybe we'd still be together 
Sharing that loving you feeling again 
It's really got me reeling again 
Will it ever stop and not start over again 
That loving you feeling again 
No matter how much I try 
This loving you feeling 
It's taken such a long time to say goodbye 
And getting over you is so hard to do 
With this feeling loving you 
That loving you feeling again",That Lovin' You Feelin' Again [Remastered Album Version] [Version]
Emmylou Harris,"Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder

You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children

Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago
Michelangelo

Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning

And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing

And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So far below
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you laid dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk above you crying

For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago
Michelangelo

Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender

And could you hear me calling out your name
Well, I guess that I will never know
Michelangelo

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping

And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago
Michelangelo

Emmylou Harris,"They say there's wreckage washing up
All along the coast
No one seems to know too much
Of who got hit the most
Nothing has been spoken
There's not a lot to see
But something has been broken
That's how it feels to me

We had a harmony
I never meant to spoil
Now it's lying in the water
Like a slick of oil
The tide is running out to sea
Under a darkening sky
The night is falling down on me
And I'm thinking that I should

Head on home
Been gone too long
Leave my roaming
Beachcombing

Little wild kitten out hunting
To see what he can get
You're in a big city now
Won't stop growing yet
The sun is going down smoking
A flaming testament
Something has been broken
And it feels permanent

Little seabird flying
He knows where he wants to go
Guess I ought to pack my stuff
And do the thing I know
I turn around and head on back
Along the old sea wall
I felt something give and crack
And now I'm sorry that's all

Head on home

Too long baby too long
Checking out of Donkey Town
So long, so long, so long

Her pretty eyes are pretty still
But Jim's got a kind of a squint Yeah
I dug up my last check from out of the mine
Now I feel like I've done my stint
Jim got an army pension
When he walked from the military court
No body ever mentioned
The medical report

She does little things for me
She likes to get the both of us high. Yeah
She says I'm a tender-hearted man
Prince charming,yeah, sure, I'm the guy
He likes the wrecker's dogs on chains
And the smoke from the company fires
Diesel oil in the trucks and cranes
And the smell of burning tires

But I've been around in Donkey Town
Too long, baby ,too long
Checking out of Donkey Town
So long, so long, so long

There's a purple heart in a silver tin
And a grey .45 in a drawer
Most of the time you can drink with him
But some other time he's just sore
On days when she says she can't think straight
Or she feels like she's getting the jumps
She'll go shoot off her .38
At cans on a Donkey Town dump

It was Friday late and she crossed those legs
She told me flat out she would. Yeah
If I could pull up my trailer pegs
We could get away together for good
I sure wish her the best of luck
She's going to need it thinking of Jim
I don't like to leave her stuck
But she's near as bad as him

Emmylou Harris,"Me and my best friend Lillian 
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin' on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin' every song the radio played
Waitin' for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town 
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian.

She loved her brother I remember back when 
He was fixin' up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin' there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin' somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.
	
She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl 
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing 
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound

She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian

She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in. 
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't know end. 
At least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only 27 and she had five kids.
Could'a been the whiskey,
Could'a been the pills, 
Could'a been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world 
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Names Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian.

Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid 
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt ground",Red Dirt Girl [DVD]

Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade, says something like
""You and me babe, how about it?""

Juliet says ""hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack""
He's underneath the window, she's singing ""hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway whatcha gonna do about it?""

Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet and you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

We come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, yeah, both mean yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

When you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, yeah you promised me thick and thin
Now you just say ""Romeo yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him""

Juliet when we'd make love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, oh I'll love you till the day I die
You know, there's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong?

Yeah, Juliet 

I can't do the talk like they talkin' on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you, the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and the rock 'n' roll company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Julie, I'd do the stars with you any time

Emmylou Harris,"Oh, Ellis Island was swarming
Like a scene from a costume hall
Decked out in the colors in Europe
And on fire with the hope of it all

There stood my father's own father stood huddled
With the tired and hungry and scared
Turn of the century pilgrims
Bound by the dream that they shared

They were standing in lines just like cattle
Poked and prodded and shoved
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom
Some were were torn from someone they love

Through this sprawling tower of babel
Came a young man confused and alone
Determined and bound for America
And carrying everything that he owned

Sometimes when I look in my grandfather's immigrant eyes
I see that day reflected and I can't hold my feelings inside
I see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life
So don't take it for granted say grandfather's immigrant eyes

Now he rocks and stares out the window
But his eyes are still just as clear
As the day he sailed through the harbor
And come ashore on the island of tears

My grandfather's days are numbered
But I won't let his memory die
'Cause he gave me the gift of this country
And the look in his immigrant eyes

Before a bullet crushed the life of their romance

And the moon along the Gunnison don't rise
Shall I cast my dreams upon your love, babe
And lie beneath the laughter of your eyes?

It's snowing on Raton
Come morning I'll be through them hills and gone

Mother thinks the road is long and lonely
Little brother thinks the road is straight and fine
Little darling thinks the road is soft and lovely
I'm thankful that old road is a friend of mine

Bid the years good-bye you cannot still them
You cannot turn the circles of the sun
You cannot count the miles until you feel them
And you cannot hold a lover that is gone

Tomorrow the mountains will be sleeping
Silently the blanket green and blue
All that I shall hear the silence they are keeping
I'll bring all their promises to you

As eight years went on by
And earned a silver visor

In the end he knew she'd been his finest hour
And all he has left of her is a song

Standing by a cabin door
Her song was ringing
Out in a voice so strong and sure
To the lonesome valley
He bring her there to be his bride
Where they would live and work together
Side by side

She was his sunshine
She was his moon and morning star
His words would ring to
The chords of her guitar

And lost to her for days and days

I'll never swim Kern River again,
It was there that I met him,
There that I lost my best friend.
Now I live in the mountains
I drifted up here with the wind.
And I may drown in still water,
But I'll never swim Kern River again.

But that gusher never came in.
And the river was a boundary
Where my darling and I used to swim.
One night in the moonlight,
The swiftness swept his life away.
Now I live on Lake Shasta,
And Lake Shasta is where I will stay.

There's the South San Joaquin
Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found.
And theres a place called Mt. Whitney
From where the mighty Kern River comes down.
Now it's not deep nor wide,
But it's a mean piece of water my friend.
And I may cross on the highway,
But I'll never swim Kern River again.

And let the moon follow me home

Followed your tears with a washing pail
I followed your story I followed your tail
Followed you straight through the
Doors of your jail cell too

Followed your voice in the darkness soft
A wind came through and carried it off
I followed your love till it never really was at all
Drank all I could swallow
Followed a road
'Til the sky ran out",Moon Song
Emmylou Harris,"Oh my darling, I miss you so.
How I loved you, you'll never know.
Though it's time for me to let you go.
Oh my darling, I'll miss you so.

Can't believe you're really gone for good.
I still hold on to places you once stood.
I should move on, but I never could,
Really believe you're gone for good.

Oh my friend, what could I do?
I just came home to bury you.
The road is long, the road is rough.
Your in my heart, that's not close enough.

All those years, disappear
All my tears, are not enough, not enough.
How can it be the ties that bind,
Cut down deep and are so unkind?
When we lose them we will never find,
Anything stronger than the ties that bind.

I still have your memory.
One or two pictures of you and me.
Life is long and life is tough,
But when you love someone,
Life is not long enough.",Not Enough
Emmylou Harris,"I spent a lifetime making up my mind to be
More than the measure of what I thought others could see
Good luck and fast bucks are too far and too few between
Cadillac buyers and old five and dimers like me

Yes she stood beside me letting me know she would be
Something to lean on when everything ran out on me
Fenced yards ain't hole cards and like is not never will be
Reason for rhymers and old five and dimers like me

It's taken me so long but now that I know I believe
All that I do or say all that I ever will be
Too far and too high and too deep ain't too much to be
Too much ain't enough for old five and dimers like me

Too much ain't enough for old five and dimers like me
And an old five and dimer is all I intended to be",Old Five and Dimers Like Me
Emmylou Harris,"One last gaze upon the sun
Bid farewell to everyone
Kick that bucket out the door
Where I'm going I won't need it anymore

Going lay my burden down
Take a bird's eye look around
From the tall pines of Carolina
All the way to wall of China

So I'll go sailing round the room
Through my window, cross to silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
I'll finally set my soul free
When I go sailing round the room

Life maybe be just but a dream
Float my boat on down the stream
To wake up on a different shore
(?) ain't something I've ever been before

I could be a drop of summer rain
Falling down on an Oklahoma plain
Oh leave the world behind me
Look around and you will find me

[Chorus: ]

(I will be) in the smoke from Monaloha
Morning mist on the Shenadoah
(I will be) a grain of sand in the Kalahara
Magnolia by the Mississippi
(I will be) birdsong when day is breaking
Words of love when your heart is aching
(I will be) blue bonnet by the highway
I'll be everywhere and always

Didn't I try to give you all the right stuff
Hung around when the going got tough

All those nights you never answered back
And I just ask you to cut me a little slack
Where were you when the world turned black

One of these days I'm gonna take that ride
Tho' there maybe nothing on the other side
I'm too old for changin'
My true blues have all been tried
One of these days I'm gonna take that ride

You always were the one
Gave me my place out in the sun
And we raised a glass to the one
It was thy will be done

So don't you believe it's time to let me go
The clock is winding down and I'm moving slow
I could keep on dancing, just for show
Don't you believe it's time to let me go

One of these days I'm gonna take that ride
Whatever's waiting on the other side
Had a little glory and I still got my pride

A little too much gray around the muzzle

I found her one day down there at the metro
A big black dog
Waitin' in a cage in line for the death row

Did they think an old dog was too much trouble

Standing there where so many die

Over the new clear watercolor
Over the rocks and glass

You have left this world,
But we'll miss our Kate,
Our darling girl!
We held your hand,
Kissed your lovely brow,
And bid farewell
You're sailing now

Free from the pain
You laid that burden down,
But you're strong and giving heart,
Will surely be your crown

As you slip the surly bonds of earth
And sail away
Perhaps we will meet again 
Somehow, some day

Until then, there's nothing we can do but wait,
To see once more, 
Our darling Kate

All those nights we sang
And talked 'til the sun come up,
You fed our souls, 
You filled our cup
With your perfect words 
And oh that voice,
We fell in love, 
We had no choice.

And I can't say 
For sure where you have gone,
But in that place 
I'm bettin' there's a better song

For we've all known down here,
The taste of joy and strife
You were the sweetest note
In the chord of life.

Now you've slipped the surly bonds of earth,
And sailed away
Perhaps we will meet again 
Somehow, some day
But if there was one name I could consecrate
It would be yours
It would be Kate",Darlin' Kate

I'm drownin' in teardrops

And you look to me now 
So I greet the new day
With the eyes of a child 
And the wonder you bring

So goodnight old world
We'll see you tomorrow
We rise with the sun
And fall with the sparrow
But here is this child

Just feel like callin' it a day
But you send me back to the start

Each time I'm headin' for nowhere
Doomed and determined to go there
It seems I never get far
You drive a hard bargain

How's a girl supposed to fail
With someone like you around them?
I've tried and tried to no avail
You just can't seem to let me down

Emmylou Harris,"I live out here in the wind and the pouring rain
Somewhere between 14th Avenue and Main
In the summer heat, the winter's freezing snow
You see I got nowhere else to go

Got no home sweet home
Into this world, some are bound to roam
And it's long hard road we've known
On the way to home sweet home

People pass by, they don't see me here
And if they do they wish I would disappear
I guess they know way down deep in their bones
It could be them out there lookin' for a home
For a home

Oh to have a place to lay my head
A crumb or two for my daily bread
Perhaps someday
A kind soul will come along
Help me to find my way back

The days are growing shorter
The years are going faster
And time is flying by 
I wake up in the morning
And before I even notice
The sun is going down
And I'm left to wonder why

I'm a lonely girl in a lonely world
I never thought my life would be like this
To have no one to hold my hand
And feel once more a sweet caress

I'd give it my best effort
Love is always worth it
But even if I try
I might still end up alone
It may not be in me
To take what love could give me
Some of us are better off
To make it on our own

As a lonely girl in a lonely world
And though my life has been so blessed
I have no one to hold my hand
And feel once more a sweet caress

I've had my share of lovers
And cared for many others
I always thought there'd be
Another one to come along
But if love can't find me again
I'll put it all behind me then
I'll just go and learn to sing
Another sad love song

About a lonely girl in a lonely world
She never dreamed her life would be like this
To have no one to hold her hand
And feel once more a sweet caress",Lonely Girl
Emmylou Harris,"I was born a black boy
My name is Emmett Till
I walked this earth for fourteen years
Then one night I was killed
For speaking to a woman
Whose skin was as white as dough
That's a sin in Mississippi
But how was I to know

I'd come down from Chicago
To visit with my kin
Up there I was a cheeky kid
I guess I always been
But the harm they put upon me
Was too hard for what I done
For I was just a black boy
I never hurt no one

They took me from my uncle's house
Mose Wright was his name
He'd later stand and without hesitation
Point the blame
At the ones who beat and cut me
And shot me with a gun
Then threw me in the river
Like I was trash when they were done

I was sent back to my mother
At least what was left of me
She kept my casket open
For the whole wide world to see
The awful desecration
And the evidence of hate
You could not recognize me
The mutilation was so great

There came a cry for justice then
To be finally fulfilled
All because of me, a black boy
My name is Emmett Till

But I'd have rather lived
'Til I was too old to die young
Not miss all I left behind
All that might have come
The summer clouds above my head
The grass beneath my feet
The warmth of a good woman
Her kisses soft and sweet

Perhaps to be a father
With a black boy of my own
And watch him grow into
A kinder world than I had known

Where no child would be murdered
For the color of his skin
And love would be the only thing
Inside the hearts of men

They say the horror of that night
Is still haunting heaven still
Where I am one more black boy
My name is Emmett Till",My Name Is Emmett Till
Emmylou Harris,"My Lord how the rains came down
The waters made a mighty sound
When the levees broke that day
Washin' all those souls away
The whole world stood to watch us drown
But we took it to a higher ground

It takes more than a hurricane
To empty out the Pontchartrain
Long ago we broke the chains
In New Oreleans New Orleans
When Brother Bill and Sister Nell
Are singing like a ringing bell
Then you'll know all is well
In New Orleans New Orleans

Bring it all, fire and flood
Fill the rivers up with mud
To cut and run ain't in our blood
We are New Orleans

So baby let the life roll on

We're walkin' in a brighter day
Nothin' can get in our way
The whole world stood to watch us drown
But we took it to a higher ground",New Orleans
Emmylou Harris,"Ridin' on her bicycle to school
A little girl out breakin' all the rules
She don't care about the birds and the bees
She's too busy skinnin' both her knees
With the arms of a loving childhood
Wrapped around her
All the wonders of the world surround her
And with the angels up above her soul to keep
In her bed down here below she falls asleep

She don't need nobody
She don't need nobody
She don't need nobody now

All grown up and livin' on her own
She goes to work and then comes home alone
But she believes someday her prince will come
There's a lot of life to go at twenty one
With nothing but her faith in love to guide her
She'll follow the young heart that beats inside her
Walk right through that door and bet it all
Confidant she can take the fall

She's ready for somebody
She's ready for somebody
She's ready for somebody now

As the years go by
The woman's not so sure
She feels an ache inside
That seems to have no cure
How did life get so long
Does no one ever stay
Was the dream of one true love
Just lost along the way
But she believes she has so much to give
Is there any other reason why we live

She stills want somebody
She stills want somebody
She stills want somebody now

Now that little girl is growing old
All of her sad stories have been told
But there are no regrets, she'll place no blame
She knows for everyone it is the same
Even when the well runs dry and the bread's unleavened
And she wonders if there really is a heaven
She finds her way back to that little girl
And wraps her empty arms around the world

She don't need nobody
She don't need nobody
She don't need nobody now",Nobody
Emmylou Harris,"I can still remember 
Every song you played
Long ago when we were younger 
And we'd rock the night away
How could I see your future then 
Where you would not grow old
With such a fire in our bellies
Such a hunger in our souls.

I guess I probably loved you 
When those words rolled off your tongue
It seemed that we were travelin'
Under some ol' lucky sun

I know I couldn't save you 
And no one was to blame
But the road we shared together once 
Will never be the same

Hey, hey gonna fly away
Won't be coming round today
Hey, hey with a song I pray
And on the wings of a song I'll fly away.

I wandered in the wilderness 
For a while I was so lost
To everything there is a season 
And every blessing has it's cost
So I took what you left me 
And put it to some use
Went looking for an answer 
With those three cords and the truth

I come down from the mountain 
I come walkin' in your shoes
I was taken for a gambler 
When I had no more to lose

'Cause you put me on that pathway 
How could I refuse?
And I spend my whole life out here 
Workin' on the blues

So I carried on. 
You can't be haunted by the past.
People come and people go. 
And nothing ever lasts.
But I still think about you 
Wonder where you are
Can you see me from some place 
Up there among the stars

But down here under heaven 
There never was a chart
To guide our way across 
This crooked highway of the heart
And if it's only all about 
The journey in the end
On that road I'm glad I came to know 
My old friend.

Hey

Won't be coming round again

Blessed is the day they return to each other
After all of the battles are done
And finally they are one

Following stars
Way cross the sky

Emmylou Harris,"Here's to the corners yet to turn
Here's to the bridges yet to burn
Here's to the whole thing blown apart
It’s open season on my heart

Days go by like flying bricks
Leave gaping holes too deep to fix
I’d just stay home if I were smart
It’s open season on my heart

I can’t blame anyone but me
For this restless fool I’ve come to be
My tired excuses just don’t fit
It don’t look good from where I sit

I tried to change without much luck
I reach a point where I get stuck
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It’s open season on my heart

I can’t be something that I’m not
I can’t give you what I haven’t got
I don’t know where I'll while away
I only know the shape of you

Here’s to the clown down in the mouth
Here’s to the whole thing going south
Just stay home if I were smart
It’s open season on my heart

I hit the streets and the fireworks start
It’s open season on my heart",Open Season on My Heart
Emmylou Harris,"Sweet Lucinda
Look out your window
LA freeway just like the man said
People honking their horns
Pointing guns at your head
Sweet Lucinda
In a land of cotton
You're not forgotten
The Mississippi River just rolls on through
And everybody's wondering what happened to you
In the land of cotton
Down on the delta
Remember your soul
We're waiting just to welcome you back to the fold
Tomorrow comes early
You better get humming
The whole damn town is gonna know that you're coming

Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis

Bring it on home and give us a thrill
Bring it on home honey send me the bill
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis

Beale Street was jumping the day you were born
W.C. Handy was blowing his horn
From the bluffs to Mud Island
The music grew quiet
Mystery train put a hush on the night
Fireflies made light of the hot summer breeze
And the wind was a whisper through the tops of the trees
Rain started falling
The river grew lazy
Bring it on home child you're making us crazy

We've got hot buttered biscuits
And dewberry pie
White-flour gravy
In an endless supply
Cucumber salad right out of the ground
And cold soda water just to wash it all down
But down on the Delta
Where cotton is king
We only want to treat you like a homecoming queen
Tomorrow comes early
It's never too late
The whole damn town is gonna open the gate

Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis

Run off with my dancing shoes

Emmylou Harris,"I walked across the bridge to the island
And sat down in the grass by the old homestead
I listened to the song of the cicadas
And thought about the one whose hair was red

This is where she gave birth to my father
Back when she was just a newly wed
You wouldn't know it looking at this picture
That her eyes were blue, hair was red

You wouldn't know she traveled far and wide
You wouldn't know she lived here all her life
There is so much you'll never know about her
So much left to say that's left unsaid

But I have got this picture in my memory
And her eyes are blue, her hair is red

Yes her eyes
Were baby blue, and was hair
Was red",Her Hair Was Red
Emmylou Harris,"You're out there among the stars
It never will seem right
If I could get to where you are
I'd be there tonight

Were you just a dream I had
How am I to know
I can't hold you in my arms
And I can't let you go

Higher mountains
Deeper valleys
Longer rivers
Stand between us now
I could climb that jagged peak
I could cross that great divide
If I knew that you'd be waiting
For me on the other side

The days pass by my window now
Oh, but nights like these are rough
I can feel you in my heart
But that's not close enough
If I could hear you breathe again
The comfort of your sigh
I'd gladly trade tomorrow in
On one more last goodbye

Higher mountains
Deeper valleys
Longer rivers
Stand between us now

When I rise above the seas
(When you rise above the earth)
And the Firmaments collide
(And the Firmaments collide)
When I pass through Heaven's gateway
Let me enter as your bride
(Yes you will enter as my bride)
Bluebonnets in my hair

That you'll gather for me there

You're out there among the stars",Higher Mountains
Emmylou Harris,"I drove my car in the middle of the night
I just wanted to see you so bad
The road was dark but the stars were bright
I just wanted to see you so bad
It didn't matter what my friends might say
I was gonna see you anyway

I just wanted to see you so bad
I just wanted to see you so bad
I just wanted to see you so bad

You were staying in a big hotel
I just wanted to see you so bad
I didn't know you very well
I just wanted to see you so bad

We'd only talked on the telephone
I'd never been with you all alone
I just wanted to see you so bad
I just wanted to see you so bad

And I got off from the seventh floor
I just wanted to see you so bad
I couldn't have asked for anything more

I don't even care
Things have changed
They're not the same
You're not my cross to bear
I see you in a different light
The truth got through somehow
If you lived here, you'd be home now

If you lived here, you'd be on the phone
Talking to your momma
Saying you ain't gone and left here yet
But someday you was gonna
The day I pledged my love for you
Sure raised a few eyebrows
If you lived here, you'd be home now

You keep wanting me to be something that I'm not
What you see is what you get
And I'm the one you got
And I'm tired of breaking these rocks
Up in this field my heart won't plow
If you lived here you'd be home now

If you lived here, you'd be at my throat
Like every time before
Slinging them old hurting words
And walking on out the door
Sometimes I think I might want you back
But there ain't no way, no how
If you lived here, you'd be home now

But, it's time I did the right thing
And released you from your vow

Emmylou Harris,"I used to get drunk all by myself
I wanted to be somebody else
And I had a mask inside my mind
That I hid behind

I'm on the point of no return
I crossed a bridge I could not burn
And turned down a road that led straight to
Just pleasing you

If just pleasing you
Is the last thing I'll do
I'll go to my grave, yeah
Nobody's slave

Most of the friends I used to know
Gave up a long, long time ago
I blew through their lives a train off track
And never looked back

And I made each love a nasty joke
Every last chance of vow I broke
Been down on my knees surrender to
Just pleasing you

If just pleasing you
Is the last thing I'll do
They'll lay me to rest
Knowing I've had the best

I used to get drunk all by myself
Now I've set that old pain up on the shelf
And each shining day I'll rise up to

I don't want no teardrops

I ain't yours you ain't mine

Old memories keep standing in the way

You lost her I lost him
Two old hearts just won't love again
They don't need no memories hanging round

Since she's gone it don't feel right
I'm better off left alone at night
I ain't faking feeling far away

The days has just come and disappeared
You can't talk and I don't hear
It don't make no difference anyway

'Cause I lost her, you lost him
Two old hearts just won't love again

From the ravages of time
But the first and last to leave their mark
Someday become the traveling kind

In the wind are names of poets past
Some were friends of yours and mine
And to those unsung, we lift our glass
May their songs become the traveling kind

We were born to brave this tilted world
With our hearts laid on the line
Be it way-crossed boy or red dirt girl
The song becomes the traveling kind

There are mountains worth their weight in gold
Mere mortals dare not climb
Come ye gypsy, sainted, sinners both
And claim them for the traveling kind

When the music slowly starts to fade
Into the light's last soft decline
Let us lie down in that evening shade
And rest among the traveling kind

And the song goes on for the traveling kind",The Traveling Kind

They got us hooked on oil
'Til the pipeline blow

Adding World War Three

Yeah, the weight of the world

Up the top of a mountain
Well I ne'er should
Poisonous as the river
With the devils's own sludge
It's the American dream
But if you live downstream
Here comes the weight of the world

Ton of plastic bottles
Headed out to sea
Bound to build an island
Thanks to you and me
Another man-made pearl
For the junk we hurl

Yeah, the weight of the world

I got to feed the baby
Recompense the rent
For the way I think I?
Where all the money went
Well there's a piper to pay

Is it a bird or a plane?
Taking love to [delight?]
Drove us all insane

Doesn't mean we're wrong
The world won't end today
If both of us move on

But didn't we have a time?
You can't take that away
We've had a change of mind
I think it's safe to say

That I've been holding on to you
And you've been holding on to me
'Cause neither of us wants to be
The first to say goodbye

And so it goes, we must admit
How we both thought that this was it
Though we couldn't make the pieces fit
You can't say we didn't try

Close the window, pull the shade
Turn the key and lock the door
We'd best forget the plans we made
We don't live here anymore

Maybe somewhere down the line
We'll remember who we were
Another place, another time
Some old feeling starts to stir

But I've been holding on to you
And you've been holding on to me
'Cause neither of us wants to be

But there's no one else in it
And sometimes those lonesome breezes blow
But it's no show so you might as well go
If you think you could win it 
Without losing and letting it show

The city is no place to hide in
Everybody knows your number
And you know that you could never be alone if you tried
You just run like a man with no reason to run
And no place to ever arrive
You must be a prisoner
Look just like a prisoner
Well you must be a prisoner in disguise",Prisoner in Disguise
Emmylou Harris,"I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon

But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind

You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind

You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

Just when the sun shines the brightest
And the world looks alright again
Then the clouds fill the skies
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

My love never meant much to you dear
For to you I was always a friend
Oh why did I fall
You have no heart at all
Sometimes you just can't win

I can't live like this any longer
Not knowing just where I stand
I know I shouldn't care
But sweetheart it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just can't win


And then when the sunshines the brightest
And the world looks alright, again
The clouds fill the sky's
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

No sometimes you just can't win.......

Let's keep each other awake
Our hearts, now they beat the same

The seam of all the paths we've crossed
A colour wheel that spins around
Weave all into one
The price of getting setting suns
We're running to the beat of the drum
We are the creatures, rays and larks

To release the love in me

Stay right here with me forever baby

Lay me down upon my bed
And make me feel the heat
Of your body next to mine

You captured all my life
In just one night of ecstasy
You brought me to my knees

The sooner I take more responsibilities
I can truly say
I am grateful for my world

Is whatever you do, some will undo
And sometimes destroy
And there's someone still left in darkness

What we see today
Are the results of the mistakes they made yesterday
And what we see tomorrow
Will be the results of what we do today

Has been replaced with money and power
The children, they are the futures
So teach them how to love themselves
And they will love others

Written on a face that he's guilty as a criminal
It's time to change your attitude

To a funky rhyme that's kickin' knowledge that we need
We lie about our hair
And we know we got a weave
Politicians lie about the things they're gonna do
And everybody's tale affects me and you
A smoker lies about the money that he stole
And a dope dealer never tells you how he got his gold
I guess what Debbie T. is really trying to say

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on

I'm seem forever, since time began 
So full of mysteries we don't understand
Searching for answers and remedies
As problems plague us like an enemy

Round and round in circles we go
Will we ever stop, nobody knows
Running with the hands of time
Always reaching, still we seem to find
Time just marches on

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on

So many blinded by life today
When will we realize love the only way
It's time to wake up
'Cause times have changed
Time waits for no one
It's a crucial game

Round and round in circles we go
Will we ever stop, nobody knows
Running with the hands of time
Always reaching, still we seem to find
Time just marches on

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on

Take care of business, don't procrastinate
We must decide on what becomes our fate
Nation to nation, love is the key
Let's take the time we need more unity

Round and round in circles we go
Will we ever stop, nobody knows
Running with the hands of time
Always reaching, still we seem to find
Time just marches on

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,

Verse 1
Many say
That I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from.
But you will see
It's just a matter of time
My love surely make you mine

(1)
Well, I'm
Livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone is so uptight
Nothin's wrong, it's alright, my man
I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on
With my man
People out there can understand

(2)
I'm givin him somethin he can feel
To let him know this love is real
This love is real

So much joy for us it seems
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams?
(hey, oh yeah)
And that's exactly why I'm singing this song to you
To let you know that real dreams do come true.
You tell me 'what does it mean'.",Giving Him Something He Can Feel

Yo I know En Vogue will love me 
'Cause I`m too fly 
I'll do my jerkin' dance make 'em

And do my own thang

Me and my girlfriends broke down to the club 
The minute we stepped in 
We were being asked to the dance floor 
Before I got his name 
He was hittin' on me strong 
But I knew from the conversation 
He was a little bit too young 
 
[Chorus]

Brown leather combat sales tag on his hat 
He wore his clothes inside-out (yo mental tip, oh) 
He had a funky step and I thought he was so cute 
But as far as hooking up with him 
He had to come harder than that, yeah 
 
[Chorus]

When the set was over 
We headed out to the car 
He politely asked to walk me out 
He's playng good so far 
The minute I blinked my eyes 
He snuck in a little kiss 
So I swung out quick to smack him one 
But I'm glad I missed

It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings

Here's a flow
An En Vogue hip-hop intro
Time to rap talk about the info
Pertaining to the four
Who re-opened the harmony door
(And let the vocals soar)

(Shoo wop shoo wop)

All of the gossipin' it put us in a recite mode
Unloadin' while the grooves explodin'
Just steppin' and keepin' pepin'

About our history and our passin'
How long (steady, strong)
Will the En Vogue be lastin'?
Askin' or predictin'

Trying to down Dawn, Maxine, Terry or Cindy
Black, beautiful, intelligent
Well structured and strong
It's gonna be along for ever hold on

repeat chorus

(It ain't over)

So, continuing my flow
Goin' back about two years ago
Lip-synching was the way to go, though
a face to a voice, a voice to a face
All the real talent was just going to waste

The word was out
A talent-search was on
Auditioned with ambition
A vision
En Vogue was born
To sing, the essential ingredients mended
Four individuals perfectly blended
Strong mind, positive, attitude is a must
Group trust
Eliminated the outside rush
Using lies as alibis to get to us it's strange
Negative attenion you gain in the world while you entertain
Stuck up - of course not
Just the knives in our back
Those coming from behind on a publicity attack
Not easy duplicating the four
There's a lot more in store
Until the fat lady roars

repeat chorus

People wonder if we're rich
I'll tell you this
More money now than before the music hit
And our hair, of course it's real
We just jazz it up a bit for the sex appeal
And no we don't lip-synch
It's all from the heart
2 Tuff-Enuff Productions put us on the charts
A few answers I thought I should give
For the minds who enquire how the En Vogue lives
Born to sing, and we proved it
A gift from the man above
Peace to our fans, and to competitors
One love
Sorry, not in it for the competition status-quo
Our only perspective is to grow
And to blow, ya know

You used to have time for me

Neither hold back tears

The day that you and me
Could not communicate
It came to my surprise
The only reason why
We misused the four-letter words
I should have known the signs
Instead I was blind
Ignoring what people would say
When will I ever learn 
Can't blame it all on one word
Some words can seem more brutal than kind

That love don't love nobody (got to be you)

Don't just say you love me (baby)

I would hide my true feelings
And when I spoke up to my friends
They made fun of my dreams
So then times got too rough
I would think back on one thing

Forces of evil struck back and forth
Throughout my younger days
Because I would listen
And care what other people would say

And built my own tiny world with respect

En Vogue,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",Thanks/Prayer

",Runaway Love [Extended Version]
En Vogue,"There's a question with so many answers
No one knows them all
No high powered scholar
High paided by the hour
Could come up with the answers
To this complex question

What is love 
I want to know, I just gotta know

How is that we can make mass destruction
With one single bomb
But can't find a solution
To one simple problem
That has troubled us all

What is love 
I want to know, I just gotta know

Why is it that
We can make smart computers 
That think for themselves
But can't make a computer
To match lonely people
With one thing in common
To fall in love with each other

What is love 
I want to know, I just gotta know

Maybe one day they'll
Make up a word that sums up love 
That won't be so complex 
And fits with the rest
But for now we are stuck
With this word and no luck 

What is love 
I want to know, I just gotta know",What Is Love

Uh, hey hey
All right, yeah

What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man

I want to take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's, he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found someone that can make me laugh
You so crazy, I think I want to have your baby

What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man

My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Say it again y'all
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man

My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a nucca out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that

I got a good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man

En Vogue,"[Chorus]
Falling in love
It grabs me; it scares me
It knows how to inform me
Falling in love
It takes me on a journey
Of emotions deep inside me
Falling in love
Nothing prepared me
For this feeling that I'm feeling
Falling in love
It's draining; it's wearing
I surrender completely

Ooh I wasn't ready for this
It's good it's bad
I'm happy and I'm sad
A mystery to behold
It speaks only to heart and soul
Like a melody deep inside of me
I saw that love keeps playing on and on
A symphony so glad I hear
Angels whispering

[Chorus]

I never knew that life could be
So heavenly I'm feeling free
Oh how could something be so satisfying?
And yet a feeling of fearfulness
Is lurking in the mist of the bliss
Inside my heart, but I know that's all a part

[Chorus]

I'm a business queen
In a courtroom kingdom
But when it comes to love
There's no software made for that
Love oh love you came
You turned my perfect world upside down
Like a work of art
Love has shaped my heart

[Chorus until fade]",Falling in Love
En Vogue,"Me and my friends, we went out last night
To a small simple club on the nights
It didn`t have much room, but hell they never do
Just chairs, a few tables, and some food

A small cramped band started playing, and all the room was swaying
Soon I found myself dancing, with a tall dark man
I was in a trance, a sort of romance
Between the rhythm and my soul, ohh

[Chorus]
Oooh, I wake up in the morning
And it`s all me, I can hear the calling
And it`s haunting each and everything
I didn`t know my Latin love was oh so strong
Even in the middle of romancing, really love the rhythm when I`m dancing
Can`t deny the spirit when you feel the Latin soul

After that night, my life had changed
I had no control and now I would behave
Every chance I got, I was at the club
Wining and dining like there was no tomorrow

Ooooh, oooh, So free
Ooooh, oooh, So me, yea yea
Ooooh, oooh, So lifting
And I don`t want it to stop, no

[Chorus: x]

If your life can`t seem to get going, hopelessness is showing
To your soul, and to Latin
Get into the sounds, of the rhythms beating out
'Cause when your dancing, your spirit will be free, yea

Ooh, ooh, So free yea
Ooh, ooh, So me, yea yea
Ooh, ooh, So uplifting, yea
And I don`t want it to stop, no

[Chorus: x3]",Latin Soul
En Vogue,"It's just like this,

I can't resist... the passion was so strong.
As I looked into your eyes, I became a little weak and i was mesmerized.

I never would've met you if I wasn't late
Oh, my mistake for hitting your new car
Somethin 'bout you took me in, somethin 'bout that dark brown skin
Somethin 'bout that sexy smile, somethin 'bout you drove me wild
And now I'm crazy, they're gonna put me away
(chorus)
As I can't believe this world without the sun
I can't believe my heart without your love
Those who don't understand, I haven't had anyone to win my heart
Like you've done to me this far

So what part of the game is this, I'm s'posed to be real smooth
Instead I'm stumblin' over words and s***, You got me nervous
Shakin', makin' my hands sweaty
Nobody's ever had this effect on sweet Sparzetti
I find myself doin' things I'd never do
Lately I've been b****in' on my friends and dissin other men for you
All I think about is you and I don't like you one bit, (what?)

I take the blows and I do it with ease 
I dish it out very hard there's no doubt 
And I won't let love take me out

A fool indeed 
To let someone 
Break me down to my knees 
I was wreckless

There's no rule for that in my world 
And yet that's plan 

Say bye bye to the teary brown eyes 
And the big sad face with an upside down smile

And I couldn't change the facts and that's a fact
He loves her more than he loves me

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.

Enchant,"When I spoke with you today
I didn't know what to say
It's been so long, so long
I said I'm doing fine
But what haunts my troubled mind
Is where it all went wrong, so wrong
I did not suspect
That we would not connect
And end up strangers
I could dance with you all night
Make love by candlelight
We could talk and talk but it's all in spite
Because you'll never be my friend
I could walk with you through the rain
We could share each other's pain
We could do all this but it's all in vain
Because you'll never be my friend
As time goes flying by
I have to wonder why
I don't see you anymore
they call it chemistry
What will or will not be
What's missing between you and me
When I spoke with you today
I didn't know what to say
Maybe so long, so long
If you chance on me some night
Underneath some lone streetlight
Just wave and say,""So long ,so long""
I do not regret
The chance I shan't forget
And we're no longer strangers
You could dance with me all night
Make love by candlelight
We could talk and talk but it's all in spite
Because I'll never be your friend
You could walk with me through the rain
We could share each other's pain

Enchant,"I run my desperate trembling hands
Along the floor were you once walked
Fighting tears that come from loss
I brave the rooms where we once talked
You took a part of me I never can reclaim
Your spirit's in my heart
But you know it's not the same
Straining to beat this blur of tears
Swollen eyes beg for my dead friend
Reminiscing with a photograph
Drives home (that) what was won't be again
I will to guarantee my reason will prevail
Pain breeds the need for make believe
To soothe a heart that's fail
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
As surely as day turns into night
I drop down to my knees and plead with the sky
Of course it does no good
But I'll give anything a try
Gazing,thinking,standing on a cliff
That guards the blue-green of the sea
I accept the blueprint of the world,that
All must pass away that's come to be
You meant so much to me
That's why there's all this pain
So much improved from our exchange
It will never be same
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
As surely as day turns into night
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
We all suffer loss
As surely day changes into night",At Death's Door

Enchant,"My destination is unknown
And I've lost my way
But I still have water
With my rations running low
I am so fatigued
Can I go much further?
Lost and all alone
In the blazing heat
And it just gets hotter
Sweat drips down my skin
And string my eyes
As I look toward the distance
Blistered hands block the sun
That blinds my sight
And dances on the horizon
Is there something up ahead?
Or just a mirage
Fooling me again
Another dried up waterhole
Lacking nourishment
Quench my thirst and feed my mind
The place that I seek is so far away
And I don't know which way to go
The vision I see is a holy place
That is tranquil to the soul
Just a nomad sailing across this earthly sea
Searching on and on for sanctuary
Weary from the chase of life's eluding dream
Strive to reach that goal but it's never ending
Raise my canteen to parched lips
Taste the water so sweet
Take one last swallow
So many miles I have come
So many more to go
Down the path I follow
Funny how we lose our way
Through this desolate land
Lives are grains of sand
Which way will the wind blow?
Sifting through our hands
To fall wherever they may
The place that I seek is so far away
And I don't know which way to go
The vision I see is a holy place
That is tranquil to the soul",Oasis
Enchant,"Take a look outside your window
And tell me what you see
Does everything look fine to you?
It seems the air is a little hazy
And the grass is much too green
What's this world coming to?
I see you haven't noticed
What's happening around you
Tell me who is fooling who?
If you choose not to take notice
And you look the other way
The path's not yours to choose
Open eyes tell no lies
The blind can see through open eyes
How is the view looking through closed eyes
It must seem very dim
Living life in such fear
Like a blind man in the darkness
Clutches to familiar things
Until he's sure the path is clear
See the walls you've built around you
It's a fortress that you've made
Such a lonely solitude
But your fortress is a prision
And you locked yourself away
Sheltered from the truth
Open eyes
If you opened up your eyes
Open eyes
You would see through the disguise
Open eyes
Accept the truth refute the lies
Open eyes
Open eyes tell no lies
The blind can see through open eyes
So think about who's thinking for you
Do you have a life to waste
Seeing what they want you to see?
You can lead a horse to water
But you cannot make him drink
Having the choice means everything
See the walls you've built around you
Too much trouble to escape
Well I guess that you're doomed
To live a life of indecision
You're buried alive,too late
Shall I seal up your tomb?
Open eyes tell no lies
The blind can see through open eyes",Open Eyes
Enchant,"There's a man who is lonely
This could change if he'd only
Take a chance and risk stepping outside himself
There's a girl he's been seeing
From afar he's been dreaming
he could have her if he were someone else
So he silently awaits
A major change in fate
A change that comes too late
And you're reaching for a star
But can you reach that far
Standing where you are?
The wanting was too much
You're longing for her touch
It's not within your clutch
There's a man who's been thinking
To himself he's been dreaming
How to build a skyscraper to the stars
Now he starts to go to it
He's so sure he can do it
Though he's lacking the knowledge of design
Now his dream comes crashing around him
And tumbles to the sea
Along with all he wanted to be
A realization strikes him
A harsh reality
He doesn't know everything
When the student tries to teach
The knowledge that you seek
Lies just outside your reach
There's a thirst you have to learn
A hunger inside burns
Time for the page to turn
It's the wanting,It's the hoping,It's the longing
There's a flame within your soul
To strive to reach your goal
But dreaming takes its toll
It's nature's own device
To grab and roll the dice
But each toss has its price
Emotions starts to flow
Your heart takes control
And steers you down the road
Your destination is no concern
The impulsive never learn
Just another bridge to burn
It's the wanting,It's the hoping,It's the longing...",The Thirst
Enchant,"Not what I've done, not what I've spoken
Not what I've shown, not that I lied
Just holding on would render me broken
But weak as I am, my hands remain tied

Fear of wrath, fear of pain
Fear of facing what I am
Fear this might, leave a stain
Of your blood on my hands

My face is scarred, my hands unclean
Can't wash away the fool I've been
Murder one or suicide
Which would be the greater sin?

Straining to hold each breath I'm taking
A shackle that pulls, I can't set it free
Not quite below, but slowly I'm breaking
In saving you I, I would be killing me

Fear of wind, fear of rain
We built this house on shifting sand
Fear this might, leave a stain
Of my own blood on my hands

My face is scarred, my hands unclean
Can't wash away the fool I've been
Murder one or suicide
Which would be the greater sin?

A wave that hits from behind me
A weight that pulls from beneath
A storm that blows all around me
A fear inside that has bound me

Fear of wrath, fear of pain
Fear of facing what I am
Fear this might, leave a stain
Of your blood on my hands

My face is scarred, my hands unclean
Can't wash away the fool I've been
Murder one or suicide
Which would be the greater sin?

And see a full and swollen moon
Resplendent in a stormy sky
I look through your gaze, its source is pure and uncorrupted
And see a wilderness of dunes, untouched,uninterrupted

Pessimis protects me
Limp hope won't let me down
Still i lust for the pure
It unties the knots and turns me around

I swear,I won't unravel this time...
I banish ""too good to be true"" from my mind
I'm steeled in my resolve by this gem I never thought I'd find
The echoes of your laughter fall upon me,like the calming rain
They intimate a surreal world,smooth-surfaced and free of stain

His cries echo by, like a river's endless flow
To wear away the stone, carve his life like a knife
The scars he'll never show

Broken dreams shatter the still
I'm invincible, unbeatable
Splintered hearts and lacking the will
I'm unstoppable, untouchable

The battle's just begun, he's standing ground
Tall and proud, despite the wind that blows
As most his comrades fall like toppled trees
In the breeze where roots none deep had grown
Roots none deep had grown

Broken dreams shatter the still
I'm invincible, unbeatable
Splintered hearts lacking the will
I'm unstoppable, untouchable

In your dance of indecision
I never realized just how frail you'd be
Cracks have shown in your foundation
Castles made of sand crumble eventually

Soon the smoke will clear then we'll see
You and me, just who's king of the hill
The oceans swell with rage, earth did quakes
The bow may break, know I'll be standing still
I'll be standing still

Instead I act alone, decisions are my own

I can't conceive how I fooled my heart and lost my head

I realized that I stuck my foot right in my mouth
And what a big foot it is...

I wish that I could turn back time

Anything to make amends
Fix this break to where it bends

Staggered by it's beauty, saddened by it's modest stay
Taken all for granted, or innocence betrayed
A lesson in mortality: eventually every color fades

The novelty of love, feelings within my clutch
I try to savor but it doesn't taste the same
Senses numbed and jaded a little day by day

It's easy to point the finger and look away from yourself

Lost in today ...

Confused by choices ... or blind to cause-and-effect ...

Keep changing it, 'til you meet the grave

Enchant,"A sense of place, a sense of waste, don't know how this can be
The silence that envelops me whispers something subtly
Exhale and change the atmosphere
They've left a trace of their fear

[Chorus:]
How could something like this have happened in a place like this?
Such mindless violence
The surroundings hold their secrets
How could something like this have happened in a place like this?
A new day is here, but there's a trace of yesterday

Here the trees can speak in voices weak that suggest a tale of pain
Of tears shed in the pouring rain
But at that they halt their sad refrain
Look up at the vault of starts and the calming harvest moon
A witness to the unspeakable, and easily repeatable
Cry out to change the atmosphere
Some kind of presence is here

[Chorus]

Red wine spilled on the carpet; we can clean it up
Tracks left on the beach that the tides wash away
Footprints dug deep in the snow; they'll melt away
But what can wash the stain away from this place?
A new day is here
There are traces of yesterday
This place is stained; what will it take to wash them away?",Traces
Enchant,"Some say it's better off this way
Now it's over
You say, ""The future's looking gray
If it's over""

Yeah, there's sorrow as we break
But it's over
Yeah, we've had all we could take
So it's over

Stow away memories of yesterday
To think over
Run away, the truth you can't betray
Or pushover

Yeah, there's silence as we break
'Cause it's over
Yeah, you've made your last mistake
So it's over

Words they hurt, fingers point blame
Look to yourself and do the same
Painful thing to admit
This puzzle piece just won't fit

But we tried, and we pushed so hard
'Til something had to give
Still we cried, and I screamed so loud
I'm sure you had to hear

Now my fingers bleed and I need some relief
Because my back it breaks
So, I let you down before you fall
But still my heart it aches

Judgment day, the good and bad we weigh
And look over
Cast away your negative display
And start over

Yeah, there's silence as we break
'Cause it's over
Yeah, you've made your last mistake
So it's over

Yeah, there's sorrow as we break
But it's over
Yeah, we've had all we could take
So it's over

Enchant,"Some nights I lie in forced awakeness
My thoughts won't let me go
A sleep like death has claimed the world outside
The silence reshapes my solitude, from a refuge to a prison
Distractionless, nowhere to hide

Aloneness holds the mirror
I see things I just can't work through
Some things you'll never shine any light into
Like how to read what will be, from what has been
Like what's in store for me, and you

I wonder what my life will be
What lies ahead for the people close to me?
How can I make my peace with uncertainty 
In a sea of risk, swim with serenity?

Some nights my thoughts drag me to a cold, cold place: the dark side of mortality
Who will be the next to go -- their light blown out forever, in that merciless finality?

Lives are running novels; at times you read, at times you write
The choice of which to do might keep you awake at night
Should I just accept or act against this pressing moment
Should I run for cover or stand and fight?

I wonder what my life will be, a public failure or success in obscurity?
How can I make my peace with uncertainty -- in a sea of risk, swim with serenity?

I wonder what my life will be, what lies ahead for you and me?
Can I make my peace with uncertainty? I wonder what my life will be: I wonder:",In the Dark
Enchant,"So safe within this cozy little cell
No risk at all throwing coins into a well
I lust for gold, but shutter at the price
Reward I want, but not the sacrifice

And the target's well with in my sights
But my hands won't release the bow
I've been pulling back on it so long
I've forgotten how to let it go
And I know I have the means
But my will is gone
And I fear I won't succeed so I'm holding on

A life passes by, I watch passively
I'm haunted by time, my enemy
I fear that I'm bound, I fear that I'm free
And haunted by time, my enemy

I'm frozen by the fast approaching night
A dear that stares into oncoming light
It's time for me to come down from the fence
But either side invites a consequence

Waiting for the door to open wide
Waiting for the stones to find their place
The price it never seems to leave my hands
Intentions never help me in the race
And I know I have the means
But my will is gone

You still suffer from this state you're in.
You still suffer, still suffering.

Fade in the shadows, in trust you deceive.
You hold your breath underneath your lies
Confined, you leave the knife inside!

Shot down underneath, bring me down for what I need.

To be an end to his constant misery

The only thing that comforts him
(What else is left?)

And so he prays for this to end

Engelbert Humperdinck,"It was right here in this cafe
We kissed and said goodbye today
I've known that girl for so long
I hope I'm not doin' wrong

To lose her from my mind somehow
For those she's gone, she haunts me now
I think I should make a start
To put her out of my heart

Give me another glass of wine
To heal this broken heart of mine
And help me ease my achin' mind 
Of all the sorrow

For now, the wine's the only way
To help me pass the lonely day
Afraid of sleepless nights
And broken dreams tomorrow

It seems an old familiar score
That girl has left me twice before
Not long ago in my dreams
My dreams have come true, it seems

She'll call me on the phone and then
She'll say she wants me back again
But this time it was the end
Can't stand this game of pretend

Give me another glass of wine
To heal this broken heart of mine
And help me ease my achin' mind 
Of all the sorrow

For now, the wine's the only way
To help me pass the lonely day
Afraid of sleepless nights

Engelbert Humperdinck,"So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
With a song I just wrote yesterday
And I hope you can hear
What the words and the music have to say.

It's so hard to explain
Everything that I'm feelin'
Face to face I just seem to go dry.
'Cause I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high.

Thanks for takin' me (Thanks for takin' me)
On a one way trip to the sun (On a one way trip to the sun)
And thanks for turnin' me (Turnin' me)
Into a someone. (Someone)

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes.
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry.

And I know that my song
Isn't sayin' anything new.
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you.

How could we know the ride would turn out bad

Making plans was so much fun
We set our goals and reached the highest star
Things that we were after, were much better from afar-ar-ar-ar

Here we stand just me and you

She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call,
But she'll just hear the phone keep on ringing,
Off the wall, that's all.

For those she's gone, she haunts me now
I think I should make a start

And help me ease my achin' mind

To help me pass the lonely day
Afraid of sleepless nights
And broken dreams tomorrow

Not long ago in my dreams
My dreams have come true, it seems

She'll call me on the phone and then
She'll say she wants me back again

As I lay searching for sleep.
Her soft hand reached out, she whispered my name
As she brushed a tear from my cheek.

but a true love would not have gone wrong.
I'm just thankful for the good times we've had
for without them I could not go on,
With all these funny familiar forgotten feelings

stop walk' all over my mind.","Funny, Familiar, Forgotten Feelings"

And even if the words are not so tender
She will always remember
The way it used to be

Let your love surround me 
Make love to me now like never before.

With just your memory to hold 
I've tried to be strong, 
Reaching out holding on. 
Alone in my bed, 
I cling to each word you said, 
Wanting you more everyday we're apart 
And each precious moment 
Is safe in my heart.

Slowly time is passing somehow I get bye
Keeping myself busy
Is my sole occupation
I don't know
What I'm doing
But it fills my mind
Putting off the moment
When I can't escape you baby.
Alone in the night
Me and the memory
Somebody set me free
From someone who used to be.
A part of my night
Woman please let me go
You said godbye
Now here I lie
Alone in the night.
It's lucky I got lovin' friends who come around
Eatin' drinkin' talkin'
About anything out you love
Late night shows in T. V.
When they've all gone home
And then I gotta face it I am dyin' for you baby.
Alone in the Night ...
Lonely days are bad enough but come the night
My heart and I can't fight it
We remember come back we surrender.
Alone in the night
Woman please let me go you said goodbye
Now here I lied alone in the night.

But tonight this 'll do just as well.

Long ago I used to know where love was found, A place in the sun
Long before this heart of mine had broken down You were the one
But now you're a lonely memory My heartache will never end
Though all of those nights are far away I wish I were with you again. Portofino I still remember the sun in your hair
Portofino mariachi music that danced in the air
Portofino I want you back in my arms
'Cause every time I close my eyes I'm holding you in the dark
In Portofino where you broke my heart.
I think of your face and still it can take my breath away After so long
And though I'll be lonely living for only yesterday I'll get along
Though now you're a faded memory My heartache will never end
This unforgotten melody keeps playing over and over again

Es war die Stunde Null

Do nahmst mir vieles krumm
Auf einmal da war keiner mehr da
Und half mir auch nicht do
Jetzt liebst do halt nen anderen
Und mein Herz schaut traurig zu

Verdammt war ich glücklich
Verdammt bin ich frei
Ich hatte doch alles, alles was zählt
Aber ohne dich lebenJetzt ist es zu spät. /Wiederholen

You put your heart on the line
Every time after time and then you lose

It's only me and you

And falling in love
Like we're meant to do

Engelbert Humperdinck,"She was standing at the seashore in a mystic summer night
And the silver moon made diamonds out of all the tears she cried.
Though her eyes were filled with sorrow she looked so divine
So kind of beautiful just like a moonlight angel
So I asked why she was crying she slowly turned her face
She whispered softly to me love can hurt a thousand ways
And for one enchanted moment I was standing helplessly
Your kisses really put a spell on me


Oh moonlight angel why did you fly away
Tell me what's your heaven earning
Tell me is your heart still yearning
For a tender love you left behind
Oh moonlight angel how could I make you stay
If you're tired and lonesome I will hold you tight
Cause another heaven is hard to find


And she whispered I must leave now wait for me I'll be back soon
On her face I saw dark shadows cause a black cloud hid the moon
And I tried to say I love you please don't go away
But all the time I knew you can't catch moonlight angels
And I saw her disappearing in the darkness of the night
All I felt was sorrow and a burning pain inside
When I tried to walk behind her just to find the Promised Land
There were no footsteps, footsteps in the sand


Oh moonlight angel why did you fly away
Tell me what's your heaven earning
Tell me is your heart still yearning
For a tender love you left behind
Oh moonlight angel gone at the break of day

Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

And with the moon up above, it's wonderful

I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

Engelbert Humperdinck,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Engelbert Humperdinck,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white

Engelbert Humperdinck,"Sleigh bells ring; are you listening?
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight; oh, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Well, in the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, are you married? We'll say no man
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

Oh, when it snows, ain't it filling
Though your nose gets a chilling?
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Engelbert Humperdinck,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind",Always on My Mind
Engelbert Humperdinck,"If you want something to play with 
Go and find yourself a toy 
Baby my time is too expensive 
And I'm not a little boy 
If you are serious 
Don't play with my heart it makes me furious 
But if want me to love you 
Then baby I will girl you know I will 
Tell it like it is 
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide 
But I I I I I know deep down inside of me 
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride 
Life is too short to have sorrow 
You may be here today and gone tomorrow 
You might as well get what you want 
So go on and live, baby, go on and live 
Tell it like it is I'm nothin' to play with, go and find yourself a toy 
But I-I-I-I-I 
Tell it like it is 
My time is too expensive 
And I'm not your little boy

Engelbert Humperdinck,"So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
With a song I just wrote yesterday
And I hope you can hear
What the words and the music have to say.

It's so hard to explain
Everything that I'm feelin'
Face to face I just seem to go dry.
But I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high.

Thanks for takin' me
On a one way trip to the sun.
And thanks for turnin' me
Into someone.

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes.
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry.

And I know that my song
Isn't sayin' anything new.
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you.

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes.
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry.

And I know that my song

Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you.

Yes, after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you.

I'm still in love with you",After the Lovin' [Live]
