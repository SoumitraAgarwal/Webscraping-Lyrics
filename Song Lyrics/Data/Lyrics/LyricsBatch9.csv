Charles Aznavour,"Ils sont venus, ils sont tous l
Ds qu'ils ont entendu ce cri
Elle va mourir la Mamma

Ils sont venus, ils sont tous l
Mme ceux du sud de l'Italie
(Il) Y a mme Georgio, le fils maudit
Avec des prsents plein les bras

Tous les enfants jouent en silence
Autour du lit sur le carreau
Mais leurs jeux n'ont pas d'importance
C'est un peu leur dernier cadeau la Mamma

On la rchauffe de baisers
On lui remonte ses oreillers
Elle va mourir la Mamma

Sainte Marie pleine de grce
Don't la statue est sur la place
Bien sr vous lui tendez les bras
En lui chantant ""Ave Maria""

Ave Maria
Il y a tant d'amour, de souvenirs,
Autour de toi, toi, la Mamma
Il y a tant de larmes, et de sourires,
A travers toi, toi, la Mamma

Et tous les hommes ont eu si chaud
Sur les chemins de grand soleil
Elle va mourir la Mamma

Qu'ils boivent frais le vin nouveau
Le bon vin de la bonne treille
Tandis que s'entassent ple-mle,
Sur les bancs, foulards et chapeaux

C'est drle, on ne se sent pas triste
Prs du grand lit de l'Affection
(Il) Y a mme un oncle guitariste
Qui joue en faisant attention
A la Mamma

Et les femmes se souvenant
Des chansons tristes des veilles
Elle va mourir la Mamma

Tout doucement, les yeux ferms
Chante comme on berce un enfant
Aprs une bonne journe
Pour qu'il sourit en s'endormant

Ave Maria
Il y a tant d'amour, de souvenirs,
Autour de toi, toi, la Mamma
Il y a tant de larmes, et de sourires,
A travers toi, toi, la Mamma
Que jamais, jamais, jamais,
Tu (ne) nous quitteras",La Mamma
Charles Aznavour,"Bohemia de paris alegre, loca y gris de un tiempo ya pasado 
En donde en un desvan con traje de can can posabas para mi 
Y yo con devocion pintaba con pasion tu cuerpo fatigado 
Hasta el amanecer aveces sin comer y siempre sin dormir 

La bohemiaa la bohemia 
Era el amor delicidad 
La bohemia la bohemia 
Era una flor de nuestra edad 

Debajo de un quinké la mesa del cafe feliz nos reunia 
Hablando sin cesar soniando con llegar 
La gloria conseguir y cuando algun pintor 
Hallaba un comprador y un lienzo le vendia 
Soliamos gritar con el y pasear alegres por Paris 

La bohemia la bohemia 
Era jugar te vi y te amé 
La bohemia la bohemia 
Yo junto ti triunfar podré 

Teniamos salud, sonrrisa, juventud y nada en los bolsillos 
Con frio con calor el mismo buen humor 
Bailaba en nuetro sed luchando siempre igua 
Con hambre hasta el final haciamos castillos 
Y el ancia dividir nos hizo resistir y no desfallecer 

La bohemia la bohemia 
Era mirar amanecer 
La bohemia la bohemia 
Era soñar con un querer 

Hoy regresé a Paris cruse su niebla girs 
Lo encontre cambiado las lilas ya no estan 
Ni suben al desban 
Moradas de pasion soñando como ayer 
Ronde por mi taller mas ya lo han desrrumbado 
Y han puesto en su lugar abajo un cafebar y arriba una pensión 

La bohemia la bohemia 
Que yo vivi su luz perdio 
La bohemia la bohemia 
Era una flor y al fin murioo",La Bohemia
Charles Aznavour,"Que profunda emoción
Recordar el ayer
Cuando toda Venecia
Me hablaba de amor

Ante mi soledad
En el atardecer
Tu lejano recuerdo
Me viene a buscar

Que callada quietud
Que tristeza sin fin
Que distinta Venecia
Si me faltas tu

Una góndola va
Cobijando un amor
El que yo te entregue
Dime tu donde esta

Que tristeza hay en ti
No pareces igual
Eres otra Venecia
Mas fría y mas gris

El sereno canal
De romántica luz
Ya no tiene el
Encanto que hacia soñar

Que callada quietud
Que tristeza sin fin
Que distinta Venecia
Si me faltas tu

Ni la luna al pasar
Tiene el mismo fulgor
Que triste y sola esta
Venecia sin tu amor

Como sufro al pensar
Que en Venecia murió
El amor que jurabas
Eterno guardar

Solo queda un adiós
Que no puedo olvidar
Hoy Venecia sin ti
Que triste y sola esta",Venecia Sin Ti
Charles Aznavour,"Chanson souvenir
Refrain de rires et de pleurs
Chanson rétro, que la radio
Chante en écho, de notre histoire

Chanson souvenir
Qui rappelle à nos cœur
Que l'on s'était juré
Fiévreux, nous les enfants d'hier

De ne vivre que pour s'aimer
Enracinés dans le même univers
Mon amour
Oh, mon amour

Quand ta vie m'était offerte
Dans les champs
De nos printemps
L'herbe était plus tendre et verte

Chanson souvenir
Témoin de tant de bonheur
Qui vient souvent, tirer à blanc
A bout portant, sur ma mémoire

Chanson souvenir
Fredonnée joue contre joue
Quand tourne rien que pour nous
Un vieux disque en trente-trois tours

Chanson de nos souvenir
Hymne dédié à notre amour
Plus beau, plus grand, jour après jour
Qui tendrement dans nos cœurs fait jaillir
Nos souvenirs

Charles Aznavour,"Inoubliable
Jolie en diable
Créature de Dieu
Follement femme
Eau et flamme
L'amour pour toi n'est que
Jeux

Inoubliable
Comme le sable
Tu files entre les doigts
J'ai beau me dire
Que t'aimer c'est du délire
Oui mais ma vie, c'est toi
On s'est aimés, engagés
Enchaînés, désirés, déchirés
Comme des amants
Terribles et enragés
Mais hormis la mort
Rien ne peut nous briser
Unis éternellement
Dans un pacte plus fort
Que le sang

Inoubliable
Indispensable
Lumière de mon cœur
Tu me fascines
Nuit et jour tu illumines
Par ta présence
Mon existence
Assoiffée de bonheur

Inoubliable
Incontrôlable
Mi-ange et mi-démon
Sous tous tes masques
Tu restes belle et fantasque
Toi, fille d'Ève
Quand je te rêve
Au lit de mes passions",Inoubliable
Charles Aznavour,"Avec ton sourire au coin de tes lèvres 
Avec ton regard comme empli de fièvre 
Tu sembles sortie des mains d'un orfèvre 
Et je ne peux que t'aimer mon amour 
Avec dans ton coeur des points vulnérables 
Avec les fureurs dont tu es capable
Tu es tour à tour et l'ange et le diable 
Qui vient troubler mes nuits et mes jours

Ceux qui disent 
Des sottises
Et prédisent notre échec 
Je les ignore
Et t'adore 
Plus encore 
Avec

Avec tes façons de fille à la page 
Avec tes curieux écarts de langage 
Le peu de printemps que compte ton âge 
Je voudrais bien te garder toujours 

Avec dans ta tête un grain de folie
Avec dans ton corps le goût de la vie 
Tai trouvé en toi toute une harmonie 
Et je ne peux que t'aimer mon amour 
Avec ta pudeur mêlée d'indécence 
Ta maturité si près de l'enfance
Je voudrais bien te garder toujours

Avec tes chagrins 
Tes éclats de voix 
Ton rire enfantin 
Ta manière à toi 
De parler soudain 
De n'importe quoi 
Et qui vont si bien
 Avec toi",Avec
Charles Aznavour,"Un beau matin je sais que je m’éveillerai
Différemment de tous les autres jours
Et mon cœur délivré enfin de notre amour
Et pourtant, et pourtant
Sans un remords, sans un regret je partirai
Droit devant moi sans espoir de retour
Loin des yeux loin du cœur j’oublierai pour toujours
Et ton cœur et tes bras
Et ta voix
Mon amour

Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant

J’arracherai sans une larme, sans un cri
Les liens secrets qui déchirent ma peau
Me libérant de toi pour trouver le repos
Et pourtant, et pourtant
Je marcherai vers d’autres cieux, d’autres pays
En oubliant ta cruelle froideur
Les mains pleines d’amour j’offrirai au bonheur
Et les jour et les nuits
Et la vie
De mon cœur

Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant

Il faudra bien que je retrouve ma raison
Mon insouciance et mes élans de joie
Que je parte à jamais pour échapper à toi
Dans d’autres bras quand j'oublirai jusqu’à ton nom
Quand je pourrai repenser l’avenir
Tu deviendras pour moi qu’un lointain souvenir
Quand mon mal et ma peur
Et mes pleurs
Vont finir

Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Et pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi
Pourtant, pourtant, je n’aime que toi",Et Pourtant

You are the one for me, for me, formi, formidable

You are the one for me, for me, formi, formidable
But how can you see me, see me, si mi, si minable

Et puis le reste, on s'en fout

Charles Aznavour,"J'ai travaillé
Des années
Sans répit
Jour et nuit
Pour réussir
Pour gravir
Les sommets
En oubliant
Souvent dans
Ma course contre le temps
Mes amis, mes amours, mes emmerdes

A corps perdu
J'ai couru
Assoiffé
Obstiné
Vers l'horizon
L'illusion
Vers l'abstrait
En sacrifiant
C'est navrant
Je m'en accuse à présent
Mes amis, mes amours mes emmerdes

Mes amis c'était tout en partage
Mes amours faisaient très bien l'amour
Mes emmerdes étaient ceux de notre âge
Où l'argent c'est dommage

je suis fier
Entre nous

J'ai fait ma vie
Mais il y a un mais
Je donnerai
Ce que j'ai
Pour retrouver
Je l'admets
Mes amis, mes amours mes emmerdes

Mes relations, vraiment, sont
Haut placées, décorées
Très influents
Bedonnants
Des gens bien
Ils sont sérieux
Mais près d'eux
J'ai toujours le regret de
Mes amis, mes amours mes emmerdes

Mes amis étaient plein d'insouciance
Mes amours avaient le corps brûlant
Mes emmerdes aujourd'hui quand j'y pense
Avaient peu d'importance
Et c'était le bon temps

Les canulars
Les pétards
Les folies
Les orgies
Les jours du bac

Charles Aznavour,"Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois rien de mieux,
Même le bleu des cieux.
Plus blond que tes cheveux dorés
Ne peut s'imaginer,
Même le blond des blés.
Plus pur que ton souffle si doux,
Le vent, même au mois d'août,
Ne peut être plus doux.
Plus fort que mon amour pour toi,
La mer, même en furie,
Ne s'en approche pas.
Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois rien de mieux,
Même le bleu des cieux.

Si un jour tu devais t'en aller
Et me quitter,
Mon destin changerait tout-à-coup
Do tout au tout.

Plus gris que le gris de ma vie,
Rien ne serait plus gris,
Pas même un ciel de pluie.
Plus noir que le noir de mon c?ur,
La terre en profondeur
N'aurait pas sa noirceur.
Plus vide que mes jours sans toi,
Aucun gouffre sans fond
Ne s'en approchera.
Plus long que mon chagrin d'amour,
Même l'éternité
Près de lui serait court.
Plus gris que le gris de ma vie,
Rien ne serait plus gris,
Pas même un ciel de pluie.

On a tort de penser, je sais bien,
Aux lendemains.
A quoi bon se compliquer la vie
Puisqu'aujourd'hui...

Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois rien de mieux,
Même le bleu des cieux.
Plus blond que tes cheveux dorés
Ne peut s'imaginer,
Même le blond des blés.
Plus pur que ton souffle si doux,
Le vent, même au mois d'août,
Ne peut être plus doux.
Plus fort que mon amour pour toi

Ne s'en approche pas.
Plus bleu que le bleu de tes yeux,
Je ne vois que les rêves
Que m'apportent tes yeux...

Charles Aznavour,"Que c'est triste Venise
Au temps des amours mortes
Que c'est triste Venise
Quand on ne s'aime plus

On cherche encore des mots
Mais l'ennui les emporte
On voudrait bien pleurer
Mais on ne le peut plus

Que c'est triste Venise
Lorsque les barcarolles
Ne viennent souligner
Que des silences creux

Et que le cœur se serre
En voyant les gondoles
Abriter le bonheur
Des couples amoureux

Que c'est triste Venise
Au temps des amours mortes
Que c'est triste Venise
Quand on ne s'aime plus

Les musées, les églises
Ouvrent en vain leurs portes
Inutile beauté
Devant nos yeux déçus

Que c'est triste Venise
Le soir sur la lagune
Quand on cherche une main
Que l'on ne vous tend pas

Et que l'on ironise
Devant le clair de lune
Pour tenter d'oublier
Ce qu'on ne se dit pas

Adieu tout les pigeons
Qui nous en fait escortent
Adieu Pont des Soupir
Adieu rêves perdus

C'est trop triste Venise
Au temps des amours mortes
C'est trop triste Venise
Quand on ne s'aime plus",Que C'est Triste Venise
Charles Aznavour,"Qui frôlera tes lèvres
Et vibrant de fièvre
Surprenant ton corps
Deviendra ton maître
En y faisant naître
Un nouveau bien-être
Un autre bonheur?

Qui prendra la relève
Pour combler tes rêves
Et sans un remords
D'un éclat de rire
Saura te conduire
À mieux me détruire
Au fond de ton cœur?

Qui peut être cet autre
Qui sera cet intrus?
Dans tout ce qui fut nôtre
Quand je ne serais plus?

Qui prendra ta faiblesse
Avec des caresses
Et des mots d'amour
En couvrant d'oubli
Nos jours de folies?
Qui prendra ta vie
Au bout de mes jours?

Nous vivons à vingt ans d'écart
Notre amour est démesuré
Et j'ai le cœur au désespoir
Pour ces années
Car lorsque mes yeux seront clos
D'autres yeux vont te contempler
Aussi je lutte avec ce mot
De ma pensée

Qui sans que tu protestes
Refera les gestes
Qui ne sont qu'à nous
Lorsque je t'embrasse
Lorsque je t'enlace
Qui prendra ma place
Autour de ton cou?

Qui connaîtra tes scènes
De folie soudaine
Ou bien de courroux?
Qui aura la chance
D'avoir ta présence
Souvent quand j'y pense
Je deviens jaloux

Qui? nul ne peut le dire
Qui? nous n'en savons rien
Et mon cœur se déchire
En pensant que quelqu'un

Te prendra un je t'aime
Et par ce je t'aime
Je le sais déjà
Il prendra ta bouche
Il prendra ta couche
Et m'enterrera
Pour la seconde fois",Qui?
Charles Aznavour,"Toi et moi
Deux cœurs qui se confondent
Au seuil de l'infini
Loin du reste du monde
Haletant et soumis
A bord du lit
Qui tangue et va
Sous toi et moi

Toi et moi
Libérés des mensonges
Et sevrés des tabous
Quand la nuit se prolonge
Entre râles et remous
Nos songes fous
Inventent un nous

Entre chien et loup dans nos rêves déserts
L'amour a su combler les silences
Et nous ces enfants nus vierges de nos hier
Devenons toi et moi, lavés de nos enfers

Porte-moi
Au-delà des angoisses
A l'appel du désir
Du cœur de nos fantasmes
Aux confins du plaisir
Que Dieu créa
Pour toi et moi

J'étais sans espoir et tu as changé mon sort
Offrant à ma vie une autre chance
Les mots ne sont que mots, les tiens vibraient si fort
Qu'en parlant à ma peau ils éveillaient mon corps

Fais-moi l'amour encore
Encore et parle moi
Pour que jusqu'aux aurores
Aux sources de nos joies
Mes jours se noient
Dans toi et moi",Toi et Moi

Charles Aznavour,"Je vous parle d'un temps
Que les moins de vingt ans
Ne peuvent pas connaître
Montmartre en ce temps-là
Accrochait ses lilas
Jusque sous nos fenêtres
Et si l'humble garni
Qui nous servait de nid
Ne payait pas de mine
C'est là qu'on s'est connu
Moi qui criait famine
Et toi qui posais nue

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire
On est heureux
La bohème, la bohème
Nous ne mangions qu'un jour sur deux

Dans les cafés voisins
Nous étions quelques-uns
Qui attendions la gloire
Et bien que miséreux
Avec le ventre creux
Nous ne cessions d'y croire
Et quand quelque bistro
Contre un bon repas chaud
Nous prenait une toile
Nous récitions des vers
Groupés autour du poêle
En oubliant l'hiver

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire
Tu es jolie
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous avions tous du génie

Souvent il m'arrivait
Devant mon chevalet
De passer des nuits blanches
Retouchant le dessin
De la ligne d'un sein
du galbe d'une hanche
Et ce n'est qu'au matin
Qu'on s'asseyait enfin
Devant un café-crème
Épuisés mais ravis
Fallait-il que l'on s'aime
Et qu'on aime la vie

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire
On a vingt ans
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous vivions de l'air du temps

Quand au hasard des jours
Je m'en vais faire un tour
À mon ancienne adresse
Je ne reconnais plus
Ni les murs, ni les rues
Qui ont vu ma jeunesse
En haut d'un escalier
Je cherche l'atelier
Dont plus rien ne subsiste
Dans son nouveau décor
Montmartre semble triste
Et les lilas sont morts

La bohème, la bohème
On était jeunes
On était fous
La bohème, la bohème
Ça ne veut plus rien dire du tout",La Boheme (La Bohème)
Charles Aznavour,"How sad Venice can be
When you return alone
And find a memory
In a repaving stone

I woke among the bird
That fills in Marble Square
With a quote of her words
Around me in the air

How sad Venice can be
When the melodies play
A song she sung for me
One unforgotten day

Like a magic sea
The gondoliers go by
But when I try to weep
I find my tears are dry

How sad Venice can be
When mist is in your eyes
And you can hardly see
As visions fill the skies

I find the little street
And then the old cafe
Where we would always meet
To dream away the day

How sad Venice can be
Beneath the sun's moon
That rises from the sea
And singles the moon

I hear the vespers chime
And cross the bridge of sun
I know that it is time
To bid my last goodbye

There's nothing more to say
I pass beneath the light
And then I turn away
From Venice in the night

How sad Venice can be
It's too lonely to bare
When you have lost the love
That you discovered there

",How Sad Venice Can Be [Que C'est Triste Venise]
Charles Aznavour,"Now as the wheel of life turns faster
Now as the seasons seem to fly
I see so many things at last, but didn't see the time go by

I've known delight, I've known disaster
The caviar, the humble pie
From the absurd to the sublime
I didn't see the time go by

I didn't see the years roll on
I didn't know the road would bend
Refused to see when youth was gone
Pretending it might never end
Now, there is price to pay for every day I threw away

It seems I've wasted half a lifetime
Within the blinking of an eye
I didn't hear the midnight chime
I didn't see the time go by

In still of nights and brief romances
I kissed the girls and made them cry
While there were balconies to climb
I didn't see the time go by

I was the guy with all the answers, 
The halfway-truths, the little lies
So sure, so certain in my prime
I didn't see the time go by

I hit the heights, I bit the dirt
I left some wreckage in my way
I didn't see that lies can hurt
I didn't know how hearts can break
And now, they come to haunt my mind, 
The lives I touched and left behind

I've sung a hundred songs of longing, 
Of sweet regret and hope run dry
I've searched for melody and rhyme, 
But never saw how time can fly, 
Newer saw the darkening sky

I was a minstrel of my time
Who did not see the time go by",I Didn't See the Time Go By (Je N'Ai Pas Vu le Temps Passer)
Charles Aznavour,"You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back,

Charles Aznavour,"She
May be the face I can't forget
A trace of pleasure I regret
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay
She may be the song that Solomon sings
May be the chill that autumn brings
My be a hounded tearful things
Within the measure of the day
She
May be the beauty or the beast
May be the famine or the feast
May turn each day into heave or a hell
She may be the mirror of my dream
A smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem
Inside as shell
She who always seems so happy 'n proud
Who's eyes can be so private and so proud
No one's allowed to see them when they cry
She may be the love that can and hope to last
May come to me from shadows of the past
That I remember till day I die
She
May be the reason I survive
The why and where for I'm alive
The one I'll care for through the rough and rainy years
Me I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I got to be
The meaning of my life is
She, she, she",She (Tous Les Visages d'Amour)
Charles Aznavour,"You've got to learn to show a happy face 
Although you're full of misery 
You mustn't show a trace of sadness 
Never look for sympathy 

You've got to learn although it's very hard 
The way of pocketing your pride 
Sometimes face humiliation 
While you were burning up inside 

Facing reality is often hard to do 
When it seems happiness is gone 

You've got to learn to hide your tears 
And tell your heart life must go on 

You've got to learn to leave the table 
When love's no longer being served 
To show everybody that you're able 
To leave without saying a word 

You've got to learn to hide your sorrow 
And go on living as before 
What good is thinking of tomorrow
Who knows what it may have in store 

You've got to learn to be much stronger 
At times your head should rule your heart 
 
You've got to learn from hard experience 
And listen to advice 
And sometimes pay the price 
And learn to live with a broken heart",You've Got to Learn (Il Faut Savoir)
Charles Aznavour,"j’avais vingt ans une âme tendre
Toi seize avec tout à apprendre
Quand je t’écrivais des poèmes
Où tout rimait avec je t’aime

Le désir bouscule l’enfance
Dans l’herbe d’un printemps précoce
On s’est uni en simples noces
Notre témoin fut dieu le père
C’était un peu avant la guerre

Mais au vent  des amours fautives
Ce qui doit arriver arrive
Ta taille prit de l’importance
On nous maria de toute urgence
Mais un jour les choses changèrent
C’était un peu avant la guerre

Un uniforme sans retouche
Un fusil et quatre cartouches
Les champs brûlés de la retraite
Les barbelés de la défaite
Quelque part en terre étrangère
Je nous revois avant la guerre

Où sont les seize ans de ta vie
Et les printemps de nos folies
Quand pour nous s’ouvraient sur la chance
Les portes d’or de l’insouciance
Et que tout brillait de lumière
Avant la nuit, avant la guerre
Avant la guerre",Avant la Guerre
Charles Aznavour,"Lui il t'observe
Do coin de l'?il
Toi tu t'énerves
Dans ton fauteuil
Lui te caresse
Do fond des yeux
Toi tu te laisses
Prendre à son jeu

Et moi dans mon coin
Si je ne dis rien
Je remarque toutes choses
Et moi dans mon coin
Je ronge mon frein
En voyant venir la fin

Lui il te couve
Fiévreusement
Toi tu l'approuves
En souriant
Lui il te guette
Et je le vois
Toi tu regrettes
Que je sois là

Et moi dans mon coin
Si je ne dis rien
Je vois bien votre manège
Et moi dans mon coin
Je cache avec soin
Cette angoisse qui m'étreint

Lui te regarde
Furtivement
Toi tu bavardes
Trop librement
Lui te courtise
A travers moi
Toi tu te grises
Ris aux éclats

Et moi dans mon coin
Si je ne dis rien
J'ai le c?ur au bord des larmes
Et moi dans mon coin
Je bois mon chagrin
Car l'amour change de main

Charles Aznavour,"Mes jours passent, mes nuits pleurent
Et pleure le temps
Ma raison sombre et se meurt
Quand meurt le temps
Ce temps mort que je regrette
Tant et tant
Car sans joie ma vie s'arrête
Et je t'attends

J'attends l'air que je respire
Et le printemps
J'attends mes éclats de rire
Et mes vingt ans
Mes mers calmes et mes tempêtes
En même temps
Car sans joie ma vie s'arrête
Et je t'attends

Je t'attends
Viens ne tarde pas
D'où que tu viennes, qui que tu sois
Viens le temps est court
Je t'attends
Mon rêve inconnu
Quel est ton nom, quel est ton but
Le mien c'est l'amour

Pour que mes jours se transforment
Et que vraiment
Ma vie par toi prenne forme
A chaque instant
Parce que le vide me hante
Avec mon sang
Comme un peintre je t'invente
Et je t'attends

Mes doigts par petites touches
Font tes dents
Avant de croquer ta bouche
Éperdument
Mais ces rêves ne me laissent
Que tourments
Car je traîne ma détresse
Et je t'attends",Je T'Attends
Charles Aznavour,"How sad Venice can be
When you return alone
And find a memory
In a repaving stone

I woke among the bird
That fills in Marble Square
With a quote of her words
Around me in the air

How sad Venice can be
When the melodies play
A song she sung for me
One unforgotten day

Like a magic sea
The gondoliers go by
But when I try to weep
I find my tears are dry

How sad Venice can be
When mist is in your eyes
And you can hardly see
As visions fill the skies

I find the little street

And then the old cafe
Where we would always meet
To dream away the day

How sad Venice can be
Beneath the sun's moon
That rises from the sea
And singles the moon

I hear the vespers chime
And cross the bridge of sun
I know that it is time
To bid my last goodbye

There's nothing more to say
I pass beneath the light
And then I turn away
From Venice in the night

How sad Venice can be
It's too lonely to bare
When you have lost the love
That you discovered there",How Sad Venice Can Be (Que C'est Triste Venise)

I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you'd call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hour

The day she died the neighbors came to snicker
""Well, that's what comes from too much pills and liquor""
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen
She was the happiest corpse, I'd ever seen

I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how she'd turn to me and say
""What good is sitting all alone in your room?
Come hear the music play

Well just listen to me, there I was in Mr Orpheum's office
And he was sayin' to me, Rose!
Get yourself some new orchestrations, new routines and red velvet curtains
Get a feathered hat for the baby, photographed in front of the theater
Get an agent and in jig time, you'll be bein' booked in the big time

Oh what a dream, a wonderful dream, papa
And all that I need is eighty-eight bucks, Papa, that's it
That's what he said papa, only eighty-eight bucks, papa

It's uh, yeah, but it's only eighty-eight bucks
It's not like I'm askin' for a second mortgage on this place
What d'ya gettin so crick, why you gettin' crazy, it's eighty-eight lousy bucks

Charles Aznavour,"Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away
Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me, and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young",Yesterday When I Was Young

Et ces dechets do nucleaire

Charles Aznavour,"Vers les docks, où le poids et l'ennui
Me courbent le dos
Ils arrivent, le ventre alourdi de fruits,
Les bateaux

Ils viennent do bout do monde
Apportant avec eux des idées vagabondes
Aux reflets de ciel bleu, de mirages
Traînant un parfum poivré
De pays inconnus
Et d'éternels étés,
Où l'on vit presque nu,
Sur les plages

Moi qui n'ai connu, toute ma vie,
Que le ciel do nord
J'aimerais débarbouiller ce gris
En virant de bord

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles
Il me semble que la misère
Serait moins pénible au soleil

Dans les bars, à la tombée do jour,
Avec les marins
Quand on parle de filles et d'amour,
Un verre à la main

Je perds la notion des choses
Et soudain ma pensée m'enlève et me dépose
Un merveilleux été, sur la grève
Où je vois, tendant les bras,
L'amour qui, comme un fou, court au devant de moi
Et je me pends au cou de mon rêve

Quand les bars ferment, et que les marins
Rejoignent leurs bords
Moi je rêve encore jusqu'au matin,
Debout sur le port

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles
Il me semble que la misère
Serait moins pénible au soleil

Un beau jour, sur un raffiot craquant
De la coque au pont
Pour partir, je travaillerai dans
La soute à charbon

Prenant la route qui mène
A mes rêves d'enfant, sur des îles lointaines,
Où rien n'est important que de vivre
Où les filles alanguies
Vous ravissent le coeur en tressant, m'a-t-on dit
De ces colliers de fleurs qui enivrent

Je fuirai, laissant là mon passé,
Sans aucun remords
Sans bagage et le coeur libéré,
En chantant très fort

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles
Il me semble que la misère
Serait moins pénible au soleil

Emmenez-moi au bout de la terre
Emmenez-moi au pays des merveilles

Que les moins de vingt ans
Ne peuvent pas connaître
Montmartre en ce temps-là
Accrochait ses lilas
Jusque sous nos fenêtres
Et si l'humble garni
Qui nous servait de nid
Ne payait pas de mine
C'est là qu'on s'est connu
Moi qui criait famine
Et toi qui posais nue

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire
On est heureux
La bohème, la bohème
Nous ne mangions qu'un jour sur deux

Dans les cafés voisins
Nous étions quelques-uns
Qui attendions la gloire
Et bien que miséreux
Avec le ventre creux
Nous ne cessions d'y croire
Et quand quelque bistro
Contre un bon repas chaud
Nous prenait une toile
Nous récitions des vers
Groupés autour du poêle
En oubliant l'hiver

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire
Tu es jolie
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous avions tous du génie

Souvent il m'arrivait
Devant mon chevalet
De passer des nuits blanches
Retouchant le dessin
De la ligne d'un sein
du galbe d'une hanche
Et ce n'est qu'au matin
Qu'on s'asseyait enfin
Devant un café-crème
Épuisés mais ravis
Fallait-il que l'on s'aime
Et qu'on aime la vie

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire
On a vingt ans
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous vivions de l'air du temps

Quand au hasard des jours
Je m'en vais faire un tour
À mon ancienne adresse
Je ne reconnais plus
Ni les murs, ni les rues
Qui ont vu ma jeunesse
En haut d'un escalier
Je cherche l'atelier
Dont plus rien ne subsiste
Dans son nouveau décor
Montmartre semble triste
Et les lilas sont morts

On était fous

Car depuis hier je suis aimée
C'est fou ce qui m'est arrivé

C'est un gars qu'est entré dans ma vie
C'est un gars qui m'a dit des folies

Mon Dieu je ne suis plus la même
Quand il me murmure je t'aime
Je trouve ça si merveilleux
Qu'il y a des larmes dans mes yeux
C'est beau l'amour qui se promène
Quand un beau gars en tient la chaîne
On voudrait rester prisonnier
Rien que pour contempler son geôlier

C'est un gars qu'est entré dans ma vie
C'est un gars qui m'a dit des folies
Tu es jolie, tu es jolie
On me l'avait jamais dit
C'est un gars qui ressemblait à un ange
C'est un gars qui parlait comme un ange
Tu es jolie, tu es jolie
J'en suis tout étourdie

C'est merveilleux en moi la vie bourdonne
L'amour jaillit dès que je m'abandonne
Et quand il m'a soûlée
De mots et de baisers
Et qu'il sourit, c'est drôle
Je mords dans son épaule
C'est un gars qu'est entré dans ma vie
C'est un gars qui m'a dit des folies

Veux-tu de moi pour la vie
Oui.",C'est un Gars

If I could travel across the world

Higher than the clouds
We'll sail across the sky

That we're soaring, that we're floating off so high

Take me higher than all the stars above

Charles Aznavour,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

She was a red-hot hoochie coocher
She was the roughest toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

She messed around with a bloke named Smokie
She loved him though he was cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
And he showed her how to kick the gong around

She had a dream about the king of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with p-platinum wheels

He gave her his townhouse and his racin' horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them all a million times

Don't you remember how it used to be

You had a hard time waking this morning
And I can see it in your empty eyes
But there's no need for talking or walking round the block
Just to figure out the reason why

I have a hard time handing out warnings
I'll just slide on out the door
'Cuz I'm tired of everything being beautiful, beautiful
And I ain't coming back no more

Charles Brown,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.

Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

the thrill of them all,

All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure

In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll.

Charles Earland,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her

I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you
All this music and all these lights
I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you

This beat is giving me reason
To keep [?] I dove off the deep end
You a lady I want to befriend
I want to say more but I want to stay decent
Baby can we get, so left that we give seven days to the weekend
I got so many secrets
Dance floor, pillow talk when we reachin'
Your whining, I see it
Your body is a season, I get weakened
The bass in the subs got me tweaking
Let's awake in this club with this sweet kiss
My fault I'm ahead of myself
I'm looking at your eyes so you read what I felt
I'm cheating on you with you
Because eye contact what we used to do

Baby just sway along
I can't hear words so I play along
Maybe I'm wrong, but the waves are strong
Walk this way, won't wait for long
This the type of track to get naked on
Let's break away from the fog
This night is miraculous
We are after lust
Love is after us, come on

All this music and all these lights
I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you
All this music and all these lights
I just wanna be with you
After I dance with you
I just want to leave with you

Let's go

All this music and all these light
After I dance with you
All this music and all these light
After I dance with you

Clowns are all that I know
They like to put on a nice show
But when it's all over I ain't playing around
But when it's all over I ain't playing around

This verse ain't gonna write itself
Just gotta remember I'm nice as hell, higher than the lights in hell
Only time could tell if when I die would I get my kinda trail, try to sell
I'm writin' for a legacy, been everyone else instead of me
From the home of Alpo, but of a different pedigree
When I speak in jest, I need to inject
Hard to breathe from my chest, respect should never leave
I bet it be deep, or it never be free
The high is so incredible to me
I play the game of losing life, my two options:
I kick the habit, waiting for a new option, you got it
Loved ones say I'm too gothic, they think it's a new topic
Boo, stop it, these dudes be mobbin
And I'm the one that gets slapped on the wrist, that's some shit
Let me get a pack and a clip like click click

Clowns are all that I know
They like to put on a nice show
But when it's all over I ain't playing around
But when it's all over I ain't playing around

Sour to the brain makes the cypher complete
Don't try to get high with me, I use the fire to speak
I happened to be what most are trying to be
Fighting sleep and I ain't G-O-D, why? Because he doesn't know me
I've been walking a steady path to hell
I ask myself if Satan is ready for a challenge
I use him as balance, after the fire nothing else is on my palette
I don't want no one in my palette
If I should die, let it be from an overdose
After my first grammy, so my death won't hurt granny
I choke when I flow, never a toke in my flow
So many typos in what I wrote, I don't know if it's dope
Fuck street smarts, I know music theory
So go ahead and turn it up as if you can't hear me
I acknowledge the power of magic, and i use it clearly
Fear is moving near me, I am more en-fearing

Clowns are all that I know
They like to put on a nice show
But when it's all over I ain't playing around
But when it's all over I ain't playing around

It's magic, It's magic, It's magic, magic, magic
It's magic, it's magic, it's magic, magic, magic

Clowns are all that I know
They like to put on a nice show

But when it's all over I ain't playing around",Clowns
Charles Hamilton,"I've been fighting sleep saying prayers for the lost
I care for the law but I ain't careful at all
I wanna confess to every sin I committed
But I'm tryna be a rebel so give me a minute
Really I get it. Your fear for the misunderstood
Gives you the right to attack. It's understood
But to get that, get this. Decisions to make
Picture your fate and don't give it away
I'm sitting in place and standing my ground
Which is a disgrace to the planet I found
Can I be down? I want nothing more than to fit in
Forced into living but my course wasn't written
I'm growing past holding cash, knowing when to clash
Glowing from the past. Show me where it's at
Something's coming but my vision is cloudy
Here I am fixing to doubt me

Every time I think I got it figured out I run and yell
So you know I hate it when I'm wrong
So if ever I'm Correct I really hope you wish me well
Maybe this is more than just a song

I know why cops are shooting black men
We were raised to be threats, but I'm asking
Where does the change begin, at home or the precinct?
I stay alone being decent
I punched a cop, knowing I would lose my freedom
I let journalists choose a reason
But since then, the cops blacking out has been senseless
Unless you wanna have a talk about its senses
The strongest race is defense-less
Hanging onto Azealia Banks sentences
Forget it, we've been in the wrong for a minute
If Jesus was black that would explain the limit
I find freedom and they tell me i'm a gimmick
I blind treason and they tell me I don't get it
I'm sleeping with demons despite satan
Quite blatant, can I make it?

Every time I think I got it figured out I run and yell
So you know I hate it when I'm wrong
So if ever I'm Correct I really hope you wish me well
Maybe this is more than just a song

Isis might attack America next
You're welcome, since I decided to share what is next
Rap has got guns that'll tear up your vest
Flare up your flesh, ...just want to stare when it's wet
I'm ashamed to go to God but the devil's dumb
I got answers but yo, I'm forever numb
Better than some, but my head is a gun
Put a gun to my head and let the lead run
All I think about is white wine and redrum
Because when I smile the feds come
I sin too often to ever grin and walk
So God, please make an exception
I pray for St. Louis and the poverty block's of the world
I pray for women with their honesty locked in their curls
If my prayers count then I dare doubt
A good night's sleep is all I care about

Every time I think I got it figured out I run and yell
So you know I hate it when I'm wrong
So if ever I'm Correct I really hope you wish me well
Maybe this is more than just a song",Correct
Charles Hamilton,"Sometimes I wish I was common for a day but I'm modest anyway
The pain in my heart, yo, I gotta give away
Not to be a plague but we're dying for a change
Thought control has us all crying up the stream
From MySpace to Instagram coming together as in the plan
Gunnin' for forever but never giving chances
Progression is the lesson of mine
Depression weighs heavy on the mind, let me define
A physical weight is placed on your mental, disgracing haters
Is simple, take away al of your vanity and pimples
Family's an issue for the lost and rebellious
Girls stay alone, thugs talk to the fellas
The yuppies taste the paper, while the gangsters shank a hater
Independent artists want to make it to the majors
What we have in common, we can't wait to see the saviour
And none of us wanna hear later. Let's Go. Uh

Everyone, and I mean everyone
Take it back to the days
Where passion remains
We all gone be laughing away
I have to say to
Everyone, and I mean everyone
When God calls your name
And stops all the fame
So if you go hard go harder

Be clear on what your rights are, before you stand up
Think twice before you walk around like
Racism is fear, face is just appear
We stay live, and making decisions in tears
Take a sip, make a fist, break a break
Make a list of what you came to get, and make a break for it
Everything is black and white but no yin and yang
Which is why I don't spit with a different name
My shit is plain revolution, isn't a game
People crying out religiously, but when you complain
You get hit in the brain with a minister's cane
To be real don't enter the game
But at last, if your interest is fame
Then get your acclaim
Just don't nag, when you give up your name
Not trying to discourage, but I gotta just nourish
Develop yourself and then watch yourself flourish, come on

Everyone, and I mean everyone
Take it back to the days

Charles Hamilton,"It isn't fair to not share what I dare
But so many people are scared
Honestly why do we care?
Innocent lives lost, sitting beside a cross
Women don't like to talk, I'm only interested in my thoughts
Shit isn't my loss, but when listenting to my bars
It's different, but try Charles
Just to provide it all
I wish I could make you happy all the time when I rhyme
But I think you'll be fine when I decide to decline

Ain't this a bitch
I stay in the mix
My grave is a wish
I wish to be paid

Justice at last
Never been the type just fuck em and pass
But this is magic
Bust it and laugh
Stuck with the crash
Mustn't be sad
But when at last, I look in the mirror
I see nothing but scratches
Ugly it has been
That's my mask cause
Death needed success
But asking for risk

Lying in the mirror won't get you nowhere
Crying in the mirror won't get you nowhere
Try to get closer, and make yourself over

It's not your talent, man
You gotta have balance
Dag it, I had it
I approach tracks like a savage
Don't laugh at the sadness
I'm genetically predisposed to it
So I make music
Hopefully it's dope, I don't abuse it
I don't have a life outside of this
I'm quiet as shit
Can't get high but I sip
I'm trying to vent
Silence within
Don't ask me how I'm doing
I'm happy when I'm losing
Am I exactly who you're choosing?

Never have I been so down
Forget those clowns
Someone roll the window down
Let me blow the Indo out
No info just doubt

Rolling too deep like cops
Mama know she's my pops
We got shocked
Can we not [?]

Gotta stay the best

But a Goth in the flesh
Pac when arrested
Lots of breath, hot to the death
Droppin' next, prophets confess
You ain't see my coming with the hotness that I possess
I am not a Tribe Called Quest
Nor am I Kanye West
Not in jest, still [?]

Hope you're nodding your head, wherever you are

I take hip hop to the cleaners
Every time I drop my thesis, peep it
God is a woman and I got aborted
Don't ask my opinion, it's not important
I always tell [?] try pot and snort shit
And tell women touch my cyclops and force it
But chill, this here is more than just skill
A lifetime decision I'm given so cut the frills
Get down and stay in the lay down position
This mouth sprays something way out, you dig it
I get it, practice talking about living
This rap shit has kids walking around bitchin'
That's it quit rapping, kidnap a Jonas
Sit back, relax and get bitch smacked by my focus
This track is a trap if you have the focus
I lift rap when I rap when in fact it's bloated, come on

They say I can't rap about being dark no more
They never say I can't rap 'bout being Charles no more
Getting doped up in Baltimore, eating every rapper til they are no more
My story is glorious. Notoriously, a gory kid
Still ain't got no shorty in the crib
Report to me Big
The afterlife's spokesperson
My flow works I'm so certain
But I'm a perfectionist with my wizardry
I expect to get a wet kiss from history
I just can't represent it, shizzit
I guess I'll be depressed for a minute
Sipping on a mystic, going ballistic
I am no bitch on some Madonna chauvinist pig shit

My teeth are rotting out so I don't do it any more
My metaphors are metaphysical
A better lyrical exhibition is to go into Heaven and slit a throat
So I dissed Pac, crucified by hip-hop
Suicidal kids knock it, you provide the flip flops
To use when I decide to kick rocks at the rhythm
Pick it up, I got you

God thinks I'm ugly
Stop with the touching me!
Goth kids trust me
I can't let them down, I gotta carve
Watching me heal is the hottest part
In the sky see a lot of dark
I'm just a hermit with a modest heart
Some days require Tylenol
Women hate me like a twat fart
And these niggas ate me like a pop tart
My label wants to make me a pop star
I had a hot start, y'all wanted music and I dropped art
Until I pass off influence to killing off classes and apologize with the realest of passion
I am a tyrant but still I am passive, I'm using this deal just to reel me a bad bitch
Sit on my lap while she pictures me rapping
She's too bad nigga give me a napkin

This song is personal so, I hope you like it

All I ask for was a partner to smoke with
I couldn't fall in love because my heart wouldn't open
Started off slow, then harder we both went
Hard to stay focused, she's largely provoking me
Hopefully we can, nevermind, it's over
Maybe we'll reconnect at a better time
I left her, after I let her recline
Relax in the fact I'm not a regular guy
Her lips were the perfect match
I tried to hurt her back
Murder the cat and put the fur on my lap
I prefer she be back but forget it, I blew it
I remember why she said she couldn't listen to my music
We were too close, she was my new host
A parasite I am with a needle and loose ropes
But she was my high, the reason I'm alive
And just like a genius I said bye, but why?

I go down she goes down, there's no doubt
So now I'm back to awkward flirts
Keep my mouth shut and telepathically talk to her purse
Not she, just a random chick on the bus
We lock eyes and she thinks about giving it up
Or does she, cause she love me more than [?]
Could I love me more than she?
Could I just be scoring threes with my game?
Or was she the dame meant to receive my name?
Whatever, this song isn't winning her back

Of the good things that the Lord has in store

Charles Hiestand,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart

Little pleasures they will share

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You

And down and down I go; round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide.
I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame.
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire.
For you're the lover I have waited for,
The mate that Fate had me created for.

Charles Holden,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new

When the world is cold,

And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart,
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Go ahead and throw your hands up

No, I’m not playing, this is my trend
No, I’m not perfect, I wanna get it right

it's gonna rain
you better get ready and bear this in mind
God showed Noah the rainbow sign
it won't be water but fire the next time.
Way back in the bible days
Noah told the people it's gonna rain
but when he told them they paid him no mind
and when it happened they were left behind
I telll you it's gonna rain
it's gonna rain
lord you better get ready and bear this in mind
God show Noah the rainbow sign
it won't be water but fire the next time.
Listen they tell me when the water begin to pour
they knock on the window
they knocked on the door
they didn't know exactly what to do
You don't want this to happen to you
I tell you it's gonna rain
it's gonna rain
lord you better get ready and bear this in mind
God showed Noah the rainbow sign
it won't be water but fire the next time
Noah said I'm sorry my friend
God's got the key you can't get in
if something don't happen to the hearts of man
the same thing is gonna happen again
I tell you it's gonna rain it's gonna rain
you better get ready and bear this in mind
God showed Noah the rainbow sign
it won't be water but fire the next time 
Noah told the people in plenty of time
but they were to simple and they were to blind
and when it came that awful day
they tried to pray but their prayer was to late
I tell you it's gonna rain
it's gonna rain lord
you better get ready and bear this in mind

And if she's beside me I know I need never care

On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me",In a Sentimental Mood

Are still around us

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

That has paid the price of love a thousand fold

I'm so lonely I could cry.

Charles Mingus,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?
Charles Mingus,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Charles Mingus,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [Live]
Charles Mingus,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain

And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Charles Mingus,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

songs that made the hit parade.
Guys like me we had it made.

Those were the days.
And you knew who you were then,
girls were girls and men were men.
Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again.

fifty dollars paid the rent,
freaks were in a circus tent.

go to watch the Dodgers win.

Charles Trénet,"Kangourou, kangourou
Mon gentil p'tit kangourou
Aux yeux verts au poil roux
On t'aimait ici beaucoup
On t'avait rapporté
Du pays des grands étés
D'Australie dans un lit
Un petit lit de paille bien joli.

Kangourou, kangourou
Les premiers jours furent si doux
Tu sautais comme un fou
Gambadant un peu partout
Sous les arbres, dans leurs fleurs
Tu faisais le joli cœur
Les voisins sans courroux
Disaient : ""Qu'il est gentil, ce kangourou.""

Tu grandis, tu grandis
Le jardin devint trop p'tit
A la fin rassasié
De jouer à saute-rosier
Saute-lilas, saute-gazon
Un beau jour tu fis un bond
Et franchit, c'est malin
Le mur de la maison de Saint-Paulin.

Un gendarme qui passait
S'écria : ""Mais qu'est-ce que c'est
Que ce gros lapin d'choux
Qui saute le mur de chez vous ?""
Je lui dis : ""Ce lapin,
M'sieur l'gendarm' c'est un copain.""
Sans m'entendre, il t'emmène
Pour t'enfermer au Zoo de Vincennes.

Nous venions le jeudi
T'apporter des fruits confits
Tristement tu regardais
Les badauds qui te badaient
Et ton exil semblait dire
Est-ce bien vrai ou est-ce pour rire
Ou pour faire une chanson
Que tu m'as fait jeter dans cette prison.

Vint l'automne le temps froid
Et je compris ce jour ma foi
En venant un jeudi
Que tu allais mourir d'ennui
J'eus alors du chagrin
De t'avoir ramené de si loin
Sans savoir que ton bonheur
C'était de vivre du pays de ton cœur.

Kangourou, kangourou
Tu partis, gentil comme tout,
Pour des lieux merveilleux
Où l'on voit passer l'Bon Dieu
Mais parfois quand l'soleil
Brise de ses rayons vermeils
La pluie fine du mois d'août
Je crois te voir là-haut mon kangourou.

Librement, librement
Tu gambades au firmament
Sur de beaux nuages perché
Tu t'amuses à saute-clocher
Saute le toit d'la maison
Saute les vers de ma chanson
Loin des cages, des verrous
Et sans raucune pour moi kangourou.",Kangourou
Charles Trénet,"J’me souviens d’un coin de rue 
Aujourd’hui disparu 
Mon enfance jouait par là 
Je me souviens de cela 
Il y avait une palissade 
Un taillis d’embuscades 
Les voyous de mon quartier 
Venaient s’y batailler 

A présent, il y a un café 
Un comptoir flambant qui fait d’ l’effet 
Une fleuriste qui vend ses fleurs aux amants 
Et même aux enterrements 

Je revois mon coin de rue 
Aujourd’hui disparu 
Je me souviens d’un triste soir 
Où le cœur sans espoir 
Je pleurais en attendant 
Un amour de quinze ans 
Un amour qui fut perdu 
Juste à ce coin de rue 

Et depuis, j’ai beaucoup voyagé 
Trop souvent en pays étrangers 
Mondes neufs, constructions ou démolitions 
Vous m’ donnez des visions 

Je crois voir mon coin de rue 
Et soudain apparus 
Je retrouve ma palissade 
Mes copains, mes glissades 
Mon muguet de deux sous du printemps 
Mes quinze ans, mes vingt ans 
Tout c’ qui fut et qui n’est plus 
Tout mon vieux coin de rue",Coin de Rue
Charles Trénet,"C'est un jardin extraordinaire:
Il y a des canards qui parlent anglais.
Je leur donne du pain, ils remuent leur derrière
En me disant ""Thank you very much, Monsieur Trenet"".
On y voit aussi des statues
Qui se tiennent tranquilles tout le jour, dit-on
Mais moi, je sais que, dès la nuit venue,
Elles s'en vont danser sur le gazon.
Papa, c'est un jardin extraordinaire
Il y a des oiseaux qui tiennent un buffet.
Ils vendent du grain, des petits morceaux de gruyère.
Comme clients ils ont Monsieur le maire et le Sous-Préfet.

Il fallait bien trouver, dans cette grande ville maussade
Où les touristes s'ennuient au fond de leurs autocars,
Il fallait bien trouver un lieu pour la promenade.
J'avoue que ce samedi-là je suis entré par hasard
Dans, dans, dans

Un jardin extraordinaire,
Loin des noirs buildings et des passages cloutés.
Y avait un bal que donnaient des primevères.
Dans un coin de verdure, les petites grenouilles chantaient
Une chanson pour saluer la lune.
Dès que celle-ci parut, toute rose d'émotion,
Elles entonnèrent, je crois, la valse brune.
Une vieille chouette me dit: ""Quelle distraction!""
Maman, dans ce jardin extraordinaire,
Je vis soudain passer la plus belle des filles.
Elle vint près de moi, et là me dit sans manières:
""Vous me plaisez beaucoup, j'aime les hommes dont les yeux brillent!""

Il fallait bien trouver, dans cette grande ville perverse,
Une gentille amourette, un petit flirt de vingt ans
Qui me fasse oublier que l'amour est un commerce
Dans les bars de la cité,
Oui, mais oui mais pas dans
Dans, dans, dans

Mon jardin extraordinaire.
Un ange du Bizarre, un agent nous dit
""Étendez-vous sur la verte bruyère,
Je vous jouerai du luth pendant que vous serez réunis.""
Cet agent était un grand poète
Mais nous préférions, Artémise et moi,
La douceur d'une couchette secrète
Qu'elle me fit découvrir au fond du bois.
Pour ceux qui veulent savoir où le jardin se trouve,
Il est, vous le voyez, au cœur de ma chanson.
J'y vole parfois quand un chagrin m'éprouve.
Il suffit pour ça d'un peu d'imagination!
Il suffit pour ça d'un peu d'imagination!
Il suffit pour ça d'un peu d'imagination!",Le Jardin Extraordinaire
Charles Trénet,"La Biguine à Bango

Connaissez-vous la Martinique ?
Connais-tu là-bas le Bango ?
Dès qu'il entend jolie musique
Le voilà debout tout de go
Pour danser avec demoiselle,
Ah, c'est un galant damoiseau,
Demoiselle, tu as des ailes,
Quand tu fais Biguine à Bango…

Refrain

Mami, Mami,
Biguine à Bango
Mami, Mami,
Biguine à Bango !
La nuit à Bango !

La nuit et le jour on ne pense
Qu'à danser Biguine à Bango,
Jeunes filles vont dans la danse,
Les mamis attendent là-haut.
En buvant avec les nourrices
Elles chantent sous leurs chapeaux :
« Mami, Mami, c'est un délice,
Quand on fait Biguine à Bango. » (Refrain)

Le mariage c'est une fête
Où l'on boit du lait de coco
Et lorsque la nuit est complète,
Papi, mami, s'en vont bientôt.
Alors tous deux vite on commence
Les caresses dans le dodo,
On recule et puis on avance,
Et puis c'est… Biguine à Bango ! (Refrain)

Bango, Bango a des p'tits frères
Des p'tit's sœurs qui dans'nt à Paris
À Paris aussi on sait faire
La Biguine comme au pays.
Et tout comme à la Martinique,
Demoisell's ont le ventre gros,
On travaill’ pour la République
Quand on fait Biguine à Bango ! (Refrain)",La Biguine à Bango
Charles Trénet,"Un doux parfum qu'on respire, c'est fleur bleue
Un regard qui vous attire, c'est fleur bleue
Des mots difficiles à dire, c'est fleur bleue
C'est fleur bleue
C'est fleur bleue
Un rendez-vous en automne, c'est fleur bleue
Une chanson qu'on fredonne, c'est fleur bleue
Un jeune amour qui se donne, deux grands yeux qui s'abandonnent
C'est fleur bleue

On envoie des pneumatiques à fleur bleue
Les dimanches sont poétiques, tous fleur bleue
On se met du cosmétique dans les cheveux
Oui parbleu, pour fleur bleue
On jure que l'on s'adore tous les deux
Et l'on jurerait encore si fleur bleue
Ne vous plaquait, ça c'est vache pour un dragon à moustache
Ah morbleu!

Elle n'est pas revenue, mystérieux
Oui à jamais disparue sans adieux
Et je suis seul dans la rue larmes aux yeux
Larmes aux yeux, larmes aux yeux
Mais soudain le cœur bat vite, ah mon Dieu
La voilà c'est la petite, l'air joyeux
Non ce n'est pas elle, quel drame! C'est une assez grosse dame
Pas fleur bleue

Alors le printemps l'automne sans fleur bleue
Coulent des jours monotones ciel pluvieux
Et cet air que je fredonne sans fleur bleue
Devient vieux, ennuyeux
Pourtant ne soyons pas triste pour fleur bleue
J'en ai là toute une liste, c'est bien mieux
Amourettes passagères, joies peines de cœur légères
Oui, fleurs bleues

Un doux parfum qu'on respire, c'est fleur bleue
Un regard qui vous attire, c'est fleur bleue
Des mots difficiles à dire, c'est fleur bleue

La chance
Aux chansons
La France
À raison
D'aimer ces musiques, ces poèmes
Ils viennent
Dans nos cœurs
Y mènent
En douceur
Une existence un peu bohème
Et tant de souvenirs que l'on croyait incertains
S'éveillent un beau matin
Dans un refrain
Alors nous disons
En toute saison
Il faut donner la chance aux chansons ! (bis)

Tu te souviens de celle
Qui répétait toujours
Que la vie était belle
Au temps de tes amours
Elle revient légère
Sur l'aile du printemps
Pour te parler ma chère
De nos vingt ans

On danse sans façon
Au rythme des beaux jours qui passent
Mais les jours passés
Revivent on le sait

Charles Trénet,"Les chiens-loups

	1

Y'a des chiens-loups dans les coins noirs
Ils sont tous fous quand vient le soir
Leurs yeux scintillent dans la nuit
Quand tous les chats sont gris

Ils sont heureux quand il fait froid
Quand la neige bleue blanchit le toit
Quand le vent qui siffle dehors
Les fait hurler à la mort

Des traquenards sont organisés
Bien des chasses-croisés
Car les chiens cachés dans leur coins
Font croire après qu'ils sont loin

Ils ont des larmes de crocodile
Et des armes bien plus subtiles
Quand ils rôdent poil à l'envers
Les grands chiens-loups de l'hiver.

	2

Je ne sors plus après dix heures
Car c'est l'heure où parfois on meurt
Qu'on s'appelle Firmin, Jacques ou Georges
Ils vous sautent à la gorge

L'an dernier ils ont dévoré
Un meunier du nom de Sarré
Ils ont même mangé son chapeau
Qu'ils prenaient pour de la peau

Il faudra que j'quitte ces lieux
Que je change de milieu
Au Canada là j'irais bien
	Chez les oiseaux musiciens

Au Québec on dit que les oiseaux
Ont un bec en place du museau
Alors moi, j'hésite et j'ai peur
Des goélands crève-cœur.

	3

Je me dis où faut-il aller
Au pays des chevaux emballés
En Camargue il y a des moustiques
Qui sont antipathiques

À Capri, il y a des serpents
À Paris, il y a des agents
À Moscou on se rompt le cou
	La glace glisse beaucoup

Tiens le soleil caresse ma fenêtre
Et l'alentour champêtre
C'est l'printemps, les chiens sont partis
En wagons-loups, wagons-lits

J'n'ai plus peur, y a plus de danger
Les belles heures sous un ciel léger
À loisir déjà font du bien
Adieu souvenir très… en chiens !",Les Chiens Loups

Chante le vent
Il venait nous voir bien souvent
À Saint-Jérôme
On l'aimait bien

Le musicien

D'où venait-il ?
On n'savait pas
Il nous disait
Je viens d'là-bas
De l'autr'côté
De l'horizon
Là où se changent les saisons
Chante le vent
Chante le vent
Disaient les filles au cœur revant

On faisait cercle autour du feu
Pour écouter ses airs joyeux
Et la Julie la belle enfant
Buvait les mots de Chante le vent
Elle fredonnait avec douceur
Pendant que nous chantions en chœur
Et tous ensemble on comprenait
Que la Julie d'amour aimait
Chante le vent
Chante le vent
Il est à toi ma belle enfant

Pourtant un jour dans sa chanson
Chante le vent eut un frisson
Il nous parla d'un autre amour
Qui lui faisait le cœur trop lourd
Quand il partit sur son cheval
Disparut dans l'ombre du val
On regarda la pauvre Julie
Qui avait perdu l'amour d'sa vie
Chante le vent
Chante le vent
Ne reviendra plus comme avant

Dans sa chambrette ensoleillée
Julie ne s'est pas réveillée

Au repos des bénédictins

Sur la colline un cheval noir

Sitôt qu'en terre elle descendit

Combien d'entre nous se souviennent
Hochant la tete, ils disent c'était

Et les maisons qui tournent rond
Tournent aussi autour du monde qui est bon

Aussi pour mieux déménager
Nous avons toujours des monte-charge
Qui rendent les meubles légers

Par la fenêtre sont apparus
Et se balancent comme des soulards au coin de la rue
La rue, elle nous mène à la digue
Et près de la digue on va danser

Pas besoin de se reposer

La houle qui roule dans nos têtes
S'oublie quand on est plus au bord
On la retrouve les samedis soirs en fête
Avec les filles du port
Et sur un air de Marine Marchande
Voici venir en chaloupant la grosse Fernande
Bonsoir monsieur, bonsoir madame
On est poli dans les bastringues d'Amsterdam
Parfois, si la bagarre éclate
Pas plus de cinq minutes ça dure
C'est le temps de se mettre en tomate
Le nez ou toute la figure

Un bon genièvre nous déssaoule
On boit cul sec dans un grand verre
La lumière au milieu de la foule
Nous fait marcher bras ouverts
Quand on reviendra des îles de la Sonde
On se dira j'ai fait dix fois le tour du monde
Dix fois le tour du monde entier
Et sans détour je me retrouve dans mon quartier

	1

Jadis sous l'soleil des tropiques
Un jeun' Français sous-officier
Rencontra par une nuit magique
Une belle enfant : « Cœur de palmier ».
Il lui dit : « Je t'adore
Mon amour, mon trésor. »
Mais la belle fut rebelle à ses vœux
Et perfide, elle fuit
Un beau jour pour Paris,
C'est d'puis lorsqu'il redit chaque nuit :

1er refrain

Cœur de palmier
Du Sahara,
Pigeon ramier
Tu reviendras.
Ton amoureux
T'attend là-bas,
Bien malheureux
Dans la Casbah.
Le soleil augmente sa fièvre,
Sa soif ardente est de tes lèvres,
Prends en pitié
Son cœur très las.
Cœur de palmier
Du Sahara,
Pigeon ramier
Tu reviendras.
Cœur de palmier
Un jour, c'est lui qui t'aura.

	2

Mais un soir la bataille fait rage,
C'est le baroud dans la Casbah.
Guito n'écoute que son courage,
Car le chagrin l'a mis très bas.
On d'mande un volontaire
Il part vif comm'l'éclair.
Il arrive au bastion d'la Légion.
L'colonel ébloui
Le décor' la même nuit,
C'est alors qu'il chante pour ses amis :

2e refrain

Cœur de palmier
Du Sahara,
Pigeon ramier
Oui c'est pour toi,
Pour te prouver
Tout mon amour,
Que j'ai risqué
Ma vie ce jour.
Mais que m'importent blessures et fièvre
Ce que je veux, ce sont tes lèvres.
J'ai tant d'espoir
De désir fou,
Que pour te voir
Je donn'rai tout,
Car je suis tien,
Mon cœur est lié À toi pour toujours mon bien,
Cœur de palmier.

	3

Mais au cœur de Paris volage,
Cœur de palmier a vite perdu,
Après trois mois d'apprentissage,
Sa jolie mine et sa vertu.
De Pigalle à Clichy,
Dans tout' les boît's de nuit,
Elle rit, puis un soir, à Saint-Louis
On l'emporte, c'est la fin.
Quel tragique destin.
Le docteur dit en prenant sa main :

3e refrain

Cœur de palmier
Du Sahara
Pigeon ramier
Qu'as-tu fait là ?
Ton amoureux
Se meurt là-bas,
Bien malheureux
Dans la Casbah
Il n'a pas pour calmer sa fièvre
L'dernier baiser d'amour d'tes lèvres…
Et séparés
Loin de vos bras
Désespérés
Chacun ira,
Pigeons ramiers
Du Sahara,

Vers la mort qui vous prendra.",Coeur de Palmier

Qui soufflent des chansons pour les cœurs amoureux

Sur un lointain rivage

« Je suis ton amoureux,
Ce soir mon cœur t'appelle
Viens, partons tous les deux… »

Qui s'en va tout joyeux sur l'onde,
Voguant vers des pays nouveaux
Au hasard de sa course vagabonde,
Bercé par la chanson des flots,
Nos deux cœurs y feront le tour du monde
Tous les deux, rien que nous, c'est mon rêve le plus beau
L'amour est un petit bateau.

Ce fut l'instant suprême,
Le destin merveilleux,
On se disait : « Je t'aime »,
Sous un ciel toujours bleu.
Et des voix nostalgiques
Sous les étoiles d'or,
Pendant les nuits magiques
Nous fredonnaient encor : (Au 1er refrain)

Mais les lointains voyages
Doivent finir un jour.
L'amour y fait naufrage,
Ainsi sombre l'amour.
Un soir j'ai vu des larmes
Au fond de tes grands yeux,
Et j'ai compris : le charme
Était sous d'autres cieux.

Adieu notre petit bateau
Qui s'en va tout seul par le monde,
Portant le rêve le plus beau

De pommes soufflées
De rasoirs à main
En duralumin

Y joue des chansons d'amour
Et pour vingt cents on peut entendre
Un baryton à voix tendre

Les oiseaux sont couchés dans leur nid
Et moi je suis couché dans mon lit
Il fait froid ce soir il fait nuit
Alors tendrement je dis :
Bonne nuit bonne nuit Suzy
Bonne nuit bonne nuit Suzy
Suzy oh oui bien sûr
Certainement oui bonne nuit
Bonne nuit
Suzy jolie… euh…
Bonne nuit

« Bonne nuit Suzy »)

Sont effacés

Des reflets de lune dans leurs yeux si doux
Elles mettent des flammes dans les coeurs des garçons
Qu'elles soient filles ou femmes à la belle saison.

Et dans nos villages elles dansent le soir
Belles dans leur jeune âge font plaisir à voir,
Dansent la Sardane sous le ciel de la nuit
La mer catalane danse comme elles, sans bruit...

Ah! les filles, les belles filles
Ah! les filles de notre pays.

Quand elles viennent à Paris
Les hommes sur leur passage
Ont les yeux tout éblouis
En voyant leur corsage.
Quand ils s'approchent trop d'elles
Elles disent: Je suis fidèle,
Mon fiancé m'attend... - Où ça ?
A Perpignan, à Perpignan, si si si !

Elles ont la peau brune, les filles de chez nous,
Chacun sa chacune, le soir c'est si doux
Sur la route d'Arles, de Céret, d'Amélie,
Quand les coeurs se parlent, les serments se lient.

Elles sont aux autres, leurs poupées fardées,
Nous gardons les nôtres, elles sont bien gardées!

Ils vont partir

Qu'est fort comme un tronc
Les paye pour couper du bois

De l'oseille pour couper du bois

Vlà qu'ils s'installent
Dans la grande salle
De la taverne

Servez-nous-en du vin d'Arbois
C'est-ce qu'on boit
Avec l'argent des coupes de bois
On se paiera

Est-ce la boisson
Ou la passion
Qui changea le ton
De leur conversation
Mais voilà que nos forts coupeurs de bois
Coupeurs de bois
Ne sont pas d'accord
Et pouvez-vous me dire pourquoi
Ils se battent à mort
Pour une espèce de je ne sais quoi

La fille a peur
Des trois coupeurs
Puis elle s'en va
Avec un autre gars
Un vrai vaurien que celui-là
De coupeur de bois
Qui ne disait rien
Mais n'en pensait pas plus je crois
Et qui le lendemain
Pendant qu'elle dormait dans ses bras
Fou l'étrangla

Nos trois amis
D'assassinat

Ce soir fait l'endormie
A l'ombre de ses tours

Je marche allègrement
Dans la nuit provinciale
De ce décor charmant

Et soudain je débarque
Sur les barques tranquilles
La rue du Pont m'accueille
Et gentiment, me dit :
""Tu vois les jours s'effeuillent
Bonsoir mon vieux petit.""

Où si l'on tourne à droite
On retrouve toujours

Sous le ciel immense

Vers l'étoile s'avancent
Des rois étrangers

Des anges musiciens
Ah ! vite que reviennent
Les Noëls anciens
Mais les jeunes s'élancent
Ivres de courir
Vers la plaine immense
Dans l'avenir.

La cloche a sonné
L'enfant Jésus est né
La vache et le veau
Lui disent bonjour, bravo !…

In the wedding cake? 
You used to hold him right in your hand. 
I'll bet he took all he could take. 
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking 
When I hear the silly things that you say.

Note 1: roller, according to Chris Schell ""I believe
Mississippi slang for a car being used to transport a
woman is ""doroller or biscuit roller. Roller
meaning car would seem to me to make more sense in
terms of this song which involves a woman leaving and
in terms of the title which may refer to the year of
the car."" Thanks To Chris Schell;
Note 2: the farm of Will Dockery, in Patton's native
town Dockery, a Delta plantation town;
This is another familiar Delta piece. Robert Johnson
used the same melody in ""If I had Possession Over
Judgment Day"" and ""Traveling Riverside Blues"". It has
also been recorded under the title ""Roll And Tumble
Blues"". Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf have issued
versions of this as well.",34 Blues

And so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again

But just between you and me 
I've got my doubts about it
But just between you and me
You're too much to forget

So I've lost the only girl I ever loved
And so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I wanna cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes

Charley Pride,"A lesson too late for the learning made of sand made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand
Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well I could've loved you better didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

As I walk alone my thoughts're tumbling round and round round and round
Underneath our feet a subway's rumbling underground underground
Are you going away

The weeds have been steadily growing please don't go please don't go
Are you going away

Into New York City and Washington
Seen Montreal and Saskatchewan and Rhode Island
And I've worked in three all night service stations and drove a truck
Take me home my heart is heavy and my feet are sore
Take me home I don't want to roam no more
Well I slept all night in a water trough
Had the flu and the croup and the whoopin' cough
Had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
And I can't count the times that I've had a cold and sore throat
Not to mention all the times that I've cut my fingers on a sardine can
Take me home...
Well I can just see 'em all now just a gatherin' round
Mama's supper table when the sun goes down
And my good old pappy when the blessing is said
Fillin' up his plate with black eyed peas and side meat
And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's hot buttered cornbread

And I'll never ever make you cry
Yes I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love

Well a poor boy's chances for pretty girl's glances are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money if you'll be my honey here's what I'll offer you
Well I'll give you love

Now I want to carry you off and marry you if you will agree

Charley Pride,"(spoken)
I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk just a little way
As we talked of our future wedding day
And when she said she could never be mine
(sung)
I placed a knife against her breast
As into my arms she pressed
She cried oh please don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity

(chorus)
Only say that you'll be mine
In no other arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I started home tween twelve and one
I cried my God what have I done
I've killed the only one I loved
Because she would not be my bride

Though it hurts to let you go darling I want you to know
And I'll stand by you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear that he made you shed a tear

I say she's just another girl now just a flame that's lost its glow
And I say her name has slipped my mind now and she's just a girl I used to know

The yard could stand a little mowin' each time that I pass by

As long as my roof's over your head as long as you're wearing my shoes

And if my baby gets lonesome and calls my name in the night
Whispers sweet nothings tenderly and gently hold her tight

Fell in love with a pretty little girl when I was older
And like a fool, I figured there was something I could make of me

If I'm lucky I still got a few more years of livin'
And lady luck's never been a real good friend to me
I never asked a favor of a man in my life
But the preacher I'm gonna see

And tell him when I die say these words over me
Here lies a man who never asked the world for nothin'
He labored in the sun and slept in the shade of a tree
His hands was calloused but his heart was warm
For his mind was pure and free

The good Lord knows that's the way a man's got to be
It's all right, it's all right
I come up the hard way and fought a good fight
And it's all right with me

But it's all right, it's all right
I come up the hard way and fought a good fight
And it's all right with me
It's all right, it's all right",It's All Right
Charley Pride,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee
Charley Pride,"Tell me again how much you love me and that you're contented in these arms of mine
Tell me there's been no one else before me say you've only loved this way one time
Even if somebody else has kissed you say you've only known these lips of mine
Even if I'm not the first to hold you say you've only loved one time

Charley Pride,"You stood by me whenever times were bad and never once did I hear you complain
You always made the best of what little bit we had
And held your head up proud to wear my name
And that's just one of the reasons why I love you so much

You are the reason that I live
I know I've got a woman that no other man can touch
Who gives me all the love she has to give

You've sacrificed for dreams of mine that never did come true
You've done without to satisfy my needs
And everytime I've tried and failed I've found new strength in you

For not one time did you lose faith in me
And that's just one...",That's Why I Love You So Much
Charley Pride,"There's a church in the valley by the wildwood
No lovelier place in the dale
No place is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the dale.

How sweet, on a clear Sabbath morning
To listen to the clear ringing bells
Its tones, so sweetly, are calling
Oh, come to the church in the vale.

Oh, come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh, come to the church in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.

There, close by the church in the valley
Lies one that I loved so well
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, 'neath the willow
Disturb not her rest in the vale.

There, close by the side of that loved one
'Neath the trees where the wild flowers bloom
When the farewell hymns shall be chanted
I shall rest by her side in the tomb.

Oh, come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh, come to the church in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood

Charley Pride,"Hey, you left your room this morning
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ our Savior
Did you sooth for loving favor as a shield today?

Oh, how praying rests the weary
Prayer will change the night to day
So when life seems dark and dreary
Don't forget to pray

When you've met with great temptation
Did you think to pray?
By his dying love and merit
Did you claim the Holy Spirit as your guide today?

Oh, how praying rests the weary
Prayer will change the night to day
So when life seems dark and dreary
Don't forget to pray

When your heart was filled with anger
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace my brother
That you might forgive another who had crossed your way

Oh, how praying rests the weary
Prayer will change the night to day
So when life seems dark and dreary
Don't forget to pray, don't forget to pray",Did You Think to Pray?
Charley Pride,"Let me live again
Let me live again

A little taste of heaven that I had before
Was just enough to keep me coming back for more
After loving you, losing you was more than I could stand
Now I'm the ghost of what was once a man

[Chorus]
Let me live again, let me live again
Reach into my heart and light the light of love again
Let me see the sun let this darkness end
Take me back into your arms and let me live again

All the love in your eyes was so strong
From my first hello to last night's bitter tears
And darling I have loved you though in my world you don't belong
Do you remember that first night when I told you I'm not free
And the way we tried so hard not to fall
But somehow time and fate had brought our lives together

Charley Pride,"If tonight should be our last night together I'm not sorry that we fell in love at all
If tomorrow sun should find me hurtin' for you I know
That the price for loving you would still be small
For I'd never know the thrill of your sweet lips
And the chills I get just knowing that you're mine
'Cause I've spent my life not knowing what real love is oh no
Though I'd be hurtin' I'm still certain
That I'd rather love and lose you than never know your love at all

Charley Pride,"Down at the railroad station there's people gettin' on
Some are a goin' north some are a goin' south I'm just goin' to be gone
Some people are born to be takers others just want to give
Some people live just to love but I just love to live
For I was just born to be exactly what you see
Nothing more or less I'm not the worst or the best
I just try to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me

When people say their life is rough I wonder compared to what
Some are wantin' more and more's gettin' less I just want what I've got

On the road I'm wonderin' what I'm gonna say
Funny how the light's not turnin' maybe this time she'll be sleepin'
In the drive I'm wonderin' if she's okay
The house looks dark to me as I fumble for the key
Now inside an empty chair is all I see
In the kitchen on the table there's a letter and Lord I'm shakin'
Cause she's cried and wrote she's tired of waitin' for me
Instant loneliness all around me certainly my whole world has slipped away
Instant loneliness where she should be and this instant loneliness is hurtin' me

She once said to me that she'd grow tired some day
This empty house echoes the words she used to say
In the hallway there's a toy and a picture of the baby
A reminder of how much she took away
Instant loneliness all around me,
Yes this instant loneliness is hurtin' me",Instant Loneliness
Charley Pride,"Well I woke up this morning when the cold Chicago wind
Blew my newspaper blanket off my back
Through my dirty broken window the grey sun filtered in
As I dreamed about the Southbound railroad track
I could almost hear the crickets in a sleepy cotton field
As daddy drove our vagon to Virgin
But today I'd give a fortune for a twenty five cent meal
And I wish I was a country boy again
So let me ride on the Southbound
Back to where I came from I don't care or where I am
So let me ride on the Southbound and put me off somewhere near Birmingham

What happened to my vision of a mansion on a hill
And the fame and fortune I came here to win
I've got nothing but the roaches running cross my window sill
And I wish I was a country boy again
So let me ride",On the Southbound

Where the sad and broken hearts come in
To pay a little Gypsy woman a dollar she'll tell me how to start a new life again
Goin' down to that place for the lonesome
Have my future read from the palm of my hand

Please tell me good news Gypsy woman that my sweet love's a comin' home again
God only knows of my big trouble I thought I had a true love a love that'll never end
Heaven only knows how much I miss her Gypsy woman say she's comin' home again

A flock of geese flew overhead
Wind from the wings fall down to me come go with us that's my way
It grieves me much to see you cry I'll break a heart with my goodbye
I warned you ahead of time
I could never say I'm sorry but it has to be that's my way
That's my way to try to find a place I've never been
Before directions master me and distance is my friend
I try to put a lifetime into each and every day that's my way
I yearn to love but it can't be for fear of what's inside of me
With the each day setting of the sun
A passin' train stirs my soul like winds of long ago that's my way

I saw fame and fortune which I finally found
Everyone at home may know me and they say that I'm a big man
A hometown boy that made good and he's back home again
But there's a face in my memory that's stands out from all the rest

A face of someone special the girl I still love best
Well I asked my mom about Jeannie she said she married yesterday
Please don't try to see her son it had to be this way
Then my eyes fill with tears as I turn back the years

Your sweet lips still whisper darling I love you and need you
And once again I'll do the things I shouldn't do
And once again I'll come to you my heart just won't let go
When you whisper my name I lose all control
And once again I'll leave my world behind and rush to you and then
I'll be happy till I leave you once again

The price we paid for love is almost too high
But I can't find the strength to end it all

Back where the air is clear back where I can hear the whippoorwills sing me to sleep

In a Mississippi cotton pickin' delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothing much to do but hang around
In a Mississippi cotton pickin' delta town

Down in the delta where I was born
All we raised was cotton, potatoes and corn
I've picked cotton 'til my fingers hurt
Draggin' a sack through the delta dirt
I've worked hard the whole weeklong
Pickin' my fingers to the blood and bone
Ain't a lot of money in cotton bale
At least when you try to sell

On Saturday night, we'd get dressed up
Catch us a ride on a pickup truck
On a gravel road that nearly strangled us
That cotton pickin' delta dust
We'd sit across the street on the depot porch
Lookin' at the folks lookin' back at us
Munchin' on a dust covered ice cream cone
Wondering how we'd get back home

On an early autumn day
Freshness of the breeze brought the mornin'
And the sun came risin' up
Shinin' down on leaves that fell like golden snow
And the mystery of it all
Made the problems of the day seem unimportant
That Oklahoma mornin'

Puts Oklahoma sunshine in my soul
There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'
Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
It warms up your mind and your body
It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul

Our campfire came to life
The crackling of the fire and smell of coffee
Turned back the time
To a day when a man could listen for a while
To the sound of mother nature
Without the sound of industry in the background

That Oklahoma mornin'
Puts Oklahoma sunshine in my smi-I-ile
There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'
Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
It'll warm up your mind and your body

Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time
And Bobby clapping hands we finally sang up ever song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Oh but feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
And feeling good was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away
Looking for the home I hope she'll find
And I'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

Charley Pride,"He was driving home one evening
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened,
Standing out there in the snow
'Til he said I'm here to help you ma'am
By the way my name is Joe.

She said I'm from St. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must have seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you
When he changed the tire
And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said how much do I owe you
Here's what he had to say.

You don't owe me a thing, I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.

Well, a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along,
And dead on her feet.

Though she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress's eyes
When she read what she wrote.

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.

This last verse of this song I really like

That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinkin' about the money
And what the lady's note had said
And as her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low
Everything's gonna be alright, I love you, Joe",Chain of Love

And friends! I've been there once or twice.
It's dark down there and lonely,
And something's missin' in your life.

When I heard a voice said, ""Don't give up!""
That whisper had an old familiar ring
I didn't see the angel, but I felt the comfort of her wing.

Daddy always called her angel,
I never knew the reason why.
I was looking for a halo
He was looking in her eye.

She was always there to guide me
With all the love a gentle hand could bring.
I didn't see the angel,
But I felt the comfort of her wing.

Now I'm looking back in time
To a young man stumbling through the kitchen door.
How Mama kept on praying
When she couldn't tell me nothing any more.

I woke up in my bed again,
I guess she must have tucked me in
I can't remember much of any thing.
I didn't see the angel, but I felt the comfort of her wing.

Charley Pride,"Did you ever just feel like a movie
Or a book or story in song?
Or did you hear some words for the first time today
And find yourself hurting alone?

When the lyrics start telling your story
And Shakespeare starts writing the play
Then those well chosen words by some
Old country verse held all your defenses away

Well, I thought I was over that story
I thought I'd forgotten that song
But old songs were new songs
For fools all alone

And we'll all come around
And we all will be found
Caught in the act of crying alone
Trapped in an old country song

But old songs were new songs
For fools all along

And we'll all come around
In that old country sound
Caught in the act of crying alone
Trapped in an old country song

Charley Pride,"In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to see but a starvin' hound
In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town

Down in the Delta where I was born
All we raised was cotton, potatoes and corn
I've picked cotton till my fingers hurt
Draggin' the sack through that Delta dirt

And I've worked hard the whole week long
Pickin' my fingers to the blood and bone
There ain't a lot of money in a cotton bale
At least when you try to sell

Catch us a ride on a pickup truck
On a gravel road, it nearly strangled us
That cotton pickin' Delta dust

We'd sit across the street on the depot porch
Lookin' at the folks lookin' back at us
Munchin' on a dust covered ice cream cone
Wondering how we'd get back home

One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to do but just hang around

Charley Pride,"Ira Hayes...
Ira Hayes...
Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war.

Gather 'round me people,
There's a story I would tell,
'Bout a brave young Indian,
You should remember well.
From the land of the Pima Indian,
A proud and noble band,
Who farmed the Phoenix Valley,
In Arizona land.
Down the ditches a thousand years,
The waters grew Ira's peoples' crops,
'Til the white man stole their water rights,
And the sparkling water stopped.
Now, Ira's folks were hungry,
And their land grew crops of weeds,
When war came, Ira volunteered,
And forgot the white man's greed.

Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war.

There they battled up Iwo Jima hill,
Two hundred and fifty men,
But only twenty-seven lived,
To walk back down again.
And when the fight was over,
And Old Glory raised,
Among the men who held it high,
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes.

Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war.

Ira Hayes returned a hero,
Celebrated through the land,
He was wined and speeched and honored,
Everybody shook his hand,
But he was just a Pima Indian,
No water, no home, no chance,
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done,
And when did the Indians dance.

Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war.

Then Ira started drinking hard,
Jail was often his home,
They let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone.
He died drunk early one morning,
Alone in the land he fought to save,
Two inches of water and a lonely ditch,
Was a grave for Ira Hayes.

Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war.

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes,
But his land is just as dry,
And his ghost is lying thirsty,
In the ditch where Ira died.",Ballad of Ira Hayes

And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).

Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.

It's rollin' 'round the bend,

Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns,""

In a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars

I know I can't be free

With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt.
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking.
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking.
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken.
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down.

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging.
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing.
Then I headed down the street,
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing,
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.

But when they turn out the lights, 
I know she'll be leaving with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.

My baby makes me smile, Lord don't she make me smile
She's never too far away or too tired to say I want you
She's always a lady, just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights, 
She's still a baby to me.

'Cause when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.

And every time you're near me I can fly 
High above the clouds and rain
Way above the hurt and pain
and when you're gone I fall down from the sky 
But every time you touch me I get high

I've been kissed by the angels
And I've been loved hard by quite a few
But after you I forget the rest 
Cause every time you touch me I get high 
And every time you're near me I can fly

Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it costs to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again

That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow

Charley Pride,"Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a dog-gone pity
Teardrops are fallin' down the mountainside
Many times I've been here and many times I cried
We used to be so happy, when we were in love

High on a mountain of love

Night after night I been standing here alone
Weeping my heart out till cold gray dawn
Prayin' that you're lonely and you come here too
Hopin' just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Tryin' hard to find you, somewhere I love
High on a mountain of love

Mountain of Love, a Mountain of Love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed you name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church and a big tall steeple
Inside the church there's an alter filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and it should have been ours
That's why I so lonely, I dream from above
High on a mountain of love",Mountains of Love
Charley Pride,"Been so many little ways you let me know
He's still on your mind
All along I've been aware that you still care about him
I'm not blind

But tonight when I reached out for you
You close your eyes and call me by his name
I think it's time I let you know the way I feel
Something's gotta change

This bed's not big enough for the three of us
One of us has got to leave beyond his memory
This bed's not big enough for the three of us
So make up your mind which one you want to keep

Oh, we've been living in the shadow of love
You can't leave behind
I've done everything I know to break his hope
To finally make you mine

Now I'm wondering if I'll ever have
The part of you I've never had before
You brought him to bed with you tonight
And I won't take this anymore

This bed's not big enough for the three of us
One of us has got to leave beyond his memory
This bed's not big enough for the three of us
So make up your mind which one you want to keep

Uh Cam'Ron (You ain't know) No Limit 
(That's right) Untertainment 
(I'm here and there) mo' money 
(I'm here and there) 
Ya don't know? 

[Cam'Ron]
Aye yo I just walk wit' y'all I don't want to rhyme 
I just need talk wit' y'all 
Mamasita senorita 
I'm lookin' for my wifey 
Cats always love me, till they girls start to like me 
They don't know I'm sheisty, and all my jewels icy 
Tryin' to settle down Ma, stop actin' all feisty 
Cause 'I don't want to be a playa no more' 
Know it's soft, but I came with a core 
For the love of Money, Charli, whoa It Ain't My Fault 
Like Silkk, it's so timid, my trunk, it go wit' it 
The whole Squad is Terrorin', cats is No Limit 
And I'm a diplomat, I'm a diplomat 
Where my honies at? Where my money at? 
That's why we act like that 
Clak clak clak, pat pat pat! 
So all you girls bring your thongs and shit 
Don't front, cause you know what song this is 
Just don't know 

[Chorus: Wyclef]
Ya don't know what we're going through 
Ya don't know the things that Cam is showing you 
What we're about to do 
You don't know 
Ya don't know what we're going through 
Ya don't know the things these thugs will do to you 
You and your family through 
Ya don't know 

[Big Punisher]
Yo, yo 
All the mommy's know me, the Spanish kid wit' the goat-ti 
And fixes the land, I be a mothafuckin' O.G. 
Ya my taste, thick in the waist, pretty in the face 
Dominican race, like my Twin Triple says 
Hot as hell, I'm trickin' in 
Shorties sharp as nails, the official chick 
Reppin' Uptown to Harlem World, where we at 
I'm up coughin' in the ambulance 
From way downtown, they got the Horses and the Carriages 
For forty bucks, you can ride and get ya hug on 
Another twenty, puff lye and get ya crush on 
It's all love, just like the Bud when ya hit it 
Cause way downtown, you know the fuzz is tryin' to hear it 
So when ya spark, ya make sure it's in the dark 
And most importantly, stay away from Central Park 
Cause cops live, just to put away a thug 
But not today, cause me and my baby in the Cabaret of Love 

[Chorus]

[Charli Baltimore]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo, uhh 
I thought I already barked on cats about Russ Hadden 
It ain't work, gotta Scream on cats like Wes Craven 
Oww! They ain't know I had it in me 
Like Lil' Kim, didn't know they had it in me 
Don't you know don't you know, we pull up from a show 
Cam and chrome bag the hos, in Prada bags all the dough 
And caked out, break out, uh 
Horse & Carriage, forced to marriage, been had too many carats 
And they ain't know, passin' that down 
Where I come from 
Ask Jane, that's my dun-dun 
How we handle them dumb dumb's 
And we like, Siskel and Ebert 
We review cats, thumbs up if they they shit's right 
And down if they new jack's 
You might see Charli, in a Benz or Ferrari 
Hennesey or Pacardi, gettin' bent at a party 
But I flip, be the new face, cover of Trace 
This the muthafuckin' remix, we ain't need no Mase 

Uh huh uh huh 
We like it (Slikk the Shocker) 
Uh huh uh huh (Cam'Ron, No Limit) 
(Untertainment) 
(Mo' money, ya heard me) 

[Silkk The Shocker]
I live life like a thug, cause time's is rough 
Convicted felon 
Now I'm like, rhyme for bucks 
Ball till I fall, should I say, my time is up 
And I cop you diamonds, never diamond cut 
Forget the money, cause I could ball with or without the shipment 
And I'm down girl, but I could ball with or without the chick 
Silkk the Shocker, Cam'Ron, now how you gonna doubt us a hit 
(Must be a car), Miss I could pull you, with or without the six 
Now I ain't the C-E-O, but I ain't far from it 
So if I ain't far from C-E-O 
That mean I ain't far from havin' C-E-O money 
Can't discuss what I'm worth, but I'm worth this much 
Like Mantigo, fall back like snatchin' purses for bust 
So many styles 
Drop a beat, I'ma drop a hit 
Rap game stop for the dope game 
And cop a brick 
No Limit Soldier baby, so watch the talk 
Get lost like, Oh It Ain't My Fault! 
I'm from the N-O, L-I, M-I to the T 
Tru my click, Silkk, the Shocker, yeah that's me 
Now look, money I'm tryin' to make it 
Bustas I'm tryin' to break, girls is like 
Ooh I love Silkk, and then, ooh I hate him! 
Cause they can't have me, but I don't look 
I can't afford to live average 
So senorita, let me walk you to my carriage 
Now I don't want to settle down, but we can do it like we married 
Cheese!

And his chime, anyday now, have me in the hay now
Dirty ass way down, I'm still gon' lay down

Kill me with your touch

Please save me
So give me all of your super love

Dive here, and your arms falling there with you

Feels like I'm tripping, I'm falling hard from the highest heights
When I crash where will you be?
I think your hair looks much better pushed over to one side
How do you feel about me?

S.O.S, this is real, and this is dangerous
You're my favorite drug, I smoke you in the car
R.I.P, what a dream, you're so damn dangerous

I love the poison
Hooked on the poison

I can’t believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head again
So I run (so long ago and so far away)
I can’t believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I’ll drink the poison

Get out my head, get out my bed
I don’t believe those, the words that you said
Pocket of lies, crystal blue eyes
Hit the ground hard when I’m dropped from the skies
You’re coming up when I’m going down
Never in sync so we just sink and drown
Press restart and reboot my heart
But I’m not a robot so I fell apart
Before the moment that we met we were chatting on the Internet
Getting kinda close through the posts that we were looking at
I was pretty confident, you were pretty into that
I linked you to my music just to see if you’d be into it
So fuck the prologue, read the Internet blogs
""Gonna love this star and it came from the clubs.""
I wasn’t looking for a fuck, I was looking for a bad boy
Bad boy, motherfucker, destroy

I can’t believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head again

Now I know for sure that we’ve got to end this
You don’t get no last kiss
‘Cause you’re so damn crazy
And I’m so damn helpless
So don’t text my number
And don’t call my mother
I can’t see your face now

Charli XCX,"Help me out, I need escape
It's the truth, I got to go
With all the boys in the back I lay
And all my girls in the super store
Because we need electricity,
City lights gotta glow for me
I want more than a car, I'm a queen
So get your shit, now we got to roll!

Let's go out of this town, too bored hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds,
Never gonna come down, ooh
Drums, bass turn 'em up loud,
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds,
Never gonna come down

Take the car and cut the brakes,
Driving out into the dark
Even though I love my mom and dad,
I wanna swim out there with the sharks
I wanna learn to speak Japanese,
Razor-sharp on the silver screen
We were made for a limousine
So get your shit, and come with me!

Let's go out of this town, too bored hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds,
Never gonna come down, ooh
Drums, bass turn 'em up loud,
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds,
Never gonna come down

Blowing bubbles out in the grass
All tangled in the stars, getting faded in the back seat
You can be hanging with us,
We used to walk around the back street,
Swimming through some real heat
Fuck the dream, I want it for real!
Always make it look so easy, move into the city
Take a little sip of surreal,
We're much more than nothing,
Yeah we're all just tryin'a be who we feel!

(Ooh) Throwing cake up in the air, we don't care, no
(Ooh) Surfing on a silver wave, wanna let go
(Ooh) We're so bored of being here, we don't care, no
I wanna run, be wild and free, and with my friends standing next to me

Let's go out of this town, too bored hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds,
Never gonna come down,
Drums, bass turn 'em up loud,
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds,
Never gonna come down

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

And I must admit I like it quite well.
It's something to be the darling of all;
Le grande femme fatale, the belle of the ball,
There's nothing as gay as life in Paris ,
There's no other person, I'd rather be,
I love what I do, I  love what I see,
But where is the schoolgirl that used to be me.

Ah, the apple trees,
Where at garden teas,
Jack-o-lanterns swung:
Fashions of the day,
Vests of applique,
Dresses of shantung,
Only yesterday.
When the world was young

While sitting around we often recall,
The laugh of the year, the night of them all,
The blonds who was so attractive that year,
Some opening night that made us all cheer;
Remember that time we all got so tight,
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight,
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,
I laugh with the rest, it's all very bright.

Ah, the apple trees,
Sunlight memories,
Where the hammock swung,
On our backs we'd lie;
Looking at the shy,
Till the stars were strung,
Only last July,
When the world was young.

You'll see me in Cape D'Antibes , or in Spain,
I follow the sun by boat or by plane,
It's any old millionaire in a storm,
For I've got my mink to keep my heart warm:
And sometimes I drink too much with the crowd,
And, sometimes I talk a little too loud,
My head may be aching, but it's unbowed,
And sometimes I see it all through the cloud

And the hive of bees,

a kiss without a future in it.

A coffee pot from Peru,
A knife and fork to spoon with,
Everything but you.

Everything but you.
You left me everything, everything but you.",Everything But You

I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

Stars in the sky are all free and they shine for me,

All this is mine and heaven too.

You give me your arms and your arms are like angel wings,
Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

I own each summer day, each mountain capped with snow,
The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me,
You bring a love so divine, all this is mine

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue
Charlie Bertini,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Charlie Biddle,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Me sinto muito bem quando fico com você
Eu tenho habilidade de fazer histórias tristes virarem melodia
E vou vivendo o dia-a-dia 
Na paz, na moral, na humilde, busco só sabedoria
Aprendendo todo dia, me espelho em você 
Corro junto com você, vivo junto com você, faço tudo por você

Seguindo em frente com fé e atenção
Continuo na missão, continuo por você e por mim
Porque quando a casa cai
Não dá pra fraquejar, quem é guerreiro tá ligado 
Que guerreiro é assim
O tempo passa e um dia a gente aprende
Hoje eu sei realmente o que faz a minha mente
Eu vi o tempo passar e pouca coisa mudar 
Então tomei um caminho diferente

Falam, falam o tempo todo, mas não tem nada a dizer
Mas eu tenho um santo forte, é incrível a minha sorte
Agradeço todo tempo ter encontrado você
O tempo é rei, a vida é uma lição
E um dia a gente cresce,
E conhece nossa essência e 
Ganha experiência
E aprende o que é raiz, então cria consciência

Tem gente que reclama da vida o tempo todo
Mas a lei da vida é quem dita o fim do jogo
Eu vi de perto o que neguinho é capaz por dinheiro
Eu conheci o próprio lobo na pele de um cordeiro

Your golden sun will shine for me!

I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill it calls to me
To be where little cable cars
Climb halfway to the stars!

The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care!
My love waits there in San Francisco,
Above the blue and windy sea.

Charlie Byrd,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

Charlie Byrd,"Quem acreditou
No amor, no sorriso, na flor
Então sonhou, sonhou
E perdeu a paz
O amor, o sorriso e a flor
Se transformam depressa demais
Quem, no coração
Abrigou a tristeza de ver
Tudo isto se perder

E, na solidão
Procurou um caminho e seguiu
Já descrente de um dia feliz
Quem chorou, chorou
E tanto que seu pranto já secou
Quem depois voltou
Ao amor, ao sorriso e à flor
Então tudo encontrou
Pois a própria dor
Revelou o caminho do amor
E a tristeza acabou",Meditation (Meditação) [*]

Charlie Byrd,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold

It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Action packed nigga get your cassettes ready
It's about to go down like this here

Uh, uh, these niggas keep hatin', that ain't right though
I'ma throw it down like this here

Now I ain't trying to take over the game
I'm just trying to get a Range Rover and a couple of chains
I got a X-ed out college bitch giving me brains
Gave her my e-mail address and an alias name
And they tell me take it easy but I can't help it
I want more green than the Boston Celtics
Let a true nigga breathe don't be selfish
Bet on hot spitta competition getting dealt wit
Hollerin' bout you totin' guns
But I see you with no straps like low-top Air Force Ones
And you hollerin' bout money ain't got no funds
And you rappin' on beats using pots for ya drums
And you'll never see me with ya bitch
Oh I got the hoe with me, you just can't see through the tint
And I'm beggin' ya dog please don't quit rappin'
If you quit rappin' I quit laughin'

[Chorus: x2]
Don't want to see us with no paper ha (that ain't right)
Don't want to see us niggas make it ha (that ain't right)
I ain't gon call you a hater dog ('cause that ain't nice)
Just let a nigga breathe in the game aight

I got a flat so I had to leave the V in the garage
And X see the bar on his Bentley ??
Headin' to the spa for a weekly massage
Me, ya lady, and ya sister do minage trios
And I just copped two Porsches
And the dashboard got more wood than the Evergreen Forest
 
Pull up on the block, two glocks two torches
Shorty too hot like papa bear's poridge
Talkin' bout you pop caps to wet me
The only cap you pop is off a bottle of Pepsi
I got enough waves for you to ride on jet skis
And fuck a bodyguard I let the tech protect me
Hell in a black end male with white break lights
Known for spittin raps out like that on tapes right
Say you got skills ha bitch keep frontin'
And I'll carve ya face up like a Halloween Pumpkin

[Chorus]

I guess I ain't supposed to spit
You probably want me locked off in the back so you can hush my shit
You probably thinkin' is see wrong for this
But XL ain't just a name known for production and shit
If ain't nothing else, I'm never ya bitch
Lyrically I'm hot, like the different color paint on my six
And if y'all really ain't on my shit, it's cool
'Cause that ain't right
I guess I know you better than me
You probably a pimp who get the pussy wetter than me
You probably a thug with more ice and cheddar than me
Fuck that if i was you I'd be better than me
Ya bitch you, you better be better than me
You're probably right, that ain't right
Naw dog, not on your life
You're better off trying to fuck with a dike
If you smart why you sound so dumb on the mic
You can't fuck with my beats let alone what I write
My click, or the fact that we tight
It ain't us, y'all ain't doin' it right
I ruined it right
A producer that ruined your life
Aw fuck it they done gave me a mic

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner,

Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker 
And the girl I left behind 
I just got to town last Friday evening 
Sure as hell didn't mean to stay 
I was on my way back to Louisiana 
Had a powerful thirst and six months pay 
I met a peroxide blond in a bar on D-ville 
I was flying high and feeling mean 
Poured down a bottle and a half of red eye 
I dropped thirty five dollars in the slot machine 
And the boys in the back was dealing seven card 
I set down and won me a 110 
I was raking in chips like Grant took Richmond 
Till big Johnny Lee come a strolling in 
He ripped off the bar like a 707 
Pretty soon he done won all of my bread 
I accused him of cheating he reached for a pistol 
I grabbed a chair and went upside of his head 
Then I took off a running like a motorcycle 
Heard the bullets whining and sirens wail 
But it took half the cops in Dallas County 
Just to put one coon boy in jail 
So call up Trudy on the telephone 
Send her a letter in the mail 
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas 
And they won't let outta this jail 
And if she asks you how I'm fairing 
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind 
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker 
And the girl I left behind",Trudy

Charlie Daniels,"I was takin' a trip out to LA
Toolin' along in my Chevrolet
Tokin' on a number and diggin' on the radio

Jes' as I cross the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to go

Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a fillin' station in sight
So I jes' limped down the shoulder on the rim

I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
A kind of a redneck lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn

Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one

There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me
And he just looked disgusted an' pointed toward the telephone

I called up the station down the road a ways
And he said he wasn't very busy t'day
And he could have somebody there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so

He said now you jes' stay right where yer at and I didn't bother
Tellin' the durn fool 
I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go

I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in an' said who owns this car
With the peace sign the mag wheels and four on the floor

Well he looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd jus wait outside
So I layed a dollar on the bar and headed for the door

Jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin
These five big dude come strollin' in
With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth

An' I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said you tip your hat to this lady son
An' when I did all that hair fell out from underneath

Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
'Specially when there was three of them and only one of me

Well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick
So I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' green-teeth right in the knee

He let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man

Well you may not know it but this man's a spy
He's an undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan

He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee
But everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me
And I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went

I said would you beleive this man has gone as far
As tearin' Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGoveren for president

Well he's a friend of them long-haired hippie type pinko fags
I betcha he's even got a Commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage

He's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys
He may look dumb but that's jus a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage

They all started lookin' real suspicious at him
And he jumped up an' said jes' wait a minute Jim
You know he's lyin' I've been livin' here all of my life

I'm a faithfull follower of Brother John Burch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife

Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck

And when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks
And they were jes' takin' my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty an' jumped in an' fired that mother up

Mario Andretti woulda sure been proud
Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd
Comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot

An' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run
But somehow I couldn't resist the fun
Of chasin' them jes' once around the parkin' lot

Well they're headin' for their car but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
Well I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air

Well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin'
Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin'
But I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the cops got there

When I hit the road I was really wheelin'
Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin'
An' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas

I think I'm gonna re-route my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to LA via Omaha!",Uneasy Rider

Play, let the blind man play

So play, let the blind man play, let the blind man play!

The years were kind while the man was blind, but he knew his time was due
And no one cried when the blind man died, with the name that no one knew
They made his coffin outta knotty pine, with a wreath of laurel too
His epitaph was short and sweet, and all it said was play

Carries brass knuckles and a .44,
Runs a loan shark business and a mary jane store.

I've been funk rocked and punk rocked 'til I can't catch my breath

Just across the bridge that I'd left burning.

Back to the chilly golden autumn haze

‘Cause we've got it all planned;
We're gonna strike up the band;
We're gonna take you for a rainbow ride.

Purple shadows fall across the countryside,
We could get together for a rainbow ride.
Close your eyes and let it happen,
Bright and breezy, nice and easy.

Hold on while the music takes you way up high;
We can race the moon across the evening sky;
See the night time rainbow colors flying by.

You left all the ladies in a hell of a fix,

Just an old boy from Memphis with a big diamond ring:
A country girl's prayer and a city girls dream;
Hail the king

But its all right now
Keep on singin' loud;
Its all right now:

The sixties came in with a bang and a roar.
The world heard a knock it was Janis at the door:
They let her in.
And when it seemed this whole world was falling apart
The houselights would fall and the music would start;
She'd be givin us all a piece of her heart,
Once again.

When we heard that the Free Bird had fell to the ground;

And now that your gone I thank God I was blessed
Just to know you

Charlie Daniels,"On a clear night, many many years ago
Two weary strangers moving slow
Were looking for a place to stay
But there was no place
Though they traveled many miles
So Mary being great with Child
Lay down on the sweet smelling hay
Then a bright light fell from heaven
As a special star shone bright
And three wise men from a foreign land
Came to worship him that night
And in the clear night you could hear the angels sing
Praises to the newborn King
Jesus is the light of the world.

And the angels heralding the Holy Birth
Were singing Peace to men on Earth
Unto you is born a Son
And the shepherds
Though they had their flocks to tend
Journeyed unto Bethlehem
To behold the Holy One

And then the Boy grew up to be a Man
Come to set the captives free
Come to heal the sick and raise the dead
And to cause the blind to see
And the best part is even though
He's gone away
He'll be coming back someday
Jesus is the Light of the world

And the best part is even though
He's gone away

The things that dreams are made of
Every year we celebrate
Around our christmas tree
Every year you seem to be
More beautiful to me
So close your eyes
Don't think about the things
Just lie here and let me sing
My christmas love song to you

Charlie Daniels,"He was nobly born
Had a Spanish bull's horn
And not one scar on his hansom face

He stood like a prince
And he had ever since
He had grandily walked into the place

Though the girls of Madrid
Tonight were forbid
For tomorrow he must fight once more

Before he left the bar
He would dance with them all
Cause he was El Toreador

The day of the feast
Was just a lie in the east
When he left Maria's warm bed

Her dark eyes said more
But he walked through the door
Shaking cobwebs of dreams from his head

And later that day
As he knelt to pray
He said God grant me this nothing more

If it is the way
And I must die today
Let me die like a Toreador

The pageant he chose
Shook from the roar
As the band played the Toreador's theme

Alarmed by the sound
The bull paws the ground
As the Toreador enters the ring

Up and down, round and round
On and on, all alone
 
The Plaza del Toros
Shook from the roar
As the band played the Toreador's theme

Alarmed by the sound
The bull paws the ground
As the Toreador enters the ring

Up and down, 
Round and round
On and on, all alone

The shouts of ole
In the heat of the day
Rushed the hot blood to his Spanish heart

And the crowd held their breath
As he flirted with death
And the bull fighter's sword found it's mark

And trying to hide
The wound in his side
He walked from the ring standing tall

And a crowd gathered round
As he fell to the ground
A priest held his hand
Where he lay in the sand
And he was heard to say
A brave bull died today
But he died like a Toreador",El Toreador
Charlie Daniels,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I am found
Was blind but now, I see

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
And how precious did that Grace appear
At the hour when I first believed

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I have found
Was blind but now, now I see

When we've been here ten, ten thousand years
Bright shining, bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing our God's praise
Then when we've first begun

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me, it was me
I once was lost but now I am found
I was blind but now, I was blind but now
I was blind but now, I was blind but now I can see",Amazing Grace
Charlie Daniels,"You can dance around if you want to
But there's some thing a man don't wanna do
And if you see him comin' walkin' down the street
You better jump right Outta his way
Everyone knows it's a street skit
Every time he comes to town
Coz he's got somethin' in his left hip
The blues down walk around

Funky-junky
Funky-junky

He's on Missouri Boulevard
About a half o' mile south of the graveyard
Better run an leap through funky old dirt
Go one don't find no shame
This old muskrat barbecue
And a sweetness on the railroad track
He's gotta tiger in his living room
He gotta monkey on his back

Charlie Daniels,"Virgil Caine is the name
And I served on the Danville train
'Til stone man's cavalry came
And tore up the tracks again

In the winter of '65
We were hungry just barely alive
By May the tenth, when Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so. well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
Said, ""Virgil, quick come see'
There goes Robert E Lee""

And I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if my money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

Like my father before me I'm a workin' man
And like my brother above me who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave

And I swear by the mud
Below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up
When he's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

Charlie Daniels,"Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the south-land
I miss 'ole' 'bamy once again
And I think it's a sin

Well I heard Mister Young sing about her
Well I heard ole Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember

Where the skies are so blue

Does your conscience bother you?

Charlie Daniels,"The pressure these days isn't easy so they say,
If you're trying to get through this world.
And if you're gonna make it,
Then you've got to live in a hurry.
This world they say may just end any day,
And I know that it possibly could.
But I can't do nothing about it,
So why should I worry.

I grew my hair long and sang a protest song,
And offered myself to this world,
Doing my best in the
Search and the quest for the white dove.
But I always knew I was just passing through,
And the trip has been rocky and long.
And through all the changes,
There's one thing I sure can be proud of.

[Chorus]
I'm just blowing along with the wind,
Taking it all in stride,
Thankful for every minute God gives me,
Goin' along for the ride,
Holdin' my woman's hand,
Helpin' out when I can,
Living the one life I own,
One day at a time.

I have lived down in some jerkwater towns,
Where the sidewalks are rolled up by ten.
And I've been a swinger,
And drifted the heart of a big town.
I've had some low rides and walked on the wild side,
And it's all been good in its way.
I've had some high-ole times,
And yeah, I've had some letdowns.

Charlie Daniels,"From a town in Louisiana on the wrong side of the tracks,
came a rowdy Ragin Cajun by the name of Rupernac,
He was harder than a hickory long and thinner than a rail,
He was faster than a Copperhead and he werent afraid of hell,
He turned 18 in the Parish courthouse facin 10 to life,
about some altercation in a beer joint with a knife,
He said judge I mean your honor I hope you'll understand,
but if it happened here today I think I'd do it all again,
cause you don't get up in my face, you don't call my mama names,
you don't whistle in my kitchen, you dont pull my big dogs chain,
I don't mean no disrespect but I been stubborn, all my life

He'd been two years in prison when his cousin Jay came down,
said his sister was in trouble in some far off Northern town,
He broke out of jail that night and left a note behind,
I'll see ya'll in a week or so, till then I'm hard to find,
He found her in a tavern up in westside Buffalo,
Gave her a one way ticket home and pushed her out the door,
Said I'm lookin for the man who done my little sister harm,
he's a soul destroying punk that stuck a needle in her arm,
and some pimp back in the corner, started makin himself small,
but he grabbed him by the collar and he pushed him to the wall,
He said you try to run away, you gone regret it, all your life,

The Cajun started laughin when the pimp pulled out a knife,
He said I oughtta kill ya, but I'm gonna spare your life,
With one sledgehammer fist he knocked him sprawlin on the floor,
and then he kicked him in his forked end, and he headed for the door,
He walked on down the sidewalk and hit the Southern trail,
He went back to Louisiana and he walked into the jail,
He said I had some business up above the bunkie line,
but my debts have all been settled and I've come to do my time,
and I hope I didnt cause no trouble, I wasnt tryin to run away,
But a feller owed me somethin and I had to make him pay,
Besides I'm kind of proud I been a coonass, all my life",Ragin' Cajun

I even played that music when I'm laying in bed,
it never did get me anywhere at all, but it makes me kinda proud.

Charlie Daniels,"Stroker Ace was born to race he had a mean streak two feet wide
A son of a gun with a taste for fun and more than his share of pride
Take a dirt road curve with a devils nerve make a car dance across the mud
Haulin? shine was his regular line till the track got in his blood

Was a real hot shot and he bragged a lot, but man that fool could drive
'Cause he loved the feel of the steering wheel
And the girls with bedroom eyes
And in a race of time or a bar room fight, Ol? Stroker stole the show
A back stretch blazer, a real hell raiser and a racetrack Romeo

Mama lock your daughters up that vile bunch is back in town
And them little girls get frisky when they hear that race car sound
They're bringing out the yellow flag, somebody?s brakes have failed
There's an alsike on the inside and a wreck along the rail
You'd better stand on it Stroker 'cause a bandit?s on your tail

It?s a dynamite joy for a country boy when he hears them engines moan
But you've gotta hang tough when it gets real rough
When you're out there on your own 'cause they'll push you down
They'll knock you down, they'll shove you up against the wall
And you always know when the engine blows that a man can't win ?em all

You can push that car just a little too far any Sunday afternoon
And if you'd break your neck in some damn fool wreck
They'd forget about you soon
But Ol? Stroker Ace was born to race and it?s worth all the trying
Just the dirt champagne in the victory lane and to hear that concrete whine

Stroker get your dander up this ain't no time to laugh
You've got to make the lap up if you're gonna take that checkered flag
Number 10 is closin? in to even up the score
It?s time to wave bye bye and put the pedal on the floor
You'd better stand on it Stroker 'cause your blowin? off their doors

Blow their doors off Stroker
Stand on it, son
Ah, you good lookin? devil you
",Stroker's Theme
Charlie Daniels,"See that man in the field over yonder
With dirt on his hands and a loan on his back
He's the man that puts the food on your table
He's the man that grows the clothes on your back
Were running a mile out of the house he was born in
Tending on the sidelines and watching him fall
Selling his land to the big corporations
What you gonna do when they get it all

He's been rolled for sure treated like a outlaw
Turned down sold out, put out to graze
He's been pushed you know when he can push no more
It gets a little harder everyday

[Chorus]
He's the American farmer
And he damn hard to beat
Better wake up America, wake up America
'Cause if the man don't work then the people don't eat

He's sending the high tech stuff of to Russia
I can't figure what where doing it for
We should be sending the wheat and meat and cotton
'Cause that man in the middle of city
Eatin' outta garbage cans, sleepin' in the street
See that baby, moping in the kitty
To make ends meet

It's a damn disgrace on the face of America
Hungry people everywhere you go
Children in Africa starving by the fields
While the land lays fallow and the banks foreclose

Well, the train was rumblin' through the night heading south to Santa Fe
And in a fancy car with a private bar and a personal valet
There was a bunch of cold eyed men sittin' at a poker table
Bettin' hot stakes all around

A hand of cards and ole Stagger Lee Crocket had a gun in his pocket
Was sweatin' bettin' hard and over in the corner this Mexican guy

And then the door flew open, the stranger walked in
Said, ""don't y'all get excited, I know this here's a private game
And I know I wasn't invited but I got a roll that""d choke a mule
I'm just about a big enough fool to lay it all right down

Kept on winning like a run away truck he was giving them a beating

And the stakes got higher than a Chinese kite, the stranger
Kept getting hot till every cent everybody had was lying out in the pot
And then the stranger threw down a royal flush, somebody said
""Hey man, that's enough friend I think you've been cheatin'""

And then the stranger picked the money up and said, ""Boys I better run""
And then the pot-bellied fella pulled a razor out, somebody pulled a gun
They said, ""You may think you're a sly old fox, you're gonna leave here
In a long pine box if you don't leave that money alone""

Just about then the lights went out and they all started fussin'
And the lights came on, the stranger was gone, they all started cussin'
And they searched that train from front to rear
That stranger he done disappeared and all their money was gone

When the train pulled in the station, with the whistle blowin' loud
A telegram was waitin' from the stranger for the crowd
Said ""Thank you for the money boys but don't feel too outdone

What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect

Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

Ain't nothin' but a workin' man

By the sweat of his brow
And the calluses on his hands

But there ain't nothin' that you can do
'Cause there's a whole lot more of us common-folks
Then there ever will be of you

Well it makes me want to jump up and run

Well I know I'm gonna have some fun

And when the rosin starts to fly and I'm looking in the eye
Like I'm just about to blow a fuse

He said music is a rhapsody
He picked up his violin stuck it underneath his chin
And started playing me a symphony

I said that ain't the way it's done let me see that fiddle son
And I sawed him off a chorus or two

Now if you want to play me some fiddle
I'll tell you right from the start
You'd better play me something lowdown hoedown honking
I don't want to hear no funeral march

It's got to make me want to jump up and sing
If it ain't buzzing like a beehive, kick it into overdrive
Or it don't mean a doggone thing

So let me rosin up my bow and I think I can show you
The way I like to play this thing
Let's put some boogie rhythm in it kick it on up to the limit
I'm gonna' put some fire on these strings

And you feel like you've got ants in your shoes

I was only seventeen when I struck out for New Orleans

Can I still call you home or have I stayed away too long

Charlie Daniels,"If you ever go back into Wooly Swamp son you better not go at night
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That'd make a strong man die from fright
There's things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground
And they say the ghost of Lucias Clay gets up and it walks around.

But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain.

The old man lived in the Wooly Swamp way back in the gurgling woods
And he never did do a lot of harm in the world
But he never did do no good
People didn't think too much of him
They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway
All he cared about was his money.
He'd stuff it all down in Mason jars and bury it all around
But on certain nights if the moon was right
He'd dig it up out of the ground.
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack
And run his fingers through it.
Old Lucias Clay was a greedy old man
And that's all there ever was to it.

But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain.

The Crayton boys were white trash they lived over on Parvis Creek
They were a real snake and sneaky as a cat
And belligerent when they'd speak.
One night the oldest brother said ya'll meet in the Wooly Swamp later
We'll get old Lucias' money and we'll feed him to the alligators.
They found the old man out in the back with a shovel in his hand
And thirteen rusty Mason jars he just dug up out of the sand.
And they all went crazy and they beat the old man
Then they picked him up off the ground
Then they threw him in the swamp and they stood there and laughed
Till the black water sucked him down.
Then they turned around and went back to the shack
And they picked up the money and ran.
But they hadn't gone nowheres when they realized
They were running in quicksand.
And they struggled and screamed but they couldn't get away
Then just before they went under
They could hear that old man laughing
In a voice that was loud as thunder.

Now that's been fifty years ago an' if you go back by there again
There's a spot in the yard in back of that shack
Where the ground is always wet.
And on certain nights if the moon is right
And you're down by the dark footpath
You can hear three yound men screaming
And you can hear that old man laugh.

CHORUS...",The Legend of Wooley Swamp
Charlie Daniels,"Me and my buddy got us a wild hair
And figured we wanted to go somewhere
So we loaded up in my rag top Chevrolet
We had a little bit of money 
And a whole lot of show
And with Hank Jr. blaring on the radio
We got us a tank full of gas
And we was on our way

We figured we'd go down to New Orleans
We were barreling down old 17
When a man with a blinking red light 
Was on our tail
He said you were doing 60 in a 45
But I'm gonna let you go this time
But if I catch you again
I'm gonna slap you in the county jail

We said thank you sir you sure been nice
And you ain't gonna have to tell us twice
And we were Southbound and down with the wind 
Blowing in our faces
We kept on rolling and pretty soon
The radio was cooking out a Haggard tune
And we were pulling into Houston
Checking out all them places

I was feeling dry and I said I think
We ought to stop and get ourselves a drink
And old Jim said yeah 'cause we got time to kill
We kept on rolling and I seen this spot
And we pulled into the parking lot
Of this place called the Cloud Nine Bar and Grill

We walked through the door
And the place was jammed
The lights were low they had a punk rock band
And some orange haired feller singing about suicide
I said Jim this ain't our kind of place
He said well let's just have one round anyway
So against my better judgment we walked on inside
Went up to the bar and we sat down
This feller walked up and said I'll buy this round
And he sat down on the bar stool next to Jim

He looked like a girl but he talked like a guy
He had lipstick on and mascara in his eyes
And everybody in that place looked just about like him
I said Jim this ain't our kind of bar
Let's just go on out and get back in the car
Cause there's gonna be trouble 
Ain't no sense in taking a chance
We was getting up getting ready to leave 
When somebody grabbed old Jim by the sleeve 
And this good looking girl was asking my buddy to dance

I said Jim don't do it there's something missing
There's fellers dancing and fellers kissing
There's a feller in high heeled shoes wearing panty hose
He said partner I just can't turn this down
You just go over there and have one more round
And I'll dance with the lady 
And we'll get on down the road

So he walked away and left me alone
But this funny looking feller kept coming on
And he was making me mad with some of the things he said
Then he put his hand on my knee
I said if you don't get your paw off me 
I'm gonna locate your nose around
The other side of your head

He said I love it when you get that fire in your eye
I said well partner try this on for size
And I unloaded on him and he went out like a light
Everybody in that place must have been his friend
They all headed for me I said this is the end
But where I come from we don't give up 
Without a fight

They were screaming and yelling and scratching and clawing
I was punching and hitting and kicking and pawing
I was holding my own 'cause I've been in a scrap or two
Old Jim come running up out of the blue
And that gal he was with come running up too
And proceeded to beat on me with a high heel shoe

I grabbed her by the hair it came off in my hand
And that beautiful girl was just a beautiful man
And old Jim just got sick right there on the floor

He dropped that dude like a shot from a gun
Smeared his lipstick made his makeup run
And me and old Jim started fighting our way to the door

We lit out of there in that Chevrolet
I put in on the floor and it stayed that way
We were going down the highway 
Doing about a hundred and ten
We were headed for home and we was getting nearer
Then a red light came on the rear view mirror
And that same blame cop was pulling us over again

Now I'm sitting here in this county jail
I had to call my daddy to go our bail
But I learned me a lesson 
That I never will forget again
I've done give up drinking I've give up bars
And running around the country in souped up cars
I'm going back where the women are women
And the men are men",Uneasy Rider '88
Charlie Daniels,"He blew in town at midnight
And he didn't mean to stay
And then he found her
Just at closing time at the Alamo Cafe

And the way he smiled and carried on
He kinda made her day
So by the time that she left
He left with her

And she let him borrow money
And she let him drive her car
She didn't really trust him
But she done and gone too far

When the midnight moon is shining
When it's shining down the way
Well, if he blew in on the midnight wind
He may never pass this way again

She knew down in her heart
That he would only stay awhile
But sometimes she was a woman
And sometimes she was a child

Then just about the time
That she was learning how to smile
One Tuesday night
He came up missing

And sometimes now she thinks
She hears his footsteps cross the floor
But it's just that midnight wind
Howling around the door

When the midnight moon is shining
When it's shining down the way
Well, if he blew in on the midnight wind
He may never pass this way again

Charlie Daniels,"In the heat of the battle
To the head army there stepped a man
He said, ""I've been to the top of the liberty
And I've looked over the promised land""

He had no fear of death or evil
His skin was black and his name was King
He said I may not get there with you
But put your faith in God and let freedom ring

There was a tyrant strong and mighty
And he built his self a wall
He said, ""This wall's gonna stand forever
No power on Earth is gonna make it fall""

But then the winds of change they started blowing
Like a free bird on the wing
And then the wall fell down with a sound like thunder
Let the free bird fly and let freedom ring

(Let freedom ring)
Throughout the northland out across the frozen Tundra
To the land of the midnight sun and the Eskimo

(Let freedom ring)
From Albuquerque across the sea to Greece and Turkey
And from Halifax down south to Mexico

(Let freedom ring)
From Carolina round the world to Indochina
From Seattle to Mobile and Abilene

(Let freedom ring)
Let freedom ring
(Let freedom ring)
Let freedom ring
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring

Innocent blood was shed for freedom
In a faraway place called Tiennemen Square
'Cause the heavy hand of cruel oppression
Is so much more than a man can bear

But you can't chain a man forever
And your guns they don't mean a thing
'Cause they'll rise again in the cause of justice
Give the power to the people and let freedom ring

(Let freedom ring)
From Minnesota across the plains to North Dakota
And from Kennebunkport out to Kalamazoo

(Let freedom ring)
From Rome to Reno and from Tokyo to Moscow
And from Barcelona, Spain to Kathmandu

(Let freedom ring)
From Madagascar and from Berlin to Alaska
And from Liverpool to Perth to Aberdeen

(Let freedom ring)
Let freedom ring
(Let freedom ring)
Let freedom ring
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring

Let's give thanks to God our Father
The author of our liberty
Gave us this land to protect and cherish
It's the home of the brave and it's the land of the free

Oh America, we love you
Sweet land of hope of thee we sing
And with our life's blood we will protect you

I know, I'm not the same

If this old fiddle could sing
Man if this old fiddle could only talk
It could tell you some wondrous things
Talk to me fiddle
Tell me about when you came across the sea

And you were part of his life for forty years
Through times both lean and fat
And he raised his family and lived out his days
In a New York tenement flat

Tell me about how that cajun fiddlin' man
Found you in a pawn shop and took you back down
To the Louisiana bayou land
You knew his wife and you knew his kids
And you watched his family grow
And you played your heart out caju'n style
At the Louisiana Fais Do Do
Well talk to me fiddle
Then a big shot yankee gambler found you down in New Orleans
And took you up the river on the Mississippi Queen
Then there came the day that you were all
That he had left to lose
And a black man won you in a poker game
And taught you how to play the blues
Talk to me fiddle
Then a hobo from Biloxi found you living in the rain
And he got himself a free ride on a west-bound cattle train
And you got off in Texas
Where they play that western swing
Where the people do the two-step
And old Bob Wills was the king

Was doing all I could do to find me a true blue
A foxy little lady to love
I looked uptown downtown looking all around town
Searching and trying so hard
Looking for the right face but looking in the wrong place
I should have looked in my back yard
Cause I found everything I was a looking for
When I fell in love with the pretty little girl next door

She went away to cellege to get herself some knowledge
She just got back a month ago
She had changed a whole lot I found out she was not
That little girl I used to know
As little freckled faced tomboy who used to make a lot of noise
Running around the neighborhood
Was sitting on the front porch in a pair of short shorts
And buddy she was looking good
I got what I want I'll never ask for more
When I fell in love with the pretty little girl next door

We're gonna move way out to a little biddy town
Where the living is nice and slow
Where they ain't got nothing but a general store
One street and a picture show
I hope we have a little boy gonna be my pride and joy
Raise him by the golden rule
Watch him while he grows tall fishing poles and football
Apple pie and Sunday school

So goodbye bright lights single bars and wild nights
Goodbye all you partying girls
You can't find what I've got in honky tonks and night spots
And I wouldn't trade it for the world
Tell the boys at the hideaway I hope they had a nice day
Tell them all I said goodbye
I would've dropped around but I'm going out of town
And besides I've got a ring to buy
So long old friend I'm headed out the door
With my blue eyed ever loving pretty little girl next door the girl next door

I got all I want I'll never ask for more
When I fell in love with the pretty little girl next door I said the girl next door
I'm talking bout the girl that foxy little girl that pretty little girl next door
I'm talking bout the girl that foxy little girl that pretty little girl next door
I'm talking bout the girl that foxy little girl that pretty little girl next door
I'm talking bout the girl that foxy little girl that pretty little girl next door

Oh Juanita I think about you almost all the time
I'm gonna keep on buzzing around you girl
Like a king bee around a honeysucle vine

Oh Juanita I just can't stand to let you outta my sight
Oh Juanita I dream about you near bout every night
When you put your arms around my neck
You make me know everything's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Your mama thinks I'm lazy and no good
She sure don't like me hanging around
Your daddy thinks I'm crazy and if he could
He'd run me right on outta town

But he can't cause I'm gonna stay here with my

Charlie Daniels,"Down near the village of old San Miguel
In a far away place by the sea
Lived Maria Consuela Manuel
A lady of high born degree
And she was sixteen a proud woman child
And I was a cowboy rambunctious and wild
But we fell in love by the tall mission bell
That stands in the village of old San Miguel

Her father was master of all he surveyed
As rich as a king on his throne
When he found out about us he flew into a rage
And told me to leave her alone
He threatened my life and told all his man
This gringo must never see Maria again
But I found a way and I sent her a note
And I still remember all the words that I wrote

Meet me Maria in the cool of the evening
We'll slip away into the night
We'll cross the border at Nuevo Laredo
And together we'll start a new life
There's nothing here but heartaches and tears
And I don't even feel like a man
I'll saddle the horses and wait by the old Spanish trail
We'll leave our troubles behind us in old San Miguel

She slipped out of the shadows and into my arms
As the clock in the village struck ten
We crept through the alleys to the north side of town
And rode into the night like the wind
A full moon was shinin' the desert was still
Then I saw the vacaros ridin' over the hill
The rifle shots rang out the horses went down
And I saw Maria lyin' still on the ground

I knew the bullets had been meant for me
And the riders were comin' on fast
As I held her I knew by the look in her eyes
That she'd soon be breathin' her last
I whispered a prayer to heaven above
Cause the good Lord has mercy on people in love
Then she closed her eyes forever more
Via condios adios mi amore

Meet me Maria in the cool of the evening
We'll fly away into the night
We'll drift through the sky to sweet by and by
And together we'll find a new life
There's nothing here but heartaches and tears
And I don't even feel like a man
Wait in the moon light just over the old Spanish trail
We'll leave our troubles below us in old San Miguel

Charlie Daniels,"Well I've got me a sweet little country girl
She's across between a diamond and a pearl
There ain't nobody like my sweet little country girl

She's a little bitty booger she just stands about five feet tall
She hails from Dixie and she talks with a southern drawl
I just love to hear her when she says good morning y'all

Sweet little country girl the apple of my eye
Sweet little country girl I'll love her till the day I die
She's got country in her soul but she loves to rock and roll
Well she's sure double tough and I can't get enough
Of my sweet little country girl
[ piano ]
Now don't think she's slow cause she lives out on the rural route
She's a hip little lady and she knows what it's all about
And if there's somethin' happenin' she don't mind checking it out

Charlie Daniels,"I was mindin' my business the other day just jukin' on down the street
When I seen this perfect stranger and he come slidin' up next to me
He said friend my old lady just threw me out and why I just don't know
But it ain't no joke cause I'm hungry and broke I got no place to go
I gave him my last twenty dollar bill and told him to go on home
And leave me alone

I don't want nobody whinin' at me I don't need nobody moanin' to me
I don't want nobody cryin' on me I've got troubles of my own

Well I went on down to this joint in town and found somethin' I didn't expect
I was having a ball when the door flew open and who walked in but my ex
She said your alimony payments' way behind it's six months over due
And if you don't straighten this out right now I'm gonna call the law to you
I said baby you'd better remember every dog's gonna have his day
And I just want to say

I don't want nobody whinin' at me...
[ keyboards ]
The cops came through the front door and I went out the back
And I caught me a ride on a west bound freight train rollin' down the railroad track
I went on out to east St Louis and looked up this old friend of mine
I said I need a place to lay my head and brother I ain't got a dime
He said you'd better get on outta here hoy and he pulled out a gun
And I started to run

I don't want nobody whinin' at me...

Charlie Daniels,"You told me that your honky tonking days were through
But you came in this morning at a quarter till two
Oh baby what you gonna do about me
You said that fling with Johnny was a one night stand
How come I seen him sitting with you holding your hand
Oh baby what you gonna do about me

What you gonna do about me
How come you treat me like an old hound dog
I feel as helpless as a knot on a log
And you ain't got no sympathy for me
I ain't telling no lie
You sure know how to make a grown man cry
Oh oh baby what you gonna do about me

I let you use my car you said it's just for a day
But you stayed gone a month and turned up out in LA
Oh baby what you gonna do about me
I said I've had enough I'm gonna take back my ring
Then I found out that you'd done gone and pawned the thing
Oh baby what you gonna do about me

What you gonna do about me
That's something that you'd better think about
One of these days you're gonna wear me out
And you'll be sorry wait and see wait and see
There's gonna come a time
You'll realize a good man's hard to find

",What You Gonna Do About Me
Charlie Daniels," You may be down, you may be out  
With nothing to be glad about 
But you can stand right up and shout 
'Cause Jesus died for you 



You may think that you can't cope 



You may be drunk or hooked on dope 


Believe me brother, you've still got hope 


'Cause Jesus died for you 
Maybe you ain't got a dime 
You're standing in the welfare line 
Or maybe you're in prison doin your time 
But Jesus died for you 
Satan may have you in retreat 
But you won't go down in defeat 
'Cause you can sittin in the mercy seat 
'Cause Jesus died for you 

FIRST CHORUS 

E D A 

He died for you - to complete salvation's plan 

E D A 

He died for you - He's got nail scars in His hands E A C#m 
He bore the cross - to sanctify the lost B 
All you've got to do is believe it, E 
Get down on your knees and receive it! 

You may think you're too far gone 
You've sinned so bad you can't atone 
But bow your head and come on home 
'Cause Jesus died for you 

SHORT SOLO 

This ol' world keeps falling apart 
But you don't have to let it break your heart 
You can make a brand new start 
'Cause Jesus died for you 
Now Satan is a mighty foe
But just stand firm because you know 
You've got a better place to go 
'Cause Jesus died for you 
When there's trouble in the wind 
Or when you face the bitter end 
You can start all over again 
'Cause Jesus died for you 

You can face death with a smile 
Laugh at all your troubles and trials 
Never have to walk another lonely mile 
Jesus died for you! 

SECOND CHORUS 

He died for you - to break the devil's hold 
He died for you - to redeem your mortal soul 
Don't be afraid - 'Cause you debt has done been paid 
You just come and do your best -- The Holy Spirit's gonna do the rest! 
",Jesus Died for You
Charlie Daniels,"you got you diamonds and your cadillac
Two thousand dollar suit across your back
You've got your mansion out on millionaire's row
Go all the places that the rich folks go
Your Bible is a check book and your church is a bank
You don't believe in charity and you don't give thanks
For what you've got brother that's a lot
You lie and swindle and you steal and you cheat
You throw widows and orphans right out on the street
You say when it comes to business it's alright to be tough
You think your money's enough
(first chorus)
But you're praying to the wrong god mister
You're living for your sensual pleasures and your evil desires
Praying to the wrong god mister
One of these days it's going to eat your flesh like fire, like fire
Eat your flesh like fire
When you need answers you don't go to the Lord
You've got your tarot cards and ouija board
You put your faith in scientology, in fortune tellers and astrology
You hate your neighbors and you cheat on your wife
You say you'll make it up in your next life
You say all roads lead to the mountain top
You've got a long way to drop
(second chorus)
And you're praying to the wrong god mister
Satan wants to blind you to the truth and tell you all is well
And you're praying to the wrong god mister
You're running down a highway leading you straight to hell, to hell
You're headed straight to hell ",Praying to the Wrong God
Charlie Daniels,"Sunday morning at the little church down the street
I was sitting in the congregation I was listenin' to the preacher  preach
Yeah, we had a good time, love all over the place
We was talking about the blood of Jesus, singing Amazing Grace
Gave a little money, that's all I could afford
And then me and my brothers and sisters got on down to praisin' the lord, yeah
We had a good time, thinkin' about the promised land
When I got home Sunday morning, I was feeling like a brand-new man

But Monday morning, my car wouldn't start, I didn't get to work till ten
The bossman said if you want to work here, don't you ever let it happen again
There was people grumblin' and carrying on, I had to listing to all of that fuss
I'll tell you brother , it's just about enough to make a man want cuss
Went over in the corner, where there warn't nobody but me
I said thank you Jesus, because I'm not the man I used to be
I gonna make it, gonna make it through the week 'cause I know
Come Sunday morning, I'll be sitting on the very front row

Saturday evening, an old friend came by and said come on, let's go downtown
We'll find us a bar and we'll pick up some girls and do a little folling around
I said hold on buddy , I'm sure glad you came 'cause I got something I want you to see
Why don't you sit down here and let me tell you about what the lord has done for me
I said Jesus love you and he died got for your sins (Jesus loves you,died for your sins)
And if you let me, I'll be glad to lead you straight to him
We talked for a little while and I got down on my knees
Now Sunday morning, every Sunday morning
Every Sunday morning he's sittin' right here with me
On the very front row",Sunday Morning

Go on home put your red dress on
Tell you mama I said not to worry
I'll have you home before the break of dawn

Pole on over to the fais do do

Zydeco music makes me wanna dance

Cause she's cheatin'
And I'm beggin'
Cause she's leavin'
And she's laughin'
And I'm cryin'
She done did everything
To bring a good man down
And this time she's really
Gone for real she's really gone

She took the house
I got the payment
She said beat it
I hit the pavement
I'm walkin'
She's ridin'
And that's my cherry red ragtop ford she's riding
This time she's really gone for real
She's really gone

She's gone and I'm danglin' in the wind
She's gone I got them empty bed blues again
Well this time she's really gone for real
She's really gone

She was foxy
She was classy
She was sexy
A little sassy
I was flyin
I was floatin
And then she pulled the plug
And I went down the drain
This time she's really
Gone for real she's really gone
Well she's officially, certified, absolutely
Positively, genuine, bona fide, never coming back again

",Gone for Real
Charlie Daniels,"They got a dance floor the size of Texas
They got a band seven nights a week
And if you don't show up before the sun goes down
You ain't gonna find a seat

They got some grown up Texas ladies
They're there to make their papas proud
They like their music, country
And they like their country loud

Well, every Saturday night before they turn down the lights
And the band starts pickin' hot
They start dancin' on the tables, dancin' on the ceilin'
Dancin' in the parking lot

You start feelin' it flow from your head to your toe
You sure are glad you've come

Down to Little Joe and Big Bill's
Dance hall and sugar hill, barbecue emporium

When it comes to southern cookin'
They know what it's all about
They got some barbecue ribs and red beans and rice
Make your tongue snap your eyeballs out

And you don't wanna 'cause no trouble
Buddy 'less you're willin' to die
'Cause Big Bill will stomp a mud hole in you
And Little Joe will walk you dry

Well, there's a cowboy's dream in tight blue jeans
Swingin' through the swingin' doors
And there's a long tall cutie, scootin' booty
Out there on the floor

Well, I guess it's time to get in line
'Cause the house is startin' to hum

Down at Little Joe and Big Bill's
Dance hall and sugar hill, barbecue emporium

Well, every Saturday night when they turn up the light
When it's just about time to close
The fiddlin' man takes the bow in his hand
And start rockin' San Antonia Rose

When you're walkin' out
There ain't no doubt that you sure had a whole lot of fun

Down at Little Joe and Big Bill's
Dance hall and sugar hill, barbecue emporium
Down to Little Joe and Big Bill's

My baby plays me just like a fiddle
She knows I love her a lot not a little
I'm just a stick that she likes to whittle
I got a heart and she's in the middle of it
I got the hoe cakes she's got the griddle
My baby plays me just like a fiddle

I come home at night
She wants to go dancin'
I'm so doggone tired
I just don't feel like romancin'

Then she walks into the room
With those blue jeans painted on
Then I change my tune
It's always the same old song

[Chorus]

My buddies call to ask
If I want to go fishin'
For some large mouth bass
Then she says she's been wishin'

We could stay at home
Then she gives me that look
She's got that red dress on
And she's got me on the hook

[Chorus]

She's goes to the stereo
Takes of my Lynyrd Skynyrd
She puts on Julio
And the light starts gettin' dimmer

She says I love you
Puts them arms around my neck
I smell French perfume
And I know what's coming next
