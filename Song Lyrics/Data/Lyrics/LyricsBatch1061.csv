Newsboys,"In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This Cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

'Til on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave He rose again

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand",In Christ Alone
Newsboys,"You are the author of knowledge
You can redeem what's been done
You hold the present and all that's to come
Until Your everlasting kingdom

Lord, I don't know where all this is going
Or how it all works out
Lead me to peace that is past understanding
A peace beyond all doubt

You are the God of tomorrow
Turning the darkness to dawn
Lifting the hopeless with hope to go on
You are the rock of all salvation

Lord, I don't know where all this is going
Or how it all works out
Lead me to peace that is past understanding
A peace beyond all doubt

Oh, Lord, You are the author
Redeeming what's been done
You hold us in the present
And all that is to come

Lord, we don't know where all this is going
Or how it all works out
Lead us to peace that is past understanding
A peace beyond all doubt

It's in the bonds of love we meet
We come together at Your feet
Equal in Your sight, made one by Your might
You've called us to restore Your lands
And place them back within Your hands

As every nation lifts You high
Oh Father, tonight, it's our desire
To see Your kingdom shine
On earth as in Heaven tonight

God of all nations, Lord of creation
Your purpose is our hope our bread
And all You've planned and all You've said

Newsboys,"They shine like dawn on an open Psalm

A word in season, a gleam in Your eye
I love to feel the runner's high of Your ways
Ah, the high of Your ways
I lived so long under basement floors
The flickering lights, the windowless gloom
I'm here to stay in the upper room of Your ways
Ah, the room of Your ways

Newsboys,"Opening salvo
Didn't help solve anything
Every time we shout our rights out
We get all grouchy and gray

It's all about me, me
It's all about what I can take
And if that doesn't ring true anymore
Maybe it was our first mistake

And since we don't believe in Santa Claus
Maybe we'd best stay awake

Every time a teardrop falls
It's kicking up dust in our world of pain
Let's get drenched under God's good rain
Caught in a deluge of mercies
Like a pebble clings to dirt
We're still clinging to bedrock sin
Let's get swept off our feet again
Caught in a landslide of love

It's all about me, me
It's all about all I can take
The good I try to do goes nowhere
The bad just seizes the day

And if we're here for something bigger, baby
There's gotta be some better way

Every time a teardrop falls
It's kicking up dust in our world of pain
Let's get drenched under God's good rain
Caught in a deluge of mercies
Like a pebble clings to dirt
We're still clinging to bedrock sin
Let's get swept off our feet again
Caught in a landslide of love

No, not angels or devils
No, not famine or war
No, not the past or the present
Not even the ground separates from God's love
Not even the ground separates from His love

'Cause every time a teardrop falls
It's kicking up dust in our world of pain

A tailwind to carry her (an) orphan's cry
Don't you worry, child

I try to settle, but I just pass through

In Abraham's field
And dreamt there was no moon

Newsboys,"So much wonder carved in Your coral seas
So much wonder shaded by ancient trees
I consider all Your hands have made
Every newborn?s eyes, every new sunrise

No power can tame Your presence
No light can match Your radiance

Let all creation sing in wonder
Every sea, every creature, every star
You opened up my eyes to wonder
What a vision, what a wonder You are

Such a wonder, ordering time and tide
Such a wonder, bridging the great divide
I consider all that You had, all You gave
And all that You endured from this rebel world

What a wondrous cross You chose to bear
What a wonder You would even care

Let all creation sing in wonder
Every sea, every creature, every star
You opened up my eyes to wonder
What a vision, what a wonder You are

Let every rock cry out
Let every knee bow down
You opened up my heart to wonder
What a love, what a wonder You are

No power can tame Your presence
No light can match Your radiance

Let all creation sing in wonder

Newsboys,"When the runners came from Bethlehem
All breathless with good news
They were passing a baton forward through time

The commission, from God?s lips to our ears
Carried by His Saints, two thousand years
Connects us all to the same lifeline

As I fix my eyes ahead
I can feel the Spirit?s breath

And I can hear the mission bell
Ringing out loud and clear
It's the revolution Jesus started
And it's here

Echoing across the world
From the shores of Galilee
I can hear the mission bell call
For you and me

I wanna run with fire
It?s my heart?s desire
Lifting Your love higher

In the history of our faith?s arrivals
Great awakenings, Welsh revivals
Saints and martyrs, summoned by a new birth

Patrick?s save of the Irish nation
William Carey?s expectation
Lambs and lions called to the ends of the earth

Gotta put my hands to the plow
Not looking back, not now

I can hear the mission bell
Ringing out loud and clear
It's the revolution Jesus started
And it's here

You have known my heart
You've heard my every anxious thought

This much is known:
The victory's won by You alone
Hear my song, my Savior and my King

We have followed fragile dreams
But only One could take the measure of our goals
And we've stumbled over the trials of life
And we've wrestled the unseen

In the hands of God we will fall
Rest for the restless, and the weary
Hope for the sinner
In the hands of God we stand tall
Hands that are mighty to deliver
Giving us freedom

When our strength gave way to the weight of guilt
'Til we strained for every breath
Only One could lift our shame and make us well
And when all is finished and we face
The fearsome power of death

If everybody love like my friend Jesus
If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus

What if this is like an early inning?

She puts me on hold
I'm back to thinking I'm gonna explode

And the music they're playing is the soundtrack of hell

If everybody love like my friend Jesus
If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus
If we want to mend world relations
Surely I can show a little patience

Another day cut loose
Another lame excuse
I've got the why and how to start here and now
Then my cell phone drops the call
And I spew out vitriol
And as my fist goes through the wall
I here a voice say 'be the change you wanna see!'

If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus

Starting now maybe I can start the change in me",My Friend Jesus

He leads me to water and traces each song line
And I know to know His ways are higher than mine

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

It may have a new perspective
On a different date

You may just be O.K.

In my baby's new born tears

Dreamed I was standing at the Pearly Gates

I felt like running away

One of the reasons I died on Calvary
Father, welcome him in
I paid the price for him
Father, oh Father, this one's with me""

When I looked up the gates were opened wide
And in the distance, I saw Jesus
Our eyes met and I began to cry

Angels robed in their beauty
Were there to show me the way
And all of Heaven singing
When I heard His voice say

""Father, this one's with me
Part of the family
One of the reasons I died on Calvary
Father, welcome him in

NewSong,"I know you wished that you had been there to say goodbye
I know you wished that you could turn back, the hands of time
I know the pain of loss you're feelin' is almost more than you can bear
But let me give you hope in your despair

All you need is God and time to heal your broken heart
God and time, to lift you up from where you are
I don't have all the answers, to all your questions why
All I know is all you really need is God and time

Only God can truly understand how His healing works
And how He uses time in our lives, to overcome our hurts
But one thing you can be sure of, He is not surprised
By anything that happens in your life

All you need is God and time to heal your broken heart
God and time, to lift you up from where you are
I don't have all the answers, to all your questions why
All I know is all you really need is God and time

Oh, I know this side of heaven we may never understand
But we can trust the heart of God and know we're always in His hands

All you need is God and time to heal your broken heart

I don't have all the answers, to all your questions why
All I know is all you really need is God and time, God and time

I listened good and I tried real hard
But it didn't get me far

I've got no doubt He's callin' me to be a God made man

Gonna trust in Him completely
Gonna go wherever He leads me
Givin' everything to be a God made man
Gonna love Him with my whole heart

I'm just a work in progress
How much I need His help

I get down on my knees

And something happens that I can't explain
His Word starts talking to me and
I'm out to face this world again

Knowing He is here with me
It's gonna be a red letter day

I had a friend call me up and tell me
How he struggles through each day
I told him that I didn't have all of the answers

I've learned to hide God's word in my heart
So I can have it with me when the pressures of the day start

NewSong,"Heaven's gates were closed
And there seemed to be no hope
For fallen man
We were prisoners of our sin
With no way to enter in
But God had a plan
The Father knew there had to be
A perfect sacrifice
So Jesus came, a cross was raised
And when He laid down His life

Wide open, wide open
They nailed His arms wide open
After three days in a cold grave
The power of sin was broken
Now with outstretched arms
He welcomes in
Everyone who trusts in Him
His nail-scarred hands hold heaven's gates wide open

For so long my eyes were closed
I couldn't see a way of hope
For someone like me
And in my despair I cried
There's got to be more to this life
Lord help me please
And the Father said
There had to be a perfect sacrifice
That's why Jesus came, a cross was raised
And He laid down His life

For every dream this world will break 
There's a promise in its place

Some say You're not the One

I know first hand the miracle that You've done inside my heart
I'll gladly stand and testify just who You are

Every breath I take I want my life to bring You praise

And nothing in this world could separate me from Your love
You're the Wonderful One

Well I've seen all the evidence
Nothing else I need to know
I'm convinced that a world like this
Needs to know that there is hope

You heal me in my brokenness
Tell me how could I forget
The wonders of Your love

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.

The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night

Tryin' to buy that last gift or two, not really in the Christmas mood
Standing right in front of me was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing 'round like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes
 
His clothes were worn and old, he was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say
 
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight
 
He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the cashier said, ""son, there's not enough here""
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said mama made Christmas good at our house
Though most years she just did without
Tell me Sir, what am I going to do,
Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes
 
So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out 
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
Mama's gonna look so great

And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight

I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me just what Christmas is all about

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Your best friend could be somewhere up in her
If you busted him or if you busted her

Then being cool when it finally came
Those were the days

Way back when hickies were the thing
You wore bloomers, not that sexy g-string
And gettin blue balls was a daily thing
But it was alright, with me
To when that very first time went down
How you moaned when I went down
You were the one
I had no doubt
We need to get that back right now
'Cause those were the days

We're still here (yah)
'Cause we conquered every feeling (every feeling)
The fire burns inside like yester year

Got to say today, is what it was
So lets keep on sending, it's only beginning

Like Cadillacs and hubcaps
Back,
Like leaving letters in your nap sack
Back,
like Jellies and pro cast
Back to girl,
When we first met
Back,
To when I got the glove on
Back,
To when our love was so strong

Ney Matogrosso,"Eu me sinto tolo como um viajante
Pela tua casa
Pássaro sem asa, rei da covardia
E se guardo tanto essas emoções nessa caldeira fria
É que arde o medo onde o amor ardia
Mansidão no peito trazendo o respeito
Que eu queria tanto derrubar de vez
Pra ser seu talvez, pra ser seu talvez

Mas o viajante é talvez covarde
Ou talvez seja tarde 
Pra gritar que arde no maior ardor
A paixão contida, retraída e nua
Correndo na sala ao te ver deitada
Ao te ver calada
Ao te ver cansada
Ao te ver no are

Talvez esperando desse viajante
Algo que ele espera também receber
E quebrar as cercas com que insistimos 
Em nos defender",Viajante

Vê se ao menos me engole
Não me mastigue assim
Canibais de nós mesmos

Antes que a tetra nos coma
Cem gramas, sem dramas
¿Por que a gente é assim?

Você tem exatamente
Três mil horas
Pra parar de me beijar
Você tem exatamente tudo

Pra me conquistar
Você tem exatamente
Um segundo pra aprender a me amar
Você tem a vida inteira

Pra me devorar
¿Mais uma dose?
É claro que eu tô a fim
A noite nunca tem fim
¿Por que a gente é assim?

NF,"All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head
When I'm on the mic that's fine but that don't scare me
It's been a long time but I'm back now
Rap pow welcome to the rap house
Rap pow will live till I pass out blackout blackout
Everybody keep on wondering if I still rap now
Are you serious, anybody out there hearing this?
Yo I came in the game as a lyricist
And I'ma leave like that, period
You sniff lines, I write lines, you've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready cause you might find
I'm from a different place and my kind
It's a little bit different than yours is
Quit snoring hip hop isn't dead
It's just been in mourning from the moment I quit recording
Quick, record this
Listen I'm warming up and you're misinformed if
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough, then I'll skip the chorus
I've been here ain't nobody heard of me?
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene
I don't live for the world
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus
Wrote this with emotion
It's hard to get a break when the door's ain't open
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice. Hold it
What am I insane maybe, plain crazy
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
You do what you wanted but you can't contain me
Lazy is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line
This is the current condition of my state of mind

Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have all I have

All I ever wanted was somebody to get this
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this
Take my song, put it on their playlist and get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us
If that's my calling or not Father, maybe I should just not bother
Go back to that nine to five but I am not a quitter so quit that
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that
Trying to make an impact in rap, is that insane?
Well, I guess so
Rap though, better give me that pencil
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental
I am in a place where I can't let go ah!
I still work a job and do this
And y'all know what's stupid?
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal and yo things start moving
But that's not the case because most of the times the artists you hear
You keep on thinking that artist is new but that artist has probably been at it for years
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking
Am I wasting my time dreaming
And I ain't got no money in my wallet but
I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this
I need this I swear to y'all I need this
And this hip-hop's in my veins if you cut me I'ma bleed it
And yo. What you think I write write raps for no reason, no
Take my pain and I put em in a song ever since them pills they took my mom
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain
I stand behind these words I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect
Don't tell me to calm down I'm calm now, listen I'm just working
Yeah it might take a minute to get it but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
I don't think they see my vision here I don't think they see my vision here!

Trusting other people's something I don't really love to do
I've never been a fan of it, I act tougher
Really my shoulders they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing
It's like I'm standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
But I would rather stand there being wet than take the handout
What's wrong with me?
You said, you've always got your hands out
And I can't continue on my own so take my hands now
I give you everything, God, not just a little bit
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite
I hate sin but I built a house and asked to live in it
Afraid to open up the door to you, let you into it
My soul is lost and what it needs is your direction
I know, I've told you I do not need your protection
But I lied to you, this thing is tiring
A man was not created for a God

I'm just being honest
Please take this outta my hands
I have no control, I am just a person
But thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect
I do not deserve the opportunity you've given me
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me
My life will always have a hold of you and not the centerpiece
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride
If I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies
There's no better feeling then when I look in the sky, in your eyes, it's amazing

I come in your house with a microphone
Lookin' like I'm about to set up a show in your kitchen
I'm outta my mind but I feel like I'm in it
If I never make it, don't make any difference
I'm still gonna kill it
You know what the deal is
Ain't never no chillin' when I'm in the buildin'

NF is a monster, I am a villain
My music is sick, and you don't know what ill is
You better get back, I don't write any filler
I write what I feel and I'm feelin' a million
So you better shh, be quiet, you hear it?
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm on a whole different level of music
Don't treat me like I don't have no clue how to do this
You better rethink what you're thinkin' and move it
Now picture me writin' when I was a kid tryna make it in music
I'm thinkin' it's crazy

I spent all my money on studio time, tryna get on my music so people could play it
I'ma keep it one hundred, my music was terrible
Learned to get better, the more that I made it
Go back to my Moments album
Most of you people, you probably don't know what I'm sayin', hold up!
What you're witnessin' now, don't try to figure me out
I grab on that microphone, jawin' the crowd
They was laughin' at me, who they laughin' at now, huh?
I laugh at myself, some people they lookin' like, wow
The moment you told me that you was a rapper, I couldn't believe it
You believe it now?

Step in the booth and I murder it
You never heard of a rapper that kill it like I do
I sleep on the couch in the studio, stay up 'til 3 in the morning
And write 'till I get more
The moment I wake up I feel like I don't even sleep
And I'm ready to put out my record
Well, thank you for buyin' it!
Maybe you burned it!
But either way, I'm gonna wreck it!
I look at the industry, look what it did to me
You'll never make it if you never grind

You put a whole lot of money into it, you better be ready to give it your time
I look at the past few years of my life and I promise you I have been given it mine
Try to keep up with this
I'm not a puppet, no string on my back, I'm one of a kind
Music is changing, no way to tame this
I am an artist, look what I painted
Hang up the caution tape, I'm dangerous
Does anyone know where my brain is?
Rappers are comfortable knowing they're famous
But I really don't care what your name is
And I really don't care if I'm nameless
Y'all just drivin' around, I know where my lane is

Nah, I'm competitive?

This is a job for me, it's adrenaline
Don't try to box me in, I am Mayweather
I come in the ring, my punches are way better
I never drink but I live in these bars
The moment you blink is the moment you lost
Say you a king, who put you in charge?
Don't care what you think, I'll break in your car
Climb on the top of it, sound the alarm
And wake up the neighborhood, rap in your yard
And the carry the speakers on both of my arms
'Til you keep sleepin' on me, I'm at large
Enough with the jokes, I ain't jokin'
You come in a session with me Imma show you what dope is
And when I say dope I ain't talkin' 'bout smoke
And I'm talkin' 'bout music that has an emotion
I look at this mic, it's part of my family

Take it away, I'm comin' to find you
I've been through a lot in my life
And it's hard to get people to listen when no one's behind you
And then Capitol came in the picture and gave me a shot
And look at it now
I look at the team I'm dealin' with, these people ain't playin' around
Lookin' back, I gotta laugh
I was in a whole different place a year ago
I look at the math, I look at the map
And thank you God, I swear it's a miracle
And I'm sorry, but I gotta leave

Broken legs but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion

Yo, my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics, they're all over the place
There's songs in the mirrors written all over the floors, all over the chairs
And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release
And let out the version of NF you don't want to see
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists 'til they bleed
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
Physically abused, now that's the room that I don't want to be in
That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't want to see it
And these walls ain't blank, I just think I don't want to see 'em
But why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
Matter of fact I think I'ma burn this room right now
So now this memory for some reason just won't come down
You used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes
Then took me downstairs and beat me 'til I screamed and I cried
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
But I'ma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
See, my problem is I don't fix things, I just try to repaint
Cover em up, like it never happened
Say I wish I could change, are you confused?
Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
This room's full of regrets, just keeps getting fuller it seems
The moment I walk in to it is the same moment that I wanna leave
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
I look around, one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
And one of the first things I wrote was I wish I would have called
But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing like it’s out of my hands
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watching these trust issues eat me alive
And at the rate I'm going they'll probably still be there when I die
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
The question is, will I ever clean the walls off in time?

So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built the safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear and not come back
And I admit I am emotionally scared to let anyone inside
So I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up but this door's not
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I'm barricaded inside so stop watching
I'm not coming to the door so stop knocking, stop knocking
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shutting the wall down ain't solving the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve ´em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's living in here
Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
Maybe that's the problem 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious he never did
He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
Now I'm in the position it's either sit here and let him win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
'Cause in order to do that I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking?

And these beats are my playground, let the words play
You ain't catch it? 
That's wordplay
Now you're stuck on the word ""play""
I'm all business, no suit on, but that's okay
I will K.O. you, if you come in my work space
And don't you ever try to tell me I lack passion
I'm a stand up guy, I promise you ain't laughing
These rappers are slowing the game down, bad traffic
And how you gonna put me in a category of wack rappin'?
Listen, I'm Hulk, I transform and I smash rappers
You sipping on syrup, that doesn't mean you a sick rapper
See what it means is you gon' probably get sick after
You don't like that I'm blunt, or is it the fact that I smoke passion?

I'm no teacher, but you'll learn to adjust
I'm my own worst critic, so critics step your hate game up
I'm a different breed of artist, I know how to survive
You come into my lane, you better know how to drive
And I suggest you buckle up if you gon' come on this ride
No Johnny Cash but some of y'all are walking the line
But you wrong though, y'all look curious
Heath Ledger type of questions like, ""why so serious?""
And you want watered down lyrics? 
Well I don't carry 'em
I dig holes for these tracks, and then I slaughter and bury 'em
The motivation I got is on a whole different level
I treat these lines like court case, I don't wanna settle
My lyrics are like bullets and they're aiming at you
And I ain't talking Switchfoot when I dare you to move

No I said I'm a land mine
Don't step on me, or you get blown sky high
And I don't mean secrets when I say to keep it in mind
That I'm ill with the words, too sick
They say I rap hungry, well that's 'cause I'm star-vin (Vin), Diesel
That´s why they calling me riddick-ulous (ridiculous)
'Cause the look in my eyes is different

You've been there for the whole thing
Help me with the drama
Rapping in the car outside daily
We don’t care if it’s the winter
We don’t care if its the summer
I remember writing raps with the curse words
I just wanna hear it
It seems like everybody does it
Did it for awhile wasn't into all the cussin'
Trying to find who I was
Being everything I wasn't
Real life yeah
Gotta lot of anger
You know where I'm at
Put it all of it in the pages
And wrote it into raps, said that we could be amazing, if I give us a chance
Now im lookin round like yeah, look at where we at?
Look at where we at now, we ain't made it yet but they can here us in the background comin'
Some are gonna hate it, some are gonna love it
I'ma put it in his hands and let God do the judging, yah!
Remember me and you always had you in the backpack
Took you into school writing on you like its nuthin' a lot of people in the room
See me scribble on a page but they ain't got a clue, naw they ain't got a clue
We're here to begin it hoping someday you and I can say
We made it and we did it
You ain't nuthin but a notepad to me, Who am I kiddin?
I'm just runnin out of space I'll be back in a minute
Turn the page homie

You know what’s crazy is
This just started as something that was an escape for us
You know
And now I look around and, there’s a lot of people going
Through the same things that we've been through
Now this music we write is actually making an impact it’s crazy

NF,"You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake
If you'd open your eyes then maybe you'd see what's at stake
You're sleeping, you're sleeping

You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
You got nothing, so what you do then is you start going backwards
You runnin' in a direction
And you lookin' for something that isn't real
And all you know is that you just gotta have it
What you're doin' is sleepin'
And thinking that you're awake and you're not
And the problem is that you don't know what you're after
So you put everything that you have into what you do
Hoping that one day maybe you don't have to feel like you're empty
But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
Then you look back and you start to regret things
You only get one life
And every time you lookin' at yours
You feel like everything you have is a waste!
And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
Is because you were never awake

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

You wake up in the morning
But you feel like you never got up and go to work
And you feelin' like you ain't got a purpose
And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
Like you ain't nothing but worthless
And, yo, you look around
A lot of these other people you lookin' at
To you, you describe as perfect
So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job
And fix ya' life up cause nothin' is workin'
And you will try to hide and make it seem like it's nothin'
But really you feel like everything is crashin' around you
And you develop a problem in trustin' in other people
Which later became an issue that will mentally pound you
You only get one life
But every time you lookin' at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
Is because you were never awake
Wake up

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake

I'm a simple person, city life just doesn't move me
I'd rather be home with my grandparents and playing Euchre

I left my girl there, wish I would've done it different

Sometimes the closest people to you make you feel protected
But those are the same people that hurt you most and leave you guessing
Some people say nobody's perfect but expect perfection
How you supposed to find the answer if you don't ask the question?
Sometimes I look into the mirror and talk to my reflection
When I go home and turn the music off, what am I left with?

We used to be close but it's time past, we became disconnected
You never felt love and I always felt disrespected
Your family thought I was a joke, I was always defensive
They just wanted what was best for you, I just couldn't accept it
And hurting you was not a part of my plan or my intentions
But I was immature, I guess I had to learn some lessons
We grew apart and our lives went in different directions
And there's a lot of responsibilities that I neglected
I had a lot that was bottled inside, couldn't express it
And this pain won't leave, I can feel the depression
It's taking over my body, feels like I'm always stressing
Doctor told me I should sleep, but I'm always restless
I lay awake at night and think, my thoughts are relentless

We sitting in the living room in our winter coats
Yeah, we sitting in the living room in our winter coats, 
me in my room mate, we like they don't know
Driving around town in the Grand Prix
People telling me that I should get a plan B
Snow on the windshield, can't see, won't work
6 in the morning, that's me
Sometimes I miss all those memories
They pop up back in my mind like, ""Remember me""
Records stop selling, these people won't care for me
The older you get, the more family is everything

I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it, I said I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it

I can feel it, I can feel it
I said I can feel it, I can feel it

I said I can feel it, I can feel it

Yeah, I can feel it, I can feel it, yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it, been a long time coming
I can feel it, I can feel it, been a long time coming yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it, yeah I said here we go
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh yeah

NF,"Only time you ever call me is when you feelin’ like don't nobody else wanna listen
When’s the last time you saw me
You probably don’t remember that ’cause that was back then you were different
I don’t wanna hear the sorry’s
I’m tired of all the talkin’ to be honest I would rather see a difference
Yeah, you pass me in the hallway
But you ain’t say a word to me
Lately all I ever feel is distant
You don’t care that you lost me
What’s wrong with ya
Had a picture of you sittin’ on the dash in the car with me
Now it’s in my closet with the other ones sittin’ in a box
I don’t wanna open up
You took it all from me
Told me you would die for me
Yeah, all you ever do is lie to me
Wish that I could say that this has come as surprise see to me
Told me that I never took the time and now you ain’t got the time for me
Yeah

I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh oh
Don’t you see me

We used to talk like best friends
I remember that I guess I don’t know what happened to us
Now you got me questionin’ what trust is
You told me you would be there for me
Yeah, but you ain’t really mean it did ya
Now you wanna jump ship
Leave me here alone
Well, I’m used to it
Everybody else did
Who you havin’ fun with
Don’t tell me I don't wanna know every time I ask I just feel sick
You're the one that jumped in
Told me you had some feelins
Now you tryin’ to tell me that is not true
I ain’t gotta clue
Who I’m lookin’ at right now, but I know the person that I’m lookin’ at is not you
Yeah
They say that you are who you hang with
Maybe that’s the reason you been changin’
Maybe that’s the reason why I’m feelin’ like you’re dangerous
And every time we talk it’s like I’m talkin’ to a stranger

I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh oh
Don’t you see me
I thought that we were close oh, oh
But now that door is closed oh, oh
When did we lose control oh, oh, oh
Guess you don’t need me
I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh oh
Don’t you see me
I thought that we were close oh, oh
But now that door is closed oh, oh
When did we lose control oh, oh, oh
Guess you don’t need me",I Just Wanna Know
NF,"I'm back, did anyone miss me?
They said a second record could be tricky
Well that's kind of funny cause I am not tripping
My fans, they know what it is and they with me
Yeah, I ain't the type that's gon' ride with the semi
I came from a town with three lakes and no city
I've been doing shows for nothing but pennies
When I leave the stage, they never forget me
Mansion was a glimpse of my life
I let you see what it's like to be in my head
People ask me what I think I think I be doin'
If it wasn't music, I'd rather be dead
You heard what I said, that was like me at a 3, you don't want to see me at 10
Or maybe you do
I promise if that is the case, then that is what you're gonna get
If you're looking for music with watered down lyrics
I promise that you need to go somewhere else
And if you want somebody to tell you everything that you wanna hear I won't be any help
This flow is familiar. I think I heard it before
Oh yeah, I made it myself
I left the door open to come in my mansion but I never said it's a beautiful house
Some of ya'll sat on the porch
Looked at my windows and stared at my door
They ask me if I'm going to kill it this record
I laugh in their face and I ask 'em, ""Do you see the blood on the floor?""
He's at it again, NF is crazy he's bad with the kids
He never talks about nothing but him
Yeah, my friends say, ""He's kind of a diva.""
Well, you need to get some new friends
I'm as true as it gets
'Till I get on the stage and flip on the switch
And I go to a place where nobody is
If you putting my name in the song, that's something that you won't regret
I'm not lying to you here
I remember the shows when no one was there
I remember the shows when nobody cared
Some people in front of me laughing like, ""He isn't going nowhere.""
It's funny now, isn't it?
This type of life isn't how I envisioned it
This type of life, it just ain't how I pictured it
I'm in the back of the tour bus, trying to face how my family is different.
Not what you think it is
Write a review, tell me what you think of this
Give me three stars and call me and idiot
But to be honest, it don't make a difference
I know some people don't get it
But you have now entered the Therapy Session
If you don't like music that's personal
I have no clue what you people are doing here
Might as well throw out the record
I pull up a chair
I track through my music like nobody's there
Only person I judge is the one in the mirror
I'm lately he ain't doin' well
I don't need ya'll in my ear
I'm tired of hearing it
You call it music, I call it my therapist
Sick people telling me I have been carrying way too much baggage
I need to take care of it
I know she's right, but man it's embarrassing
Music has raised me more than my parents did
Take out a picture of us and I stare at it
Who am I kidding? You probably ain't hearing this
Show me an artist you want to compare me with
You put us both on a track, I'm a bury 'em
Give me this shovel, it's 'bout to get scarier
None of you want to attack what you staring at
I see you got beats, but where is the lyrics at?
NF is the logo, you know I been wearing that
Don't come to my show and be sittin' in the very back
I call you out in the crowd like, ""There he is!""
I thought I'd be happy. It feels like I'm cursed
It's hard to be clean when you play in the dirt
You gave me this place to go when I'm hurting
I thought it'd get better, but it's getting worse
And I got nobody to blame when I work, like 24/7
I ain't been to church, and Satan keep callin' me, he tryin' to flirt
I hang up the phone, these are more than just words
I drive on that highway and listen to Mansion
I look up to God like, ""When did this happen?""
Yelling with all of my fans to ""Wake up!""
But feel like I haven't
I get emotional. I didn't plan this
I'm doing things I never imagined
I'm sorry but I gotta leave
I don't wanna be late for my therapy session",Intro 2
NF,"This may be the last sunset I'll see
So I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last air that I'll breathe
So I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in

I heard that pictures don't change
Just the people inside of 'em do
Whoever told you that life would be easy
I promise that person was lyin' to you
You got a problem with followin' through
That's why I got a problem with followin' you
You keep lookin' at me like this problem is new
But we’ve been here before, what you tryin' to do?
Don't talk to me like I don't know what you feeling
'Cause I was there with you back in the beginning
Quit looking away when I talk, let me finish
I'm tryna be honest, you're tryna forget me, ugh
What's wrong with you, hey?
I know that you got a lot on your plate
You keep telling me I should get out of your way
But I can't see how you gon' lie to my face
Don't tell me you fine 'cause I know that you not so don't even try
And what we gon' live for in this life full of pain 
'Till we're eighty and one day we'll get up and say we regretted our lives
That's where we going
Do not pretend like you don't even notice
Funny thing is that you already know it
I'm starting to think that you like how I feel so be lost in the moment

Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

Yeah, they told us that time flies, didn't know what it means
Now I feel like we just running around tryna
Catch it and hoping to cut up its wings
But that ain't gon' happen
Joy, when was the last time we had it?
I don't remember 'cause all that we do
Is go backwards but that's what you get
When you live in the past
And I know we breathing but we not alive
Really, is this the way we wanna die?
'Til you got everything bottled inside
If only they knew what goes on in our minds
I know what you thinking so don't try to hide
Why do you look at me like you surprised?
If you really mean what you write in these lines
Why don't you fix it? 'Cause I'm getting tired
Yeah, I can no longer do this
Ever since you fell in love with the music
You find a way to express what you feel
But the moment that you get away from the mic
You don't know what you doing
Is it clear to you yet?
I don't know what's going on in your head
But eventually, you'll have to deal with the things
That you talk about yeah, but I guess until then, we're lost

Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment

Yeah, oh, yeah, oh lost
Oh, yeah, oh, no no
This may be the last songs that I'll sing
So I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last day that I'll breathe
So I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in",Lost in the Moment
NF,"When I die, put my ashes in the trash bag
I don't care where they go
Don't waste your money on my gravestone
I'm more concerned about my soul
Everybody's gon' die
Don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder do You see us down here?

Oh Lord, oh Lord, do You see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord

Listen, yeah everybody wants change
Don't nobody wanna change though
Don't nobody wanna pray
Till they got something to pray for
Now everybody's gon' die
But don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder do you see us down here?

Oh Lord, oh Lord, do You see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord

It's easy to blame God but harder to fix things
We look in the sky like, ""Why ain't You listening?""
Watching the news in our living rooms on the big screens
And talking 'bout ""If God's really real, then where is He?""
You see the same God that you saying might not even exist
Becomes real to us, but only when we dying in bed
When ya healthy it's like, we don't really care for Him then
Leave me alone God, I'll call you when I need you again
Which is funny, everyone will sleep in the pews
Then blame God for our problems like He sleeping on you
We turn our backs on Him, what do you expect Him to do?
It's hard to answer prayers when nobody's praying to you
I look around at this world we walk on
It's a smack in the face, don't ever tell me there's no God
And if there isn't then what are we here for?
And what are y'all doing down there? I don't know Lord

Oh Lord, oh Lord, do You see us down here?
Oh Lord, oh Lord

Do You see us down here? Oh Lord
Can You see us down here? Oh Lord

Can You see us? Can't You see us?",Oh Lord
NF,"Yeah, real music
(Yeah)
Yo, ya just get in that, you get in that head space, ya know

Somebody get the body bags, working with beats and
Put the MC’s in ‘em, season 'em, put 'em on a beat with me, then I’m eating ‘em
Get away from the table, you rappers ain’t hungry enough, you rappers ain't hungry like ah
They talk about me like I'm here, they talk about you like you was
That nurse came into my room, she told me I'm sick in the head
I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed with a pad and a pin and a brace on my neck
They told me that I’m never leaving. Why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game
I'mma come in they session and cut off they legs, woo
Strap a grenade to my head, pull out the pin
My music is mind blowin', ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain’t never been on my level, I gotta part 'em out the way
To keep 'em talking and acting like everybody 
Gonna get up in a sleep with your eyes open
You wanna know what I noticed?
I look around and my fanbase and they ready
That last album was heavy, that last album was gritty
How you gon' match that? Just let me
Do what I do best
You're better off playing Russian roulette
Then comin' in a booth with me cause I get
A little bit intense, I’m like, “Who’s next?”
Y'all better watch it, take a look at where the clock is
It’s my time, this ladder of music that I climbed
I took the machete, the game isn’t ready
Them rappers, they coming up on me, I cut off the ladder, and I told ‘em, “bye-bye”
What? Were you lookin’ for a high-five? Nice try
Do not believe everything that you read on the Internet
I do not know who your dentist is, but he should clean out your mouth
Don’t call me a sellout, that’s something I’ve never been
I've been through hell all my life though
But I know where heaven is
Father forgive me, for I am a sinner
But you gave me music as medicine
And nobody want a problem when they get in my zone better leave me be
I'm a mean MC, better feed me rappers or feed me beats, ah, feed me both of 'em
They like ""Nate, what's it like to be famous?""
Um, I'll let you know if I make it
I wonder what life will be like if I didn't stick out my neck
200 dollars inside of my bank account, woo, I was living on that
I need some money to pay for my rent, I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complaining, I'm just being honest, I promise that I will not beg for respect
I get so frustrated, take a look at what I created
Time is wasting and I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job
Me, I don't have no patients
I keep pacing back and forth, I keep racing
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it, why? 
Cause you acting like you read my pages
I wreck these stages, real talk, better give me space cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it, I'm not famous, I'm just Nathan
And I wonder how the world gon' take this
They might hate it, but you don't know anything about me
You know I'll leave 'em changing
Cause you know I'm real with it, don't care if you feeling it
I'm feeling it, you don't like it then deal with it, and if God ain't real, real isn't
You still wonder why I existed, I exist in the world that's real different
And what you gon' be when you grow up Nate? I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess, better watch your step when you step in it
Some of this brain is off limits I'm off in a
 World that you don't get cause you ain't ever been in it
In 10 minutes, I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain, don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines, I'm just protecting 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life then don't get so sensitive
When I say something a little bit raw
I jot my thoughts and they call it negative
You wanna know where my heart is? I stand out cause I wear my garbage
I work my hardest and every time I look into the mirror
Don't forget about where I started

Tell me what am I doing?
Tell me what am I doing?
Tell me what am I, what am I doing?
Mmm
Tell me what am I doing?
I say what am I doing?
Tell me what am I doing here?
If I'm not being real, mmm",Real

Quit with the trash talk before you get tossed in it
Y'all tripping, bar ripping, y'all sipping too much, right to the palms dripping
Lost in it, thoughts different, you don't want no drama? Then don't get involved in it
I'm in a whole different head space, you making money? Well that's great
I got no interest in talking to people that I know are two faced
Too fake, get outta my face, woo
What are you doing in my lane? There's already too many rappers
I'm sick of the traffic and I ain't got no brakes
I already passed you, you don’t like what I’m doing, who asked you?
You got into music cause you think it’s fun, man I’m doing this cause I have to
It’s real music, chills to it, feel through it, real stupid
Skills truest, quit moving, woo
If I say something, I will do it
I used to dream of these moments
I'm living 'em now
Look up to heaven like Mom are you proud?
I'm on my way to New Zealand, I'm up in the clouds, dang
I mean who woulda known this, who woulda known this
This industry never told me I was welcome
I went to the house in the back
And broke in then told 'em that I would be back
I flat line, all of your whack rhymes, that's mine
Might get away from it boy MM LP, I'm the bad guy, the last time
I have been taking it easy, the game's mine, fame why?
I don't care about none of that, I'm just speaking the trash lines
I grew up on Eminem, now look where the game's at
Lame raps, Hollywood fame acts, I'm sick of the same trash
I got no blunt in my mouth but give me a beat, I'mma blaze that
Give me a beat, I'mma blaze that, you and me ain't in the same class
You and me ain't on the same row, music has always been my home
I used to call up some people that won't call me back, now they blowing up my phone
Ain't it funny how that works? Mad perks, killing the record
Got blood on my black shirt, I'm jealous in love with the music, don't ever come near her
I ain't from around here, how you let me run it down here?
If that isn't bothering none of you rappers then what are y'all doing out here?
It was like music to my ears, might never make it, I don't care
Drake, I love what you doing but call up the game and tell 'em that I'm here, yeah
I like that, might snap, I laugh, y'all better surrender and get out your white flags
And cancel your flight plans, your career isn't taking off
You sound like a hype man, hit you with the mic stand
And they ask what the hype's about, come and find out, I mean, where is you clowns at?
I been training, pen game is insane, I'm done playing
This music is ground breaking, lung shaking, done waiting
Y'all taking my patience, quit faking, y'all hating, it's crazy
I mean you know who my name is, rhyme slayer, stop Nathan
Woo!",Statement
NF,"Yeah, I gotta say like a month ago
I was talking to fans
And one of them pulled me aside and said
""We never met but I swear that you know who I am
I been through a lot
I don't know how to express it to people
Don't think that I can but I got that mansion CD on rotation
That's real for me Nate, you do not understand""
It's crazy for me
Kids hit me up, say they slitting they wrists on the daily
This music is more than you think
Don't book me for just entertainment, it's entertaining
Hearing these parents, they telling their kids
My music is violent, you gotta be kidding me
I guess that your definition of violence and mine
Is something that we look at differently
How do you picture me ah?
Want me to smile, you want me to laugh
You want me to walk in the stage with a smile on my face
When I'm mad and put on a mask, for real though
I mean, what you expect from me?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say that life is a race
I know my problems'll probably catch up eventually
I do my best to be calm
How you gon' write me and tell me you slaughter my family?
That's just a glimpse to the stuff that get sent to me
These the parts of my life that'll never see, woo
I am aware it's aggressive
I am not here for acceptance
I don't know what you expect here
But what you expect when you walk in a therapy session?

Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

This girl at the show looked me in the face
And told me her life's full of drama
Said that her dad is abusive
Apparently he likes to beat on her mama
I got so angry inside
I wanted to tell her to give me his number
But what you gon' do with it right?
You gon' hit him up then he'll start hitting her harder
That's real
These kids, they come to my shows
With tears in they eyes
Imagine someone looking at you
And saying your music's the reason that they are alive
Sometimes, I don't know how to handle it
This type of life isn't glamorous
This ain't an act for the cameras
You see me walk on these stages but have no idea what I'm dealing with after it
I put it all in the open
This is the way that I cope with all my emotion
I'm taking pictures with thousands of people
But honestly, I feel like nobody knows me
I'm trying to deal with depression
I'm trying to deal with the pressure
How you gon' tell me my music does not have a message
When I'm looking out at this crowd full of people I know I affected?
Ah, I got some things in my life, I know I should let 'em go
Let me jot it down, let me take a mental note
I put it all in this microphone, think about that for a minute
What is the point of this song, I'm just venting but what you expect from a therapy session?

Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

What you think about me
That doesn't worry me
I know I handle some things immaturely
I know that I need to grow in maturity
I ain't gon' walk on these stages in front of these people
And act like I live my life perfectly
That doesn't work for me
Christian is not the definition of a perfect me, woo
I ain't the type to be quiet
I ain't gon' sit here in silence
If I wouldn't say what I say to your face
Then I promise you I wouldn't say it in private
I am not lying
People go off on my page and I'm trying to quit the replying
But this is ridiculous
I'm passionate man, I really mean what I'm writing
You want me to keep it 100? Okay, I'll keep it 100
I see a whole lot of talking on socials
But honestly, I don't see nothing in public
I kinda love it, yeah
""Why don't you write us some happy raps?
That would be awesome
All your music is moody and dark, Nate""
Don't get me started
You wanna know what it's like if you met me in person?
Listen to my verses
This music is not just for people
Who sit in the pews and pray at the churches
I won't reject it
I don't expect everyone to respect it
I don't expect you to get my perspective
What you expect from a therapy session?

I mean, I think sometimes people they confuse what I'm doing
I write about life, I write about things that I'm actually dealing with
Something that I'm actually experiencing, this is real for me
Like this is something that personally helps me as well
I'm not confused about who gave me the gift
God gave me the gift and he gave me the ability to do this
And he also gave me this as an outlet
And that's what music is for me
When I feel something, whether it's anger
Um, it's a passion about something, or frustration
Like this is where I go, this is, that's the whole nfrealmusic thing man
This is real for me, I need this, this is a therapy for me",Therapy Session
NF,"We gotta talk about things
We gotta do something different

I don't, I don't know if I can do this
Riding 'round in the city, babe
I know you wish you could change me
Why you mad? Girl, why you angry?
Yeah, why you angry?
Back and forth, you love you hate me
Arguing about the same things
I don't, I don't know if I can do this

I apologise but those ain't my hours, you ain't never been with a man
Who's working this kinda job, who works for this kind of drive
I wouldn't be with me either
Hold up, yeah I think that's work on the other line, I gotta go
We can argue some another time
Hand up the phone, I regret it right after
This is the chance that I couldn't just pass up
See I signed a deal, you say that I should've asked ya
I guess I was scared to see how you reacted
And maybe I knew I'd be selfish
These are the things I ain't proud of
I'm always the type to get jealous, there's always two sides to the story
And you're not the one that I blame when I tell it, that's real, yeah
You ain't the one, you ain't the one
I mean I should've manned up and that's hard to say as a man
The older I get the more I understand a relationship's more than just holding her hand
I'm sorry, you can blame me, yeah, you can blame me

I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things

I'm the type to rent a hotel room just to feel at home
I'm the type to rent a hotel room just to be alone
I got an issue with people pretending they like what they don't
Please don't bring up my issues unless you gon' deal with your own
Please don't try to pretend like you keep it real, though
Yeah it's funny that you got a lotta money
But that money doesn't buy you skills, though
I don't care if I am on the billboards
On a killing spree, I'm about to kill more
Got a chain on you paid a mill' for
I mean what you people even live for?
I write raps, you steal yours, oh Lord (haha)

We just getting warmed up
Yeah, I said I was coming, I warned you
So close to the fans, I feel like they ride on my tour bus
You wanna know what I do in my downtime?
Then come to my fortress
I apologize for all the corpses
It's a mess right now but I haven't had time to put the rappers in the coffins

We ain't talked in like six years, why you writing me now?
I just turned 100k down just to keep the brand looking right, now (that's real)
I ain't bragging about the money, I'm just saying I ain't controlled by the bank account
Or the bank amounts
I'm a businessman but don't touch my money, I don't play around

Lights out when the mics out
About to hit the West Coast, hype crowd
I just put a record out
What you think I'm gonna pipe down?
Nah, I've been looking for a beat, look what I found, woo
I mean everything that's coming out of my mouth
Tried to tell me, yeah, I ain't had the right sound
Oh, yeah, well
Tell me what you think now
Two records in the bag, I ain't done, though
What's coming next year?
Let me hear the drum roll
Don't flow, anybody wanna be the one to make an issue out of nothing?
I'mma hit you with my iPhone
I know I'm a little out of hand now
I ain't looking for a handout
You didn't like what I was doing last year
Which is funny 'cause you lookin' like a fan now
Are you a fan now?

I kinda miss being broke now let me go back to my old days
When I used to walk into high school
And hand out my CD in hallways
I told all my teachers that I'd be a rapper
They smiled and looked at me, ""okay""
That's a pretty nice dream, but you better get a real job""
""Mmm, no way""
Yeah I live what you dreamin'
I could do this while I'm sleepin'
I ain't the type that will bring up your name for nothing
But please, don't give me a reason
I'm on the edge now, I ain't playin' with you
Never really been a fan of takin' pictures
I'm just being honest, yeah, I'll take it with you
Shows sellin' out, better get your tickets, oh Lord!
I got a love for the fans
I can't express what it feels like
Sometimes I wonder if it's even real life
Sometimes I look at the past and think about how I got here in the first place
You know the glove is my birthplace
I don't wanna be rude but I could get you on my worst days
Say nothing for me, do it all the time
Yeah they barely workin' while I'm workin' overtime
Last year they like, ""who am I?""
Now this year they like, ""you the guy""

And if necessary, use words. St. Francis of Assisi

We're passengers aboard the train
Silent little lambs amidst the pain
That's no longer good enough
And when it's time to speak our faith
We use a language no one can explain
That's no longer good enough

And God knows it's a shame
As we look to pass the flame
We are not the worthy bearers of his name

[Chorus]
For the world to know the truth
There can be no greater proof
Than to live the life, live the life
There's no love that's quite as pure
There's no pain we can't endure
If we live the life, live the life
Be a light for all to see
For every act of love will set you free

There's something beautiful and bold
The power of a million human souls
Come together as one
And each in turn goes out to lead
Another by his word, his love, his deed
Now the circle is done

It all comes back to One
For it is He and He alone
Who has lived the only perfect life we've known

It drives you mad this pretty sight
The fake faces the fake smiles
You want escape, you close your eyes


The sandman comes you slip to dreams
A peaceful world that´s what it seems
While bombs are crashing down your home
You are asleep you are alone


And nobody cares and nobody cries
And all continues during this time 
If dreams come true, i´ll tell you mine
No dreams at all, just wake up fine

Is this the goal of our lives ?
Surviving just like in ancient times ?
Are people just like living dead
Working for their daily bread.",Dream

If you take one step closer it will lead to another.

Sweet miracles and strange circumstances.
I see the sun up, the showdown, the cool winds that blow down
On the big beat the life long romance is.
You've got a gun in your hand; you're making self plans.
Stay with me all through the night.
Control yourself.  Love is all you need.
Control yourself.  Open up your heart.

You can't stop the world for a boy or a girl.
Sweet victims of poor circumstances.
But you can pour back the love, sweeping down
From above, giving hope and making more chances.
Well, I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll come back down here and show me the way.

Niamh Parsons,"Black is the colour of my true love's hair
Her lips are like some roses fair
She's the sweetest face and the gentlest hands
I love the ground wheron she stands

I love my love and well she knows
I love the ground whereon she goes
But some times I whish the day will come
That she and I will be as one

Black is the colour of my true love's hair
Her lips are like some roses fair
She's the sweetest face and the gentlest hands
I love the ground wheron she stands

I walk to the Clyde for to mourn and weep
But satisfied I never can sleep
I'll write her a letter, just a few short lines
And suffer death ten thousand times


Black is the colour of my true love's hair
Her lips are like some roses fair
She's the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands
I love the ground wheron she stands 

then i sat down and I wrote this song
I wrote it neat I wrote it long
and with every line i shed a tear
and at last i said farewell my dear

so faretheewell my own true love

and if heaven or earth no more i'll see
i'll treat you like you treated me",Black Is the Color
Niamh Parsons,"The strange young man who comes to me
A soldier on a three day spree
He needs one night's cheap ecstasy 
And a woman's arms to hide him
He greets me with a courtly bow
And hides his pain by acting proud
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him.

Let us dance beneath the moon
I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'
The morning always comes too soon
But tonight the war is over
He speaks to me in schoolboy French
Of a soldiers life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him

He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me neath the Paris skies
Let's not talk of how or why
Tomorrow's soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard too fast
He falls asleep his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him

They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belguim and France the dead are everywhere
They die so so fast there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory old world fame
The old worlds gone gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them

Tonight the war is over

It tastes like pork and beans

Citified high heels
I can tell by your giant step

Oh, you're so down home girl

Every time you monkey child
You take my breath away
Every time you move like that
I gotta get down and pray

Don't you know, that dress of yours
Is made out of fiberglass
And every time you move like that

Nic Jones,"Shotover river, your gold it is waning 
It's weeks since the colour I've seen 
But it's no use just sitting and Lady Luck blaming 
So I'll pack up and make the break clean 

Farewell to the gold that never I found 
Goodbye to the nuggets that somewhere abound 
For it's only when dreaming that I see you gleaming 
Down in the dark, deep underground 

It's nearly two years since I left my old mother 
For adventure and gold by the pound 
With Jimmy the prospector - he was another 
For the hills of Otago was bound 

We worked the Cardrona's dry valley all over 
Old Jimmy Williams and me 
But they were panning good dirt on the winding Shotover 
So we headed down there just to see 

We sluiced and we cradled for day after day 
Making hardly enough to get by 
Til a terrible flood swept poor Jimmy away 
During six stormy days in July

Because Nice & Smooth is like dope on a rope

Lookin out beyond a level of sight and sound
To wear a crown might be profound
But pound for pound I must astound you
Or leave a stain inside your membrane
I want to reign, supreme like a Powerlord
And use my brain and a pen, like a shield and a sword
Since my mind conceive this, why not believe it
My hands receive it, and therefore I must achieve it
Then I have no other alternative
Than to show the party people just how I live
See I emerged from a level called brown
And like an atom radiates, I develop from the elements
Then I saw a vision of greatness
So I proceeded to follow a path, where only warriors go
I found the glow, I learned to know to go with the flow
I've grown, but must continue to grow
I'm like the sun, or should I say the North Star
A black pearl, or maybe I'm a quasar
I'm bright as hell, sometimes it even scares me
How in the world could one MC, be so deep?
I don't creep, like a frog I leap
And I, reap what I sew and sew what I reap
My lyrics seep into your soul and gain control
This is a fact not rigamarole
I'm icy cold but warm like a mink stole
See I've been writin' rhymes, since I was pre-natal
I have a lust and hunger for stage, my attraction is fatal
If I was to categorize me
I'd be a bigger surprise than human eyes could see

Look, stare, you can scope
Because Nice & Smooth is like dope on a rope
Yo, Nice & Smooth is like dope on a rope
Yo, Nice & Smooth is like dope on a rope

Early to rise
We gotta get paid
Early to bed
Yo, yo, we gotta get laid
I think it's time for us
To make fresh rhymes out of our heads

Early mornin, break of dawn'n
At the hotel, we be yawnin
Take off your clothes, take off mine
Sun is shinin I'm feelin fine
Stop it booty I don't want to do the do
But I want the breakfast menu
C'mon, give me a big be	-B.L.T.
C'mon, give me a glass of vitamin see
Toast with butter, not a cover
If you burn it I'll want a-nother
Because I'm choosy and I'm small
I'm like Cinderella at the ball
I throw my hands, up in the air
I got the juice you never com-pare
Ladies shake your derriere
Homeboy, this ain't a fashion fair
Who's that booty over there?
Whattup baby, what's your name?
You oughta be in pictures, you know what I'm sayin?

Rap czar, superstar
No limitation in my life and I'm known to go far
Live in the Bronx upon a street called Marion
Girls on the block call me a black Blake Carrington
Handsome as hell, I dress real swell
By the tone of my voice maybe you can tell that I
Shampoo with Prell and live life well
When I pass you on the street it's lack of failure smell
I'm gonna let you know that I'm divine competition
When I give a show don't front just pay admission
To see, the greatest rapper that will ever perform
Cause this is, a rap attack not a quiet storm
Went downtown to meet my girl
Light brown dimples and natural curls
Got to her school, what did I see?
Some onionhead brother tryin to talk to my G
I said, ""I beg your pardon, no need for alarm
But I am the man with finesse and charm""
A man of good nature no quiver or qualm
Didn't want to have to do the boy no bodily harm
Told him Silvie is the girl that I came to pick up
And if he kept talkin to her he'd be pressin his luck
He said, ""I'm sorry Smooth Bee, I didn't recognize
Didn't recollect nor did I realize
That she was your girl, but it's no surprise
Cause when it comes to cutiepies you win first prize""
So I thanked for the compliment then stepped off
Grabbed my girl, and jumped in my ride and broke North
Took her uptown so we could make love
Cause while she's in school I'm all she thinks of
Smooth Bee, the only MC
That's guaranteed to be free cause I possess the key, c'mon

[ VERSE 1: Greg Nice ]
Hey yo
Dizzy Gillespie plays a sax
Me, myself, I love to max
Redbone booties I'm out to wax
Stick up kids is out to tax
Spring again, and I'm feelin fine
Pass me an ice-cold glass of wine
So I can get mellow
Lay back, and let my girl play the cello
Hello
I hate Jell-O
Let me be me, relax in my tipi
Watch a hardy boy mystery
Greg N-i-see-e
I'm nitro
And I'm hype, so
Don't ever believe
That you can deceive me
See many visions of love and splendor
I'm the real thing, not like a pretender
I rock rhymes over beats on the real tip
Stay real strong and hang on like a vise grip
Use my mind to control all my body parts
Got an early start, plus I'm very smart
Type of man that the girls want to read about
Indeed I proceed to rock the house without a doubt
Steppin up next, no further ado
Smooth be	 is gonna make it real funky for you

	I'm gonna make it real funky for you

[ VERSE 2: Smooth be	 ]
Smooth be	, notorious, glorious
Knowledge is infinite, I live in a fortress
I'm so astronomical, yet on a physical plane
My body's just a shell, in control is my brain
I strain to gain spirituality
So I can finally be in unity
Harmony with the all eye-seeing
Supreme being
Knower of histories and mysteries
I'm mystic, also stylistic
Not materialistic, simplistic
Humble while others tumble, stumble
Smooth be	, not Bumble
Rumble, no, that's not likely
That's in my old 'school daze' like Spike Lee
Smooth be	, my rhymes get better with time
I should get an endorsement for creating fresh lines
And as I grow older, lyrics get hyper
Cause I'm a dominant black pied piper
Spreadin peace and love throughout my travels
And take time to read and unravel
Day to day problems, and then solve
Them, I can see clearly now as I revolve
Around suckers
Who perpetrate heroes
But I'm no sandwich
More like a manwich
Or maybe like a meal
Which is much more real
Than Clark Kent or the Man of Steel

Keepin you on the floor, givin you more and more

It's too hot to hold you can get it sold
In the summer heat in the winter cold
Fourteen karat gold won't mold, now
Bust the sketch that I'm about to tell
I saw a dookie rope downtown on sale
Was it Wall Street or was it Canal?
Anyway I'm steppin out in style
Yo fellas there's a treasure trunk (where?) Up in the attic

G-O-L-D gold I'm twenty-two years old
And uhh, I never fold, I'm livin my role
as a diplomat, and my pockets are fat
My rings are eighteen karat skeezer, and it's like that
Went to the jeweler, had a fifty G budget
Bought a turkish rope, a medallion made of nuggets
You can look, you can touch it, but don't smudge it
Milky, milky, I'm so silky
I met this cutie and her name was Judy
Judy was top choice, had golden brown eyes
Def lips, and fly thighs
Jet black hair, her complexion clear
And her derriere, had savoire-faire
Big gold teeth in her mouth
Mmmmmmmm - Judy was from down South
She had a warm heart, that could get real cold
Judy was all about, G-O-L-D gold

[Teddy Ted]
Now, Teddy Ted, and I must prevail
I buy my gold by the pennyweight scale

I bought a solid gold 500 S-E-L

Greg Nice, I met this dame
I like her style, she feels the same
Is she gaming, merely claiming
To be my girl, to change my world?
I don't like to be uptight
I don't wanna fuss, I don't wanna fight
She's obsessive, too possessive
I wish I knew this girl's objective
I met baby girl when I was on tour
Gave me more than what I bargained for
Makes me breakfast while in bed
She loves to keep her man well fed
Diplomatic, socialistic
Baby girl had strawberry lipstick
It tastes sweet, just like honey
Said to myself, ""Yo, this dip's a dummy""
Tried to gas me for my money

Hey yo, kickin wicked rhymes like a fortune teller
Had a dog by the name of Old Yeller
Old, Yeller, had a fiendish plot
Schemed and dreamed, for me to make a knot
Ever since then booties clock me like Big Ben
As I go on and kick more
Got more songs than a record store
Some is sniffin and some is buffin
Some is riffin some ain't sayin nothin
But my pockets I am stuffin
Huffin puffin blow the house down
Nice and Smooth is in your town
I own a sailboat, and this I quote
Collect federal notes, from songs I wrote
Not the Shah of Iran and I'm not the Pope
But my name is on the Walk of Fame like Bob Hope
Baby doll, bust the sketch, don't forget
That I'm a trooper and you're troopette
I'm Mr. Smurf and you're Smurfette
I, take you, to the hotel
You, take me, to the motel
Like a rocketship I will excel
When you do a crime you go to jail
Pay the bail then hop the bail
Bounty hunter is on yo' tail
Mission to bring you back to jail
Pump a little weight so I'm not frail
Baby doll, you know what I'm sayin?

""When I'm on the mic, there won't be no delayin'"" 
""When I'm on the mic, there won't be no delayin'"" 
""When I'm on the mic, there won't be no delayin'"" 

Smooth be, my rhymes express awareness
And I possess finesse and we share this
I'm at the top of the pile
My long rhymes span infinite miles
'Cause I'm buildin, a new rap level
Through bass and treble, I will abolish the devil
I must prevail
Smooth be, too fresh to be stale
I stay def beyond 2000
And my spirit will keep arousin
All new jack boys and girls
And I never had jheri curls
Smooth be rollin' right and exact
And givin no slack, I'm tellin you flat, that
I am an orator, dope rhyme conniseur
Never leavin you bored on the dancefloor
You want more, Smooth be's got enough for 4 scores
Chewin MC's like Reese's Pieces
And treatin other MC's like feces
They walk around with no direction
They get mad over our complexion
They didn't pass inspection
Nice and Smooth is your resurrection
I'm like an Audi with fuel injection
Don't wear glasses, got good perception
Used to rock at the T-Connection

What's your name?
  I'm Teddy Ted
My name is Greg Nice
  and I'm MC Smooth Bee

[Greg Nice]
Humor!  I'll make you laugh
Go take a bath you don't know the half
Yeah my structure, is like a skyscraper
Greg, Nice not a comic book caper
Like Bruce Wayne or even Dick Grayson
I'm not Freddie and I'm not Jason
I hate base and, chasin clouds of illusion
Mass confusion, which drug are you usin?
Greg, N-I-see-E
Freelance style, mother's last child
I'm buckwild don't make me pull your file
Used to wear a frown now you wear a smile
Teddy Ted is the jewel of the Nile
The original ooh child, versatile
Eagles want to fly, rappers made to ramble
My name is Greg Nice I used to scramble
Met this dip who changed my world around
At night she wore diamonds and pearls, and I say
what a way to agree, she walked up to me and said umm
""Oh no, it can't be!
 The incredible sounds of Greg N-I-see-E""
I said yes, Nice Greg, Greg N-I-see-E
Come to my cabin baby doll and see
Thirty minutes we can go around the galaxy
She, bought it for sure when I walked through the door
Turned around I saw her bloomers on the floor
I said umm, golly gee I know this can't be
Then I thought BA-BOW did it all for me
So we got busy and her name was Missy
I gave her permission to be my main squeeze
Never felt lips like these, I'm telling you!
She blessed me well, made me perspire
Missy, my number one heart's desire

[Smooth Bee]
Rhymes, rhymes, rhymes
I just write rhymes, as I incline I design
Denyin me is like frontin on Jesus
And it's a sin to begin, knowing you'll never win
You want to be my friend?  Blend
I can't extend, neither pretend
to be better than the next man, that only comes in when
others try to apprehend fake styles and then smile
while I create rhymes by the miles
No hot towels, nor weak bowels
What's with the why's anw who's, you're not an owl
I'm watching you, mm-hmm, ready to close in
And like a thief in the night, nobody knows
when I'll strike and flex and vex, against your literature
I don't bite but I write while you snore
I have to rupture your senses while you pay consequences
Smooth Bee not he now battle commences
I'm VICKING YOU!  Of all your knowledge and all of your lessons
Of all your strifes through life and all your BLESSINGS
Terminating you!  Subtracting cells from your brain
Can you refrain?  Let me explain

Skill trade (we know what we doin')

My name is Greg Nice I like to swing
Went to Canal Street I bought the dookie rings
After that, I bought a fur
Then I went to see the lady for a manicure
Cut my nails down low and my rings was glowin'
Around my neck the dookie ropes was showin'
Went outside, to the BM ride
With the VVS rims on all fo' sides
I was, butter soft had on fresh gear
Kickin' it live to the girl in the air
Baby doll, when can we hang?
You got my number, give me a rang
Called me up yo, late one night
Let's get busy 'cause the time was right
You know what she wanted, she wanted to do (What? What?)
Yo she wanted to date (what?) she wanted to ooh!
Took her to the movies, I took her to dinner
Told her I'm a vet, I ain't no beginner
Grabbed her hand and said, ""Let's catch a cab
Baby don't worry I'll pay the tab""
Dug in my pockets, for the gusto
Big bills, had nothin' low


The S to the M double-O T-H'er
B-E-E no time to waste
Ah right about now I'm gonna reminisce
Of how a fly MC became a rap-ologist
Around the time when Chubby Checker, invented ""The Twist""
I used to play spin the bottle, run catch and kiss
Smooth Bee's my name, that's what I said
I got a blue Mercedes, a big brass bed
I live on a hill overlookin' a view
And I came here tonight just to rock for you
So let's a rock y'all, and get down
Let's take a trip on a funky merry-go-round
You see, round and around and around we go
And when the funky beat stops everybody will know
'Cause there's a time and a place where we'll all have fun
And Smooth Bee will be your number one
Master of Ceremonies and you must admit
That I was, born and raised to make top hits
So vicious, malicious, and very discrete
I have mystical powers I perform any fete
I'm gonna be ranked at the top of my field
I'm gonna see my name in the Rappers Guild
With all the other rappers, who want to be known
I'll be boastin' with a gold-tone microphone
'Cause I'm death-defyin, never caught lyin'
Not a female's love I'm ever caught buyin'
Get so much sex that I might explode
And on a sperm count scale I'm an overload

[Chorus]

Yo, I'm a trooper, and I do loopers
I do stunts and I smoke blunts
Forty ounce of private stizzinock
Standin' on the corner, holdin' my jizzinock
Watching all the girls, pass!
Boy she got a big! (Ooh ooh)
Hey, baby, whatcha eatin?
Looks to me, like you be beefin'
Sneakin' by I saw you peepin'
Did you think Greg Nice was sleepin'?
I'm not rich like Donald Trump
And I don't have no big fat lump
Slouch, only on the couch
And if you fight me girl I will say ouch
(Ah yeah!)

[Chorus]

Smooth Bee guaranteed to make a mic sing
I'm Smooth Bee I'm guaranteed, to give you what you need
Not a sip not a swallow but the whole damn bottle
Got a lot of juice but my girl cut me loose
For a sucker with cazals and plate named Bruce
Little did she know that I'm choice and not moist
Undisputed rapper with a golden voice
An entrepreneur, undercover love
Man of the world with my life to explore
Minks socks leather suits shirts made of velour
Smooth articulate entertainer MC
I'm rappin' to a funky beat, my dialogue's unique
Every time she sees me she offers me a skeeze
She says, ""Please Smooth Bee, please, please!
Let me ride in your blue Mercedes""
I taunt and tease as she drops to her knees
And I let her wipe my nose every time that I sneeze
 we know what we doin'!

[Chorus]

A skill trade
We know what we doin'
A skill trade 
We know what we doin'

Teddy Ted down with the skill trade
Slice and dice, he must get paid
Sip iced tea, and lay in the shade
You gaze be dazed as he will amaze",Skill Trade
Nice & Smooth,"[girls singing]
Some-thing, I can't, ex-plain (*repeat 7X*)

[Smooth Bee]
I think I love her
but the Lord only knows if she's the one for me
My true Queen
I can't ask for more physical attraction
Baby girl is real hype
She says she wants to bear my child
Is it because I make hit records
or cause I'm a good lover?
I don't know, I guess I'm a little petrol
Together we do things that I've never done with anyone else
like eat ice cream together, sharing Chinese food
and of course entering each other, endlessly
You see, when I make love to my woman
I like to tear down walls and build new ones
I take her through multiple ecstasy
and this girlie insists that she's my match
My new love level
But I just can't front anymore
I can't feel it
So therefore I must carry on
Just take me to Love Court
cause Smooth Bee's not settling down
Call me a tramp, jiggalo, ho, et cetera
but my jimmy's not for sale
More than one woman's my motto
I'll never be caught stranded with a flat tire and no spare, word
Yeah right
In four more months, you'll be having our child
That's if you intend to have our child
And since we both made this commitment
which brings forth fruit through light
be like a strong tree, with strong roots
And like a strong limb, I'll never fall off
unless the sustainer of all living things, allows it
And I want you to remember baby, that I do love you
I really do

[girls singing]
Some-thing, I can't, ex-plain (*repeat 5X*)

[Greg Nice]
I'm sorry baby, I'm so so sorry
I didn't mean to bruise your delicate flower-like emotions
Listen - I was on some hardcore illusion of what love really is
You know I used to put up a phony forcefield shield
and the whole nine yards
Keep my true feelings, locked deep inside a box
But when your love was so strong, so potent
it was too much for my heart at last
Guess I was somewhat immature, but I've grown up now
Baby you gotta take me back, I'm on the verge of self destruction
I never had a love like yours before
Remember our walks through the park, our cozy dinners for two?
Our exhange of love juices?  MMM-mmm!
Baby, don't throw 'em all away
The only reason I broke like I did, is because
I love - I mean, I couldn't react any other way
Just think - another man, sleepin in my bed
with the one I love?  Please, tch
I'm just too nice for that
Please baby, take some time, think about us, you and I, me and you
I'm sure you'll realize that I'm the one for you
I guess I'll say peace now, and remember baby
please remember, I'll always, and always, always, love you
See you!

Ooooh-ooooh-oooh

[D.J. Teddy Ted]
Baby, you don't love me anymore
I'm not sure you really did before
You see I couldn't see through your phony charms
Nothin really mattered when I took you in my arms
You see I found you so fascinatin
Oh baby so fascinatin
You see I thought you were the one for me
Found out you were nothin but a fantasy
You know, you left me standing lonely
Girl, you left me standing to cry
But yet you weren't woman enough to say goodbye
But there is, there is one thing I must thank you for
You taught me a lesson in life I'll never make the same mistake anymore",Something I Can't Explain

You can't have your cake and eat it too, girl
Cause I guess that two loves just won't do, girl
You say you want a love that's new, girl
Between me and him you've got to choose, girl

Verse One: Greg Nice

I've spent most my life, searchin for yours true
And when we first met I thought that girl was you
You really captured me, right there from the start
But how was I to know that today you'd break my heart?

Chorus

Verse Two: Smooth Bee

I bought you Fendi, Louis', diamond rings
Mink jackets all the fly material things
Thought you were mine, from the heaven above
But I see another knucklehead sharin my love
I thought you were the lock and I, had the key
My personal jewel, my life's entity
But I see, you're now for Greg N-I-C-E
E, E, E, and

Chorus

Verse Three: Smooth Bee

Say you want freedom and respect
Never tied you down, no need to check
But you called me up, wishin to explain
How your man has a car no need for a train
Then you see me with my brand new girl
Eyes like emeralds, teeth like pearls
Put a frown on your face and you act all rash
Wanna pull her hair and face you wanna bash {echoes}

I got a shitload of story tales in my sack
Please come in, hang your coat on the rag
While you at it, make my coffee black
So I can get the monkey from off my back
15 cents minus 5 is a dime
Sexy young ladies, let's intertwine
Greg N-i-c-e ran it down the line-line

[ VERSE 2: Preacher Earl ]
I'm the P-r-e-a-c-h-e-r, uh
Preacher Earl and I'm considered a superstar
Pick up the microphone and I proceed to rock 'n roll
By the time I sweat I'm out of control
I'm like a locomotive goin express
My lyrics written in spraypaint on the wall (ssss...) def
I'm from Uptown, I'm a gangster from the projects
Either or, take it all, get much respect
Destined for fame when I'm goin for mine
This, this is how I run it down the line

Hey yo, beats, styles, mics I be flashin
If you step up step in a orderly fashion
See, I collect the dough for the show and then I'm dashin
House parties I'm crashin, pool parties I'm splashin
Eatin candy yams, drinkin Baby Sham, breakin down ( ? )
Got the masterplan, glance at the Melo stance
Arms are crisscrossed, posture rasta

The biggeda-Bass Blaster with a tongue-twistin rhyme
(This is how we run it down the line)
Yo, literally, literary literature
Six slippery Seals slippin silently ashore
Sally sold seashells down by the seashore
Sold two shells but couldn't see to sell no more
Beautiful babblin brooks bubba between blossom and banks
Brothers above the Brooks take a punch off the plank
A big black bug bit a big black bear, bit him on the rear
The bear was big but the bug didn't care, he had no fear
 
How much would could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Yo, I don't know, all I know is I say it good
Asu, you got the funky, funky rhymes
Yo my brother, run it down the line

[ VERSE 5: Asu ]
Yo, rhymes is rippin and the mic is passed to me
It was too young so they got me for statuatory
Don't take me for granted, punk, yeah, and think I'm worthless
Fuck movin mountains I move planets and you'll be earthless
You don't wanna battle Asu, all I leave is fossils
Lethal Weapons Die Harder cause the Mission's Impossible
And my rhymes is riper, I'm ready to come crisper
Old jacks know that so they go back and whisper
Takin surveys, gettin nervous, I'm just too worthy
They can't stand me and say, 'He can't be from Jersey'

[ VERSE 6: Guru ]
Mad, mad response I'm catchin just as soon as I step into the place
That's why a smile's on my face
I got styles that you trace with haste but I'm too deep
Lots of the ladies I meet, I must be sweet
So I say hold up and wait up and then listen here
My rhymes come crisp and clear, but beware
My format is all that, my concept's refined
The Gang to the S-t-a-double r shines
Chumps be losin it, abusin it, not gainin
So there my gain is they vanish while I'm remainin
And twice as Nice with a Smooth groove I end my rhyme
And yo (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 7: Smooth B ]
Yeah, lyrical, financial and spiritual
A dream of touchin my style would take a miracle
You didn't know how deadly was my flow as I grow
And bumrush and crush any foe
But I prefer to have a good time when I rhyme
But lately I have had to refine and be sublime
Cause sometimes some people don't understand
That I'm a man with ambitious plans and I stand to live grand
And they fight with all their money invested to hold me back
But now I'm featuring the mack pack
Smooth B, you know I'm feelin fine
(This is how we run it down the line)

Go within, feel your heartbeat, then

Cause everytime I put my mind on God
Things really don't seem so hard
And I can be the man I really want to be

Everytime I rock a mic
It's like ology-psych
And I just want to press on like Lee
And make a movie like Spike

There's a lot of MC's out there that show and don't prove
Runnin round town, talkin bout they're smooth
They're smooth operators, Smooth imitators
But only one Smooth be	, the smooth originator
Smooth connaisseur, there's no one truer
Select a rhyme, and you'll find that few are
Able to match my professional blend
With Greg Nice by my side I continue to ascend
Movin on up through the lyrical light
I'm like the Alpha Omega, my rhymes will excite
Bust what I'm sayin, cause I'll always exist
And the girl that I select will be an emperess

Now I scooped this high heel, sweet as a shroodle
Found out she liked to eat noodles
For her birthday I bought her a french poodle
Now - get down, get down

Tim Snake on the funky drum sound
Can I tic-toc, ah-ha, toc-tic?
No other than my man Slick Nick is on the mix

Maybe one day I might have a band
It ain't gonna rain no more no more

Not like a rattling snake, I'm not from Babylon
Much like a prince on a throne, within a state of my own
I'm not a kid, I'm grown
Righteously leading a path, my wisdom's shown
Phone calls I'll accept, Smooth, I keep a positive rep
Call me the Tap Dance Man, I never stutter or step
And wrong doing's my mission, it's just influencing you
To benefit, cause I'm legit - and I can't quit
Conversed with prophets on how we must receive our blessings
Studying hard every night, I have reviewed my lessons
And now I'm ready and strong, I'm movin right, not wrong
I'm battling back and forth, like a game of ping-pong
Prevailing victoriously, I must continue to strive
Focussing on destinies to keep my spirit alive",How to Flow
Nice & Smooth,"[Greg Nice]
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I'm sweeter and thicker than a chico stick
Here's an ice cream cone honey take a lick
I go to Bay Plaza and catch a flick
Wore my Timberland boots so I can stomp ticks
Scandalous get a wiff of this mist
Just like the Yar Boys now I'm blissed
I feel good per say good state of mind
Drive a red Sterling and the seats recline
I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to Tavern on the Green have a glass of wine
He say, she say I heard it through the grapevine
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addict
Teasin, skeezin, all so pleasin
Don't ask why I got my own reasons

[Smooth B]
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 125 and Saint Nick
Waiting on a cab, standing in the rain
Under my heart three clouds of pain
She got the best of me
What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime...ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, no one could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting biz
She was in my penz getting stiffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow, I need blow
And I said whoa, little hottie
I'm not DeLorean, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks
And what do you know
In 18 months she came home and I let her back in
And now she's sniffing again...

Yes I'm the man with the mic in my hand
Give me elbow room, it's time to expand

Can't catch me with a radar scan
Now what's a rock, what's a pebble, what's a stone?
What's a bitin MC, that's a clone
I'm Big Willie on my cellular phone
All I want to do is make the fly girls moan, hey!!
I bring drama like Prince
I been rippin microphones (how long?) ever since
Rubber boots and Lee suits

Get down, uhh!  I stain like ink
Comin to your rescue just like Link

Bag me a dime piece dressed in pink

Verse Two: Smooth be	

Now don't get uptight, I'm travelling at the speed of light
And everything's gonna be alright

Gonna make the Planet Rock like Afrika Bambaata
Peace to Red Alert
Aiyyo, back up from the ropes, so no one gets hurt
It's the MC with the golden charm
Dustin rappers off with the golden arm
This style deals with the mic in my palm
I never leave my crib without readin the psalms
I gotta read my scriptures for they keep me refined
I gotta keep my nine for the deaf dumb and blind
Rewind selector, lead by supreme protector
keepin the tax collector
off my back, and I could never afford to have wack, styles

Umm baby tell me how I make you feel
Shed some light on your sex appeal
No cock block tonight, tell your girlfrien Jill
Pass the prophylactic and pop the pill
If the food tank stink, than use a Massengill

Bring the rain, snow, hail, earthquake
New York, Brooklyn handle Melida
Met this girly Bita, twin sister name Sherita
When I ate the poom poom, she asked me could I beat her
Not with my fist, but beat her with my peter
Thought to myself, no idea sweeter
Butter complexion, super erection
Couldn't make a move without protection
Now I'm strapped type, ready for flight

You might catch a smack or
maybe catch a bullet, cause I'm known to pull it
And I'm known to use it, I got patience punk don't abuse it
You choose it, cause you want to hear it
Tried to bite the style but you can't come near it, fear it
Run for the hills get off the dillz split the mills
My name's Everlast, I wipe my ass with hundred dollar bills

Will I stale or rust? Will I create dope shit, yeah that's a must

Now who is the man with the bag of tricks?
Hey it's not a problem that I can't fix

Now I don't want trouble
I'm humble like Barney Rubble
If you give me trouble, I'll give it back to you double

And don't make me burst that bubble

Used to hang out with this king who had 43 wives
Didn't know who he loved the most
So they all played him closer than butter on toast
For rhyme or reason, never treason
The kid was always in season
Took me to the players ball and all
Told me always keep my game tight and stand tall
Now I always have love for my people
Especially when they stayin on point like a steeple
But now more than ever we got to stick together
There's been enough bad weather
Take a look around you
I know it seems sometimes like negativity surrounds you
But don't let it stop you from gettim loot
If homegirl's frontin, than play her like a flute
Yo man start fakin than he can get the boot
Cause being on the block broke man ain't cute

And all praises due for this physical existence
I always say first things first

Now may I make a mark then make a spark
Over this phat track or should I say dope beat

cuando el poeta es un peregrino
cuando de nada nos sirve rezar

Then why does my soul feel glad, today?
If you're not the one
Then why does my hand fit yours, this way?
If you are not mine
Then why does your heart return, my call?
If you are not mine
Would I have the strength to stand, at all?

I'll never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
And we'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I
Share my life with

I don't wanna run away
But I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then
Why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay
In your arms?

If I don't need you
Then why am I crying on, my bed?
If I don't need you
Then why does your name resound, in my head?
If you're not for me
Then why does this distance maim, my life?
If you're not for me
Then why do I dream of you, as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
And we'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I
Share my life with

Nicholas McDonald,"Her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
It's so it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me
""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Yeah. Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know you know you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking
If you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing

Nicholas McDonald,"When you've given everything you've got
But never seems as good enough
Lighting candles in the rain
You keep going back again
When you're lying on your bed
And everything you said, comes back at you
Like a shot out of the dark
What's a bullets through your heart

I can see you
In the shadow
Won't you step out here beside me
For a while?
Oh oh oh

Cuz anything could happen
Anything could happen when you smile
Smile
Break the spell tonight
Set my world alight
Go ahead and smile
Smile
Cuz you're too beautiful
To be crying now
What can I do to make you smile?

If every single cell in you
Is screaming out to say it's not okay
Let the blood rush through your veins
This is momentary pain
And as the feeling starts to bite
A tear drop will ignite a spark in you
You've been hiding it too long
Don't you know the nightmare's gone

I can see you
In the shadow
Won't you step out here beside me
For a while?
Oh oh oh

Cuz anything could happen
Anything could happen when you smile

Don't see
What I see
You don't know how beautiful you are
Just let
Me in
Let's step out of the dark

Cuz anything could happen
Anything could happen when you smile

Break the spell tonight
Set my world alight
Go ahead and smile

Nicholas McDonald,"I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
I'm just out to find
The better part of me

I'm more than a bird
I'm more than a plane
I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
It's not easy to be me

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd but don't be naïve
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed but won’t you concede
Even Heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

Up, up and away, away from me
Well, it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for kryptonite on this one way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me
Inside of me, inside of me

I’m only a man looking for her dream

Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone,
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow.

One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

At the tender age of twelve
You'd so often been described by those
Who said they knew you well
Dark and rugged in your thirties
With a smile as bright as your robe

Every teacher, every preacher
With the very best intent
Found new ways to hide the mystery
Replaced by common sense
And to know you was to keep you in my pocket
So easy to hold

I know I can't explain you
I would not even try to
And yet it's clear that you are here beside me
I marvel and I wonder
So near and somehow still so far
What makes you who you are?

It is easy to insist
On what is packaged and precise
And dismiss the clear suspicion
That you're bigger than we'd like
It is tempting to regard you as familiar
In so many ways

I know I can't explain you
I would not even try to
And still it's clear that you are here beside me
I marvel and I wonder
So near and somehow still so far
What makes you who you are?

A definition or an absolute
But I could not be satisfied with black or white

There is so much you

Nichole Nordeman,"When I met him on a sidewalk
He was preaching to a mailbox
Down on 16th Avenue
And he told me he was Jesus
Sent from Jupiter to free us
With a bottle of tequila and one shoe

He raged about repentance
He finished every sentence
With a promise that the end was close at hand
I didn't even try to understand

He left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions
So I turned and walked away
And laughed at what he had to say
Then casually dismissed him as a fraud
I forgot he was created in the image of my God

When I met her in a bookstore
She was browsing on the first floor
Through a yoga magazine
And she told me in her past life
She was some plantation slave's wife
She had to figure out what that might mean

She believes the healing powers of her crystals
Can bring balance and new purpose to her life
Sounds nice

She left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions
So I turned and walked away
And laughed at what she had to say
Then casually dismissed her as a fraud
I forgot she was created in the image of my God

Not so long ago, a man from Galilee
Fed thousands with His bread and His theology
And the truth He spoke, quickly became the joke of educated
Self-inflated Pharisees like me

And they were wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
They were tongue tied, drawn by their conclusions
Would I have turned and walked away
And laughed at what He had to say
And casually dismissed Him as a fraud
Unaware that I was staring at the image of my God
",Wide Eyed
Nichole Nordeman,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)

(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)

(Until the day that you are me and I am you)

Until the ocean severs every mountain high)

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As
Nichole Nordeman,"There are times when faith and common sense do not align,
when hard core evidence of you is hard to find,
and I am silenced in the face of argumenative debate, and
it's a long hill it's a lonely climb.  Cause they want proof, 
They want proof of all these mysteries I claim.  Cause only

I would be a fool for You, all because You asked me to.
A simpleton who's seemingly naive,
I do believe, You came and made Yourself a fool for me.

What if we created some kind of man made faith like this,
Out of good intention or emotional invention,
and after life is through there will be no You.
Cause they want proof of all these miracles I claim,
Cause only fools believe that men can walk on waves.
Maybe it's true, yeah but...

Nichole Nordeman,"The bright are the stars that shine
In somebody else's sky
Green is the grass that grows some place different

More possibilities
More than You offered me
More than I care to see from a distance

I was certain that the truth would be
In a place that kept eluding me
But every stone turned and unturned again
Would only serve to prove
That I never had to move to find You

And You will always be
The only love I'll ever know, home
And You have made for me
The only place I'll ever go, home, home

God, for the shameless pride
The times when I rolled my eyes
To laugh at simplicity, show me mercy

Knowing what I know now
It's hard to imagine how
I could feel anything but unworthy

And the mystery of Your love for me
Is not as hidden as it seemed to be
Should have known then when You said to me
""Seek and you will find""
It was right here all the time

And You will always be
The only love I'll ever know, home
And You have made for me
The only place I'll ever go, home, home

I believe in the quest and the journey
I believe that the answers come in time
Where we begin is where we arrive

And You will always be
The only love I'll ever know, home
And You have made for me
The only place I'll ever go, home

You will be and You will always be
The only love I'll ever know, home
And You have made for me
The only place I'll ever go, home, home

Nichole Nordeman,"Have I come too casually? because it seems to me there's something I've neglected how does one approach a deity with informality and still protect the sacred?

Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback to warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, go slow, I fall behind

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting

If you're lost you can look and you will find me

If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting

Watching through windows you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting

A golden glow that's bound to soon wear off
Then it's back to the mundane telling tales of glory days
When we were hopeful that this change was here to stay

So why would a young man
Live in a waste land
When the castle of his dreams is standing by?
Why would a princess
Put on an old dress
To dance with her beloved and a chance to catch his eye?",Live

Nichole Nordeman,"You woke up one day in a bad way
With a dark heart in a small cave
And decided to hide
For the long bitter night
But one day someone loved you
Let the light in, made the old new
From the water and mud wrote you new name in love
Now something about it just doesn't seem real
Sometimes that's just how it feels

You are still a promise
Heartbeat of god
You may have forgotten
But he has not,
You are not your ashes
You are a flame
Do not ask the shadows
The light of the world knows
Knows your name

There was one day, you were certain
That he called you, 'cause you heard him,
And the crowed disappeared,
Everything crystal clear
But then one day it was not so
Other voices you didn't know
From the frey and the fringe they were all weighing in
Now you can't remember who has your heart
Well here's a start

You are still a promise, heartbeat of god,
You may have forgotten but he has not
You are not your ashes, you are a flame
Do not ask the shadows the light of the world knows

Your a friend of god, god the son
Blameless and forgiven one
The slave no more, finally free
Sins and errors are now redeemed
Oh beautiful and broken heart
Is safe and sound in his arms
You were chosen you were his
So remember this

You are still a promise
You may have forgotten

You are not your ashes, you are a flame
Do not ask shadows the light of the world knows
Knows your name
He knows your name
You are not your ashes, you are a flame
Do not ask the shadows the light of the world knows
Knows your name",Name

And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love

I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away

Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""

But like my favorite records, keep spinning them thangs
Let my hair grow, cause I was looking for a change
Shorty call me the Scare Crow, I'm looking for some brain
In ""The Wiz"", there it go, here it is, where the show
Cause through yo dress, I can see yo drawls
So shorty just shake it, make a round of applause
If you outta Hypnotic, 'nother round at the bar
And when we parking lot pimping, they surrounding the car

And the way you wear ya jeans, is means to cuss
So DAMN!, how you get them on, DAMN! big secrets on her
Throwback chick, hotter than Ms. Vic Damone

Unless you unblock ya joint, then put on ya coat

Come through in something new, wit the invisible roof
Oh the settings on my necklace them invisible too...
When we do what we do, we can't be visible boo
The last thing I need is lawsuits, all I did is call you
Initiated first move, shorty that was all you
I'm NOT tryna be ya man, pimp bones in my body

Nick Cannon,"Uh this real (its you that i owe)
I owe you (said i owe you)

They say the ones you take for granted
You miss the most
Woke up every mornin to grits and toast
School clothes spread
At the foot of the bed
Anything that i needed was there
You get it prepared (yea) (you did it for me)
Held it down when my pops and moms ain't
Repay you in a way
That stocks and bonds caint
Jus think
Its that same little boy that used to break rules
Spill cool-aid on the floor
You was my father and my mother
The mother of my father
Known as my grandmother
I reffer to you as mama
no one calmer or conciderit
As you my dear
Love my parents just as much
But lets get one thing clear
You raised me by choice and you didn't have to (mama)
Showed me where to go when i had to use the bathroom
Nasty that's true classy that's you (mama)
Id give you my last breath if i had to

[chorus:]
When i stop,look back think about my life
You gave me your love weather wrong or right
Ooo i owe you come on I owe you (its you that i owe)
When i was down and out
And all my friends was gone
You stayed by my side never left me alone
Ooo i owe you (its you that i owe) (i owe you) I owe you

Bethany, Sharron hack it
Kept me wearing jackets
Started triple phat
Mama kept with the fashions
Everlasting love
Couldent ask enough
Went to school, two jobs just to have for us
Plus no child support, you did it on your own
Independent women you the queen of my throne
(you did it for me)
Condos to one bedroom we called home
Long as you was there i was never alone
Though we had our ups and downs
Its all up now
You used to wear small frowns
Tear them all up now (How?)
Did you imagine ma
That your son would grow up to be this handsome huh?
No I'm playn I'm sayn you the reason i exist
And for this mess you deserve pure bliss
Any wish ill grant it
Any diss ill slam it
You my all understand it
You son Nick Cannon

[Chorus]

Lord, heavenly father
I praise your soul
Learned to love you for myself when i was eight years old
Before then i didn't about your grace and mercy
I just knew my pops was preaching
While i played in the nursery
Then he taught me that you so loved us all
That you sent your only son to die on a cross
I once was lost but you keep finding me
I always fall but you keep reminding me
Verse john 1:9 that I'm right you see
And it'll be just fine you took a liking to me
Gotta let'em all know
You can still have fun
Lord in the reins rove you ride shotgun
Saved me in that crash
Blocked bullets when they blast
That night at the party
Know they got the homie
No you got him surely
And as for me if it wasn't for y'all i don't know where i would be

When i stop,look back think about my life
You gave me your love weather wrong or right
Ooo i owe you come on (nobody told you to do it for me yeaaa) I owe you
When i was down and out
And all my friends was gone (you loved me)
You stayed by my side never left me alone
Ooo i owe you (oh) (your my savior) (i owe you)

When i stop, look back think about my life
You gave me your love weather wrong or right
Ooo i owe you come on (Said i owe you) i owe you (i owe you)
When i was down and out (said you've been so good so good to me)
And all my friends was gone
You stayed by my side never left me alone
Ooo i owe you i owe you
(Said you've been so good so good to meeeeee)

When i stop, look back think about my life
You gave me you love weather wrong or right
Ooo i owe you come on i owe you

And all my friends was gone (i love you so much)
You stayed by my side never left me alone (i love you so much, i love you so much)

Puttin' dubs on a six, diamond flood on her wrist
In the club handcuffed and they huggin'
And Chinchilla furs Jakub, his and hers

Now, what you gettin' is gettin' on my nerves
Used to go out with laundry mouse to splurge
Foreign designers can't pronounce the words

Try to get you to glam alike
Ever since I bew your spot you got hammers like
Shoulda played your position like Vannah White
Never knew me and you could be man and wife

Now it's no more love, we just us
No more me and you, no more us
No more we can cruise hit the city bus
Can't believe that I fell for you
I guess it's true, gigolos get lonely too

New Puerto Rican chick with a slick bun
I got your rum, got your rocks
Got your, oh daddy, please don't stop
I was your best thing going, now just your mail ticket
Goin' out there movin', shorty, we can still kick it

Hate to admit it, have me spendin' for a minute
If you say you didn't get it, yeah, you can still get it
You said all you want is love and affection
Used to be my angel, then you started vexin'
Took you out bough you all kinds of things
Then it got too high and burned off your wings

Up and down, the block with Dexter sayin' jock
I ain't mad at ya 'cause the pimpin' don't stop
I hold the name of the game, my chick chose him
It's nothin' to get knocked off, I'm feelin' all slim

We was doin from day one a feeling that i couldn't escape from seems like a dream i don't want to await from a lot of things
that i can't get away from a lot of stress i just want to erase em you da reason why i'm hard at work you think my job is
chasin baller skirts i ain't got to search baby doll you're first see you got this touch that revolve to earth i know you
sweat when i'm out on tour i was max and maturable and adorable for a lot of balls to step from my hotel door couldn't even
recall what i go there for but i was much younger much dumber out of touch so i bring my less on the summer crazy amazingly
you forgave me turn around and say to me

Whenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever you done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you
whatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know that i'll be there

[Verse 2 (Nick Cannon)]
yo every man needs a rider beside her my rider to is clinon was to pick em up off the bottom whatever he need she got em
and vise versa even though his style might hurt her a phone call is a phone call to a fella but to women it falls under the
same umbrella it's trust plus honesty respect gotta jugle em all try not to neglect 'cause if something go wrong it be hard to
correct they forgive but never forget no matter how many diamonds you sit on they neck you look at invisible set they be
they be invisible next that's why i hold my home team down no matter how much of this world i'm going around i'm gonna treat
you da right way it always feel good when you say...

at the movie premiere who da one in the drop with the wind in her hair poparatzzi
watch but to see pops don't like me and that's wherever i might be so i need a girl to stand and to understand and stand
next to cannon 'cause i got a plan and i ain't tryin put no weight on ya girl but it's hard to have alove affair in front of
the world everytime you move every step you make bein watched possibly videotaped that's why i need a place where i can
escape from and another soul and which my soul can relate and i probably make a lot of mistakes but i still need to hear
somebody say...

Yo shorty watchu want to do

You would come back the same shade of them things that's around you
All up in the club with thugs like we bad
Addicted to them chicks should be up in rehab
And the ice got em stuck freeze tag
Yo man the myth the Nick Cannon he's bad
But I ain't never seen a chick work it out like you
And I ain't never seen a chick wear a blouse like you
And I ain't never seen a chick wail out like you
The way you pop it drop it mama I think I like you
So come uptown Malibu where the soups hot and blue
I want to see you move and get a smile outta you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
All up into woman keep layin next to me
Cannon the kid that make skinny sexy
Sexes hefty and ma's with lefty
Saw a puerto rican mami and she want to bless me
A chick named Leslie others connected me
He gave her the two-way and she keep on textin me
I'm from Texas named Lexas
Shorty only want me couse she like my necklace
But when I'm in town its bed and breakfast
I thought you knew there's a few on my checklist
Girl in the photo-booth with a gold tooth
Danes the truth said her name was Ruth
So I pondered to what she often do
Says she like Proton Boots and Ajam Maju
Respect this don't get it to wreckless
cause you could be the next chick on the checklist

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm up in the V.I.P. just thuggin it out
Flashin like a star you know shinin her mouth
The boys over there tryna figure me out
If they call security they gon get a kick in the mouth
Got hundreds in my hair Jacob on the other
Party's almost over but we can hit another
Tell the Valley to pull up the truck
Shorty such-n-such lets keep in touch
Saw the sun comin up hit the beach or what?
We can eat some brunch mama get in the front
Got your girls in the back but they ain't tryna get nasty
They can get the tax if you ask me

Me and my mans and your girlfriends too
After tonight I'ma only visit you when the moon is blue
Is that your man right there? What he doin' with you?

Sayin' talk to the hands, is that still cute?
Jimmy Choo boots, that's real cute
Only chick in the place with style and grace
And like, 5'8"" with a tropical face

And like, expensive taste, spotted my chain, that's right
Get on my game, gotta see well hear that
Is that a weave can't believe that I said that
I don't know what possessed you to wear that

Girl, you out of tap? Girl, wear that
Wait to be not, make it hot, man, you feel that?
Smashin' all across the states
And I stays iced out like frosted flakes

Anythin' you really wanna do, I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you, I'm with that
Meet me in the parkin' lot at two, I'm with that
But you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

I don't know you
My name's not important, I'm as big as Elvis
You think you're so cute
Keep it real ma, you don't know me like that dance

But I don't want to
Believe me I don't give up that easy, girl
Cause I kinda like your attitude

I seen them hot chicks and they blockin' and ugly home girls
And ninety nine percent of the time
It be hits like this brain washin' your mind

Yo, you lookin' at my watch, just watchin' the time
You think I'm gonna stop you must be out of your mind
If you ain't V.I.P, then get out of the line
Think I woke up one day and just decided to rhyme, nah

I ain't got no problems with ya'll
We all ken I'm tryin' to find a Barbie doll
So I could get a phone number, call her tomorrow
Ask her, how her night went with a superstar
Yeah, that's what I was shootin' for

I'm one hundred percent over the fence
You like a mad mechanic throw in a wrench
And my game mad 'cause you playin' the bench

Anythin' you really wanna do, I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you, I'm with that
Meet me in the parkin' lot at two, I'm with that
But you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

I don't know you
My names not important, I'm as big as Elvis
You think you're so cute
Keep it real ma, you don't know me like that dance

But I don't want to
Believe me I don't give up that easy, girl
Cause I kinda like your attitude

It's your attitude that got me whipped in my whip
Like whips you [Incomprehensible] I can't be mad at you
Lookin' good, you remind me of my Benz
When I'm pushin' through the hood
Twenty four inch rims steerin' wheel all good
Envision the bigger picture for real it's all good

Wouldn't ya'll do it if ya'll could?
If ya'll could, wouldn't ya'll do it?
But ya'll ain't for stardom
On the road from autumn to autumn
From Cali to Atlanta to Atlanta to Harlem
You don't need Burt Reynolds for the Cannonball run

Anythin' you really wanna do, I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you, I'm With that
Meet me in the parkin' lot at two, I'm with that
But you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

And see what had happened was
I was hollerin? at this chick in front of the 99 cent
store
Well, here's the whole story

She was a tall slim, oh, chick I met last week
At the mall, cute feet with the baby fat booty
She paged me to come over the mall
So I smashed in the crib, bumpin?, can't walk {Oh,
boy}
With the doo rag on {Yo?, boy}
When she sang that song she turnin? me on
If would have known her pops was home
Could have stayed at crib, hollered at her on the
phone
But pops got hot, he was old school pimpin?
Tank tops, flip flops and dress socks
Rang dang when he came with the questions
Boy, you were young and how knowin? for the Lexus
I'm sorry, Mr. Jackson, but I sell records
Nah, once again, I ain't got a jail record
It?s Nick Cannon, the cat you ain't used to

They want to date, gotta ask pops
You a grown woman, all that need to stop
At the club, yeah, you have a thug at home or not
You daddy?s little girl that he love a lot
Well, he don't know about that tat you got, huh
Nah, I'm playin? I'm just rockin?
Shorty ??? probably hooked up
Probably teach you how to move in those ???
Cut to the next day and a half
Called the crib and your dad hung up on my a**

Nick Cannon,"Talking Ma
I know the situation is personal
But it's something that has to be told
As I was making this beat
You was all I could think about
You heard my voice...

Verse 1:

Just think just think
What if you could just
Just blink your self away
Just just wait just pause for a second
Let me plead my case
It's the late 70's, huh
You seventeen, huh
And having me that will ruin everything, huh
It's a lot of angels waiting on they wings
You see me in your sleep so you can't kill your dreams
Three hundred dollars that's the price of living, what?
Mommy I don't like this clinic
Hopefully you'll make the right decision
And don't go through with the knife decision
But it's hard to make the right move
When you in high school
How you gotta work all day and take night school
Hopping off the bus when the rain is pouring
What you want:
Morning sickness or the sickness of mourning?

Chorus:

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul Know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live? Can I live?

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul Know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live? Can I live?

Verse 2:

I'm a child of the king
Ain't no need to go fear me
And I see them flowing tears so I know that you hear me
When I move in your womb that's me being scary
Cause who knows what my future holds
Yo the truth be told you ain't told a soul
Yo you ain't even showing I'm just 2 months old
Through your clothes try to hide me deny me
Went up 3 sizes
Your pride got you lying saying ain't nothing but a migraine
It ain't surprising you not trying to be in WIC food lines
Your friends will look at you funny but look at you mommy
That's a life inside take a look at your tummy
What is becoming ma I'm Oprah bound
You can tell he's a star from the ultrasound
Our spirits connected doors open now
Nothing but love and respect 
Thanks for holding me down 
She let me live 

(Chorus)

It's uplifting fo'real y'all
I ain't passing no judgement
Ain't making no decisions
I am just telling ya'll my story
I love life
I love my mother for giving me life
We all need to appreciate life
A strong woman that had to make a sacrifice
Thanks for listening
Thanks for listening
Mama thanks for listening",Can I Live?

I believe I can fly

Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it (I can do it)
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can touch the sky

Spread my wings and fly away

I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey

Nick Carter,"Across the street the river runs
Down in the gutter life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running down under cover
Of a helicopter blade

The flames are getting higher
In effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still alive
Somewhere someday
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I Love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness
Light it up
Light it up
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I Love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Oh, yeah

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle
Of a slot machine
Love may still exist
In another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I Love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam

Don't take your love away from me.
Don't you leave my heart in misery.
'Cause if you go, then I'll be blue,
Breakin' up is hard to do.

And you kissed me all through the night.
Think of all that we been through,
And breakin' up is hard to do.

They say that breakin' up is hard to do,
Now I know, I know that it's true.
Don't say that this is the end.

Nick Carter,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

Nick Carter,"(Verse 1)
I wish I could define all the thoughts that cross my mind,
this angel begged for me to choose.
I don't even know which ones to lose
when I've fallen down so far
I think I'll never see your light, oh bouncin' off of me shinin' down here from you eyes.

(chorus)
Help me make the right decisions between right and wrong, weak or strong, day and night, where I belong.
Help me make the right decisions, know which way to turn, Lessons to learn and just what my purpose is here.

(Verse 2)
Its like I got the signals crossed with messages I can't decode.
Half asleep, never wide awake ya' know.
Complete overload and I got so much information here and nothing I can really grasp.  I should know the truth but I'm too afraid so I have to ask.
 (Chorus)

(Bridge)
Oh want to know you and more than anything,
I need you in every dream you're there for me. You love me for who I am. No Angel, just an ordinary man.

 (Verse 3)
Help me figure out why I'm stuck in the middel trying to understand why I can't. Why's it such a riddle.  Got my eyes crossed. Thinking so hard but I know I'm missing the mark. Can you help me sort out all the information?  I'm just wrecking my brain, paying attention but I'm still lost and at all cost I...I...I gotta know...gotta know!

Get outta my pocket

Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life 
And right outta my life 

You walk in, right into my world
Right into my backyard

You gave to me jack
And you pretend
To be my friend
But you're surrounded
When all this time you're turning
A knife in my back

Tell me, how does it feel for ya
How does it feel to be down on your knees

Better make a word cause you know it's gonna go down
I say everything that you say
And by the way did you say that you couldn't make a better day
Better leave real quick cause you know me
Everything I do, everything I fake
It's a payback, and it's all

You say you're sorry now
That you feel bad about it
You make it up to me

They say I'm missing out

But there are moments when you can't deny what's true
Just an ordinary day like when I met you
It's funny how life can take new meaning
When you came and changed what I believed in
The world on the outside's trying to pull me in
But they can't touch me
Cause I got you...

I got you...oh yeah

I want to thank you for all of the things you've done
But most for choosing me to be the one

When you came and changed what I believe in
The world on the outside's trying to pull me in
But they can't touch me
Cause I got you...

That I'm afraid you won't be there
Maybe I am in too deep
But I don't care...

I'm right where I belong
I got you
Yeah, prove them wrong...
I've got you, yeah

Nick Cave,"Ah want to tell ya 'bout a girl
You know, she lives in room 29
Why, why, that's the one right up top a mine
Ah start to cry, Ah start to cry

O Ah hear her walkin'
Walkin' barefoot cross the floor-boards
All through this lonesome night
Ah hear her crying too.
Hot-tears come splashin on down
Leaking through the cracks,
Down upon my face, Ah catch'em in my mouth!
Ah catch'em in my mouth!
Ah catch'em in my mouth!
Walk'n'cry Walk'n'cry-why!

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!

Ah read her diary on her sheets
Scrutinizin' every lil bit of dirt
Tore out a page'n'stufft it inside my shirt
Fled out of the window,
And shinning it down the vine
Out of her night-mare, and back into mine
Mine! O Mine!

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
Cry! Cry! CRY!

She's wearing them bloo-stockens, ah bet!
And standin' like this with my ear to the ceiling
Listen, Ah know it must sound absurd
But Ah can hear the most melancholy sound
Ah ever heard!
Walk'n'cry! Kneel'n'cry-why!

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!

O tell me why? O tell me why?
Oh Why? Why? Why?
O tell me why and don't tell me a lie!
Why the ceiling still shakes? Shakes! Shakes! Shakes!
Why the fixtures turn to serpents and snakes?

This desire to possess her is a wound
And its nagging at me like a shrew
But, Ah know, that to possess her
Is, therefore, not to desire her.

O o o then ya know, that lil girl would just have to go!
Go! Go-o-o! From her to eternity!

From her to eternity! [Repeats]",From Her to Eternity
Nick Cave,"I stood in the water
In the middle month of winter
My camel skin was torture
I was in a state of nature
The wind, sir, it was wicked
I was so alone
Just as I predicted
My followers were gone

And I cried `Mercy'
Have mercy upon me
And I got down on my knees

Thrown into a dungeon
Bread and water was my portion
Faith - my only weapon
To rest the devil's legion
The speak-hole would slide open
A viper's voice would plead
Thick with innuendo
Syphilis and Greed

And she cried `Mercy'
Have mercy upon me
And I told her to get down on her knees

In a garden full of roses
My hands, tied behind me
My cousin was working miracles
I wondered if he'd find me
The moon was turned toward me
Like a platter made of gold
My death, it almost bored me
So often was it told

And I cried `Mercy'
I cried mercy on me
Cryind `Mercy'
Have mercy on me",Mercy
Nick Cave,"It was back in '32 when times were hard
He had a Colt forty-five and a deck of cards
Stagger Lee 

He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat
Had a '28 Ford, had payments on that
Stagger Lee 

His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
And told him, ""Never ever come back no more.""
Stagger Lee 

So he walked through the rain, and he walked through the mud
Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood
Stagger Lee 

He said ""Mr. Motherfucker, you know who I am?""
The barkeeper said, ""No, and I don't give a good goddamn.""
To Stagger Lee 

He said, ""Well, bartender, it's plain to see
I'm that bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee.""
Mr. Stagger Lee 

Barkeep said, ""Yeah, I've heard your name down the way
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day.""
Mr Stagger Lee 

Well, those were the last words that the barkeep said
'Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head 

Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town 

She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she starts to flirt
With Stagger Lee 

She saw the barkeep, said, ""O God, he can't be dead!""
Stag said, ""Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head."" 

She said, ""You ain't look like you scored in quite a time.
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime.""
Mr. Stagger Lee 

""But there's something I have to say before you begin
You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in,
Mr. Stagger Lee."" 

""I'll stay here till Billy comes in, till time comes to pass
And furthermore I'll fuck Billy in his motherfucking ass.""
Said Stagger Lee 

""I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know?
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one fat boy's asshole,""
Said Stagger Lee 

Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, ""You must be
That bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee.""
Stagger Lee 

""Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee, and you better get down on your knees
And suck my dick because if you don't, you're gonna be dead,""
Said Stagger Lee 

Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head
And Stag filled him full of lead

Nick Cave,"I've been loving you a long time
Down all the years, down all the days
And I've cried for all your troubles
Smiled at your funny little ways

We watched our friends grow up together
And we saw them as they fell
Some of them fell into Heaven
And some of them fell into Hell

I took shelter from a shower
And I stepped into your arms
On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all its charms

I sang you all my sorrows
And you told me all your joys
Whatever happened to that old song
To all those little girls and boys

Now the song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
But there's a light I hold before me
And you're the measure of my dreams

I watch them bloom for me and you

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, how do you do?""
What they're really saying is ""I love you.""

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow

Nick Cave,"Onward! And Onward! And Onward I go
Where no man before could be bothered to go
Till the soles of my shoes are shot full of holes
And it's all downhill with a bullet
This ramblin' and rovin' has taken it's course
I'm grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses
And the city streets crack and a great hole forces
Me down with my soapbox, my pulpit
The theater ceiling is silver star spangled

And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

There's a man in the theatre with girlish eyes
Who's holding my childhood to ransom
On the screen there's a death,
There's a rustle of cloth
And a sickly voice calling me handsome
There's a man in the theatre with sly girlish eyes
On the screen there's an ape, a gorilla
There's a groan, there's a cough, there's a rustle of cloth
And a voice that stinks of death and vanilla
This is a secret, mauled and mangled

And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

The walls in the ceiling are painted in blood
The lights go down, the red curtains come apart
The room is full of smoke and dialogue I know by heart
And the coins in my pocket jingle-jangle
As the great screen crackled and popped
And the clock of my boyhood was wound down and stopped
And my handsome little body oddly propped
And my trousers ride down to my ankles
Yes, onward! And upward!
And I'm off to find love

Do you love me? If you do, I'm thankful
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

This city is an ogre squatting by the river
It gives life but it takes it away, my youth
There comes a time when you just cannot deliver
This is a fact. This is a stone cold truth.
Do you love me? I love you, handsome.
But do you love me? Yes, I love you, you are handsome
Amongst the cogs and the wires, my youth
Vanilla breath and handsome apes with girlish eyes
Dreams that roam between truth and untruth
Memories that become monstrous lies
So onward! And Onward! And Onward I go!
Onward! And Upward! And I'm off to find love
With blue-black bracelets on my wrists and my ankles
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?","Do You Love Me?, Pt. 2"

When you walk in the room

Tell me, darling, what you're trying to do

You give me double vision, strange condition
When you act that way
I'm walking sideways, my nights become days
But I feel okay

Tell me, darling, what you're trying to do

You give me double vision, soul transmission
When you act so cruel
My mind is reeling, can't see the ceiling

Where a million passing feet have troped before me
With my guitar in my hand
Suddenly I realize nobody knows me

Where yesterday the multitude
Screamed and cried my name out for a song
Today the streets are empty
And the crowds have all gone home

I pass a million houses
But there is no place that I belong
All I knew to give you
Was song after song after song


All the truths I tried to tell you
Were as distant to you as the moon
Born 200 years too late
And 200 years too soon

I'm a child of this age
Locked into the pages of your book
And when I am but dust and clay
And all the children stop to take a look

Will they marvel at the miracles I did perform
And the heights I did aspire
Or will they tear out the pages of the book, 
To light a fire

With the rain on my face
There is no place that I belong

And did you forget my song?",Singer

Nick Cave,"On the first day of May I took to the road 
I'd been staring out the window most of the morning 
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass 
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast 
I should have taken it as a warning 
As a warning As a warning 
As a warning 

I'd given my nurse the weekend off 
My meals were ill prepared 
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb 
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room 
With all its teeth bared 
All its teeth bared All its teeth bared 
All its teeth bared. 

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

I left my house without my coat 
Something my nurse would not have allowed 
And I took the small roads out of town 
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown 
And my pajamas clung to me like a shroud 
Like a shroud Like a shroud 
Like a shroud 

There rose before me a little house 
With all hope and dreams kept within 
A woman's voice close to my ear 
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?"" 
""You looked soaked to the skin"" 
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin 
Soaked to the skin 

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

I turned to the woman and the woman was young 
I extended a hearty salutation 
But I knew if my nurse had been here 
She would never in a thousand years 
Permit me to accept that invitation 
Invitation That invitation 
That invitation 

Now, you might think it wise to risk it all 
Throw caution to the reckless wind 
But with her hot cocoa and her medication 
My nurse had been my one salvation 
So I turned back home 
I turned back home I turned back home 
Singing my song 

Hallelujah 
The tears are welling in my eyes again 
Hallelujah 
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in 
Hallelujah 
And twenty pretty girls to carry 
Them down 
Hallelujah 
And twenty deep holes to bury them in

I hope it does as I have planned

Two hundred words. we live in hope

A town we all know well
And every Sunday evening
In her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And I knocked that fair girl down

She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
""Oh willy, dear, don't kill me yet
I'm unprepared to die""
She never spoke another word
I only beat her more

With her blood did flow

I took her by her golden curls
And I dragged her 'round and 'round

With your dark and roving eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl

Got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried
She woke up in a fright
Saying, ""dear son, what have you done
To bloody up your clothes?""
I told my anxious mother
That I was bleeding in my nose

I called for me a candle
And I called for me a bed
And I called for me a handkerchief
To bind my aching head
I rolled and thrashed the whole night through
All horrors I did see

Pointing his finger at me

They carried me down to Knoxville
And put me in a cell

And then all at once, he was standing there
So sure of himself, his head in the air
While my heart was breaking, which one would it be?
Then you turned round and walked right out on me",Running Scared
Nick Cave,"Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, I know you most of all
You've robbed my poor pockets of silver and gold
And whiskey, you villain, you've been my down fall
You've cuffed and you've kicked me but I loved you of old

Oh, whiskey, rye whiskey, whiskey, I cried
If I don't get rye whiskey I surely will die

Well, I go yonder mountain and build me a still
And I send you a gallon for a five dollar bill
Well, it's beefcake when I'm hungry, whiskey when I'm dry
And it's greenbacks when I'm hard off and hell when I die

I said, ""Whiskey, rye whiskey, whiskey"", I cried
""If I don't get rye whiskey I surely will die""

If the sea were made of Whiskey and I was a duck
I'd swim to the bottom and never come up
Oh, but the sea ain't made of Whiskey and I ain't a duck
So I'll play Jack of Diamonds and trust on my luck

Nick Cave,"We were called to the forest
And we went down
A wind wind blew warm and eloquent

We were searching for the secrets of the universe
We rounded up demons and forced them
To tell us what it all meant

We tied them to trees
And broke them down, one by one
On a scrap of paper they wrote these words

(And as we read them, the sun broke
Through the trees)

Dread the passage of jesus, for he will not return
Then we headed back to our world
And left the forest behind
Our hearts singing with all the knowledge of love

But somewhere, somehow, we lost the message
Along the way
And when we got home, we bought ourselves a house

And we bought a car that we did not use
And we bought a cage,and two singing birds
And at night we'd sit and listen to the canary song

For we'd both run right out of words
Now the stars they are all angled wrong
And the sun and the moon refuse to burn

But I remember a message
In a demon's hand

Dread the passage of jesus, for he does not return
He does not return
He does not return",Time Jesum Transeuntum et Non Riverentum
Nick Cave,"Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm paying my rent everyday in the Tower of Song

I said to Leonard Cohen: How lonely does it get?
Leonard Cohen hasn't answered me yet
But I can hear him coughing all night long,
A million floors above me in the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born like this, with a golden voice
Twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond,
Well they tied me to this table right here in the Tower of Song

You can stick your needles in a voodoo doll
I'm sorry baby, but it don't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
They don't let a woman kill you in the Tower of Song

I've grown bitter, bitter, of this you may be sure:
The rich, the rich have got channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgement but it won't be long, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices in the Tower of Song - oh yeah -
The guitar, the bass, the drums, so nice every hour in the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
But I loved you, baby, way back when
All the bridges are burning that we might have crossed,
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
But I'll never have to lose you again, Tower of Song

I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'm back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me, baby, long after I'm gone
I'm speaking to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song

Now you can say that I've grown bitter, of this you can be sure:
The rich have got channels in the bedrooms of the poor

See it split and change
It won't do you any harm
It's just trying to rearrange
It was born to live a day
Now it flies up from your hand
It's beautiful
It's the one they call
Your ever-loving man

Wolves have carried your babies away
O your kids drip from their teeth
The nights are long and the day
Is bitter cold beyond belief

On the mad vibrating sand
And through your teeth
Arrange to meet

Everybody wants to be

Don't disturb me as I sleep
Treat me gentle when I wake
And don't disturb me as I sleep
Even though your body aches

Even though your body aches
To serve at his command
Between the walls
She still adores
Her ever-loving man

Close your eyes, sleep in him
Dream of your lost sons and daughters
Me, I'll raise up the dorsal fin
And glide up and down the waters

I'll glide up and down the waters
Then I'll walk upon the land
And call 'em out
The ones who doubt
Your midnight man

Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around!
Don't did you see
Everybody wanna to be
Your midnight man

It's early in the morning
And I don't know what to do
It's early in the morning
And I can't believe its true
As I lay in the moment
And it's happening again
Well, I called you once, I called you twice
Ain't I your midnight man

Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around!
They want you, they love you, they need you
To be, your midnight man

The distant moanin' of a train

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

With a face of an angel

All alone in the dark
As the midnight turns to blue
I'll be meltin' into you
Meltin' into you

I walk the streets on the city
People hustling by
I've got a smile on my face
And a gleam in mine

'Cause when is crazy day's true
I'll be coming home to you
And I know you'll be there waiting for me
With a love so true

Can't seem to get you off my mind
Love like all just what to find
Just wanna run and split to you
Soon I'll be walking through that door
And I'll be meltin' into you
Only you
Say that you love me too

Now I know where I'm going
'Cause my heart's in control
We are one spirit
Body and soul

Every night and every day
I close my eyes and pray
That this will last forever
And we'll always feel this way

We are joined at the heart
All alone in the dark
As the midnight turns to blue

Meltin' into you

I know that you love me too

Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.

See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet

Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.

So sorry for himself
Oh poor boy
So worried for his health.

Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for

May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday.
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads.

Oh poor boy
So worried for his life
Oh poor boy
So keen to take a wife.

He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white.

Nobody knows
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If you cross their stiles.

So sorry for himself

So worried for his health.
You may say every day

Nick Drake,"Betty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
About things today
And fallen leaves.

Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime.

Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure.

For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more.

Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free.

If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me.

Oh, how they come and go
Oh, how they come and go.",River Man
Nick Drake,"Do you curse where you come from,
Do you swear in the night
Will it mean much to you
If I treat you right.
Do you like what you're doing,
Would you do it some more
Or will you stop once and wonder
What you're doing it for.
Hey slow Jane, make sense
Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence.

Do you feel like a remnant
Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving
Just a little too fast.
Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move.

Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.
So try to be true,
Even if it's only in your hazey way.

Can you tell if you're moving
With no mirror to see,
If you're just riding a new man
Looks a little like me.
Is it all so confusing,
Is it hard to believe
When the winter is coming
Can you sign up and leave.
Hey slow Jane, live your lie
Slow, slow jane, fly on by.","Hazey Jane, Pt. 1"
Nick Drake,"And what will happen in the morning when the world it gets
So crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning.

What will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel
With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

What will happen
In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window
In the morning.

Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eye shade
Start over again.

Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear.
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round.

Let's sing a song 
For Hazey Jane
She's back again in my mind.
If songs were lines
In a conversation
The situation would be fine","Hazey Jane, Pt. 2"

In the morning, when you rise
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know

Love can be broken
Though no words are spoken
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know

Love, don't cry
I'll never try
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will not know

Green are your eyes
In the morning, when you rise
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will be told someday

Soft and tender are her skies
Yes and no are the answers
Written in my true love's eyes

Autumn's leaving and winter's coming
I think that I'll be moving along
I've got to leave her and find another
I've got to sing my heart's true song

Round and round the burning circle
All the seasons: one, two, and three
Autumn leaves and then there winter

And then I'd know, there'd be no others

Every single thing I thought was right
I may never learn my lesson

You and me
Is everything I need
Is everything I want
But I want to believe
That when they say love is blind
That I see
Every time you smile
When they say only fools rush in
That I may be foolish to know what forever is

I know love can be a scary thing
But you are more than worth it
Girl I ain't even nervous
Your touch it makes the fire burn
And now that this fire's rolling
I keep on wantin' more of

You and me
'Cause it's everything I need
It's everything I want
And I want to believe

Gathering all his sticks in dreams

The sevenoakes of vanity
But you suffer for your jealousies
On a Sunday

We spoke out late about years of pride
The showing of both sides
Never mind this boy he's lost inside
The trouble he can't hide
Never mind this, travel in the rain
On a hesitant day on a gray Sunday

Gathering sticks on Sunday
Makes my everything in between
But everybody knows I'm someone
Gathering all his sticks in dreams

Gathering sticks on Sunday

But everybody knows I'm someone
Gathering all his sticks in dreams

On a Sunday
On a Sunday
Never never giving you up
On a Sunday

You suffer forty feet up
Your jealousy all the work
You think of him as a fool
Because he gave you his all

No mate or buddy of mine
Is going to live to sublime
Deeper season than reason
Letting go all the time

A coward, clown and a dreamer
I find it hard to believe her
It seems that all I can do
Is tell this boy he's a fool

Making all of it up
Sending all of it up
Seems that all I can do
Is say I leaving you someday

On a Sunday
Forget all I've been

Nick Ingman,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

'Cause in a crowded room Id be the only one shed sees
Shes looking bored now Im runnin' out of time
Ive only got 6 minutes if Im gonna make her mine

5 minutes and shes where I want to be
Another minute everything just feels so new
I need 6 minutes with you, 6 minutes

This could be the end or its just the beginnin'
Shes the kinda girl that I want to know better
Reachin' for her keys so I guess its now or never

Id sing her favorite song, shed be front row at every show

What's the use believin' in You anyway?
I guess it was just heartache talkin' through the pain

But I still believe, someday you're gonna speak to me

Dear God
I know You've got a million other calls to take
You're dealing with a lot of things that just won't wait
But there is one request that I just gotta make

Dear God
Won't You send a sign down, just to ease my doubt?
I'm trying to hear You, but the silence is so loud
I think I see a rainbow from behind the clouds
And I hear You now, dear God",Dear God
Nick Jonas,"I wrote this lyrics for you
All by myself
What makes you think I need you
Or anybody else

But when you see me walkin'
Just starin' at my feet
'Cause I'm not all about you
I'm already complete

I hope this doesn't make you cry
But I don't wanna make you mine
I told you for the millionth time
That I don't need you in my life

But you can see through me
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid, I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

I woke up thinkin' of you
And that weirds me out
I try hard not to call you
But I can do without

Hearin' your voice sayin'
That I am on your mind
It wouldn't work to rush this
I'll come around in time

I hope that you can understand
Right now i don't know where I stand
I'd rather hide behind this walls
Pretendin' I don't care at all

But you can see through me
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid, I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

Life keeps going on
The world keep spinnin' round
Can't we stop going in circles?
Am I afraid of what they'll say?
Or too confused to see you and me

But you can see through me
How you get to me
You know I'm just a fraud
I'm just afraid, I feel the same
But don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

Nick Jonas,"I am what I am, I can't help myself
And if you don't like it get with somebody else
I'll never change my ways, it's not a phase
This is how it is and this is how it's gonna stay

Because I am what I am, I know what I'm not
I'm not the type of guy that doesn't know how good he's got it
And I won't back down, won't come around
Saying that I changed cause that's not how it's going down

I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!

I am what I am, what can I say?
I'm gonna be this way right up until my dying day
Because that's how it goes head to my toes
And if it doesn't show well I just had to let you know

Because I am what I am and nobody else
And if you've got a problem better take it somewhere else
Because I can't turn back, I'm right on track
And if you think you know well then you better check your facts

Cause I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!

Oh can't you see
I'm just being me
I can't be you
And I don't want to be
Don't try to get inside my head
Cause what you see is what you get

I am what I am, I can't help myself
And if you don't like it get with somebody else
I'll never change my ways, it's not a phase

And knock on Heavens door

Time for me to live

Time for me to lay down all my worries
And I?ll spread my wings

When those clouds have been your eyes
But I feel a calling
I will rise, I won't be falling

And I?ll escape the gravity

And if you leave on the light
It means you're sayin' come in, it's alright

Come up, come in, I want to see ya baby (I'm comin' over tonight)
Cause we know how to do it
Come up, come in, I want to see ya baby (I'm comin' over tonight)
'Cause we know how to do it

I saw you in the hall today (nothin' left to say)
But still I know what's in your head
I'll see you later on in bed
I smiled at you but that was all
Then one day we went at it up against the wall

It's some daily habit, we can't wait to grab it
We both gotta have it, just give me a sign

I'm comin' over tonight
Come in, it's alright

I'm comin' over tonight
And if you leave on the light
It means you're sayin' come in, it's alright

I'm comin' over tonight
And if you leave on the light
It means you're sayin' come in, it's alright

Come in, it's alright",It's Alright
Nick Lachey,"I met this girl Friday night she said why don't you come with me
Anywhere let's take a flight she said, ""Who knows what we might see?""
I was ready to go but I didn't know that fate was gonna stop me
I met this girl she rocked my world and she's there waiting for me
But the train was late, she's at the gate, stuck in the rain, she got on the plane
I guess this girl will hate me forever
I guess were not meant to be together

[Chorus:]
If that's the way it is
Then that's the way it goes
And everybody knows
If that's the way it feels
Then that's the way it flows
It's out of your control
Just let go
Let go

I thought I knew back in school that I would be a doctor
Mom said, ""Study hard and you'll go far."" But then I went and shocked her
I said I'm leaving today to go to L.A. I want to be a rock star
I thought I knew, but I'm a fool
Now I'm sleeping on the cold floor
Where the private jet - ain't happened it
Kristal champagne, stuck in the rain
Sorry mom don't hate me forever
I guess I should of kept it together

[Chorus]
If that's the way it is
Then that's the way it goes
And everybody knows
If that's the way it feels
Then that's the way it flows
It's out of your control
Just let go
Just let go

You can try to make the sun rise again
You can try to turn the tides, but you can't
You can drive the car
You can sign your name
Hold on so tight that you'll go insane
You can try to plan your life to the end
You can try to run the race until you win
You can buy the house
You can own the car
Doesn't matter who you are
I said the train is late you gotta wait
Your private plane is sitting in the rain
All of us are in it together so let go
Let go (let go)

[Chorus x2]
If that's the way it is
Then that's the way it goes
And everybody knows
If that's the way it feels
Then that's the way it flows
It's out of your control
Just let go
Let go",Let Go
Nick Lachey,"When the darkness finds the night
My heart still beats for you
In your eyes I see the lie
What can I do, I'll try my best to walk away
So I don't have to feel the pain
It goes on and on, on and on
And this emptiness I feel goes on and on
On and on
As I cry myself to sleep I just can't go on
On and on
When this love I feel for you is oh so strong
On and on, on and on
Why can't I feel your heartbeat next to mine
The way it used to be
I love that purpose that's so right
I need you to see I try my best to walk away
But I just can't ignore the pain
It goes on and on, on and on
And this emptiness I feel goes on and on, on and on
As I cry myself to sleep I just can't go on
On and on
When this love I feel for you is oh so strong
On and on, on and on
Can I find a way to let you know
Could I ever make you see
Baby you took my soul and took my heart
But the pain you left all for me
It goes on and on
On and on
And this emptiness I feel, it goes on and on, on and on
As I cry myself to sleep I just can't go on,
On and on
When this love I feel for you is oh so strong
On and on, on and on
You've got someone else to share your nights
I guess it's meant to be
In your eyes I see the lie
But the light's not from me
I turn around and walk away
But I'll never escape the pain

It goes on and on.",On and On
Nick Lachey,"Yeah baby 

He told you he could be the man that I could never be 
He has a way at making promises that he can't keep 
He gets so angry when I try to point this out 
And still it's you who's always calling me this late at night 
I know you miss the way I used to hold your body tight 
You needed me girl but you never say it 

If you love him more just tell me so (tell me so) 
But do one thing for me before you go

Why can't you sleep at night

If it's the last thing that I ever do 
Let me make this clear to you 
(Open up your eyes) 
Don't be blinded by his promises 
(Open your eyes) 
The one he says isn't who he is 
There's more to us than you realize 
So open your eyes 

I know our history is something that we can't ignore 
Just give me half the chance I'll make it better than before 
Worse thing I did was give you wings to fly away 
And if it's yesterday that keeps your heart from coming home 
Girl I apologize for all the things that I've done wrong 
To lose your love would be the price too high to pay 

He can't love you more than I do 
Girl don't let his sweet lies blind you

Wake up and find

All my life I thought a love like this would last
But every road can hide a corner we can't see
I had a vision that I woke up by your side
I felt you're breathing and our souls were intertwined
But who controls the destiny
Not me
And we had it all right in our hands
We had the room to fly and still the place to land

And so I'm calling out, I'm calling out
You're the only one
Who can save us from what we've done
That don't leave me hanging up
I'm reaching out and praying you'd come back again
It's just darkness I'm living in
And you're the only place my heart has ever been

Maybe I'm longing in a way of love naive
Maybe I'm desperate for a reason to believe
There wasn't anyway I thought that we would fall
I've seen perfection in a rainbow in the sky
I've seen a child make the coldest grown man cry
But loving you I thought was greater than them all
And we had it all, just you and me
Now there's a doorway to me heart without a key

And so I'm calling now, I'm calling now
You're the only one
Who can save us from what we've done
And don't leave me hanging up
I'm reaching out and praying you'd come back again
It's just darkness I'm living in
And you're the only place my heart has ever been

Wherever you are right now
Come back baby show me how you feel
Because I'm lost without you here
I'm calling out, I'm calling out
You're the only one
Now take a look at what I've become

I don't want to leave you with the shadow of a doubt
Did I ever give you the strength you've given me?
And how can I begin to make each moment mean the most so you will see
I never loved you more then I do today
Sometimes life just seems to get in the way

It's been too long
I want to sit down and write for you a perfect love song
I want to shout it out in a silent crowd
I want to move you in a million ways
I said to you everyday did I ever tell you I love you that way

And did I ever tell you I'm better to have known you
I don't want to change you cause I proud of who you are
And should you ever question the pain we are going through
What I need to mention is that life just isn't living without you
You know that I want you more than anything
Sometimes I just forget to say what I mean

It's been too long
I want to sit down and write for you a perfect love song
I want to shout it out in a silent crowd
I want to move you in a million ways
I said to you everyday did I ever tell you I love you that way

I never loved you more than I do today
Sometimes its crazy life just gets in the way

It's been too long
I want to sit down and write for you a perfect love song
I want to shout it out in a silent crowd
I want to move you in a million ways
I said to you everyday did I ever tell you I love you that way

Looking for yourself tonight.
And I know,
Gonna sell your soul under the lights.
And I hear,
The emptiness that echoes in your cries.
Someday,
I'll pray that you finally realize.

Your beautiful,
That's all that I can say.
Unforgettable,
I'm caught in every way.
Don't every let the mirror tell you lies,
Just look at your reflection through my eyes.
Your beautiful.

It seems,
You always keep one foot outside the door.
So sad,
You gotta all but still you long for more.
And you cry,
So desperate for your place among the stars.
But why,
Just searching for what you already are.

Your beautiful,
That's all that I can say.
Unforgettable,
I'm caught in every way.
Don't every let the mirror tell you lies,
Just look at your reflection through my eyes.

Somewhere in the night were back in another time I smile as I rescue moments from my memory.
Somewhere in my mind, in my mind

Its strange its not even sadness to except the things you can not understand. I don't remember all that you said, a million corners in one tiny head.

Come to steal my piece of mind.
The only peace I find,
Is pretending your that still laying next to me.

So why, why, why

Why don't it just stay away?
Why do dreams have to fade,
Into all these shades of blue,
Where I wait for you.

Where you close your eyes,
Feel me by your side.
I will wait for you,

I can't undo all the days that I misused.
I thought you that ya always stay. 
Its hard to face the simple truth,
That time brings no relief,
And time is all you need you said,
Had to go clear out your head.
While your trying to decide if you'll come back to me.

Do we have to cry cry cry?
Tell me why this has to be,
Why don't you give into me?

Pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer
I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes

Yeah

'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

I've been dying inside
Little by little
No where to go but going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still

And I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

Falling faster
Barely breathing
Give me something to believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head

Take what's left of this man
Make me whole once a gain

'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin

I'm going outta my mind, outta my mind

I heard they cut off everything he had
What a dirty low down thing to do
To mess him up like that
They dumped him in the jungle

I said he ain't never been the same

I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll

Well, the bride was a picture in the gown that her mama wore
When she was married herself nearly twenty-seven years before
They had to change the style a little but it looked just fine
Stayed up all night, but they got it finished just in time

Now on the arm of her daddy, she's walkin' down the aisle
I see her catch my eye and give me a secret smile
Maybe it's too old fashioned, but we once were close friends
Oh but the way that she looks today, she never could have then

Well, I can see her now in her tight blue jeans
Stuffin' all her money in the record machine
Spinnin' like a top, you should of seen her go
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll

Well, the proud daddy only want to give his little girl the best
So he put down a grand on a cozy little lover's nest
You could have called the reception an unqualified success
At a flash hotel for a hundred and fifty guests

Well, take a look at the bridegroom smilin' pleased as pie
Shakin' hands all around with a glassy look in his eye
He got a real good job and his shirt and tie is nice
But I remember a time when she never would have looked at him twice

Well, I can see her now drinkin' with the boys
Breakin' their hearts like they were toys
She used to do the pony, she used to do the stroll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll

Well, I can see her now with her walk man on
Struttin' up and down to her favorite song
I still remember when she used to want to make a lot of noise
Hoppin' and boppin' with the street corner boys
She used to wanna party, she used to wanna go

And I fared little better when I tried settlin' down
Maybe some magic moment, I've never known one, not for long
For all too soon the magic is in a moment gone

When I get down on the pages all I felt

I looked so good and I dressed so snappy
Two-tone shoes on my feet big old smile on my face
As I moved and grooved all over the place
Now I'm down in the heels my complexion is bad

Is caged by frail and fragile bonds
Restless by day
And by night, rants and rages at the stars

And how to shelter from the rain
And in the twinkling of an eye
Might have to be restrained

Sometimes 
It tries to kid me that it's just a teddy bear
Or even somehow managed 
To vanish in the air

Nick Lucas,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Was romance what it seemed at the Mardi Gras
Was the love that we made just a brief masquerade
Was it gone with the song that the orchestra played

Was it just by chance we spoke of love

Until the morning comes to you
On my mind all the time
Baby, you give to me
Something so good
And if you knew
What I want to do

[Chorus]
It was dark, it was night
Except for the moon
Put some light in your eyes
Girl, I was in tune
Night turned to day
Day turned to night
Feels so right
Hold on tight
With all of your might
I'm gonna take you for the ride of
Your life
Do you think you can give to me
Every day fulfill my need?
I can't remember
Feeling this good
Every moment
Leaves me wanting more and more
The special things, every word you say
I find myself wanting you
Every single day, oh
On my mind all the time
Baby, you give to me
Something so good
And if you knew
What I want to do

I want to be
I want to be
I want to be
Alone with you
I want to be
I want to be
I want to be
Alone with you

Nick Scotti,"In this world that we live in
How much loving are you gonna give?
Everybody's looking for the saviour
To be resurrected
Looking to the heavens for someone 
To come down and protect us
Everybody's in a race, and there's no
Time to stop and look behind us
Never ever trying to break these chains
That always seem to bind us
[Chorus]
Everybody
Want to change the world
Ain't nobody
Making changes
Everybody
Whether boy or girl
Everybody, everybody
Everybody
Want to rule the world
Ain't nobody
Making changes
Everybody
Whether boy or girl
And life goes
Everybody's always talking
Brotherhood for generations
Always saying how the past is wrong
But you're not making changes
Everybody says they're gonna take their
Time but do nothing 'bout it
In the end your own best friend should
Be the one you turn to 'cause

Nick Scotti,"[Chorus]
There's just no justice in this world
As long as you and I are apart
There's just no justice in this world
As long as there's a ring around your heart
Who said there's hope if you wait for the morning?
Who's got the gold that was waiting for you?
I want to know no more wishes and warnings
If there's a God, I want to see him soon
I'm so in love I could cry forever
And drive you to tears with my pain
Only a flood's gonna get us together
Lord only knows how long I've waited for rain
I know that you bleed
My heart goes out
I know that you need
My help
So I'll keep holding on
[Chorus]
I just can't run
Even though I been wishin'
Can't get your body off of my mind
Under the sun
Under any conditions
Could you ever come back to me again?
I know that you bleed
My heart goes out
I know that you need
My help
So I won't let go

Nick Scotti,"In our conversation
What you said to me
Your words of wisdom
Made me crazy
Your sexy whisper
Made me believe
That all you wanted
Was a piece of me
Don't you want to know who I am?
You know you can't find love in a one-night-stand
There is something that I like in you
So before I make my move...

[Chorus]
Slow down, don't go so fast
I need some time to get to know you better
Slow down, gotta make it last
The situation is plain to see
I'd put my wrap on
Every girl that walked past me
I need something real in my life
Come on, let's give it a try

Nickel Creek,"I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves.
I keep my lamp lit, to warn the sailors on their way.

I'll tell a story, paint you a picture from my past.
I was so happy, but joy in this life seldom lasts.

I had a keeper, he helped me warn the ships at sea.
We had grown closer, 'till his joy meant everything to me.

And he was to marry, a girl who shone with beauty and light.
And they loved each other,
And with me watched the sunsets into night.

And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea.
And the winds that blow remind me,
Of what has been, and what can never be.

She'd had to leave us, my keeper he prayed for a safe return.
But when the night came,
The weather to a raging storm had turned.

He watched her ship fight,
But in vain against the wild and terrible wind.
In me so helpless, as dashed against the rock she met her end.

And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea.
And the winds that blow remind me,
Of what has been, and what can never be.

Then on the next day, my keeper found her washed up on the shore.
He kissed her cold face,
That they'd be together soon he'd swore.

I saw him crying, watched as he buried her in the sand.
And then he climbed my tower, and off of the edge of me he ran.

And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea.
And the winds that blow remind me,
Of what has been, and what can never be.

Feeling this sort of a love that we once knew
I'm calling this home when it's not even close

And standing on a darkened stage
Stumbling through the lines
Others have excuses
But I have my reasons why

We get distracted by dreams of our own
But nobody's happy while feeling alone
And knowing how hard it hurts when we fall
We lean another ladder against the wrong wall

And climb high to the highest rung

You pressed your hand
Into a brand new sidewalk

We would all vote him most likely to be loved to death.
I hope he still wants it, but it might remind him of when,
he aimed for the bulls eye and hit it nine times out of ten.
That one time his hand slipped, and I saw the dart sail away.
I don't know where it landed, but I'm guessing between green and gray.
We thought nothing of it, but it still haunts him like a ghost.
With all eyes upon him, except two that matter the most. 

He says ""Green is the color everyone sees all around me.
Gray is the color I see around her, and she's just a blur.""
The more the crowd cheers, the less I can hear
and they don't really care what I play. It might be for her.
But for now it's between green and gray. 

We paid and we cheered. Now we're gone and to us that feels right.
But for him every one of those evenings turns into a night.
With another hotel room where he lays awake to pretend
that he's doing fine with his notebook and discman for friends. 

He says ""Green is the color everyone sees all around me.
Gray is the color I see around her, and she's just a blur.""
Night after night what I hear, what I write fills the room
and my head starts to sway. It might be for her,
but for now it's between green and gray. 

I want you to love me, he whispers, unable to speak.
And he wonders aloud why feelings so strong make the body so weak.
Then he awoke. Now he's scared to death somebody heard.

Saying are you weeping for my store
Or are you weeping for your house carpenter
Whose face you'll never see no more

I spied a cowpuncher riding along
His hat was throwed back and his spurs were a-jingling
And as he approached he was singing this song
Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies
It's your misfortune and none of my own
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies
You know that Wyoming will be your new home
Early in the springtime we round up the dogies
Mark 'em and brand 'em and bob off their tails
Round up the horses, load up the chuck wagon
Then throw the little dogies out on the long trail
Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies
It's your misfortune and none of my own
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies
You know that Wyoming will be your new home
Night comes on and we hold 'em on the bedground
The same little dogies that rolled on so slow
We roll up the herd and cut out the stray ones
Then roll the little dogies like never before
Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies
It's your misfortune and none of my own
Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies
You know that Wyoming will be your new home

We had grown closer, 'till his joy meant everything to me 

And he was to marry, a girl who shone with beauty and light 
And they loved each other, and with me watched the sunsets into night 

[Chorus:]
And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea 
And the winds that blow remind me, of what has been, and what can never be 

She'd had to leave us, my keeper he prayed for a safe return 
But when the night came, the weather to a raging storm had turned 

He watched her ship fight, but in vain against the wild and terrible wave 
In me so helpless, as dashed against the rock she met her end

[Chorus] 

Then on the next day, my keeper found her washed up on the shore
He kissed her cold face, that they'd be together soon he'd swore 

I saw him crying, watched as he buried her in the sand
And then he climbed my tower, and off of the edge of me he ran 

[Chorus]

I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves
And though I am empty, I still warn the sailors on their way",Lighthouse's Tale [DVD]
Nickel Creek,"Where am I today? I wish that I knew
'Cause looking around there's no sign of you
I don't remember one jump or one leap
Just quiet steps away from you lead

I'm holding my heart out but clutching it, oo
Feeling this sort of a love that we once knew
I'm calling this home when it's not even close 
Playing the role with nerves left exposed

And standing on a darkened stage
Stumbling through the lines
Others have excuses
But I have my reasons why

We get distracted by dreams of our own
But nobody's happy while feeling alone
And knowing how hard it hurts when we fall
We lean another ladder against the wrong wall

And climb high to the highest rung
To shake fists at the sky
While others have excuses
I have my reasons why
With so much deception it's hard not to wander away
It's hard not wander away, it's hard not to wander",Reasons Why [DVD]

Never mind I'll just name her after you, love of mine
I'll fashion her into a sweet long legged icon making all praise holier

Oh, but she gave us to each other
The only thing she's done for me that you could never do
For that she'll always be remembered
After she discovers I don't love her half as much as you

Love of mine when she goes why can't you stay
Here with me

Love of mine when you die I tell myself that you'll never live
Even as I curse the girl who says she'll find someone worthier of the gift
Someone who wants to share it with her
Far away from those who take you, to have and to hold

Here we all lie
In a dry sea of Solo cups
With the sun in our eyes

Where no one claps 'cause they're sure that there's more
What a great way to start the first day of the rest of my life

I guess the show's going on
So we pick up the pieces
We dropped for a song
And an ear-splitting headache
That makes it hard to figure out which puzzle they're for
But I can leave this part out of the story I write
There are worse ways to start the first day of the rest of my life

Roommates, friends, lovers - quiet
I'm coming to
I'm turning myself into something a little less promising
A little more useful

The battle is over
We lost, but we'll live to call off the war
Don't that ceiling look high from the floor?
Don't it hurt just to move
As we shrink from the light?
As it pierces our bodies and thaws out our hearts

She must have done something wrong tonight
The living room becomes a boxing ring
It's time to run when you see him clenching his hands
She's just a woman, never again

I hear her scream from down the hall
Amazing she can even talk at all
She cries to me go back to bed
I'm terrified that she'll wind up dead in his hands
She's just a woman, never again

Been there before but not like this
Seen it before but not like this
Never before have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman, never again

Just tell the nurse you slipped and fell
It starts to sting as it starts to swell
She looks at you, she wants the truth
It's right out there in the waiting room with those hands
Lookin' just as sweet as he can, never again

Seen it before but not like this
Been there before but not like this
Never before have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman, never again

You're just a child with a temper
Haven't you heard don't hit a lady
Kickin' your a** would be a pleasure

He's drunk again, it's time to fight
Same old s***, just on a different night
She grabs the gun, she's had enough
Tonight she'll find out how f***in' tough is this man
Pulls the trigger fast as she can, never again

Seen it before but not like this
Been there before but not like this
Never before have I ever seen it this bad

From long days in the field
Mother's hands are serving meals
In a cafe on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs

You'd call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive

Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

This is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time I had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must of done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Lot's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I

Every memory of lookin' out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye, good bye

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They said somebody went and burnt it down

We use to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just a steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you
That you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinkin' about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done, you're far too young
And the best is yet to come

So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reachin' out to let you know
That you're not alone

And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Well everybody's hit the bottom
And everybody's been forgotten
Well everybody's tired of being alone
Yeah everybody's been abandoned
And left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hangin', on

Just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reachin' out to let you know
That you're not alone

And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Well honey here comes a lullaby

Nickelback,"I'm in a bar full of bikers
And a handful of junkies
It's a fifty fifty chance that they're
Plannin' to jump me
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive oh

Well my favorite little waitress has
Ahold of my eyes
But here's a shotgun
Loaded hidden under the bar
Her finger's on the trigger
If anybody gets out of line

There's other places that are better to go
But I'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And I can't get enough of the things that she does

She's gonna be my midnight queen
Locked and loaded
I'm ready to go
She's gonna like my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go
And I can't get enough of
The things that she does, alright

Well, she walks like a model
And she talks like a trucker
Doesn't want a lollipop
But she sure loves a sucker
They' re closin' in around her
I'm cutting to the front of the line
Oh, she grabbed a bottle of tequila
And a lime for her lips
Laid her body on the bar
And put the salt on her hips
Was lying when I told her
That I'm the only gonna lick her tonight

There's other places that are better to go
But I'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And I can't get enough of the things that she does

She's gonna be my midnight queen
Locked and loaded
I'm ready to go
She's gonna lick my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go

She's gonna be my sex machine
And I can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo
And I can't get enough of
The things that she does, alright

And I can't get enough of the things that she does
She's gonna be my midnight queen
Locked and loaded
I'm ready to go
She's gonna like my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go

She's gonna be my sex machine
And I can never get her under control

Nickelback,"You call to me, and I fall at your feet
How could anyone ask for more?
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more?

But if there's a pill to help me forget,
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to

'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more

And this kind of pain, only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go
But if there's a pill to help me forget,
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to

It's trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more

So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
Was it something that I did?
Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear
Tonight I'm dying to tell you

That trying not to love you, only went so far
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining, of what we're fighting for
And if we just keep on trying, we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more",Trying Not to Love You

My baby still looks amazing with no makeup
And dammit I knew the second that you came up
From underneath the covers
Said ""I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother""
One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me
Packed all of my shit and moved across the country
And now we're buying diamonds
Saying it's only 20 karats, it can't be that hard to find it, baby

Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
