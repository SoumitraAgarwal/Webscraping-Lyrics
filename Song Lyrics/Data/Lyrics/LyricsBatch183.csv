J. Alvarez,"De la disco al hotel, bañarnos en placer 
Me encanta esa fragancia, que tienes a channel 

Y ese booty que mata y tu aroma que me arrebata 
Ella vive la vida viajando 
Y se vive la movie gastando 
Y ese booty que mata y su cuerpo que me arrebata 
Ella vive la vida viajando 
Y se vive la movie gastando 

Mi gata es de la calle, con guille de fina me gusta 
La llevo a un restaurante y al ambiente se ajusta 
Checking nude my baby, no sale sin su ruger 
Yo soy su maltes y ella mi perrita poodle 
Mami mueve esa cola, ella nunca anda sola 
Un corrillo de sicario, todas de carrola 
No se aceptan ni feas, ni flacas, ni chumbas 
Dile a todas tus amigas locas que se los tumba 
Ella le gusta salir under poder 
Mucha frontiadera sin dejarse ver 
Super culiau, asi se mantiene la cosa 
Ella sabe que yo tengo 100 y no es celosa 

Es una dulzura, es calle pura, semi desnuda, una locura 
Y de lejitos tu la ves, el flow de cara se le ve 
Y no mire envidiosa porque esta poderosa 
Independiente y corre sus cosas 
Y de lejitos tu la ves, el flow de cara se le ve 

Y ese booty que mata y tu aroma que me arrebata 
Ella vive la vida viajando 
Y se vive la movie gastando 
Y ese booty que mata y su cuerpo que me arrebata 
Ella vive la vida viajando 
Y se vive la movie gastando 

Yo soy su perrito de raza, el nene de casa 
Ellos hablan de grasa y a mi que son guasa guasa 
Mai' como brinca ese culai 
Me gusta flow cuyo rubia y con las card mai 
Tiene las taxi, tiene las toro 
Un presidente y el cubanon de oro 
Independiente a ella no hay quien le meta el diente 
Y solo escucha musica de los delincuentes 
Los mejores del mundo de 0 a 50 en la lenta 
Sudando tu te ves violenta 
Bien derecha como una flecha la tiene hecha 
Y llama al cirujano porque no esta satisfecha 
El princi! 

Es una dulzura, es calle pura, semi desnuda, una locura 
Y de lejitos tu la ves, el flow de cara se le ve 
Y no mire envidiosa porque esta poderosa 
Independiente y corre sus cosas 
Y de lejitos tu la ves, el flow de cara se le ve 

Y ese booty que mata y tu aroma que me arrebata 
Ella vive la vida viajando 
Y se vive la movie gastando

J. Alvarez,"Fui fanático de todo lo que eres tu
En ti no habían defectos ni problemas de actitud
Hoy en calma me visita y no veo la luz
Porque busco reemplazarte y nadie como tu
Esta desolación me esta matando
Nada gano con estarte recordando
Por fuera riendo, por dentro llorando
Tu olor mi cama y la foto en el cuarto

Hoy voy a beber, hoy voy a olvidar
Bar tender otra copa que no quiero pensar
Los momentos que viví contigo
Busco reemplazarte y no lo consigo

Hoy voy a beber, hoy voy a olvidar
Bar tender otra copa que no quiero pensar
Los momentos que viví contigo
Busco reemplazarte y no lo consigo

La culpa me mata, el remordimiento me maltrata
Y tu feliz con tu nueva vida y a mi me matan las heridas
Detrás de tu corazón, sin una valida razón
Tu aguantaste demasiado y yo cree mi propia prisión
Me ahogo en el alcohol, pensando en este dolor
Y arrastro mi orgullo en una barra, sufriendo por amor

Hoy voy a beber, hoy voy a olvidar
Bar tender otra copa que no quiero pensar
Los momentos que viví contigo
Busco reemplazarte y no lo consigo

Hoy voy a beber, hoy voy a olvidar
Bar tender otra copa que no quiero pensar
Los momentos que viví contigo
Busco reemplazarte y no lo consigo

Otra botella, para olvidar, mi cielo sin estrellas
Ella se marcho dejando una huella, tatuada en mi
¿y yo que hago?, con este sufrimiento, que me mata lento
Solo te pido librame de este tormento
Con este sufrimiento, que me mata lento
Solo te pido librame de este tormento

J. Alvarez,"Si quieres ve dile a tu amiga 
Que no hable y que se decida 
Que por que sigue mirándome 
Cada vez que nos encontramos 
Muy profundo nos miramos 
Ya la pille deseándome 

Obsesión fatal es lo que tengo baby
Contigo quiero experimentar 
Salgamos de la costumbre 
Y tirémonos a explorar 

Obsesión fatal es lo que tengo baby 
Contigo quiero experimentar 
Trae a tu amiga y tirémonos a explorar 

Vamos a bebernos algo a fumarnos algo 
Conocernos, un party involucrarnos 
Tu amiga se ve bien, hace tiempo yo no salgo 
Y tengo un par de pesos, pa reventarlos 

Las miradas hace rato estaban hablando 
Estaban diciendo que nos estamos gustando 
Hace par de horas estaba maquinando 
Las dos solitas, las metí en el baño 
Haciendo daño, cristales empañando 
Pal instagram zumbando los selfies modelando 
Los tres brincando el bajo retumbando 
Y de los dj’s mando que se estaban quejando 

Obsesión fatal es lo que tengo baby 
Contigo quiero experimentar 
Salgamos de la costumbre 
Y tirémonos a explorar 

Obsesión fatal es lo que tengo baby 
Contigo quiero experimentar 
Trae a tu amiga y tirémonos a explorar 

Hmm móntense, vámonos 
Empiecen, matémonos 
Si quieren la ropa quitémonos 
Y en el mismo carro besémonos 
Dos contra uno, uno contra dos 
Dale pa la parte de atrás pa hacerlo mejor 
Chula para estar más cómodos 
Préndele otro cripy 
Porque no se deciden y me ponen happy 
Yo sé que tu quieres también 
Que tu amiga le gusto 
Por eso le doy a las dos a la vez 
Aprovechando el momento 
Estoy soñando despierto 

Obsesión fatal es lo que tengo baby

J. Alvarez,"Tu detienes el tiempo besandome 
Me despego del mundo cuando estoy con usted 
Quiero hacerte mil cosas una y otra vez 
Y volverte a tener si vuelves a nacer 
Tal vez esto no nos combiene 
Pero hay algo que no nos detiene 
Será tu boca al besar me incitas a pecar y termino haciendote el amor 
Esto no nos combiene 
Pero hay algo que no nos detiene 
Será tu boca al besar me incitas a pecar y termino haciendote el amor 

Deja que el sol salga que bese las nubes 
Vamos a darnos algo en las actitudes 
Ponte positiva un poco agresiva que yo voy a darte lo que tu me pidas 
Y deja que lo malo se apodere de nosotros 
Que el pensamiento sea otro que todo quede entre tu y yo 
Hoy te quiero comer devorar tu piel 
Hacerte mía que te sientas mujer 
Llevarte a conocer lo que es el placer 
Ven y besarme la boca que te quiero complacer 
Si tu me pidas más, más yo te daré 
Si quieres ver las estrellas te llevare 
Sólo te digo una cosa que si me ves con otra no te pongas celosa 

Tal vez esto no nos combiene 
Pero hay algo que no nos detiene 
Será tu boca al besar me incitas a pecar y termino haciendote el amor 
Esto no nos combiene 
Pero hay algo que no nos detiene 
Será tu boca al besar me incitas a pecar y termino haciendote el amor 

No se lo que tu tienen que al parecer 
Sigues invadiendo mi mente 
Llegaste así de repente 
Cuando te trato de olvidar 
Será que lo prohibido es algo normal 
Qué el peligro nos amarra 
Nos hace víctima de el y no nos quiere soltar 

Hoy te quiero comer devorar tu piel 
Hacerte mía que te sientas mujer 
Llevarte a conocer lo que es el placer 
Ven y besarme la boca que te quiero complacer 
Si tu me pidas más, más yo te daré 
Si quieres ver las estrellas te llevare

Pues más le daré

Quiero que se transforme y que saque lo de 'fiera' 
Que grite como tu quiera reggaeton que te quema
Bailemo' toda la noche que yo corro con lo que sea
Vente, que quiero perderme 
En tu mundo de pasión, dañémosno la mente
Déjame acariciar tu cuerpo tan caliente
Déjame sentir tu piel como se siente
Y si te entregas más, más tengo para ti 
Reggaeton hasta abajo mucho amor y sexo

¡Dale movimiento, dale dembow
Menéalo rápido, ponlo en slow
Se pone dulzona cuando lo baila con flow
Rompe todas las ondas y roba el show
Cuando se combina un parcero con la maña de 'boriquizi' 
Hay mucho piquete pa la nena, estamos 'easy' 
Alguien va a pararnos, whoa whoa, difícil
Ninguna se salva cuando cae el 'missile' 

Que le den, que le den, que le den reggaeton  pa' ver lo que pasa
Que le den, que le den, que le den prueba la fiera y te caza
zumba y arrasa, me prende y pasa 
Yo lo tumbo y exploto la casa

Si todo me gusta de ti

Ya ni como ni duermo

Nuevamente te tengo,

Sexy baila, y me deja con las ganas 

Y yo hoy estoy aquí sediento y loco por tenerte 
Tu boca me llama, me pide que te bese
Tú eres la única que me hace morir de ganas
Usted se suelta el pelo cuando baila y me enloquece (farru)

Déjate llevar por el boom boom 
Del bajo cuando azota 
Pégate a mi cuerpo
No te hagas la loca y baila 
Tú no eres una santa
Como te gusta el dembow
Y el reggaeton te encanta 

Hay química entre tú y yo 
No miremos bebe el reloj
Si tomas este servidor te invita
Ya yo se lo que tú necesitas

Que bien te queda a ti esa faldita
Ella es señora no es señorita
Sexy baila y me deja con las ganas
Como te luces cuando lo meneas
Cuanto quisiera hacerte el amor
Enséñame lo que sabes

Que la noche no se va a acabar temprano
Siénteme y dame de ese calor humano
Anda con Yandel no con cualquier fulano
Lleguemos mas allá
Más allá de la ropa
Más allá de besarte en la boca 
Más allá de darnos un par de copas 
Tú haces que me eleve la nota 
En la cama me agotas 
Cuando te mueves así, bailando 
Sigue rozándome así, guayando 
Como te brilla la piel sudando 
Sigue sigue me estás descontrolando

Pero que clase de rumba pa pa
Pa la que yo cogí anoche que que que
No recuerdo lo que sucedió
Pero que clase de rumba pa pa
Pa la que yo cogí anoche que que que

Pero que hora son, qué fue lo que paso
Por qué Farru tiene el carro aparcado en la habitación
Yo no recuerdo, solo se que amaneció
Y que tenia un tatuaje que decía ""Peace & Love""
Pero que confusión, creo que cometí un error
Y mezcle los tragos y una pastillitas de color
Que sentimiento creo que tenia un medicamento
De esos que te noquean duro contra el pavimento

Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aquí en mi cama
Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara

No recuerdo lo que sucedió
Pero que clase de rumba pa pa
Pa la que yo cogí anoche que que que
No recuerdo lo que sucedió

Y ya no me acuerdo de nada, no tengo nada en la mente
Solo que estaba tomando mucho ron con aguardiente
Rumbiando en la disco estaba prendido el ambiente
Ese es mi único recuerdo hasta donde estuve consciente
Se acababa la botella y de camino ya venia
J.Balvin me estaba hablando y no sabia lo que decía
Creo que nos presentaron, aun no lo se todavía
Que no recuerdo tu nombre mala suerte la mía

Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aquí en mi cama
Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aquí en mi cama

Ya esta amaneciendo, el sol saliendo

Sé que te gusta sentirnos vivos
Que lo hagamos agresivo 
Y que sea prohibido, mamá

Ella quiere que yo la lleve, que conmigo ella se eleve
Cuando ella me mira de reojo, porque sabe que yo me antojo
Qué bonito le queda el rojo, qué pasaría si me la robo
Demasiado sensual, sacándole el instinto al lobo

Es esto soy una maquina, tú eres la que me domina
Se ve que le estás metiendo fuerte a tu zona abdominal
Tenemos cuenta pendiente, se mueve como una serpiente
Y ahora quiere que le apague su instinto caliente

Solo déjate llevar
Mírame, báilame 
Y sedúceme hasta el final
Tócame, no dejes de calentarme
Solo déjate llevar
Mírame, báilame

La que yo cogí anoche que que que
No recuerdo lo que sucedió

Y ya no me acuerdo de nada, no tengo nada en la mente
Solo que estaba tomando mucho ron con aguardiente
Rumbiando en la disco estaba prendido el ambiente
Ese es mi único recuerdo hasta donde estuve consciente
Se acababa la botella y de camino ya venia
J Balvin me estaba hablando y no sabia lo que decía
Creo que nos presentaron, aun no lo se todavía
Que no recuerdo tu nombre mala suerte la mía

Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aquí en mi cama
Ya son las 6 de la mañana
Y todavía no recuerdo nada
Ni siquiera conozco tu cara
Pero amaneciste aquí en mi cama

Ya esta amaneciendo, el sol saliendo
Yo amanezco a lado tuyo, bebe
Y aun no recuerdo lo que sucedió ayer
Quisiera saber cuál es tu nombre, mujer

Pero que clase de rumba pa pa pa

No soy un santo
Tampoco ando en cosas malas
Cuando no estoy contigo
Es porque ando con mis panas
Somos polos opuestos
Y por eso nos gustamos
Qué más le vamos a hacer
Si así nos enamoramos

Así peleemos primero, mi mujer
Mami, no me celes tanto

Constant drinking and love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
Down and out with these love songs, got me open all night uh huh, got me up all night hey

OK, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent? Had a thing for you
Even wrote the song dreams for you
'Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
'Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' 'cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you, I'm saying

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want ya

Like, give me 20 dolla', dolla'
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall, each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling please play
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever, but

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want ya, yeah

Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
And when I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
'Cause as I left them I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, 'cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of lettin' my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame 'cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowin' through our veins is the same
My mama left you and maybe your anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be tellin' you fuck you 'cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help 

But break down, I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit man
It's fuckin' with her body, now she sick damn

That shit these rappers kick is nothin' like real life
You made a milli off of servin' hard white, yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shootin' niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bullet proof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruitin' niggas
We tryna stand tall when it gets to crucial niggas

We break down, we break down, we break down

And she don't want nobody to know, 
His daughter twenty five pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be four
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho
But temptation stays 'round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?
Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freakin', but them niggas holla
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She do the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Knowing it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got 'em
They say he wouldn't leave me yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you're in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin' now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king

Then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream
Just a dollar and a dream

Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
Your paper, confetti, small time, y'all on one, I'm on mine
You logged off 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure that money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares where niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team?
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
You never, have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If you don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life get hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? My fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' ""God damn, what's her name?""
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like ""Bitch don't be so fuckin' lame""
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those praying for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will

""Ahh, yeah nigga, we out here nigga, yeah nigga!"" 
So we goin' crazy, we goin' crazy as fuck, we like super excited
Dog, ten seconds later, all I see in the back and hear is ""woop woop,"" 
Blue lights right behind me, the fuckin' undercover car, of all things
So I'm like fuck. I knew right away what it was 
Dawg, for the, for two and a half maybe three years before that, in New York, 
I was drivin' dirty, my license was no good
Dawg, how 'bout the moment I found out I was gon' get the deal 
A fuckin' cop got behind me and I already knew what it was
I handled it so like, I handled it the best way you could ever go to jail like I went to jail knowin', 
Bitch like, ah know what I'm sayin'? 
I'm in there dog, spendin' the night in jail realizin', like, these niggas have no clue, 
Bitch I'm 'bout to sign this shit

Still at it

What a life we chose
I'm sending this out to those
Who fell down, but then rose
I'm hot, I'm hellbound
With these flows, Cole
And when my story's told
Let it be know I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine
But me I glow
So
I'm coming for what I'm owed
You know?",Intro
J. Cole,"Yeah, I had this little bad thing something like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, something like The Wiz
But you see the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world and about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like ""baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard""
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down for
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feeling we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feeling
You feeling when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause she be healin' that shit
And naw that ain't your girl, dog, but you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights please

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights,
For now everything just seems so right,
And how you make the darkness seem so bright,
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights,
For now everything just seems so right,
And how you make the darkness seem so bright,
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceiling
She say she wanna blow Ls, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryin' to put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been living a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like ""baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen""
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow, the more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game
And ain't it shameful, how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make, coward nigga you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family, dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recording tracks
Said ""I know you wanna change the world but for the night please
Just reach over and hit the lights please""

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights,
For now everything just seems so right,
And how you make the darkness seem so bright,
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

I got you pregnant now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin’ if this gon' make me think 'bout wifing you
Like if you had my first child would I spend my whole life with you
Now I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I’m tryna talk
Now I ain't tryna spend the night with you
I’m kinda lost see
I’ve been giving it some thought lately and frankly
I’m feelin’ like we ain't ready and it’s hold up now
Let me finish
Think about it baby me and you we still kids ourself
How we gon' raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself
A nigga barely over twenty, where the hell we gon' live?
Where am I gon' get that money
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give ‘em
And I’m not with them niggas who be knocking girls up and skate out
So girl, you gotta think 'bout how the options weigh out
What's the way out?

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it

And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect

She said, ""Nigga, you got some nerve to come up to me talking about abortion
This my body nigga, so don't think you finna force shit
See I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flipping like reciprocals
It figures though, I shoulda known that you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claiming that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowing all the right things to say, I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life, is you God, mothafucka?
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here I'mma love it
I ain't budging I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help from a man
But I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talking about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
'Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doing the same shit, you ain't shit nigga""

And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work but you doubt it

And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work but you doubt it

They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons
They grow apart, she wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her 'cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh oh, she tellin’ him she missed her period like typo’s
He panicking, froze up like a mannequin
A life grows inside her now he asking “is it even mine”
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant dawg
Could she be lying?
She be crying crying 'cause he acting distant
Like ever since I told you this nigga you acting different
And all his niggas saying man these hoes be trapping niggas
Playing with niggas emotions like they some action figures
Swear they get pregnant for collateral
It’s like extortion, man if that bitch really pregnant
Tell her get an abortion
Uh, but what about your seed nigga?
What about your seed nigga?
What about your seed nigga?

Take advantage, fuck you, tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same, on different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score, you got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers, pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off, you bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like a episode, why we cheat, I'll never know
Is it 'cause we rap? Heavens know, lotta niggas rap though, never blow
Like heterosexuals, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be 'cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
I never told, I never told

Wine and dine, meal paying, with hopes that she'll lay in
The bed and, get wet then, give head then, you bet man
The same girl who said we just met man, game colder than the fucking dead man
One night stands, no best man, no bridesmaids or reverends
'Cause Wolverine's depressed and don't wanna be your ex-man
'Cause Cupid aims and throw the darts, there go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark just to have that shit torn apart?

The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets nigga, I don't rhyme I shoot
Bang

Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take, my soul to take

Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life caper
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker
Our hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan
More than a rapper this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina
""Shut up, Cole!"", this is for my niggas back home
Homes, waddup Bo?
This is for them bitches that played me, waddup ho?
No I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
Two kids that don't even know they real dad
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic
It's Cole still at it, y'all be talkin' 'bout the same shit
Than how I feel about it, mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'
Cole plannin' funerals, you might fit the coffin

Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take, my soul to take

Get on your job lil man, this ain't Saturday
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
Well if this shit ain't fire nigga, why you noddin' with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it
Now you all conflicted 'cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me
'Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero nigga
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac
When he slept with Madonna
Hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about
My nigga gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set
It goes tick-tock, game on lock
Sun gon' shine but the rain won't stop
Oh no

J. Cole,"I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short, fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelled out, my own pain spilled out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains, Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer, hope my girl ain't leavin'
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money comes fast so bein' hungry don't last
'Til you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
Cole World, it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now, couldn't be more herer
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero

Hey, I'mma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
'Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

Up in first class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit in coach, hate to see me walk past 'em
Young, black, pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', ""how did he manage?""
""With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!""
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar 'cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like ""what the fuck you got a deal for""
When I was ass out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

Hey, I'mma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back

You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

I made it to the rack, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all plan
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not 'cause my looks, 'cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb nigga’s, y’all been lyin from the start
My life’s like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gon' say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same

Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge

Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit

J. Cole,"Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to be
'All you can be' posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany
I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know that the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope
And knew one day you would find it
And knew one day that you would come back and rewind this, singing

I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better tonight)
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: ""Don't let me slip""
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you
""You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane""
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go with me damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's a tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

I'm a born sinner

J. Cole,"Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors I'm just paintin my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped the range rover my girl got the mercedes
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way that people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you
Cause I'll be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, ""Here go your chain my nigga""

This is chaining day
I need you to love me, love me
Chaining day, my chaining day
I need you to love me, love me
My chaining day
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair

Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home where niggas sit today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', ""Fake it 'til you make it""
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated to that hundred racks
I gave it up, for what

I need you to love me, love me
Chaining day, my chaining day
I need you to love me, love me
My chaining day
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear

Lord
This is the last time
Told my accountant, It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my Chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I love this slavery
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me

J. Cole,"I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?""
What it's like to have a crooked smile

I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
'Cause he don't seem to want you back
And it got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking
Not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch
That them broads can't be, and that's you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
(You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
Like the sun, I know you know I found my way back round)

We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know them movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation, or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, cause we in hell already
I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
Yo one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hell naw
I ain't snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

Uh huh

Ey yo, I walked through the valley of the shadow of death
When niggas hold tec's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check?
And if so, you gotta expect to sip juice
From the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee ""the finisher""
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit
And who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done

So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine

All in my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-
Seven, way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
At 12, trying to get that taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home ""baby, don't yell""
How many record do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the double X L
Or Fader, fuck ya magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest
I ain't talking about later
I'mma drop the album the same day as Kanye
Just to show the boys the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what next the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and the pussy's wet

She thinking bout all the things she can get
She thinking you got a range for a whip
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple cause
All you got is a phone full of bitches, and they just like her

That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her cause I tried to hit
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative
Nigga is to hit and never commit
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call

Now she staring dead in my face she was smirking

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin

I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who thought that I would meet him on tour?
I'm earnin' stripes now nigga, got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let him know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though, cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning feeling fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said you the one, yo why you make that shit?
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin

I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made ""You Owe Me"" dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts, you mean tellin' me
That I was not up to par, when I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind, I kept on sayin'
Where's the hits? You ain't got none
You know Jay would never put your album out without none
And dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with their outcomes
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I study the shows, the fans, study their hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number 2
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game but on the way
I let Nas down, I got no one to blame, I'm ashamed I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin

I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen
Outside my core then I can open a door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall like the son of the Lord
On the cross, dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that hip-hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?
Lettin' Nas down
I got the phone call quietly I mourned dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight may I never lose sight, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin

Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records
""And so my fellow Americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country""

Excuse me

Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit
Moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag

Mo Money, Blow Money, Show Money
Party Money, Side Ho Money, Dope Money
New Clothes money from shit that I wrote money
So much money I don't know who stole from me
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money
Still broke compared to niggas with old money
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money
Billionaires with Petroleum and coal money
Probably kill themselves if they had Cole money
Talk shit and I'mma see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Popoff off robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that let me stroke money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money
Spend it before we get it and could never hold money
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money
Money control niggas, white man control money

Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7

You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11

Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that,but I never fly that,
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpacking, that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot

Wit' my gettin' money machine, nah what I mean?

New York times
Come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money of sins by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter
In a city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once
My nigga visibly stressed in a mess he's smoking his blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that
All I do is pray for that
This the city god told me, 'go and make it' at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that

Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocal sick
That's how success came
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game
Wall street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparation for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world, free from pain

To show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
City's you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us till they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em till the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad

Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit
Who you had to kill, who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top dammit.
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator no ladder money
Escalading new caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money.
Crooked smile nigga momma never had the money damn
I ain't trippin'
A nigga Jordan I ain't Pippen yeah
Up the steps I ain't slippin'
Tears blood sweat I ain't crippin, Pierce
A song you can sing along with when you down
On some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas you think she out there getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga plus dawg I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crash and only it killed his lame ass
I'd be glad its that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund check she used that to float.
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope

And there go you

Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

Homie, don't quit now hear my shit and tried to switch now.
Know you felt the shit just now
Know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you?
Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward
Getting high off of power
Fuck it more to you, saw through you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for more money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but it just ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watching little Jermaine
Do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got
Now the nigga don't paint the same thang
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Thinking old school niggas like Dame and Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame
My brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker
You're just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
And I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you

And there go you

Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

J. Cole,"Married men act totally different
When they by themselves, don't they?
You see them with their wife
""What's up Tony?""
""Hey man, how's everything going brother?""
""Just taking it easy, hanging out with the lady""
""Alright, God bless you, take it easy now""
You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, ""What's up Tony?""
""Hey yo, where's the bitches at nigga?""
Where's the bitches?

Yeah, give me my space
Lord ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, I mean I got no time to wait
Love my girl but I told her straight up ""don't wait up""
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked then made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feeling like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wanna be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowing when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wanna let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Oh shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying
""Baby, why don't you throw these bands on me?""
And I came to spend
She pop a molly let the motherfucking games begin
I'm running

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on

When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings
Followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher says we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: ""Are you sure?
Even the murderer? Even the whore?
Even the nigga running through bitches on tour?""
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit
She losing faith in him and he knows and shit
Like what the fuck is a break
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got till it ain't no more
No more tears it's been ten long years, damn near
I don't know if I can wait no more, and who can blame her
You complaining 'bout every time you out, you come back she pout
Sleeping back to back, this is whack
We 'bout to go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out on account of your guilt
She's has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evening
And even then, your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman
At least you know you got Lois Lane
But you

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on

Yeah, unbelievable seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age 3 I knew this world was three below
Listen, even know my ego low achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent, yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me: ""Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color their face is""
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
9 months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, cause you
Know your wifey loves you, does you refuse to accept it?
That's that type shit that tell why my granny light-skinned
Rich white man rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains still concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from 50 mill like Dave Chappelle?

Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough
Look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers trying to steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet
I'm real life hot
Homie, get your weight up
Fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect
Whenever I say faggot, okay faggot?
Don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass
That's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya
Boy Meets World
I'm trying to find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James
Wait a minute that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck
If the hoes like it
I love it nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Digga Digga
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like eleven so forgive me
A decade later I be all up in the city
Trying to get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it
It was, fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know
In a year he'd be fucking paying me
What can you say to me
I beat the odds like Vegas
I use to rap about haters before niggas was hating me
Now they hate to see a young Black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free
Pardon me

Got the game back and I ain't never lettin' go

I'm the prince of the city
I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parks where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
So I'm wondering really
What could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops cause he's sorry
Fuck the education
Would ask for reparations
But I'm probably just gonna buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the T.V. so the demons in him
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil but now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul

My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati

This next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati
Is you stupid nigga
Young Black millionaire
Old White billionaires
I'm sure that they could do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would have been a summa cuma laude
Beyonce told me that she want to cop a blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth
I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see them at the Oscars

Oh hey what's up? What's goin' on with you?
OK, friend hug, friend hug, just a friend
Keep it friendly, friends, friends

Re-adjusted my target audience
Cause it's obvious
I've gone astray
Losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timberland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind
Just the sound of my whole career
Crashing burning
The thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years
Until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here
Mask my tears, but I

I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go

J. Cole,"I grew up, a fuckin' screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need somethin' newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I weren't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I, could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
Cause I'm tryna stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dream in quiet tryna dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? Aye who am I? (Yeah)

Things change, rearrange, or so do I
It ain't always for the better dawg, I can't lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be..
Move along, nothing to see

I always did shit the hard way, my niggas slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbaca
Whispers that he got it for the low low sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peep game, got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, to ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front door
His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though
I told her hello and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash, and just asked
""What a nigga gotta do to get that?! Put me on""
He just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 Years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, ""Nigga you know how you sound right now?
You won't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now, listen""
""You everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me, when I look up to you?""
""You bout to go get a degree, I'm bout to be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or sell a number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't never want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?""
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show ol' girl what she missing
The illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?

Things change, rearrange, or so do I, (Aye who am I?)
It ain't always for the better dawg, I can't lie (Aye who am I?)

Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there
There is no right or wrong
Only a song
I like to write alone
Be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasin' panties gettin' dome
Had no clue what you was goin' through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way
Because she loves me like you do
And though it do not always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together

I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it

Another day another rhyme ho
Another day another time zone
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playin' on my trumbone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred or lazy
Give em' words and the urge to raise me
Nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot dog, catch up to me nigga
Uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shit in the mist
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this bitch
Like thanks for the view
Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showin' off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin' soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Gettin' head like a coin toss
Too easy

I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong

If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the thrown, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cuz niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOW

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me girl why you be stressin me for time
When you tell me you love me, can't you see im tryna climb
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

My inhibitions, fighting my intuition
Premature premonition
Showin me the demolition of these phony niggas
So ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
Im like that time you bagged a dime
And checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day yall have to decide, who you gon be
A scary nigga or a nigga thats gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be

Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me! BLAOW

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a King
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

History repeats itself and thats just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem, and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gone snatch the crown
Look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time
And claim that you sick, and fuck it if the truth is
Who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls from the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he claims onto the need for power
But reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same
Are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause deep down I know every pore just wanna be loved",Fire Squad

When we long for you, start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breath without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em

We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a straight
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers

May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you nigga with me cause I love you like my brothers

Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
'Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the one's you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours

No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her ""Hey, what's good?
""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out of touch with reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
I'ma need my shirt back
Nigga you know how it go
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home

Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
Thats all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it

Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shits not always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know
How could you know? How could you know?
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
And listen up I'm bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat about a bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga

That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?I
I look around like do you want to be another nigga

Father forgive me for me, childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me, miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
Before you go I've got to, want you now

Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well

Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh at mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
'Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she ride on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
It make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deeper
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said ""have you ever had sex before""
Damn

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

I wrote back and said ""of course I had sex before""
Knowing I was frontin'
I said I was like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know what
So she done roll back and told me
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when playing on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like ""Yeah baby sound like a plan""
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
Fuck

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no

You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying God don't let me bust quick
I'm watching pornos tryin' see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in a crib now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practice
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle""

Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long, the consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat
Her mama be stressing me like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it
Ain't got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes)
For your eyes only

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?

You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you're hearing this, unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you
In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God
But because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me
Maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related
Mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above, maintaining a time sheet
That slow money, picked up the family business
By the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking, what the fuck we naming this girl?
I told her Nina, the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated cause the cash running out
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See baby girl I realized, my definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your 
Father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your Daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

For your eyes
For your eyes only
For your eyes
For your eyes only
For your eyes do you understand, for your eyes

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling
He said ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing
When times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your Momma nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects
I had to interject like, ""Nigga what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I've been having premonitions, just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow, like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said the only thing I'm proud to say I was a father
Write my story down and if I pass go play it for my daughter when she ready
And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only, don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means I would never be brought into this world 
'Cuz my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a 
White girl to take back to Jonesborough with
'Lil Zach and Cole World barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later making sure the story's told
Girl your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cos he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving O's
Nah your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cos he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed fuck the law, although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cuz he loved you""

Bringing me closer to heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm in peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the father for forgiveness, God, I'm overwhelmed (Please God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if he's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, he'll never judge a man
Because he knows us all and therefore he would understand

The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt I evolve
I no longer bury demons

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seen it come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party soft lips soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is than tell me if I'm wrong or right
If, I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights off

And put my number in it
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time
I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind is letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
I be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girls 100
And I want it, no question
I know destiny well and know I seen the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, this the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights off

Darling don't you wait for me

A practice of being present
There's no where I need to be, except right here with you
Except right here with you
Foldin' clothes, watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows, eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl with bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day I'm drinking almond milk
You soft!

Save you some time, alleviate a bit of stress from your mind

We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Got learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say ""Damn what’s gotten into you?""

Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

It's ain't supposed to be sad though you might feel it that way
It's a song about desperation, 
Every now and then we do get desperate

This is a song about L-O-V-E, 
And if you abuse it you're gonna lose it 
And if you lose it you're gonna 'buse and 
If you 'buse it you ain't gonna be able to choose it 
'Cause you ain't gonna  have it further on down the line 
Things ain't gonna be so fine 
You're gonna to be sitting there on your little machine 
Trying to look and keep it clean and 
You're going to be home playing bingo all night all alone 
And that's why your sitting there by the telephone 
And you know that she ain't going to call you!

So you put on the TV and you're watching Johnny Carson 
Segwaying right into the Tomorrow show 
But that don't got the go so you turn it off ya turn on the radio, 
The radio don't seem to get the click so you say 
""Hey Man, I can't lickety split"" 
You start to open up a little book 
And there's something there you got to overlook 
And you say ""BABY, you know there's somethin on my mind!
""You say ""Baby there's somethin on my mind - 
I know that you're home and I know you ain't all alone! ""

So you start walking over to her house 
And you get over to her house 
And you walk over to her door and 
You start poundin on her door and you say 
""Open up the door bitch!? 
This is wooba gooba with the green teeth, let me in!!""

Well, she opens up the door 
And then you just kinda walk up to her and say 
""Baby"", (say Baby!) you look up way up at her green mascara 
And you say ""Oh my darling, 
You know her and me was at the party as friends -
Do not believe what they say 
That's only gossip that they tellin ya - 
A wise crack of lies!"" 
You say Darling!!!

Take your big curls and squeeze them down Ratumba - 
What's the name of the chick with the long hair? 
(Rapunzel!) Hey Rapunzel! 
Heh heh... Hey Reputa the beautah! Reputa the Beautah! 
Hey Reputa the Beautah flip me down your hair 
And let me climb up to the ladder of your love!! 
Because this is the wooba gooba sayin to ya 
""Love comes once and when it comes 
You better grab it fast 'cause sometimes the love 
You grab ain't gonn' last and

I really didn't care
I had already gone too far
To let them steal my share

So, like a fool I took 'em on
And as my anger cool
I realized I could take all mine
And skip off with theirs, too

I know I must be crazy
I'm bound to wake up dead

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door
Somebody, somebody
Tryin' to even up the score

I figured I should lay real low
And stayed away from town
I covered up all my moves
So, it'd be hard to track me down

But I started gettin' shaky
And I paced around the floor
Hiding out all alone
I couldn't take much more

Just sitting 'round here waitin'
Is drivin' me up the wall

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door

Tryin' to even up the score

So, I called up my old friend Marlene
Who was lookin' for some fun
I got drunk and like a fool
I told her, what I'd done

I heard them knockin' at my door
They got to me at last
It don't take much to figure out
How they'd found me out so fast

And when I looked for my Marlene
I saw that she was gone

Waitin' outside my back door

J. Geils Band,"This is the story of a young couple in Portland, Maine

While waiting for her husband Don
To return home from work, she reaches for a can of anchovies
As she spreads the tiny fish across a piece of lettuce
She notices a small note at the bottom of the can
Written on it is a telephone number

Curious, she dials, and is told, ""Don't move, lady, we'll be right over""
Placing the phone back on the hook, she turns
To see three smartly dressed men standing in her kitchen doorway
Before she realizes what is happening to her
She is rolled tightly in long sheets of cellophane
Transported to an international airport and placed on a waiting jet-liner
All this being too much for her to comprehend, she passes out

Upon awakening, she finds herself in a strange, foreign speaking nation
'Dalas nekcihc dna tihs nekcihc neewteb
Ecnereffid eht wonk ot suineg a ekat t'nseod ti'
Alone, fearing her escape impossible
She seeks comfort in the arms of a confidential agent

With the trace of her kiss still warm upon his lips
He betrays her to the hands of three scientists
Who are engaged in diabolical, avant-garde experiments previously
Performed only on insects and other small, meaningless creatures
Using her as their subject, they are delighted with the results
For the first time, a human being is transformed into a, shh, top secret

Meanwhile, back in Portland, Maine

Her husband Don, now chain-smoking 40 packs of cigarettes a day
Sits at a local bar and has a few beers with the regulars
Bored, everyone's attention turns to the television set
That just hangs from the wall, welcome to bowling for dollars

Suddenly, crazy Al says
""S-say, Don, there sure is something familiar about that bowling ball""
To which the terrified Don replies
""Oh my God! That bowling ball, it's my wife!""

And the lesson we learn from this story is
Next time you place your order
don't forget to say, ""No anchovies please""","No Anchovies, Please"

Panic rules the moment with no mercy or desire
Ran across the blackened sand to get a soft ice cream
And now my mouth is burning crimson in a long and bloody dream
Sometimes I wonder 'bout these physical disorders
My only contact is with TV news distorters

Glancing over quickly at the words from brain to pen
All that I can tell you,  I'm insane, insane again
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax

Puppets with directions they whisper in my ears
Circled stairs around me drip with long forgotten tears
Nothing done without a motive, proving they were smart
Every path they traced for me another kind of chart
Corporate Christie says it all the meeting is a-twist
My pulse is fading quickly you can feel it on my wrist

Glancing over quickly at the words from brain to pen
All that I can tell you,  I'm insane, insane again
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax

I need some breathing room
I need some breathing room

Shrink rap, clap trap, mind bend, echo send

Back track, meat rack, cardiac, yakety, yakety, yak

Breathing room, I need some breathing room
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax

Mama, won't you tell me please, please what is goin' on?
I have seen with madhouse vision
No conclusions can be drawn
My mind is inside out and all the clarity is gone

Bending over backwards in a rush to comprehend

Silently she contemplates

She's a flame, flamethrower
She's a flamethrower at night
She's a flame, a red-hot glower
She's a flamethrower at night

You might think you're burnin'
All your candles at both ends
Maybe you should go to church
To make up some amends
But if you think you're fireproof
So cool and much too much
Don't dare go near my baby
Cause she'll melt you with her touch
I forget the darkness
I forget the pain
When she's movin' through my heart
And when she's pumpin' through my veins
She's the part inside me
I never can control
And she's the only reason
I know I've got a soul

Hold on this song has a little introduction to it
It's ain't supposed to be sad though you might feel it that way
It's a song about desperation
Every now and then we do get desperate

This is a song about L-O-V-E, 
And if you abuse it you're gonn' lose it 
And if you lose it you're gonn' 'buse and 
If you 'buse it you ain't gonn' be able to choose it 
'Cause you ain't gonn'  have it further on down the line 
Things ain't gonn' be so fine 
You're gonn' to be sitting there on your little machine 
Tryin to look and keep it clean and 
You're going to be home playing bingo all night all alone 
And that's why your sittin' there by the telephone 
And you know that she ain't goin' to call you!

So you put on the TV and you're watchin' Johnny Carson 
Seguin' right into the Tomorrow show 
But that don't got the go so you turn it off ya turn on the radio
The radio don't' seem to get the click so you say 
""Hey Man, I can't lickety split"" 
You start to open up a little book 
And there's somethin' there you got to overlook 
And you say ""Baby, you know there's somethin' on my mind!
""You say ""Baby there's somethin' on my mind 
I know that you're home and I know you ain't all alone! ""

So you start walking over to her house 
And you get over to her house 
And you walk over to her door and 
You start poundin' on her door and you say 
""Open up the door bitch!? 
This is wooba gooba with the green teeth, let me in!!""

Well, she opens up the door 
And then you just kinda walk up to her and say 
""Baby"", (say Baby!) you look up way up at her green mascara 
And you say ""Oh my darling
You know her and me was at the party as friends 
Do not believe what they say 
That's only gossip that they tellin' ya  
A wise crack of lies!"" 
You say Darling!!!

Take your big curls and squeeze them down Ratumba - 
What's the name of the chick with the long hair? 
(Rapunzel!) Hey Rapunzel! 
Heh heh... Hey Reputa the beautah! Reputa the Beautah! 
Hey Reputa the Beautah flip me down your hair 
And let me climb up to the ladder of your love!! 
Because this is the wooba gooba sayin to ya 
""Love comes once and when it comes 
You better grab it fast 'cause sometimes the love 
You grab ain't gonn' last and 
I believe I musta
You know I think I musta, 
You know baby I think I musta
You know I think I musta
I musta got lost!!!!!!!

(Sung)
Never thought about tomorrow 
Seemed like a long time to come 
How could I be so blind, baby 
Not to see you were the one 

I let ya slip on from me baby 
I let ya walk on by, 
Shoulda loved, you told me 
I refused to love, I let it die 

Musta got lost, musta got lost, musta got lost 
Somewhere down the line 
Musta got lost, musta got lost 
Give away the day you were mine 

Don't know why I let you leave me 
Honey I don't know 
See its hard to see lovin' comin baby 
But I have a way to see it go 

Musta got lost, musta got lost, musta got lost 
Somewhere down the line 
Musta got lost, I got lost 
Give away the day you were mine 

Love can be a sweet thing 
Girl I just don't understand 
Made a game outta lovin' you 
Now I hold a losin' hand 

Musta got lost, musta got lost, musta got lost 
Somewhere down the line 
Musta got lost, I got lost girl
Give away the day you were mine

I just don't understand it 
I just don't understand it
I just don't understand it

And I musta got lost, musta got lost, musta got lost 
Somewhere down the line, hey 
Musta got lost, baby, I got lost girl
Give away the day you were mine

Musta got lost, I got lost, musta got lost 
Somewhere down the line 
Musta got lost, I got lost girl
Give away the day you were mine

by the J. Geils Band
Some fellas look at the eyes
Some fellas look at the nose
Some fellas look at the size
Some fellas look at the clothes
I don't care if her eyes are red
I don't care if her nose is long
I don't care if she's underfed
I don't care if her clothes are worn
First I look at the purse!
Some fellas like the smiles they wear
Some fellas like the legs that's all
Some fellas like the style of their hair
Want their waist to be small.
I don't care if their legs are thin
I don't care if their teeth are big
I don't care if their hair's a wig
Why waste time lookin' at the waistline?
First I look at the purse!
A woman can be fat as can be,
kisses sweet as honey
But that don't mean a thing to me
If you ain't got no money
If the purse is fat....that's where it's at.
Some fellas like the way they walk
The way they swing and sway
Some fellas like the way they talk
Dig the things they say.
I don't care if they wobble like a...
or talk with a lisp
I still think I'm a good lover
if the dollar bills are crisp

Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you",Since I Fell for You

This is for my pimps this is for my hustlas
Diamonds in the back Lac' drivin' muthafuckas
If ya gettin high smoke one for me
If ya gettin drunk it bettter be Hennessy
This is fo rmy chicks lookin good in they whips
Smokin dro drinkin yac real sexy when they sip
What's my name?
Uncle James family rest in peace

[Verse 1:]
I grew up in a house with my mother
Didn't have my punk ass father
Cuz he felt it was his time to move on
It seems when I got a bit older
The world got a lil bit colder
And I had to learn everything on my own
I think about where I been and where I am
Oh and I know I got so far to go
But ya'll don't hear me
So when I don't even feel like
Thinkin about it or talkin bout it
This is where I goo you can find me

[Chorus:]
Sittin in the back of my Lac
Smokin my dro sippin my yac yea
Yeah, Yeah [x4]

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes I don't
Know if I want
To keep on going
So I go and I be alone
I get in my car
I hit the boulevard
I park then I sit
I spark then I sip
And I smoke and, and I drink and, and it helps me clear my mind
I said I smoke and, and I drink and, and it helps me clear my mind
I said I smoke and, and I drink and, and it helps me clear my mind
Helps me clear my Mind!

[Rap: ]
Some nights I get Xo tipsy
Other mights I get Louie the 13th pissy
By myself? Damn right on my lonesome
Cuz I get sick and tired of niggas callin when they want somthing
So I get off in my pearl white Lac'
With my sunroof top
And a diamond in the back
I sip my yac and smoke my weed
Niggas if you thug sang this song with me

Did u know, you do that for me
And I wonder sometimes why,
You be taking your time I

I know it's goin' be right
Girl I put that on my life

You be giving me the coldest shoulder
Cause you don't want your emotions taking over
Instead you talking about you Looking for a soldier

Are you trying say you don't see that in me
I know that were friends,
but taking it there wont mess it up
Please just trust in me
Girl I got you cant you see?

Fix your heart up,
Before you give it to someone (Ohh)

Someone who don't deserve it,
who's going to hurt it baby

(You Should Be With Me)

Like a scene from my favorite movie
Hard to control myself when you're next to me
If it's against the law to love then sue me
Girl this whole thing got me in disbelief
I know it takes time
To build something that's worth while, But
Just in case you didn't hear me
I'mma say it again more clearly

J. Holiday,"We are good for each other
Yes, we are good for each other
We were meant to be together

Girl, we met such a long time ago
But I was too young and scared to let you know
But I'm standin' right here right now
Tellin' you I love you and I ain't gonna back down

In your life, it has changed but I know
It was a mistake to let you go
The situation ain't the same from before
Girl, can't be nothin' better than you and me forever
Like woodgrain and leather, we fit good together

We are good for each other
But that ain't all I gotta say, baby
We were meant to be together
'Cause we were meant to be together lady

We are good for each other
Yes, we are good for each other
We were meant to be together

Girl, the old sayin' is, 'What you love let it go
If it comes back then it was yours and if it don't then it won't
So that's what I did and girl, you came back so
Now you're mine that feelin' that's [Incomprehensible]

Just get ready for my love, get ready for my touch
'Cause I ain't gone never let nothin' come between us
Oh baby, come and be my lady
And we can be Bonnie and Clyde all up in my Mercedes

We are good for each other
But that ain't all I gotta say, baby
We were meant to be together
'Cause we were meant to be together lady

We are good for each other
Yes, we are good for each other
We were meant to be together

We were meant to be together
Like the sun and the moon and flowers in June
We were meant to be together
Just like paper and glue, B. B. King and the blues

We were meant to be together
Like Hennessey and Mary Jane, Tammy T and Marvin Gaye
But it's always been this way, it's gone always stay the same
We gone be forever like winter coat and sweater, oh, girl

We are good for each other
But that ain't all I gotta say, baby
We were meant to be together
But we were meant to be together, baby

We are good for each other
Yes, we are good for each other
We were meant to be together

Now the old sayin' is, 'What you love let it go
If it comes back then it was yours and if it don't then it won't""
So that's what I did and girl you came back
So now you're mine [Incomprehensible] yeah, yeah

J. Holiday,"Don't choke on that, homeboy, blow it out
Don't sip on that drink, pour a little out
Let your life reflect what comes outta your mouth
And never pull out your piece unless you dumpin' out

Never fear no man but know when to run
Leave no man standin' till the battle is won
And when it's gettin' real good, better pull it out
When niggas front, don't give up, my brother, sweat it out

And don't smoke what you don't roll up
And act right if you know you can't fight
Take a test if you're unsure if it's yours
There's a one percent chance that it might be another man's

And we know the life we been livin', that one day we might fall
And the only choices we give is got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, He's got love for us all
Still we're livin' these thug, these thug commandments

Stop cuffin' that young girl, let her breathe
Be a father to your kids, not hell disease
No doo-rags in the Lord's house
Trust in the Lord, but keep a glock in your house

When you talkin' to a man, look him dead in his eye
Never get high, come on on your own supply
Gotta think fast, stash your little cash
Watch them snake niggas, they slither in the grass

And don't smoke what you don't roll up
And act right if you know you can't fight
Take a test if you're unsure if it's yours
There's a one percent chance because it might be another man's

And we know the life we been livin', that one day we might fall
And the only choices we give is got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, He's got love for us all
Still we're livin' these thug, these thug commandments

We fall down but we get up
We sell out and we reap up
And we keep watch from the roof tops for the cops
Hive snitches, tap telephone switches

And we get paid but we won't sell
Right back slang, new story to tell
Goes around and 'round like [Incomprehensible]
And never changes, that's all the game is

And we know the life we been livin', that one day we might fall
And the only choices we give is got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, He's got love for us all
Still we're livin' these thug, these thug commandments

We fall down but we get up
We sell out and we reap up
And we keep watch from the roof tops for the cops

From your lips and back up to your eyes

I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you

Got me fiendin' for her love, can't lie
Man, you should see how she got me
Spendin' all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do

'Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me

And my fingers all in your hair
I wonder if you feel me watchin' you
'Cause I can't go a night without your lovin'
Got me lookin' at this phone
Every time it rings, I hope it's you, girl

Got me bracin' for your love
And I've fallen for you, I can't lie
I just wanna be with you
And yes, she got me there, I said it
Somebody call the paramedics
Tell 'em to hurry up and come through

I can't breathe when you're touchin' me

Don't ever leave me, girl
I need you inside my world
I can't go a day without you
And see, nobody else will ever do
I'll never feel like I feel with you

In the doorway
About to leave me for good this time
She's standing
Handing me my chain
And the keys and the bracelet
I got her for our two years
She said there's nothing left to do here
There's no more love
I'm leaving you here
And she turned away
And I see two years fall to the ground

I'm saying don't go
Cause you make sleeping difficult
You make it difficult for me
Don't go
And you make eating difficult
You make it difficult for me
Don't go
It's almost impossible
Almost impossible to breathe
Don't go
Cause you make living difficult
When you're not here with me

And I can tell that deep in her heart
She would like to stay
Because she loves me
And she knows that I love her too
She just hates the way I get neglectful
And some times a little disrespectful
In front of my friends
Baby don't let go
Cause all that I need is you (You)
So as a fool

I'm saying don't go
Cause you make sleeping difficult
You make it difficult for me
Don't go
And you make eating difficult
You make it difficult for me
Don't go
It's almost impossible
Almost impossible to breathe
Don't go
Cause you make living difficult
When you're not here with me

Cause it makes no sense
To break-up over silly arguments
If we both know
That what we've got is real
So I'm begging you don't go baby

I'm saying don't go
Cause you make sleeping difficult
You make it difficult for me
Don't go

How do you find yourself
Inside of love (Inside of love)
With a girl that you met
Inside the club (Inside the club)
Never could that be me-Yeah
That was what I used to say
Until it happened just the same to me
I never thought it could happen to me
But these days I'm finding myself on the ground

Have you ever met someone
That you thought was for the moment
Then they came & stole your heart
Before you knew that it was stolen
Took you by surprise
Cause you never saw it coming
And now I can't deny

It was only me, taking flights over sea.
But now it's you cause they finally realized you're a star.

Even though I don't show it girl, I just want you to know,
That even if we fight a million times over little things,
We can still make it better I meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring,
That I'ma love you forever, I fall for you deeper everyday,
Feel it now girl more than ever, but with our type of love, forever ain't enough

I've been searching my whole life,
I'm lucky I found you, no better girl too you ain't leaving
Cause forever ain't enough you see me for who I am and not for who I'm not no,
I'm telling you that I'm sorry if I tend to treat you the wrong way
But I care you know my heart is there

Even though I don't show it girl, I just want you to know,
That even if we fight that even if we fight a million times over little things,

J. Holiday,"See there's this lady, that lives on the street
She has no job, no home, no family
And she barely has the chance to even eat
So she begs, and steals, and sells her body

Sometimes she may come off a little strong
But she's just on her own
But is it was you
What would you do
If you didn't have a home

If you didn't have a pot to piss in
Didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless
Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you

There's a man, on the street
He's got holes in his shoes, on his feet
We be in the club spending doe
Then we'd come outside and tell him no
All he needs is a couple bucks
He's got a little change but it's not enough
We turn our backs and laugh
But we stop in our tracks
And turn the other way, because we got it made
Sometimes we make 'em up
Just a little strong
But he's on his own
But what about you
What would you do
If you didn't have a home

If you didn't have a pot to piss in
Didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless
Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you

A new day when I open my eyes
Got a black president but there's people outside
I know you've seen 'em and we all done passed 'em
Some people seen some shit last night
Still got 'em laughing
But it's not funny, It's all about money
And I bet you won't go put on them shoes
Crazy because we're out clubbing
Ain't worried bout nothing
But imagine is that person was you
(imagine is it was you)",Homeless

J. Karjalainen,"Ystävät mua kuunnelkaa
Ja mukanakin laulaa saa
Kun kerron teille pienen tarinan
Tää on laulu Laura Häkkisen
Ja silmien niin sinisten
Oli juhannus ja siitä aloitan

Mä ikkunasta hänet näin
Kun keikkabussiin hetkeks jäin
Tää juttu sattui Järvilavalla
Hän seisoi ihan yksinään
Laiturilla mietteissään
Mikä juhla se on sillä tavalla

Mä menin päähän laiturin
Ja hyvät jussit toivotin
Hän kasvonsa käänsi minuun päin
Silloin näin mä kirkkauden
Jota olevankaan tiennyt en
Ja kouristuksen tunsin syömmessäin

Hän oli kaunis kaunis niin
Mun silmät peittyy kyyneliin
Aina kun mä häntä aattelen
Niin sinisinä järven veet
Ei ole koskaan loistaneet
Kun loisti silmät Laura Häkkisen

Ei minua hän tuntenut
Eikä oikein uskonut
Kun sanoin että soitan bändissä
Mä sanoin ""Soitan kumminkin
Beibi menen sekaisin""
Hän sanoi ""Taidat olla kännissä""

En ollut enää ollenkaan
Olin tokkurassa muuten vaan
Mulle riitti loiste silmien
""Nähdään päässä laiturin
keikan jälkeen"" ehdotin
""Nähdään vaan"" hän sanoi hymyillen

Hän oli kaunis kaunis niin
Mun silmät peittyy kyyneliin
Aina kun mä häntä aattelen
Niin sinisinä järven veet
Ei ole koskaan loistaneet
Kun loisti silmät Laura Häkkisen

Keikka alkoi yks ja kaks
Eikä tullut paljon kummemmaks
Onneks se loppui lyhyeen
Sinisilmääni mietin vain
Mä katseellani häntä hain
Pian tahdoin hänet nähdä uudelleen

Mä jengin läpi kiirehdin
Takas päähän laiturin
Ja odottelin sydän pamppaillen
Siihen tuli jotain porukkaa
Nimmareita jaagaamaan
Mut ei koskaan Laura Häkkinen

Mä olin epätoivoinen
Mä etsin alta koivujen
Mä pyörin eessä nakkikojujen
Mä siinä melkein turpaan sain
Kun tyttöäni turhaan hain
Ja varkain valkes aamu kesäinen

Hän oli kaunis kaunis niin
Mun silmät peittyy kyyneliin
Aina kun mä häntä aattelen
Niin sinisinä järven veet
Ei ole koskaan loistaneet
Kun loisti silmät Laura Häkkisen

Stade sanoi ""Lähdetään""
Mä sanoin ""Menkää, tänne jään""
Ja istuin takas päähän laiturin
""Mä en lähde minnekään
Mul on juttu meneillään""
No Stade sano ""Mä poltan Camelin""

Silloin vanha järkkäri
Näki minun hätäni
""Arvaan ketä ootat"" alkoi hän
Kylmä karsi ruumistain
Kun kertomuksen kuulla sain
Näin miehen kyyneliään pyyhkivän

Oli siitä vuotta kymmenen
Kun järveen kesken tanssien
Hukkui nuori Laura Häkkinen
Sen jälkeen joka juhannus
Näin loppuu tämä kertomus
Nähty oli loiste silmien

Hän oli kaunis kaunis niin

Hei mitä sinä naurat?
Luitko ajatukseni?
Voin olla vähän hölmö

Musta tuntuu niin kuin oisin saanut jotain
Silti yhä uudelleen ja uudelleen
Menen sekaisin
Menen sekaisin sinusta

En osaa kirjoittaa
Sulle rakkausrunoja
Mutta ota tämä laulu

Jotkut menee sekaisin rock'n'roll-musiikista
Jotkut menee sekaisin alkoholista

Vielä kerran sinä saat minut sekaisin

Took a big chance and waved me home
I'm pretty sure the ball touched me

J. Rawls," 

Medic! Medic! A, yo, that's what they yelling!
Their hearts done stopped pumping, son, and ain't no telling
What that kid gone do now, is that him writing texts?
What the?! I didn't know that son was ambidextrous
With the beats and the rhymes
Plus he said it on time
And listen to that groove
It's raw with no refined
With ""Boom-na-na""..
Yeah, that's how we did it
Rolled the loop, and kick in the snare, and then he lit it
Now you're brain's on drugs
Introducing J. Rawls
He makes the beats for ya'll
And now he got the gall
Like, Who he think he is?
Like maybe Mos, Sans, and Kwa..
Ain't wrote no damn lyrics since the days of my man, Ra
But he still move the crowd
To the next universe
And ain't no chaos in this verse
But you gotta let it soak first
Before you knock it
But listen to you rock it
And once that rhyme settle up in your dome
Just buy the album when I drop it
But it ain't like that
I'm just statin' my case
I been touching Ts and marks [????] since I tied my first shoelace
So listen up! Cause, son, the rhymes about to start
So sing the chorus with me, cause that's my favorite part
Come on:

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Who they want to be like?
They can't see me!
Who they tryin' a' be like?
They tryin' a' be me
Who they want to be like?
They can't see me!
Tryin' a' be like.
They can't see J. Rawls

Who they want to be like? That's what I thought
Expected Sands on the mic, son, but, yo', you got caught
By them brothers united, and we're not Bling, Bling
And ain't no stretch Hummers and stuff
We just doin' our Thing, Thing
With the nine to five; man, I'm trying to stay alive
And, yo, this rent payment is due, and ain't no checks from Jive
Or, maybe, Tommy Mottola, or even Arista Corporation
I just do this stuff for fun, I do this stuff for Jason
Or maybe Joe Sikes (Peace son!)
So I can take it up a little higher
Put two weeks in on the job or maybe even retire
And I just got here, but I'm still working like I'm starving
And working my ass off, but it's getting kind of hard and..
So maybe the next time you see me I'll be talking about Bling, Bling
But I'll be giving to the org instead of wearing them diamond rings
Or, maybe, buying equipment, so I can perfect my craft
Making phat ass beats for Sands; so he can, keep spitting that math
So check for Book of Acks [???], and peeping the Lone Cats
But don't be expecting too many more of these damn Rawls raps
Until next rhyme, remember this moment in time
With that ""Who they want to be like?"" Cause that's my favorite line

Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

J. Thompson,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

I found my love at last",At Last

I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.

and I did ev'rything I could to get me though the night.
Don't know where it started or where it might end;
I turned to a stranger just like a friend.
 
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.

No more lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Now that I've found a friend and a lover;
I bless the day that I discovered 
you, oh you; 
 
lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.

J.C. Lodge,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times, 
Doin' things that you don't understand.
 
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.  
 
Stand By Your Man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to 
when nights are cold and lonely.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And tell the world you love him.
Giving all the love you can.
Stand By Your Man.

And show the world you love him.

Broken, beaten, sick at heart

Must have been part of the game,

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

And give you advice dying for home
You could be the girl I'm searching for
But I hardly know your name
Ooh, why don't you love me anyway
Won't you do what your little heart's tryin' to say
Baby go ahead and rain on me

See I don't know why we keep standing around here like
Little boy lost and his girl
But you won't let me in and I can't say goodnight
And just drive away my world
?Cause you're the face I will always see
When I close my eyes and dream
Ooh, why don't you love me anyway
Won't you do what your little heart's tryin' to say
Baby, go ahead and rain on me

Go ahead and rain
Oh, you can go ahead and rain, rain, rain on me
You know this old world would keep spinning around
Without a lucky guy like me
But please won't you love me anyway 
Go ahead and do what you little heart's trying to say
Baby, go ahead and rain
?Cause maybe things will never be the same again

J.D. Souther,"She gave me a heart in a woman's hand
Carved in cherry-wood
The severed part from a foreign land
I clearly understood

Love has a border and I can't cross over
Love has a border and a right and a wrong
Love has a border, some kind of an order
Beyond that border I don't belong

I sleep all day and dream all night
Prowling up the coast
I have my way when the moon is bright
I'm howling like a ghost

Love has a border and I can't cross over
Love has a border and a right and a wrong
Love has a border, some kind of an order
Beyond that border I don't belong

I ain't going to heaven now
'Cause I learned too many tricks
I just wanna get over this wall
How come I sit here making bricks
And mold her, guarding the border

So I keep that hand like a secret wife
A coin I never spent
Far away there's a place in life
I never really went

Love has a border, I can't cross over
Love has a border and a right and a wrong
Love has a border, some kind of an order
Beyond that border I don't belong

Guarding the border

",The Border Guard
J.D. Souther,"(Everything is wonderful)
First you think its easy, then its not
Then you wonder why you?re stuck down here on this rock
Times comes you may look around 
And realize were all we?ve got
Makes you wanna come on up 

When you think your carrying, to much load
And you feel your heart might just explode
Wow ow little wanderer your standin on a walking rope
Makes you wanna come on up, right now

So come on up to this love right now
(Come on up come on up)
Come on up some one will show you out
(Come on up come on up)
You?re standin inline at the tree of life
When there's fruit on every bow
Just come on up to this love right now

You know people tell you anything you wanna hear
The truth is always whispering in your ear
Someone?s always gonna tell you what you wanna hear
All the while the truth is whispering in your ear

So come on baby
(Come on up to this love)
Oh come on up come on up

Won't you come on up to this love

J.D. Souther,"Oh I like the way you bring the water
With your fingers on the lime
And when you walk that way it kills me
I'll be here at closing time

Is that a ring there on your finger
Or just a thin and fading line
You could walk away from me but don't do it
I'll be here at closing time

I'll be outside with the engine running
Carrying a coat and tie
Looking for a place to take you
I can almost hear you sigh

I'll be outside with the engine running
Pointing at the western sky
Looking for a place to lay you down
But I don't want to make you cry

I can see us walking in the future
With a child of yours and mine
I can feel the sunshine on our shoulders
Til it's closing time
Baby when you walk that way it kills me
I'll be here at closing time
I'll be here at closing time
",I'll Be Here at Closing Time
J.D. Souther,"That chip upon your shoulder
Makes you seem much older
But you're just a kid in dangerous disguise

I know where you've been sleeping
And you really should be weeping
For every time you never caught the prize

I don't wanna kiss you and I don't really miss you
You say that you're not ready and you're right
Still I want you in my arms tonight

And you jump hidden dangers
You run up to perfect strangers
You know more than you'll ever realize

You wanna be my girlfriend
It's like standing in a whirlwind
Though this might truly cut us down to size

I don't wanna kiss you, I don't really miss you
You're either out too loose or in too tight
Still I want you in my arms tonight, tonight

You make me think of Anna Beth
With pretty feet and perfect breath
I got on the boat and she stayed on the shore

Now the world around me is sinking
But I'm no worse off than I'd be thinking
That it's you who's knocking at my door

Baby, I don't wanna kiss you much
I don't really miss your touch
Now that's just not right, here I want you in my arms
I can feel you in my arms tonight, tonight

",In My Arms Tonight
J.D. Souther,"If the world was flat 
I?d walk off the edge
But I can?t ?cause it?s to big and round

I can just see myself 
Falling through space
Grateful not to be found.

Trouble with living here in the future 
And sailing the Dutchman?s sea
Is the trouble with love in the present tense
And the fear of eternity.

See no matter where you are
You?re about to come round 
To just where you?ve already been.

Don?t be afraid
It happens to people
And then it happens again and again.

Go off this marble 
Leave something here 
For somebody else but you.

Awww it?s a pity
Most folks don?t realize.

If the world was safe 
I?d fly in my sleep
Crashing right through these blue walls.

Doubts and fears would rise 
Like a duster in Texas
Cushion my deadly fall.

The problem is worse 
If you?re religious
What keeps your head in its place?

They think what they think
But you know what you know
The secrete handshake of fate.

If the world was you
I?d travel extensively
Visiting some places twice.

Scrambling for purchase
Wherever it?s slippery
Against all and any advise.

I?d sleep upside down
For a new view of heaven
Dream at both ends of the night

All through the middle 
I?d breathe with you
Knowing we?d be all right.
(Then we?d go)
Twisting into the light.

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

She thinks it's all a dream
She got rock and roll way down in her soul
She wants to know where's the limousine

You're too young anyway
The devil in disguise give her the prize
Then you can carry her away

And my high turns out to be low

J.J. Cale,"I woke up early this morning
There wasn't a cloud in the sky
I walked up to the window
If I had wings I could fly

Everything looked like a garden
The wonder of it all
Reflection of the sun on the water
Looked like a crystal ball

The blue sky covers dimensions
Beyond what my eyes could see
Stretch my imagination
Totally free

The time was only a moment
Spreadin' like a lighting rod
I know I saw for a moment
The hand of God

As if he'd painted a picture
And put it on my window pane
What I saw this morning
I'll never ever see again",Woke Up This Morning [#]

Talking about yesterday
All those good times are gone

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

I'd say a lonely prayer again

And what it means to cry by yourself?

The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.

J.J. Sheridan,"There's a dear old land of leprechauns
And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven

No one ever will.

That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,

In the window at night,

And guided me right.

And you kissed me all through the night.
Think of all that we been through,
And breakin' up is hard to do.

They say that breakin' up is hard to do,
Now I know, I know that it's true.
Don't say that this is the end.
Instead of breakin' up I wish that 
We were makin' up again.

I beg of you don't say goodbye,
Can't we give our love just one more try?
Come on baby, let's start anew,

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

Someone to sing to me some little samba song
Someone to take my heart then give his heart to me
Someone who's ready to give love a start with me

I got a problem with fuck niggas
Always talkin' shit and try to duck niggas
Sucker niggas won't finish what they started
Be coppin' dueces cause them niggas soft-hearted
They straight bitches
Always puttin' on shows for these niggas and hoes
Be wantin' to run your mouth but won't throw no blows
Ain't got no scrap, better kill that rap
Think life is a game, until that ass get tapped
And when it do, what you do, you run like a bitch
Or do you straight turn state on a nigga and snitch
When you ain't got your boys, you ain't got no balls
And you ain't gangsta with all them 911 calls
Real niggas don't call police
Real niggas handle theirs when they got beef
Flawed niggas talk shit and know they can't back it
Know they ain't real but always trying to act it

Getting three glocks and jumping out of treetops
Making suckers flee spots, and leave knots
Got guns, get funds, yeah I'm packing styles
Suckers acting foul, get smoked like Black and Milds
Nigga know a plan, laying down this thing
Beyond all that rap shit, I only spit game
You scared, say you scared, but just peep what I said
I'm so wicked off the head, probably shoot out of dread
that's right, all you suckers better recognize
Before I start recognizing, ain't gonna have you niggas sweatin' mine
I'm in this thang for real, ain't nothing fake here

It ain't to much chalk in these streets that can hold me back
I make stacks and stacks, for the weeks and weeks I got slapped
Freaks, I got the grill with the white gold
Keep a pistol in my hand with the tight hold
From the city where they drop blows
Known to pin-hold down off them figure fours
Shit shady, we all about to bust on sight, lighting up the night
Putting hoes off in 74's and watching em' all blow
It ain't shit funny, its the money man and Gipp
Holding sawed-off pumps in your face chump

[Yo Gotti]
I was a young nigga thugging now, moms bugging now
Getting the Third Degree, for bringin drugs in the house
Getting my ass in, but my mama had to spoil it
Ran across my work, flushed my shit down the toilet
Fucked me up bad, but I tried to ignore it
Couldn't though, why? 'cause I owed the nigga for it
125 grams eight one yo-la, 50 doller power tell blue motorola
Broke up my tube and my scale, I got no luck
Hold up, mama even threw away the soda
I remember this shit like it was yesterday
Falling in the house late, seent the look on mama's face
I knew something was wrong, by the smile and the smirk
You know the look you get when your mama really hurt
She shook her head, I dropped mine, ya'll already know
Boy you selling dope, get your shit you got to go

[Chorus repeat- X2]
I'm on the motherfucking grind
You think this easy, you out your motherfucking mind
You could see the shit I'm doing, if you was blind
Straight up, I'm just trying to get mine

[Yo Gotti]
What am I to do now, where am I to go?
And how the fuck I'm gonna pay this nigga for his do?
Been looking for me, got a nigga kind of scared
And all the other niggaz looking up side my head
They said he came through, layin low with his beeper
Two, Three cars Two, Three Desert Eagles
Got me a fresh quarter ounce and a beeper
Fuck it, I'm a grind till my bank get steeper
72 hours had 28 elither
Know what I'm talking about that uncut ether
Junkies lookin whoin, goose neckin and browsing
Word got around, I sold up the Public Housing

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]
One week later had 4 and a split
Called up the nigga, told him told him come get his shit
I'm a real nigga, I just ran into some problems
All the time you think a nigga tried to slick rob ya
Thinking about my mama and them, I'm ready to go home
I'm fifteen years old, out here on my own
Mama let me back in, mama real strict
After school, straight home, no phone, no shit
Now doom in my room, I assume I was broke and it's true
So what the fuck a nigga gone do
Called grip, I heard he just got back off a trip with that shit
Man fuck it, I'm getting back with my click

Somethin' about pimpin' 
Cause this players gotta keep a fat knock 

I'm like JD Walker 
Pimp hat to tha right smooth talker 
Bitches workin' all night like a stalker 
Gettin' every last nickel dime and quarter 
Pimpin' ain't hardly nuthin' new to me 
Used to be a little kid watchin' movies 
I knew what I wanted in life, about nine or ten hoes 
I ain't want no wife 
I used to walk real cool like my leg was broke 
And I still do, now I get paid from hoes, Beeitch 
'cause this East side nigga don't care 
Since I was nine years old I been a player 
And now I got a lot 'o women 
It's never endin' 
It's just somethin' 'bout this pimpin' 

[Chorus]

Now, one time for you H-Os 
You want to try a real player bout his pesos 
Hey hoes, I know you in this game tryin' to come up, pick a come up 
Got these niggas got they nut up for some cut ups 
So wut up all I want to do is get this money witcha 
I'm dead serious, I ain't tryin' to be funny witcha 
I teach tha game but It ain't for free 
When I see you with some change you just bring it to me 
See you can come up in this game 
And you can get hurt ho 
When you in public just remember who you work for 
Cause all them tight ? cats gonna come try to holla 
So called ballers, flashin' they dollars 
Hatin' J baby, you just play it crazy 
Let him spend his loot on them boobs 
So you can pay 
All I want is the bread 
He want the pussy and head 
Don't be misled just remember everything I said

And she luv to see a nigga on top
Even though she know there's other bitches wantin' the spot
But they can't fuck wit Slim, cuz baby be the real
Got nerves of steel, feds can't make her squeal
She's a freak in bed, love gettin' head
Keep a nigga welfare wit plenty of bread
Call her Superbitch, love nice shit

Cuz that's slowin' down the money that she can go get
She's a polite assassin, always classy
Exotic, erotic, far beyond trashy
Female rider, keep the heat inside
Down with gangsta shit and my getaway driver
She is J's baby, number one lady
Luv the way she play me and drive these niggas crazy
She's a ??? Swiss, and I'm her pimp

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

""They say there is no hope for the young generation. I beg
to differ. I feel like we gon' go there, you know. You all
just got to trust us. It's like they don't trust us. When
you think about it though, it's up to us to make it happen. For real.""

Keep your head up and smile within
YOu know we gon' make it
Doesn't matter if they don't believe
You know we will suceeed
Got through the bad times to live the good times
We gon' make it

[Verse 1]
Now we possessing old souls but we young folks
I figure generation X will give us some hope
We all some lost souls, all seeking knowledge bad
It's all the same, whether dropouts or college grads
And 2001 was timulturous
Tith all these terrorist attacks on our culture, plus
In NY, we had to watch the buildings crumble down
And Lisa ""Left Eye"" is gone, so we humble now
To tell the truth, I still bug on how Aaliyah left
But if you look when it's cold, you could see her breath
""One in a Million"" girl, and there ain't too many flows that I can do
But Ness, he made me hear the soul in the sample
Funerals, the only time the hood come together
And when a kid pass away young, he's young forever
Preserved in the image that the good lord made him
Generation why, they can't fade him, No

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm chilling with this gangbanger from the west side
He ask me why am I alive and all the rest die
Little hustler, he had just lost his best friend
Somebody let the pistol blow like the west wind
I told him, death is like magic, homies disappear
I mean, we know their spirits living, but we miss them here
I told him, ""Player listen, you were blessed to be hear""
Finally, took a puff of smoke to make him see clear, see there
He been hustling for three years, spillin malt cheap beer for this tee's peers
Little chip, so I asked him ""Where's your momma man?""
And he said, ""Well, she's with Dr. King in the promise land.""
I told him, ""Do your thing but never lose your focus
My only hope is that you learn about what hope is.""
And oh yeah, I know about what selling dope is
To tell the truth, we do the same thing in show biz
Now keep living

[Chorus] plus
Though we came to get paid, and sometimes it's not the right way
But if you learn something this day, we can make it

[Verse 3]
I used to hang on the block, with the glock
From six o'clock to six o'clock
I used to tell all the haters, forget me not
Then the whole world found out I MC hot
These old folks call us thugs right
Big rims and froze ropes, we love life
So I have to say something to today's youth
Whether you sipping grey goose or pray to Jesus, hang loose
There's nothing that can stop us, no crooked coppers
It's time to get our proppers, now's the time
Broke, I done been there a million times
Cheese that don't melt, little children crying
And that's why corrupt thoughts fill their mind
Cats come out the projects and still they shine
So whether MVA or NBA, call my niggas on the block
I'll simply say, keep hustling

Bridge:
I can?t take another broken heart.
Maybe we should spend time apart.
Oh Oh Oh.
Driving me crazy, I can?t take it no more.
Maybe we should spend time apart.

Chorus (X2):
I told you once I told you twice, the next time I won?t be so nice.
You so quick to give it up, when you don?t think about us. (you don?t think about us)
I won?t let you keep (keep) hurting me, if you gone keep causing me pain.
I won?t let you keep (keep) hurting me, I?m ?bout to take you out the game.

So many dreams, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which dream of all the dreams
When there's a dream for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

The wind is filled with songs
So many songs, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles

Which one to choose, which way to go?
How can I tell, how will I know out of
Oh, so many stars, so many stars?

Along the countless days, the endless nights

Daddy's little baby, must learn this world is shady
And the color of your skin don't make you less of a lady
Degrade yourself, never cuz I'm teaching you better
Life ain't all about cheddar diamonds and leather
Understand you a black sister, in this white man's
World, don't let it get ya, down girl
It's essential that you grow amongst your group
So you don't grow too fast and be doin lord knows who
Cuz daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different
What I, do for a living is a talent I'm given
And I'ma raise you too black too strong beautiful
Tell the truth let you know what women go through
Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gone cheat
So be careful in the heat baby girl wit cold feet
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you daddy's little baby ha

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever

Yo Ja's imagery is somewhat like God and his chemistry
Blasphemy, I tell my baby girl proudly
Put her over my knee and let her know this world is yours
Men are dogs take it from daddy and hold yours
Head high lady, love is bout lies and deception
Will always be seen through the eyes
In my demise don't cry just, hold on
Stay headstrong and live to learn that life goes on
The day you was born God answered my cry for help
I look at you a female replica of myself
I was conceived 2/29 you 9/22
God' whats the science in this sign you threw?
I wanna know just so I can spread the jewel to my youth
So she don't have to come up like I did runnin loots
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
For real

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever

When I look in yo eyes I see stars
It's me and you against the world
Baby it's in the signs
And anything you want you can get it daddy's getting it done
You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones
And go through rain sleet and snow to kiss the sun
Though my travel through the storm has just begun
Swear to god when my sister died, I was only five
Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life
Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me
She came at the time when nobody cared for me
This world's tough, I'ma guide you through it carefully
Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free
My little lady, can't quite understand me now
But baby, in time I'll break it down
So keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
For real

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you

As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me

I don't know whats wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turning into murderers
Couldn't fuck with a third of us
Still against me
And wanting to see me in the box
Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.
Leave you Red like Foxx
Ain't nothing funny about that
I see you in a coma, ain't coming up out that
You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and bust another slug on you

Slumping Kennedy-style with your memory out

Shot up in broad day
Now everybody want you
I'm feeling like: stupid didn't the inc. warn you the first time
It's murda
Whenever you see blood
It's murda
Lay you down for the love
That's us 
Leave the lights on
Knife through your windpipe
Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right
You thinking it's alright 
But it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Giving niggas facelifts and taking it
While making you bleed
And if I got a taste of the shit I'm taking more than you need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up wrap his body up in a area rug
Who holding the heat?
Who leaving niggas cold in the street?
Y'all know me, ya Co-D, Ja-Rule the O.G.
Niggas better watch me closely
Get a grip, it's hennessy that fuels all that murderin' shit
When I look in the mirror my reflection is killer
Jigga, X, Ja niggas 
It's murda",It's Murda
Ja Rule,"It must be the way that I spit shit 
That make you say damn this nigga ridiculous 
The way I hit 'em and move nigga I can't lose 
Inconspicuous incognito niggas ain't ready 
For whoever who has the flow nigga know I spit deadly 
Fear me to the day I'm dead on the street with holes in me 
The ghettos got love for me 'cause I'mma lay for 'em 
If I have to gradually down or after 
The only fib be love and disaster 
Tears before laughter but who gonna cry? 
My style be so touchin' nigga wipe yo eye! 
Get used to obvious lies and dead wise guys 
And any bitch niggas feel they fuckin' wit my's 
C'mon let's get it on, to the break in the dawn, 
Before long if you wrong you be dead and gone 
And now I'm the bomb to clarify my name in vain

Till you live it and the cash gets to eatin' at yo spirit

I keep tryin' to get this world to see 
Hustle hard my mind on that money 
My motto to be stack it if you got it for when you get it 
Don't talk about it just be about it that it

For operatin' like planes I'm a hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em 

Baby I come in style comin' fresh out of Queens (Brooklyn) 
I recognize how my killa cliques gettin' down 
Everyday is while takin' yours into process niggas is stress 
Leavin' peep holes in yo chest god bless the next that get laid to rest 
Frustration and stress make me question death 
I want to shoot all niggas I feel should be shot on the spot 
Let 'em rot with lead in their knot 
Oh shit you bitch ass niggas be lit 
Smoke weed it give you the heart to proceed 
Whatcha game plan you the man 
Go for your guns feel no remorse 
When I leave your brain ? 
Now settle down get your shit tight 
Should we expect move right 
And everything is aight 
But if you slip son that ass is gone top dog motherfuckers recognize

Y'all know who the fuck this is
You know we would kidnap yo kids
You know what the fuck we do
Murder bitch niggas like you
For real, all the time, any place, anywhere
Y'all niggas could get it
Act like y'all don't know

In a world that's ice cold, blacks die slowly
Cats snatch rollies, gats'll leave you holy
My momma always told me the streets will slow me down
Daddy never showed me how the heat will hold me down
So now I rob and steal, spit shit you feel, wit a clique that kills
Yea my shit's that real, I hustle hard all my life
Ran the streets all night
My wife always said everything was gonna be aight
And she was right and that's one reason why I love her
But everything she said went in one ear and out the other
Word to mother, look at it from a thug point of view
When the kids need clothes, what a thug gon do?
Hit the streets and hustle, pick up the heat and bust you
I'm tryin' to eat like Russel
Murda is my hustle But you keep chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch, when the eight (.8mm) spit
You could feel the hatred, taste it
You high right now, you ain't ready to die right now
The .45 will calm you down, you under trauma now
It's drama how a child will shut shit down
Kill a nigga for the fuck of it I get you touched for chips
Fuck that shit, fuck the whip, and fuck you bitch
You can just suck my dick

If you chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker, we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch
When the .8 spit you could feel the hatred, taste it
It's your blood, when we show blood, we murderers (murderers)
We throw slugs, we hustlers (hustlers) we sell drugs
And tell thugs live it up till yo time stops

Yo I give a fuck if y'all niggas hate me
I drop bodies off where the lakes be
But lately, I've been hittin' cribs
And safes where the cake be
I take three to the vest for the love of the dolla
I put that hot shit through you and watch you Holla Holla
The same niggas that I ball wit I'ma brawl wit
I'm a tank running in banks and takin' all of it
Player we're flawless, wit nothin' to lose guns bustin'
And brossen niggas y'all can't live
Funny shit about it, niggas wanna hit me, forget about it
Thug shit I'm still livin' y'all niggas just spit about it
I rob and stomp niggas 2/3rd of my life
The other 1/3 spent sittin' on curbs chasin' those birds
If you ever get the urge to come by and try to test
There's only one and then you get numb and lied to rest
It's murder the only code to the ghetto
It's murder, nigga hand me the Bessel
And dance with the devil, guns rapidly spit
Gangsta shit, attractin yo bitch, gettin head and lean back in the whip
I mastered the chips, Nigga I'm tryin to tell you
You're holdin hammers and nails and
We have you where the dogs couldn't smell you

If you chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker, we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch
When the .8 spit you could feel the hatred, taste it
It's your blood, when we show blood, we murderers (murderers)
We throw slugs, we hustlers (hustlers) we sell drugs
And tell thugs live it up till yo time stops

Ja's a motherfuckin' problem
Any nigga think not, I'ma pop him
Put the lean on niggas the minute I spot em
Who's gettin' it, I got him nigga dead and gone
Gonna guide em to the cross roads show em how those guns blow
I'ma degenerate nigga addicted to hydro, switchin' four lanes
Top down wit my eyes closed, got a death wish
Money, drugs, and murderer shit
What you want with this? We'll kidnap yo kids
And clap up yo crib, It's the murderers
Who you know wit guns that kill shit
Just because we're them hot niggas
Sell mo records than Roc niggas
I'ma lock it down for six months and shock niggas
What's my name?
J the A R.U.L.E. with them hoes get between more sheets than Isley
You can't deny me, I'm the motherfuckin' one
Druggin' bitches like Heron(heroin)
The god be the Rule, if you're hot get bice and bice
On your jewel to cop a Bens
20 inch chrome, the shoes, I got nothin' to lose but everything to live for
Thoroughbred demand and supply the raw

Shall not be condemned
But he that believeth not
Is condemned already
Only because
He has not believed
In the man and the only begotten son
My Lord

[Chorus]
For he so feared the word
He left his only begotten son
To shed his blood
Show that pain is love
But I won't cry 
Cause I live to die
Wit my mind on my money
And my guns in the sky 
And my guns in the sky

Yeah, 
Why would you leave somethin' you love here to die
In the cold
And it grows
Like a concrete rose
You the fool ain't I
Till I withered and died
On the same streets you left me 
And, screamin' Lord let me in
I don't know where to begin
Since I lost yo love
But then again your love
Was strictly for the drugs
I don't know whether to hug
Or to fill you with slugs
Fuckin' them whores
Instead of claiming what's rightfully yours
Holdin' my heart from all the pain you caused
With no direction you left your first born lost
Give or take a few
Cause my hate for you
Grew, over the years
Through blood, sweat, and tears
I wanted to be just like you
My father figure, now I want to fight you 
You bitch nigga, left me 'lone
And parts of me never out grown
The fact that left home 
When moms was so strong
Don't let them get you fed
This world is yours she said
Now nothin that stoppin me but two to the head
In life there's more to come
When its all said and done
You lost one love
Your only begotten son

[Chorus: x2]

But what a nigga live for
And damn ready to die young
I'm the shadow behind the gun
Look at what I've become
The fear of many niggas
The floss of most bitches
The love that runs deepest
In the hearts of street niggas
Raised in the ghetto
By the ghetto
Was taught young to pop the medal
That's how shit get settled
Learn to cook up the coke
Never leave home without toast
Learn to fly my bitches with birds not coats
Never trust ya, from a toddler to hustla
I was trained as a youngsta, to cock back and slug ya
Love me or hate me, ya only son
Let me live or kill me, the chosen one
Ja, under the gun gotta kill 'em for show
If you want it you gonna get more then you askin for
Lifes got more to come
But when its all said and done
You lost one love
Your only begotten son

[Chorus: x2]

I wanted to be fam of yours
Looking now at nothin' more than
Two lost souls 
Lookin' to meet at the cross roads
I burn the hydro
Lay back with my eyes closed
In deep thought like Brittany is somethin' I'd die for
How the fuck do you sleep at night?
Knowin' you wrong the only thing you ever did right
Despite the loss I stretch the length of a short
Now I got a new father whose name is New York
Runnin' wild in the streets
With heat, we don't talk
Cause when its cold you basically live life in dark
When light would shine from the heavens
And bless one Ja Rule loved
Your only begotten son

[Chorus: x3]",Only Begotten Son
Ja Rule,"[Chorus: x2]
In my race against time I, can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life 

God, why the hell am I here?
Is it a blessin', or a painful lesson
Of life and its directions?
Date of conception two twenty nine
I was birthed and won't be denied
Lookin' into these eyes
And witness lives' tragedies
The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me
For every lock there's a key
The only thing that ever made me click was ""Cash Money""
So that I lust for
Be it one of my deadly sins
You know the seven 
I got all of them deep within
Sometimes I slip, but you be there
Pick me up, now I'm on my knees like what's up
'Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick
Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence 
Got me to a better sense
Cause what's yours is mine
Hear me lord, I'm runnin' out of time

[Repeat: x2]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too high
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life 

Nobody cry for me
Cause I, want to see you smile for me
When I die look through my windows, to the soul
Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old
Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talented warmer world
Which is so cold
Take me 
Save me 
Before I'm crazy
The only reason I live
Is for my baby
Never did you tell me that 
Life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this 
Shit might be changed
But now I'm just racin' against time 
Tryin' to survive
And see why 
Y'all niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie 
Get drunk and stay high
Don't de-nigga-ny 
Cause they'll never take me alive
Feel me lord 
I'm runnin' out of time

[Repeat: x2]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin too high
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life 

I fears no man
But when its time to go
I'm gone
Racin' through the darkness
Learnin' what's right from wrong
Lookin' for the light
But all I see is the night
When everything else is bright
What happened to my life?
Is this what I am?
Is this what I've become?
A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin' and no one
Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire within my soul 
I must set this whole world on fire
If I control my destiny
Maybe one day I'll give this world the best of me

We might be coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do
Or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist

Doctor says let them die said his f***ing dog bit me
I don't know whats wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all n****s turning into murderers
Couldn't f*** with a third of us

Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.

Giving n****s facelifts and taking it

Are you a figment of my imagination?
Or am I one of yours?
Believe me baby, an hear me, fear me, feel me
That's why they all want to kill me dead
True in the head but nigga not
As soon as I get the drop
I pull up the pop of the test
It's outta the prairie
Bitches style juice running through my head
How many want to die nigga?
My concept It's irrational
My thinking now
I'm erratic like Mike W's whose falling down
I'm losin' sight now I can hardly see
And smoking all this fucking weed
I can barely breathe
I'm like tell a bitch bleed
Squeeze on D
Run up in the deli
Wrung up on D

Are ya watching me?
They be watching, niggas they be watching, keep watching
Keep watching me
Now don't look down
Are ya watching me?
They be watching, Bitches they be watching, keep watching
Keep watching me
Now don't look down
Whose watching me?

C'mon watch as I creep through your block
In the hard top drop
With my bead on knock
Cause cops I ain't standing
And gangstas know
Catching before hanging
And my dogs keep banging
Cause ain't shit changing
And hustlers ya'll keep slanging
We stuck in the game
Wit not a lot to gain
But everything to lose
But we soldiers that front-line
In days to rule

Hit it from behind that's how i polly wit mines

Get me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin 
Let's get the party 
Cracking right here fuck V.I.P

Home wit tears in her eyes 
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies 
She ain't surprise at me 

Just surprise at we 
Been together for this long 
And I can be 
The one to mistreat her 

Thought it last forever

Cut, who gettin high, the hottest pictures 
Livin, life so free 
That we ain't fearin 

The, ills of the world 
In heat of drug dealin 
You and I then made a killin 
And tuck together

Love is the only evil seed that could sever 
A tied this close 
Not the love between us but your love for the dough 

You went O.T started makin M-O-N-E-Why

Wash away your tears (my love) 
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love) 
I'm putting on everything out (my love) 
And my pain it's my love 

And I want 
This world to smile for me 
Don't shed a tear 'cause the nigga died happily 
My momma warned me life was a muthafucka 

But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin 
And every night she just looked at me 
Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like 
""I don't want me baby to die"" 

Brought so much pain into a life 
Gotta make it better

Ladies call me white Kane
Pure as snow

Cutie pies powder they nose
I've been preaching to the stars
Ladies be livin real harder
A lot of icons
But consider me god
Born in the seventies
The eighties was growing wit time
Now it's two g nigga
And the world is mine
I was a smart nigga
Figured if he put me on the spot
Wit hot shit bubble me up til I rock
Come put me on the block
In a new form and new sound
For ja rule and I'm feeling like I'm too strong
I move on down to d.c.
V.a.
And I even did as far as californ i.a.
Come to shit
They fly, they float, they snort, they smoke
Hustle, bag and mope
For more
Down the freeway racing out of control
It's crazy
When you fucking wit rule it's shady

It's your life
Bitches if your fuckin and striping

Sentinella gutta shit
Four sides of the chrome
Flows smack you wit the rubber grip
Never been a nigga, niggas want to play they cards wit
See me in the dark whip
Better go call your guards quick
Better go hit the block and tell them bitches that shisty shit
Known the freaks face like that yellow bezel ice shit
Similar response
Yo that kid spit the nieces
Baby re-intise this
Cd's raise they prices
Make a nigga chain
Paid off in a different name
Maid think they got flame
Shade just hit the brain
Me and ja fucked around and made the teams a list
Two niggas from two sides
Like a 7/10 split bitch

Niggas from the east
Christ from the gun to the mics
I'm living my life
Running through hell wit no ice

But I'd sell my lost soul to win
Go to bed and die
Then I'd wake up breathing again
Cause I'm all in
Even though shit ain't right
I wake up sweatin my life every night
Help me
Is it the devil that going to get me
Or is it god don't feel like being bothered wit me
So hard to hit me
This life a sacrifice
If I grow blind through the dark my kids gonna see the light
If I die young it's cause a nigga too high strung

I know y'all fiendin' for more, and I'm not done
As long as I can run through current like state times
Keep up a sane mind, and hand on my iron, I'ma blast off mine
Look in the eyes of a nigga who seldomly cries
I got a beautiful wife and kids, why me?
y'all cats choose cash and cribs, why me?
If this good livin' Lord, why me?
When I live so dirty yet I'm worthy to be

Would if you was that man
Would you run wit me? Gun wit me?
Would you understand the husstlin', the struggling

We'd be bound to bump heads, 'cause you livin' my life
All righteous, and you said livin' righteous was right

If you lighten up forever you can dig to the night
Wrap them guns over there, and bring 'em on ova' here (One of us)

Now we ride jet sled baby, bubble in Ba-Namb
'cause Rule and the Lord got it goin' on

Would you believe that you could breathe again?

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yo
Let's trade places, Rule be Spirit, God be flesh
And let's see just how, weak the flesh gets
Now you call on me, ""Every night bend your knee""
Until your start to realize I ain't answerin'
Now you hang up the phone, Lord, pick up the chrome, Lord
Can I blame you, Lord, for needin'a feed what's yours
Got a wife that you love, yet you still lust whores
And I'm supposted to judge you, on earth where it's ugly
You might as well aim at the sky, slug me (One of us)

I know what'cha goin' through, every move you make

What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in a roam
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong

And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor

Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Come on and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Sprawled out on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Girl, get a grip, come on, pull it together
It's only a sun shower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share, somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my baby be mine

Nothing but the muthafuckin hits",Always on Time

Gotti, here we go again, yo

Two two-nine and seventy-six, get off my dick, niggas I'm born
The future problem's, kicking and carrying on
Cause I got blood in my lungs and can't breathe, just conceived
And a nigga already fixing to leave
This ungodly world and to think, I got a baby girl
To raise, in this deadly era of AIDS
Just yesterday we were slaves, and good friends
Now that we got ends that don't meet niggas we will meet again
I want to know why, the shit gets said
The shit gets wrote, the shit gets read, motherfuckers get fed
I shed a tear for my ride or die, cause thugs cry
And the truth'll shatter niggas pride like cold lies
Can I live? Dog, why you want to stop the Rule from rising?
And I G for me, surprise and growl
At the young that you called a liar
Now I'm the king of this jungle, no more denying
Talk to the iron if you want to holla, I'll pop at you
Probably, piercing your bone when you poppin' your collar
Cause this is, pain over love, my style's brain on drugs
Yo' style's can't catch up to Rule niggas whats up?
Motherfucker

When the gun blows, and the shots fall
When the smoke clears, we'll be right here
Screaming murder (murder!) Know it's murder (murder!)
Murder (fuck why y'all!) We'll be right here (you hear?)
When the gun blows (c'mon!) and the shots fall (c'mon!)
When the smoke clears (murder!) we'll be right here (murder!)
Screaming murder (yeah!) Know it's murder (yeah!)
Murder, we'll be right here, cause it's, murder!

[Ja Rule]
Yeah, yeah, 
Motherfuckers why y'all want problems, see man, I'm the nigga to give 'em
Niggas don't want none of the Rule they know how hard I'm hitting
Why should I bother with 'em, when they ain't touching what I'm doing?
I'm taking this rap game, to levels that's unhuman (c'mon niggas)
I'm a beast, with animalistic, intentions
And the best of why y'all niggas is honorable mentions
Standing next to I-N-see, niggas
Why y'all fear we, rap's first organized crime family
Selling more records than dope, these days apparently
Got bitches on both coasts, we don't fuck sporadically
How you goin' handle me? I'm pushing your pill
Crossing 'em over, shoot from the corner, three mill'
I'm the franchise deal that bust hotter than burners
Why y'all niggas want it come and get it
But just know motherfuckers it's, murder!

(And the game don't chose me)
Bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy Holes they one in the same
(Ever since you told me)
There's only room for two, I been making less room for you
(Now only GOD can hold me)
Hug me, love me, judge me, the only man that hoves above me
Holla!

I met so many men,
And it's like they're all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain!

Laughing like we wasn't happy
But not knowing that we growin' and we gettin' married

Touch niggas clutchin' what they know they bustin'
We can do whatever nigga, whenever nigga

Throw it up, put it down for the streets
Who wouldn't fall in love, with a life like this
Hittin' hoes that's priceless

Tired of hoes takin' offers, instead of orders

Cause in the late '60's this game was flawless
Until blow got on the rise
Them ol' Jacks was slingin' pies in bell bottoms and buttonflies

But now, pop yo collars, blow set for sag
And we still fly birds L-A-X to Lag
They roll caddies with white walls, we ride Benz with mags
Still the goal remains the same, guard from feds

I seen how pain can turn to trust within a

She can get a man to do anything but she's a

This sexy thing is only 17 and she's a

I admit I get a lot of love from women
It's only cause if I put that thug lovin' in them
It's hard as a mitten
Gotta hit the club and bang out
Song after song till I end up in the wrong route
Tank top, sweat it out
Where she's shakin' that ass shakin' that ass
And got her breast pressed to the glass
Strobe lights flashin'
That X is kickin' in
And I'm orderin' the chrissy open bottles of tin
On our stairway to heaven baby bring a friend
Putaya sayin', fuck in a stretch Benz
You know me I like it wet, rode slowly
By the way baby, how old is you codie
You lookin' a little young to me
And how many you had that girl on, two or three
It's a damn shame
But she could of had the world
And now she's nothing more than a

She start fucking niggas and learn to show 'em respect
They a father figure she honor love and protect
To your down ass bitch
One you could cuddle up and wile out with
We call it thug love
Hot sex and hard drugs was a thing of the past
But look here murder inc nigga bringin' it back
We got them stressed strung out beatin' to be hung out
Cry in their crib backs when they say why
Would I get involved with niggas
Involved with killers
Involved with dealers
Involved with niggas that make millions
She could of had it all Including the world
Now she's nothing more than a

She can't deny, she ain't livin' her life right
She got a man but her mans livin' his own life
With his wife and kids his crib and Bev Hills
The benz that only spins on them chroamy wheels
What has he done for you lately
Only remind you of when them times a little bit rider
A dick and he's crazy and will reminds us 
And then he hit you with that one last promise
You want it to be the truth so bad
You lookin' in his eye and your cryin', sayin' he ain't lyin'
But you know he is
But your a glutton for punishment
And you know pain is love
So what's wrong with sufferin'
The hard times have past, the good times are comin' (comin')
All over your chest baby that's how your lovin' it
And its sad cause you could of had the world
Now your nothin' but a

And don't leave him dead to realize, it's a fucked up world we live in

Niggas can you feel me?
'Cause in this world I'm alone, and trapped inside this body that's out of control
I'm hittin' these streets daily
Know when I got babies to feed rarely seein 'em rarely
This game inhaled me, and like Christ on the slate, nailed me
God, please don't fail me
But it's crazy to ask upon the Lord for help
When I got guns to bust and drugs to sell
I see you in hell, motherfuckers, I ain't bitter
'Cause I know snakes and snitches get it where they slither
My niggas, doin' life in the pen
This gotta be what y'all thinkin', shit

'Cause these hoes keep callin', they keep callin', they keep callin'

Will I make you cry baby
You know I lie, you can see it in my eyes baby
But the truth is when a woman's fed up
There ain't a damn thing you can do about love
What about us?
Why must our lawyers discuss
Who gets the kids, who gets the cribs and how we should both live
When I love ya, when we apart all I do is think of ya
But you think I'm fuckin' everything that's walkin'
Either skirt or the thong
It don't matter, 'cause in your eyes I'm dog, fuckin' 'em all
I got a woman that's gone and a passion for bitches
If you lose one the other becomes your religious
So what am I to do but get the wind behind me
Ground beneath me, make it hard for hoes to reach me
'Cause the Rule ain't easy
Babe, unless you're freakin' please believe

But the game keeps callin', it keeps callin', it keeps callin'

Will I think these niggas friends and they foes
'Cause in this rap game, you never know, just let it go
If my pain is love, my brain's on drugs
And may all my hoes thug on
And keep these punk niggas paralyzed, from the waist down
I got 'em face down is the equivalent of where I'm at now
Over the top of y'all niggas
Just a little quicker and smarter
Enhancin' the game makin' it harder
For niggas that freeze again like Braxton
I be hittin' niggas with thrillers like Mike Jackson
I'm a problem
Number one with a bullet, I keep it up in my gun
It's hollow so when I pull it it numbs
Your whole body
Give it or take a few seconds
You'll probably, be the same nigga to dick ride me
Never again would I close my eyes
And walk through the dark backwards blind

It keeps callin', it keeps callin', it keeps callin'

Never again

[Chorus]",Never Again
Ja Rule,"[Chorus:]
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why
Love don't love me
Is the only thing that seems to hold me
God can you explain why

I sit alone in my four cornered room staring at candles
Gettin' hot tryin' to handle, this hand that's been dealt to me
I don't need, especially in this world overwhelmed with greed
See we cut from a different tree
Why'all niggaz hope and I wish a nigga would fuck with inc
Went through the troubles and the struggle of hustlin' and runnin' (what)
So the ones that come behind don't' run through nothin'
They would fear no man but God and do a lot of frontin'
And I'm here to tell the world that pain is lovin'
Like when I die I hope it rains
'Cause if it does, that mean the Lord shared them niggaz pain
Here lie our man slain
And I would get out the game if I could
But I promised all my life to my kids I'd make good
Can't stand my father and love my momma
Still I try, god can you explain why

[Chorus:]

I live my life under pistol, 'cause lately love ain't been a issue
With who's gone miss you, when you dead and gone
Will my name live on? or will I be the last to die and breathe and eat
'Cause I need a little love and affection and baby
I live like every day was my last one
Dang, I've been living my life...(haha, yea)
Like I'm a leave this world unmarked, smiles combed to horror
For all them days when it rains
And it feels like thangs ain't gettin' no better for me
Nobody loves me, sometimes I wish god could come down and hug me
And wipe the tears from eyes
'Cause in my heart I know only the strong survive
And I die for my family, so they can live a better life
I try, god can you explain why

[Chorus:]

I'll sacrifice my life, fuck all the dumb shit
'Cause being black and broke's gettin' redundant
My grow to be a world leader like x and king
If I can live a longer than pac and big
What do (?) niggaz run red, you could tell by the lives we live
If it changes it'll be God's prediction, so pain inflicted, like Jane's Addiction
Live right like Christians, but dance with the death
It's like callin' stones a devil, the road is unlevel
Still I walk through the valleys of shadows of death gasping for air
Breathe in my last breath
My daughter told me first words, my son walked his first steps
And all through life we anticipate death
And if pain is truly love, for my family I die, god can you explain why

[Chorus:]",Pain Is Love
Ja Rule,"Here we go again, baby
Where is the pain?
Had to break free from all this motherfuckin'
Anxiety, strains on my life
Open my eyes and see: it's a big world out there
God can only shine his light on me

I'm crying, everyone's dead
My pain, my love
I'm crying, everyone's dead
My pain, my love",Pain Is Love (Skit)

So much pain

Uh, yeah, huh, yeah
All my, niggas.. so much pain
Uh, huh, yeah
Yeah, so, much

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my fo'-five
Cocked on these niggas time to die
Even as a lil' nigga, you could picture me hot gun in the rain
I shed the tear, cause this nigga here inherits the pain
And now I'm labeled as a thug nigga, you know the game
Smokin' weed, fuckin' hoes, slangin' things, that's the life I live
Even if I tried to go back I'd get lost (come back)
And everything I seem to love I done lost
Fuck the world if they can't understand me
What else could I do? I had to feed my fuckin family
Yo' lies is my truth, so I'm a drug to your youth
And you don't want 'em nowhere near me, now that they can hear me
I spits razors, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of tote-slangers and chalk lines
Why do we die at an early age?
Nigga so young, but still a victim of a twelve-gauge
Feel the rage this world has bestowed upon me
And I don't give a fuck 'cause they don't give a fuck 'bout me
So I keep, drinkin' Hennessy, bustin at my enemies
Will I live to see twenty-three? There's so much pain

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain

Years and years of strugglin' all my life
Runnin' wild as a kid, grew up blazin' 'em right
I'm in a, little cell I call my soul lately
It's been a, givin' me hell and my heart is screamin', ""Don't enter""
I've been cursed, for what it's worth I feel dead
Spittin' to you, I know I'm in way over my head
But Lord hear me, I believe in your ""7 Day Theory""
Three souls done sent this whole world teary (can you hear me?)
Too hot for you to stand near me
It's so much pain, and niggas wanna kill me
I'm tired of the stress and the strain
But my, grimiest grimeys got love for me
They're blazin', sendin' shotguns up above for me
My face in, Hennessy with no chaser
Coke rises on every way in, keep us hustlin' nigga
Me and my man got a plan to get this paper nigga
So if you owe nigga, look for the gauge to blow nigga
I figured I'd be considered a killer
Doin' crime excited my mind and leadin' the blind
I, can't express my compassion, my satisfaction
For gettin' fucked up and blastin', we all been there
Taught from young to shoot, show no fear and lie
And wipe the tears from yo' mother's eyes - so much pain

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

They got me mobbin' like I'm, loc'd and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckers if they test me
Trust, I got my glock cocked, playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a, passion
Better duck 'cause I ain't lookin' when I'm, blastin'
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy
And gettin' high on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why?
Cause the stress gettin' major
A buck-fifty 'cross the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real they can not see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets
And I be, ballin' loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckers 'til you buried
I was born to raise, hell, a nigga from the gutter, word to mother
I'm tough, I'm kicki'n dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean, until they kill me
I'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me

Surprised that they look in my eyes?

If I go crazy it's the same
I'ma blame it on the world for what I became

'Cause they gave me all the fame and the money name
The million icon so the world can catch a nigga wit his lights on

Like you're fallen off in a raw mosh pit
Get tossed in a ditch your coffin is sick
While I floss in the awesomest whips and I toss in your chicks

Cause your talk can get you crossed and lost in the mix

Your hips, those thighs I (love it when you call me baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu baby)

I, got a fetish for fuckin' you wit'cha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin' to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me
Cause every woman just wanna be happy
And it's crazy, but baby, I (love it when I'm wit'chu baby)

Girl your stare, those eyes I (love it when you look at me baby)
Your lips, your smile I (love it when you kiss me baby)
Your hips, those thighs I (love it when you call me baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu baby)

I wanna get away, cause you know like I know
And there's a better day, a-comin', I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin' half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin'
Like when we kissin' bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me baby

Girl your stare, those eyes I (love it when you look at me baby)
Your lips, your smile I (love it when you kiss me baby)
Your hips, those thighs I (love it when you call me baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu baby)

Shorty, are you really gettin' bored with me, or him?
Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
(But then again I'm still young and I'm livin' my life)
You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
(BABY, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thing
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin' different boy, stick to the plan
(You be my down ass, wit'cha round ass)
I know I'm feelin' you (like you feelin' me)
The way you're holdin' my body, the way you touch me

Girl your stare, those eyes I (love it when you look at me baby)
Your lips, your smile I (love it when you kiss me baby)
Your hips, those thighs I (love it when you call me baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu baby)

And when the sun, gon', shine
Fold up the mini-blinds, load up the lucky 9
And hit 'em up from behind
That's, my, life - and it'll never be the same

In the Ferrari hard top watchin ""Hard Rain""

No more love, baby boy I throw back slugs
through your Green Bay throwback, I hits that up
And let you know where the reign is from

Mix gin with a little cocaine, you got me

I take a look at my life, it's gettin' ugly
And now I know that you all want to slug me
I can get above it, it's my life and I dug it
Even though I live it close to the edge
I'm gettin' closer to death, with every little step
that I take, in the awake of my last days
I hope the sun shines with a light rain
That would mean the world shared my pain
And now the world could be happy again, smile
Cause if I ever walk ""The Green Mile""
You can look at me and blame it on my lifestyle
What can I say? I was raised as an only child, lonely
Poppa didn't show me, so the streets raised me
To call me crazy is not unheard of

If they would only re-alize
I'm a rock star bay-bayyyyy, hey hey
Only if they could live my life

Said a nigga was RAISED up in the streets (yea mama I'm a thug)
And nuttin is stoppin for me (except for myself)
Is the Lord in me? (You and everyone else)
God please shine down on me
I'm not the only nigga that prays every day for forgiveness
This life is makin me substance abusive
The media always wants the exclusive
Well here it is - FUCK 'EM ALL - baby cause they're useless
Sometimes I feel all I need is my music
It fuckin sets me free, and let me breathe
Cause my niggaz ain't leavin they blood on the streets
for they kids not to eat, and they kids not to eat
REVOLUTION! Pick a side and draw heats
And may the best man hold his head on these here streets
Cause in life and in music I'm poised and I'm focused
And the world should take notice

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
Underworld ties, is where my heart lies
They do the drama, makin songs like ""Ol' Blue Eyes""
that make the whole world sing..
It's alright if you don't understand me, it wasn't meant to be
Cause it's hard enough for me to fight for what I believe in
Than have to look in the mirror and see demons
Now everybody's talkin rhyme over reason
My only reason for rhymin is cause I bleed it
Here come the leeches; they gettin paid
off my talent, my love, my pain - am I a slave?
Bein cursed in my own brain
For this life I embrace and I praise
A nigga stuck in his ways
As the remix plays
Rule and J. Blige, ""Rainy Days""
I think about life and music and how to stay focused
And the world should take notice

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
Hey, this is a message to mankind
I bust clearly you shoot blind, not in my right mind
Lord if you love me please throw up a sign
And take a nigga off the path of destroyin his life, and
This life we're livin the sign of the times
Where buildings take on planes, babies born with AIDS
And we all need change
So I became a rock star bay-bayyy (rock on)
Now they all gon' hate me (hate on)
But from the bottom of my heart I pray
That in life and in music the world stays focused
And I hope you all notice

But you miss bein' next to me, don't you?
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you wanted
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere
or intervene on me
Peelin' your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freese, see it's on me
Shoes 19, comin' through in that new Bentley thing
From town to town and city to city
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy and Bob and Whitney
It appears the Lord sent me a down

Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's how to deal with it
On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent
Maybe I'm true generous
Generally believin' that all women want me
They don't want to get even
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God
Betrayal or trust, sustain your vows
Secretly or sacred
Cause I love it when you rock your body-body
Move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi
And roll up along side me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is that you need my heat
Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
Lovin', thuggin' and I know you

[Chorus]

And I know you're gettin' bored

Baby, here I'm holdin' your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless
Cause you been gettin' at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck them strays
Cause I been in a rage lately
Hopin' God'll forgive me for all the sin and all the woman
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginnin'
I hope your watching so you could see that nigga ain't built
like me!!
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love lookin' somethin' like soft porn
Tell me, baby, do you really want to go home to him??
But the brightest of your days just goin' look dim
Cause you fuckin' with a loser, baby, you can't win
When it's said and done you're gonna need me

Got a fasination wit for freak ho's 
New whips wit two seats and two do's 
I've been waitin so long to explode 
Now watch me cock back and unload 
Bullets goin threw the chest and out the back 
Shit is usually how the babry acts

It's just the way us niggaz live 
And I run wit real niggaz that run wit big guns 
That are designed to pop ya lid (Shit) 
Never met a real nigga I didn't like 
Never met a bitch nigga that I didn't fight 
Now niggaz gon get down, and a nigga gon lay down 
Dependin on how niggaz view life 
And you'll never look in my eyes 
And you'll never, ever smile

And you can't touch me 
But if you really want to fuck wit me

I ain't really into ballin and tossin my chips (uh huh)
Rather cop real estate then ride big whips
Rather trick on my wife and go real a dick or hips
Slick bitch that's strict man, she can't get shit
But she get trashed on the car hood by Hoodstock

Go 150 months, and come home gettin rich again
Nigga it's sicker than, I hope you listenin
Nigga we glistenin, pop off and leave you in the dead man position
Black Child is Murder, why'all forgettin
The work I put in, the dirt I done did
On this earth niggaz lives is worthless
Unless you worth a few million, school your children
Let the game get to 'em, then they brain get ruined
Mine speak foreign languages fluently
Hoodstock exchange ain't nothin new to me
Cop and go, set 'em shoppin up to Unity

Might taste it if it smells clean to me
Mama lean with me, holler and scream with me

I can't land it man with gun in hand
A hundred grand in escrow tryna expand
A million niggaz that brick, whole bricks to grams
Just leave with money, its seems like its Uncle Sam
So keep (hustlin) I done roll that comes from all the pain and the (strugglin)
(Look at here) federal agents (runnin in)
Come again, it must be mistaken identity
Like when Oswald took the rap for killin a Kennedy
We in the street, not industry niggaz

Cocked and let go!

Fuck all y'all motherfuckin' bitch ass niggas
I'm talkin' to whoever wanna be ridin' my dick
And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it
It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with
If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths
Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment 
To see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
Like when I come through with spinners on the six
And got bitches bouncin' like Ronnie in Tricks
But some whores in this game really don't make sense
Bomb roof and via Cal's and clonin Ems
But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs
A horror show, yeah picture this
Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again

Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos
Cause I don't love these hoes
I'm above and beyond everything that your seein'
And I'm the only real nigga left rappin this freakin'
If I could be one of the seasons, you'd call me summer
The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer
The bull just move like runners from city block to city block
Layin' down the foundation for what's really hot
Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)
I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)
My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art
And nobody can really tell the twins apart
I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria
I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya
My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia
Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads
So I push the Porsche high and truck to court
Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision
I feel like the nigga that triggerin' guns with mittens
It's hard to get done, I'm hearin' that security runs
Around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin' another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably
If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee
Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up
Snow cone the country leave no market untouched
Call me drugs if this is how they pushin' us rafters
But I don't do it cause I need it, I do it cause I want more
Definition is greed, I do it cause I want yours
And y'all niggas is teasin', y'all don't really want war
But if you really do, your gonna need a lot more

I thought I should warn these motherfuckers, there's a gun in this bitch
And I know he's got one on his hip
But I got the drop, and outside, rule got the drops
All it takes is a cock and a pop
Money for bail, ain't seeing no more sales
Instead, I'm poppin' on yahts
They told me j.prince runnin' the south
And I'm beast from the east, that'll come and put a gun in your mouth
I got bricks for days, dicks to make a bitch behave
Had to baldhead my shit threw, had to switch the waves
Just that quick, slip and the mac spit, bladdat
Four up in they chest and reload while they back flip
We in this together, bad weather, rippin' the storm
They some dictionary rappers, they just spittin' the norm
You supposed to know the la costra nostra flow
I did it, cause I lived it, you can quote the flow
Hit your six up with sixteen in sixty seconds
Get your whips up, we split beams, keep fifty weapons
To you coppers that's posin' a threat
Fire up the air, wholes in the tec
To put a hole in your neck
See I rep for the four forty but I'm about the five
Ride by, blazin' out the five, nigga I'm so cool
Bitches say, hizzy, you remind me of the old school
In the club posted, snatching hoes with no jewels

As the world turns, these bitch niggas is runnin'

I kept it ""Between Me And You""

'Cause that what real street niggaz do
""Put it on Me, cause even thugs get lonely
Sometimes ""I Cry"", fo' niggaz I'm a baptized
When will they realize I ""Live It Up""

Cop tha coke sell it and re' it up
I'm ""Always On Time"" got bitches ""Memsmerize""
From the ""Thug Lovin"" load the clip
Cock back the nine, open mouth shove it

Look in his eyes, and squeeze like fuck it
And just to think my niggaz do this shit for nuthin'
When my wild Rule' thuggins, lookin' to get a come up
Come on in and catch the angel that's all in

Call me Lord remis' my time, and I'll arrive with
Blood in my eyes

But never really get right, livin off of the hit I

""DMX"" was my dog, but now we just dog fight
Sucking on glass dicks, calling them crack pipes

And yo lady's dicked up, and you contracted to aids

Who the fuck you callin' gay nigga, must a been talk to
Em' and ""Dre"", nigga, pour out a little liqour
And rest in peace to ""Tupac Shakur"", cause you let us know
That Dre was a queer before

And ""Marshall"" how dare you use his name in vain
Son of a panther, you'll never understand his pain
But you do understand trailer parks and cocaine
Disrespcting your mother what fuckin part of

The game is that man , I guess this world need change
So we got it, and now I gotta put 'em in the grave

Yo, what up world, it's Rule public enemy number one
It's cool, my new best friend is my pistol
And anybody that want it or got jewels run it
And end over your head, don't make me gun butt it
Do you like Manolo, put two in your stomach
And flash the burner on bitches like stacks of hundreds
I'm livin' my life (my life), what gets better than ice in hell
When you cookin' up coke to sell
It be the little statistics, some pictures, some prints
Some informants to get the operation pitched
We enormous, some would say the ""Inc."" is ""Murderous""
You don't want us to strap up and bang the strip
But if need be, we'll bang out like Bloods and Crips
Styrofoam the noozles and extend the clips
Murder meets gangsta shit
And all my niggas that live it from hood to hood bang to this, nigga

The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether your Blood or cause we all gangsta
The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether it's dope or coke we all slang drugs

I'm the street's poster child
I'm supposed to wile
With the toast I'm foul
My Murder Inc. mob money, Oprah style
From here back to the block, they get that green
Known to put a hole through a nigga's shoulder soon as the beam glow
Probably graze you in the face, give me a break
I'ma rapper, out here to stay, don't make me do what I say
Just let me say what I do
Cause I'ma put it in a rhyme, every time, about to spray up your crew
And I ain't lickin' off shots to warn 'em
Just a pop swift to the dome, on the real ""G-Unit"" nigga, glock and all this
So believe I'm not the one when it get stupid in the booth
I told y'all with Rule it was a gun in this bitch
Now I expose how scary you niggas is
And when you want the bis
My brick city outlaws' a bury you niggas
I'm so cool, when I ain't doin' my numbers
Let the

Okay, motherfuckers when the bounce came to your waist
And shells get to droppin'
You better duck, and get up poppin'
Don't get left with the cops
Gangsta, yeah, put that work in
Put a nigga dick in the dirt
Lace shots to the face
Hopin' it shut case, John Doe
Unidentified, I always hit 'em high when I dump and let it fly
Now once with 45 nigga I had a picture on top of the coffin
Murder Inc. bosses

The life, the life (the life, the life)
Whether your Blood or cause we all gangsta
The life, the life (the life, the life)

Niggas don't want it with us, cause it's Murder

Okay you hard as fuck
But when the slug hit, you dead if your name ain't armored truck
Murder Inc., Outlawz and the Floys is here
Bang, bang, shoot 'em up, cowboys is near
Stampedin' anythin' in our way, we'll attract war
If your smart you'll slide over like handicap doors
I ain't a killer, I just spark a lot
So when I squeeze I'm turnin' your whole block to a parking lot
Understand I'm the grimy Floy
Wanna trip to death then try me for it
Crazy since '94, that's why cats don't hang around me like Chinese stores
One step ahead of you, get more guys
You strapped with four fours, we pack four fives
Fuck talk get the chalk out
You'll be lucky if your able to crawl or walk out

I'm in the pop life
So when I pop up in your life, and I pop twice
Get down, I spits more than rounds
And niggas bleed heavier than hoes on they period
This sound gotta movin' ""Faster Than Furious""
But nah I ain't Ludacris
I'm here to let y'all niggas know I ain't new to this
Gun butt your bitch
That's the way I get down, believe my style is Murder
Clap a nigga, dipped and hide the burner
The rule to learn ya bomb ya like embalming fluid
Until your limbs feel a loss of movement
In the hospital in critical livin'
Must minimal (who done it?) it's Murder
Yeah, that's subliminal
Who gets down and bangs with nothin' but criminals (c'mon, c'mon)

[Verse 1]
Guess who's back to personify money, power, and bitches
But when bitches been gettin money, that when shit get ridiculous
I'm hittin switches like six fo's, bouncin and leanin
The west coast seemin, keep the fo' fo' demon
And the rock is all stashed up
Roll up a little diesel, keep it hashed up
Then +Holla, Holla+ at the whores, is hollerin back
Let 'em know a few facts like if your ridin, your back's slidin
This is the 'Race Against Time' and I ain't got time to waste
To give chase, I put a hole in your fin
But your head to the barrel like DJ's is spinnin
Backward, to blow off the backwood, I'm so hood
But what's really hood, when you ain't doin your hood 
no motherfuckin good, and bein misunderstood
I would die if I could, Rule the lion
And I'ma keep ""ri-da-da-da-da-in""

[Chorus - 2X]
Race against time, I - can't stop
Runnin through the red light - livin my life
Even if I'm gettin too hot
Still I can't stop - ""Ri-da-da-da-din""

[Verse 2]
Bless the day that the God was born two, twenty-nine, seventy-six
This cocaine was heavily mixed
And all them niggaz had a fixation for bad reputation
For pimpin hoes, and shootin fo, to bring the free basin
If this is time erasin, the devil is runnin like Bettis
And got his guns out lookin for ways to behead us
You can die in a matter of seconds, so I'ma slow it down
Turn back the hands of time with the 40 Cal
Claimin your style is the realest, so I'ma define the meanin of murder, it's killer
You outta your mind, the burner's designed for the fill up
No gas, and when I spits like acid
smoke weed, but blow ether, spit ashes 
cause young Rule in his prime like 'Clay Cassius'
Hated by the masses, but overwhelmed with love and passion
For when I die niggaz keep ""ri-da-da-da-din""

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If Jesus Christ was criticized, then why not me
What the fuck am I special, I struck a deal with the devil
Haha, every kid a prophet, which one seem like its logic
Me in church, or me in bed with bitches managen
I can chase like sergeant, addictive like heroin
Outsiders just lookin in, through a barrel that's pinned to the peep hole
They seein all or nothin like Jazz from Clisco
Hit 'em up and let's go, jump over the threshold
I just got married to bangin pistol, drugs and other shit
Feel in love with a bitch that I call crime
She reminded me that nobody can beat time
If you get enough of it nigga
So I looked her dead in her eyes and pulled the trigger
Thinkin that the music we feel would be somethin different
But this the same old criminal vibin
I ain't hidin, I'ma keep ""ri-da-da-da-din""

Between me and you, we can find each other
flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin' to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed a n**** go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me
Cause every woman just want to be happy
And it's crazy, but BAY-BAY, I (love it when I'm witchu baby)

[Chorus]

I want to get away, cause you know like I know
And there's a better day, a-comin', I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin' half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin'
Like when we kissin', bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll, ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me baby

[Chorus]

Shorty, are you really gettin bored with me, or him?
Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
(But then again I'm still young and I'm livin my life)
You know you're right and I'm the type
to pull up to your bumper, get your bumper
(BABY, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin' different boy, stick to the plan
(You be my down a**, witcha round a**)
I know I'm feelin' you (like you feelin' me)
The way you're holdin' my body, the way you touch me

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x2]
I love when you touch me baby
All over my body baby
I love when you kiss me baby
All over my body baby

That you would fall in love with this side of me first

And now your heart broke and it's making it worse

Scared to look passion right in it's eyes

What the fuck is ya hobby mami highway robbery
'Cause you got enough jewelry on ya body to buy a Ferrari
I'm like Ruben I'm sorry but I don't studder
Matter fact call me Frank Love 'cause I'd love to fuck ya
She said slow baby don't rush
I promise if you be patient I'll let you tear it up
And nigga sho nuff
We decided to keep in touch with each other you feel me
I didn't know we'd be touching ??
I'm serious, and I'm so sincere
My object is to stay in the clear
'Cause we find fuck and flee these broads round here
I done made so many women shed so many tears
Sittin' home all alone getting drunk off of shots of Bathome
Decided to call let her feelings be known
In a slurred tone, she said I always get what I want
And what I want is you, but I don't get it cuz...

Girl our, situation is getting a little out of my hands
You calling me constant telling bitches that I'm ya man
I thought we was just friends conversating
Gettin' to know one another on a friendly basis
Lets face it we from two different worlds that don't collide
But when they do the crash is more like a biz-omb
Your favorite seasons bigati and mines is summer
You use credit I rubber band wrap my hundreds
What we got in common is minimal right next to nothin'
And I think that's what's subliminally keepin' you comin'
Back to the one you been fuckin' but never thought you'd be fuckin'
How often do you think about the awkwardness of it
I know you love it to say the least
And I ain't just sayin' that contrary to some beliefs opposites attract
And my track record is something to be expected
Money cash hoes you know how it goes

(I never thought)
That you would fall in love with this side of me first

Why, who would've thought

Who would have thought that something so simple would turn out to be detrimental
Now I'm feeling like I'm caught in the middle
Of this love triangle between she me and reality
Reality is tellin' us that we could never be
'Cause I come from the streets and you come from a rich family
But I don't think that your family would understand me
It's the little things you overlook when you're around me
Drugs guns bitches and needless to say
You're a pimp in your own way
Baby you're makin' it hard for me to look in your eyes and tell you to move on
I'm gone (I'm gone)
But then I'm back again
Money and good pussy's a fatal attraction for men
She hits me every night quarter past ten
And with every call her voice got a little more intense
Now we involved and it really don't make no sense
So be careful what you ask for you just might get it biaaatch!

Nobodys livin life the way that I live it
Nobodys spittin and doin it, I spit it
But who fuckin admitted
I'm one of the bigger biggest of niggaz that done did it
Been hated and delt wit it, when agents tap in my lyrics
So by the time that they hear it, the crime's already committed
Natural Born Killa, but that I'm already and then
Murdah was the case, but I-N-see's been acquitted
The Agency's gettin livid, They wanted us to be finished
But we got unfinished business, Sned God as my witness
This is another testimony to my life and my story
Askin you hoes, Why should I talk when I got guns to speak for me
don't come at me homie, Especially tryin to act like you know me
Only if you can control me, Know where you been chosen befor me
To sit in ya grave, homie dig it, I'm hearin its lonely, But see
Nobody...Does it...Like Me! And they know it they can't spit it the same
But still they try, 'cause that's part of the game, WHUTS MY NAME?!

These niggaz incredible, throughout the ghettos of America
People, see these window I see through
Off they mirror they evil, jealous bullshit that men do
Had I known it was you, there'd be no clue on who done killed you
Like when Kane murdahd Able, Niggaz must have been able
To put caine through they nasals, They so high they see angels
I see life from all angels, tangled, webs and weaves
Now niggaz is able to kill like Kane all over the streets
100 degrees Ferenheite, hot as the hottest summer night
Heatin up desperatly in the need of some ice, I'm nice
Nobodys quite like, flow like rare blood types
I be wrong if I'm right, right if I'm wrong, I was the RULE born
When my legacy is left through my boys maiden name live on RULE
Niggaz is foolish tryin to do whut I do, 'cause see
Nobody...Does it...Like me! And they know it they can't do it the same
But still they try, 'cause that's part of the game WHUT MY NAME?!

Yeah, yeah, yo
I got a knack for pushin crack, and cookin raw coke
Fresh off the boat, no vest but I tote, and wear it like a coat
I'm starin through the scope, with one eye open and one shut
Zero in on the target, spark him and watch his head bust
Ain't s*** to discuss, unless it's moneybags
or the SK-8, drop Jag with funny tags
Homey laugh now but die later when the lead dump
And double barrel slugs like Elmer Fudd, I'm handsome

Some of your favorite rappers is flamin, I'm bangin things at them
They claim they gangster, lettin mens give brains to them
I aim the stainless, let the games begin
Bang bang dangerous, my gun gang famous

Get removed n****, my wolves is playin hardball
Leavin him bloody like a Pelican Bay yard brawl

And the flyest crews goin the fastest
Pull up to the hottest club in New York, with my hazards on
No tags, I just drove it off the showroom floor
Straight cash, bout my paper, I'm on my gangster
Doin this s*** for ten years, n****z I'm major
Maybach and all that, same behaviour
Money over b****es, b****es over strangers

I get in and get a table, get bottles, some bitches
Come over, they claimin they models
Until they want a drink they ain't even know who I was
Until I took my hat off, and then they started backin that ass up
Whoa! She did this dance with her hands up
Then she touched her toes and made my thing stand up
Type of chick that'll have a nigga in handcuffs
Taste but don't swallow, look but don't touch
Forbidden, not to be eaten, but she is
Feedin me rotten apples that fall from the tree
Why don't we leave, just us three, and get acquainted
Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin

Caught the last flight in from JFK
Baggage claim sign read are-you-L-E
Takin me straight to the party so I can get started
Rubbin on bitches like full body massages
And takin dead aim on all open targets
Soon as I walk in I see the one
That I want to be humpin, bouncin, and grindin on
Her lowrider sit low, you can see her thong
And she like to get low on her favorite songs
I'm like don't stop, get it get it, let me get up on it
Let me see how bad you really want it
Like, them cold nights when you're hot and lonely
Give me your pager, pick up a phone and call me
I was thinkin that maybe we could have an orgy
Mama I'm just playin - but I'm sayin

Filled with fast women when they stop intervene
Tanned up and their walk is mean
I don't wonder how she got in, I want her out of them jeans
It seems, me and my team got a routine habit
Of gettin rid of sweaters as soon as we snag 'em
In the club, gettin high, relaxin
I see a few asses that's pacin backwards my way
The DJ spinnin it backwards
Givin shouts to actors, athletes and rappers
Now, let's get it crackin, you know how it happen
After the party there's an afterparty happenin
(Let's get this party started)
Ain't that what you said, or am I hearin things?

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You talk too much s***
You know n****z always talkin bout b****es ain't s***
Money over b****es
But give all our money to the b****es any f***in way
(I love my b****) So I'ma send some love out
to the b****es, holla

[Verse One]
S***, here's somethin to remember
When we met that day in September
But, you've been gone since November
Had to finish out yo' last college semester
Her major - brokerage investor
She probably go broke tryin to invest her
time and money in somethin that she call love
Cause, she love f***in with thug n****z
That always get high and had to be drug dealers
Eventually, she hooked up with some hood b****es
The hood b****es turned her on to strippin
Now the, gettin is good and it's well understood
That money on the wood can make things get harder
Be glad I'm not a pimp, if I was I'd charge ya
But for all that you go through, just thought I'd let you know
Hoes need love too, I'm f***in witchu

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
N****z need to read the man-you-al
To separate your housewife from a hoe
Cause there's no rules to this s*** here
Am I makin myself clear?
What she don't know won't hurt her why'all
So keep big pimpin on the low
Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too

[Verse Two]
You know what they say right? B****es ain't s***
And all men are dogs cause we just want to f***
Sundown to sun up, one up on a hoe
I might go down on the low, that's just me though
From L-A-X to Heathrow, I'm one of them n****z
that really doesn't need no, introduction
When I met her she was ""Girl, Interrupted""
Grew up became a woman not to be trusted
Frustrated and flustered, living amongst
these thieves hoes and hustlers, I'm diggin what's next
She had a studio apartment in the projects
With her and her girl from D.C. used to bus checks
And hold the coke, her n****z ain't sold yet
In hopes the copes don't know about all this
Shiiiiit, for all that you go through
Just want to let you know, hoes need love too

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Fake nails, fake breasts, fake eyes too
It's oh-four, and that's kinda what we used to
But you don't holla back like you used to, but I ain't mad at cha
I'm happy for a b****, even if I can't have her
I remember when you was down in Atlanta
Workin gentlemen's clubs and you didn't even know what a gentlemen was
Forty to love and I want to serve
That body like Serena's with less curves
But actions speak louder than words, and you gettin your money
Mami every month, 15th and 1st
S*** could be worse, you could be in the struggle
Or born with no a** and have nothin to hustle
Go on flex your muscle, cause that ain't the case is it?
Go on get your paper keep flossin on these b****es
Cause for all that you go through
Just thought I'd let you know, hoes need love too, I'm f***in witchu

Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound

I might get my Brooklyn n****z to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about

Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin out with them old rifles
Just doin s*** for nothin, it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that n****z want to murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not c***y, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

Ja Rule,"[Chorus:]
Nobody loves me
Sometimes the world can seem so cold
Looking through the windows of my soul
I see, the true fan now I know (I know, I know, I know)
Why'all gotta love me
When the weight of the world was on my shoulders
You were there
When it got heavy, I held it
You were there
The ones that stood by me like soldiers
You were there

I know you love me

But I'm still waiting for the Lord to come hug me
Send a sign or somethin'
This is all for nothin'
The talent and passion of mine
I'm sick of sufferin'
I know your plans is greater than mine
So I'm asking
Why do you want me dead or alive
And how could you let the people see me through the enemy's eyes
Like, jealousy, envy, Feds want to convict Gotti
I'm thinking probably we was gettin' too much money
Too many niggaz in whips sittin' on twenties
Too much connections to the streets, why'all niggaz doin' somethin'
And after overall assumptions, or it's all or nothin'
Ain't nothin' stopping the second coming, except the coffin
I may be encased, but even from there I still touch 'em
Niggaz ??, that's why we still hustle
For all my niggaz that can't be here
For every tear, send my a prayer, I swear

[Chorus:]

But what's love, when your friends become enemies
Your nightmares are no longer your worst dreams
And as bad as everything seems
Keep hustling
We gon' get it by any means
How unfortunate, January the sixth
Federal officers, raided our offices
Making it hard for us to eat, and breathe, and live
And they swear they got niggaz asking for relief
They've been handin' down indictments for about a year
And they send nobody to jail yet, we still in the clear
And the Bible that said, ""Thou shall not fear no man but God""
Whoever said that, ain't never faced the law
And why all this fake ?? going on
I'm fighting niggaz, swingin' back against the wall
That's for my niggaz that can't be here
For every tear, send my a prayer, I swear

[Chorus:]

How could you hate me, why would the Lord forsake me
Put the weight of the world on my shoulders
I thinkin' I could brush it off and nobody notice
Keep raisin' my kids: Britney, Jeffry, and Jordan
Keep coppin' new whips: Bentleys, Benzes, and Porsches
My niggaz, and my fans is the only thing of importance
It's crazy how the world turns
Sometimes, you gotta light up and let it burn
Sweep up your ashes, put 'em up in a urn
On a mantle from memories
I hear you callin' me, Lord knows you love me
The passion of Rule is so real, just lend me your ear
You'll feel what I feel, you'll tear when I tear
The vision's real clear, just look in my eyes
I believe in putting my life in the hands of God
For all my niggaz that can't be here
For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear

When my legacy is left through my boys maiden name live on RULE

It's the same egospiritual, we thuggin in harmony
They say death brings life, there exchange no robbery
If I'm wrong pardon me, me I'm just tired of poverty
Why them n****z in the hood never hit the lottery

Unless they go lottery, first round in the draft
First we dustin off the rounds and we slip in the mag'
Then we slip on the masks, and go out and mash
And we call it feeding our family

Y'all call it a tragedy, Damn

While they shed they joke and laugh puttin a choke round us

Can I get a moment of SILENCE
'Cause they claimin it's the n****z that's causin all the violence
What bout the ones that protect to serve our honor
Poppin the blue colla', with shots soon to follow

The ghettos in horror, cause in this boy shot went back
And now the neighborhood hot and he can't move the crack
When it's all about the dollars
And he'll individually get murdered cause money is power

But then these snitch's get to talking and it's colder than ours
Cuffed and crimed on the bus heading straight to the Island
He was only 13, but tried us in the dope and as high as the coast
'Cause ain't no more children in the ghetto where I'm from

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
We ain't all killers in prison
Matter fact that's a stereo typical thought of livin
'Cause they don't know about the hood and them love in it
Summer time top down with the wood finish

Pushin hard uptown windows slightly tinted
Back to back Benz and jeeps, blowin weed with my n****z
On our way to a house party, gonna f*** with some b****s
Let's get some liquor for shorty who said she make us some chicken

And if we get 'em drunk enough we probably could freak em, and do it every other weekend
If I don't have to kill n****z, I never would leave the ghetto
I'm like an angel that put on a halo, cradle the grave of my n****z that we
Lost in the ghetto

'Cause where I'm from in the ghetto we rock white tee's and nike's
Roll 3 dice and name our dope ice cream
Set trends and ya'll follow our lead
But in New Yitti n****z follow they dreams, where I'm from

[Chorus]

Now I lay me down and sleep
And I pray to the Lord, for my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take (Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take)

[Repeat Chorus]",Where I'm From
Ja Rule,"Always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Come on and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Sprawled out on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus]

Girl, get a grip, come on, pull it together
It's only a sun shower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B	
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share, somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus]

Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

[Chorus]

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my baby be mine

Here at W-I-Z we play nothing but the hits, nothing but the hits
Nothing but the muthafuckin hits",Always on Time (Explicit Album Version)
Ja Rule,"[Chorus]
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

Want to keep you flawed with no dough
Pimpin' ain't easy
Trust me I know
When gangstas and hos
Go go go go go go together
Like chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, chedda and glamorous things
Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
Cause this is how I'm livin' and why'all women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness
Cause I want the p-you-s-s-why
Got a lotta n****z wonderin it ain't just I
Gotta keep ya cash comin and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
S***, she probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and irv and jeffrey quite icy
Sip seraphin
Who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-n-see

[Chorus]

[R KELLY]
How many girls does it take to get to
Mack status
Player status
Pimps that get
Ya boy half rich fore we hit show biz
But show biz brought next level chicks
Pull them in them hot cars go and buy the whole bar n****
I came from the dirt what you want me to say
I'm at the top of the world and lifes a p**** buffet
And that's why I get m-I-a
Shut the game down so the bustas can't play
Hell yeah I splurge money
Hell yeah I act funny
Look at you like f*** you
All the s*** I been through
It's a wonder why I'm still here
Said I was gone but I'm still here
And all you b****es that left me here
Its mighty strange how you right back here

[Chorus]

[JA RULE]
I wonder why love is about money
And why wou want to take it all from me
Honey
My life is dark but its lovely
Crimes cars cribs ain't that right kelly?
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Why'all b****es don't know
Money ain't a thang
Mami need a lil change
Girl I'm pitchin quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New benzes new porsches
New cases new lawyers
I'm becoming the infamous notorious rule
N****z couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
N****z don't possess the heart that I do
And it's a wonder that I'm still here
Thought I was gone but I'm still here
And all you b****es that left me here
Its kinda funny how you right back there

Oh oh oh oh ohhhhh
Oh oh oh oh",Wonderful (Instrumental)
Ja Rule,"In case you don't know the call me Loc, short for L O K I
I'm speck for rule saying his last goodbye
This is Exodus, this been a hell of a ride
From Vinni Venni Vicci to Blood In His Eye

In the next plan in time I've seen the rock split
In the ride it?s as rough as the ride gets
And you know that they all want to murder The Inc
But they can't kill us and now we got to finish these niggaz

And if finish it means murder
(Murder, murder, murder)
([Unverified])
So be it

Last that I recall, they tried to murder the God mimic my style
Then leave them in memory of
But smile, some memories lost, the new identity was born
And no, this ain't a movie, dog
This is murder
(Murder, murder, murder)
And you need a second for me

Yo Gotti, I make the hits, you just give me the nod
But the air play the gun, play from New York to L.A.
The S.K's will make these niggaz spin like Pirelli's
We had some good years but I'm tired and ya niggaz despierin'

And trying to put the dalce to the fire, it?s like an episode of the wire
The only difference is the vengeance is taking us in real life
Now, everybody wanna look at us and think twice
And point there fucking fingers like damn the bad guys

why?all nigga?s don't know, we them niggaz, man
Murder INC we done bin through it all done n seen it all
There ain't nothin' you can tell me, nigga
I just wanna let y'all know man I've been through so many things

N if it wasn't for the way I live life
Would a nigga pray every night to Christ?
Jesus I'm just asking
'Coz my prayers never seem to get answered

Ma mama didn't raise no bastard
I was born with the talent you can't touch
I call magic, you call it music once it get remastered
I got with Gotti started makin' classics

It?s murder, it?s the courses of traffic
Trust was my only niggaz force of habit
At the time in the game everything was average
Pac catches die, big catches die
And my nigga had a plan to keep Def Jam alive

First he sign D then he sign me
Then he introduced Jay and the rest is history
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the misery
Reminiscin' the Spike Lee them was the school days
We graduated with A's

But these niggaz make you wanna bring out the are's and AK's
And till they back up 'coz that what they gave us
When they read the vendikas and various papers
But no heart, no foul y'all, niggaz is funny style anyway
Now, we go hard shit till the edge

that's a good question though, see I don't understand
Why they would think what they thinking about
It's just not the case though I love my niggaz that's all I'm guilty of
And that all that I ever was guilty of is the love for my niggaz

It's all good though I ain't stressing that shit man
Sometimes God has to put you through things
That bring out the best, very in who you are nigga

Sam said it to me, he said, ""Sometimes greatness
Is not what you accomplish, it's what you overcome""
Still breathin', feel me?
",Exodus (Intro)
Ja Rule,"My nigga Buck 3000 over here, you know, 
My nigga Gotti, the Princess, Momma, what's up baby? ha ha, 
Brooklyn son, what up what up? 
My nigga Lloyd, my nigga Caddy, my nigga C. Gotti, 
My nigga Young Merc, my nigga Blackchild (Exodus), 
My nigga Cool Joe, this is a new beginning, 
You know, I see everybody in the building, my nigga L, 
My nigga Gab, my whole Murder Inc. mob, 
Yo, you know how we do, yo, yo all my niggas

This here is exodus! Say goodnight to the legend,
Cause lord knows the world gon' miss him,
Universal the system is similar to institutionalism,
And I just did 7 years in prison.
Now I'm a free parolee and time spent, its money they owe me
Give me my space don't crowd me homie
I'm a motherfuckin' hustler.
Pushin' rhymes like weight, but sometimes its slow,
It's up and down like the Dow Jones, shit fluctuates 
But my real niggas still keep their stock in me,
Feds investigate, the monopoly,
Preme team, Murder fuckin' I-N-C, there's no stopping we from
(EXODUS)

You know what I think, I think the world doesn't have a clue, 
On what its like to be a, a superstar in the spotlight, 
And and, everybody is lookin' at you and everybody's, 
You know, scrutinizing you and they got their lil opinions and shit. 
I came in this game, you know and got in this music business to do what I do, 
To make music for the people to enjoy, for the world to love, 
You know, and and somehow I became a motherfuckin' criminal ha ha

Yo, damn I remember when it was on UPN News
And I refused to start losin' and hopped in my WHO
Got a recruit from this (nice?) and peeled back the WHO
Niggas listen in I'll tell you how it all began (gun shots)
That's how it sounded when I-N-C came into the game
On 10th of murder then them, them,
Well we, we, we, cause these boys is hot
These boys got glocks, these boys send shots do you know what its like, 
To live your life hard knock?
I think not that's why you live it safe through mine
I think plot then kill, you think suein' them blind
You think life's a bitch? I think the bitch is mine!
We'll never see eye to eye, y'all corporate, we gangsters
And niggas tryin' my patience is gettin' me anxious,
To speak for my defendants, that say that they plaintive
Guess we guilty by song, but yo the government must be on
(Exodus)


I mean to think that we would jeopardize everything that we built, 
To motherfuckin', sell drugs and launder money? 
I mean are you fuckin' serious!? 
You understand, I-I mean, we-we're a company you understand, 
A-a-a record company, that wants to show love to every nigga that cant get love, 
That cant receive love, from, from motherfuckin', 
The corporate world, that cant go get a job, 
Cause they been in jail, they did a 3 to 9, a motherfuckin', 
A bit or whatever the case may be they did for their time. 
We give these motherfuckers the opportunity, we give them jobs, 
Cause y'all ain't gonna give 'em the jobs, so we give it to 'em. 
And motherfuckers wanna look at us and down us for what we do for that! 
They wanna call us motherfuckin' criminals and crime family for that! 
Well if they wanna call us criminals and crime families, 
Then so be it motherfucker! Cause these is my niggas 
And if nobody's gonna stand up for my motherfuckin' niggas, 
Then we gon' do it ourselves, we goin' police ourselves, 
That's how we been getting down nigga, holla back at me, Rule. Exodus!",Exodus (Outro)
Ja Rule,"Do you love me, do you hate me
Do you love me, do you hate me
Do you love me, do you hate me
Yeah, yeah

This world loves me, this world loves me not
I'm torn between the best of both cus I'm hot
In this game so brittely, literaly
I got niggas wanna riddle me, get rid of me
R-U-L-E, need I say more?
World, hope y'all prepared for the chaos
Cause y'all want the beast in me, so I'ma give it
Paint pictures vivid, live high as a spirit
Y'all can all jump in it
That's what you might as well do
If you gonna live life timid
And I ain't never been intimidated
Believe me, and I don't wanna fuckin' breath easy
I wanna make it hard for these niggas
So when they can't stand me
I'ma make it so these niggas can't feed they family
Now do you love me, or do you hate me?
C'mon and get me, I keep it off safety

[Chorus]
Do you love me
Do you hate me
Ready or not
Here I come

There's nothin' but love spread between me and my niggas
We bust guns together and fuck so many bitches
But I know that Hell is callin'
In the name of the lord just let a nigga in
Cause I ain't done nothin' wrong, but love thy self
And harm other niggas that wanna stop my health
Is that healthy?
Cause love'll never be hand over hand
It's man versus man
It's Murda
If I'm gonna be hated or to be loved
I prefer ta live wild and die from slugs
What you want from me?
Lord I'm only a human
Tho I bear your name, I'm a devil in chains
Release me, cause Lord only knows it ain't easy
When I'm scarred for life, I know that he sees me
Now do you love me nigga
Or do you hate me nigga
C'mon and get me
I'm waiting nigga

[Chorus: x2]

Y'all just wanna watch me rise, then watch me fall
Before it's all done I'ma die from it all
I might OD in a club off drugs like River Phoenix
Or get shot down like BIG and Pac for my genius
I know this worlds seen it before, and here I come
I know y'all fiendin' for more, and I'm not done
As long as I can run through current like state times
Keep up a sane mind, and hand on my iron, I'ma blast off mine
Look in the eyes of a nigga who seldomely cries
I got a beautiful wife and kids, why me?
Y'all cats choose cash and cribs, why me?
If this good livin' Lord, why me?
When I live so dirty yet I'm worthy to be
Number one, the world's only begotten son
Here I come

Do you hate me?
Do you love me?
Do you hate me?
Here

Come",Love Me Hate Me
Ja Rule,"I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me

[Chorus]
How dare these niggas try to fuckin' hate on me
Come out and make records sound just like me
But nobody does this here quite like me
Now let me tell a little something 'bout me
Pops tags, things fresh to death like me
Who pulls more whips out the stash than me
Y'all bitches wanna ride, c'mon it's on me
I guess it's my time, all eyes is on me

Man everybody wanna rhyme like Rule, sing like Rule
Talk some shit to get they name on the news
Papers, haters never pay they dues
Always got their feet in somebody shoes
Walk with me, or ride this old Bentley
With the rims you can sit in
Or the Enso with them TV's that's hidden
I stay in menages with various women
Huh, I'm just kiddin' that's not how I'm livin'
The realest, the nigga in the realest state
I got real estates in different states, go figure
Cause I ain't singing you'se a ""Gold Digger""
But bitches, ""you ain't fuckin' with no broke niggas""
That's why I ride, ain't you see I put you on the CLS
We on the point your voice sound like sex, yes
There's no real way to stop me, that's why y'all copy
I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me

[Chorus]

Yea, I know, one more gin, bitch you better come on in
Relax a while, sip on hypno and henn
I like your style, you're so old school
In them Sasson Vidals, fifty four eleven
Reebok classics Remind me of '87 when
Niggas was playing with blocks like little kids and
Even though we men we still big wheelin'
Still cop cribs, six beds, four baths, high ceilings
All of the art of drug-dealin' cause every mil
Is two for me, when it's all tax-free
Pray for God's children, all except for me
I'mma walk in the path the Lord has paved for me
One foot at a time, niggas follow my footsteps
Put the world on my shoulders, leave one set of footprints
Man, y'all motherfuckers can't stop me, that's why y'all copy
I know you niggas ain't fuckin' with me

[Chorus]

I know what a nigga that do right, can't do no wrong
And everything's alright, till everythin' goes wrong
No part to piss in, no shoulder to cry on
You get to thinkin' why can't we let by-gones be by-gones
Rule the icon, who killed the industry like iPods
Had these niggas runnin' like track stars
Except runnin' backwards when I sit back rollin' the backwoods
Loadin' my trey-deuce for them niggas that act hood
Ridin' my six-deuce uptown, I'm so hood
Bitches love the coupes when them doors swing upwards
Money long, I'm putting from the green like T-Woods
Hard white is not to be confused with white good
White gold should never be perceived as platinum
And cubic-zirconium never gon' shine like diamonds
Cause, no matter how hard they copy, they still not me
Y'all bitch niggas ain't fuckin' with me

To all my bitches that be givin it up, ah
C'mon

Baby, this ain't your typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, I'ma fuck you tonight thing
Fuck, knowin your name, jump yo' ass in the Range
And roll over, gettin blown while blowin the doja
Bring head to a closure - that's a good bitch
Before it's all over, I'ma meat this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, mo' betta
Cause if you ain't - know, gangstas and hoes go together
Poppin my collar potnah - who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot; and the mug and the watch ugly
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky; you think I got time
to fuck all these hoes and do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama chargin white Rolls
Uhh-oh, another episode

And I ain't mad at'cha; never leave you alone
Cause we fucks when I'm home, phone sex when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus I freaks off like O-Dog in ""Love Jones""
Been in, many zones, baby one hoes, two hoes
From, prissy bitches to hoes that do porno
But you know, the Rule be livin it up
And got all these hoes, givin it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, then I'll open it up
On the freeway, dick in her mouth, foot on the clutch

Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

See'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein' me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fuckin' you all wild
But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus]

Girl, get a grip, see'mon, pull it together
It's only a sun shower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-be	
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-see
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently' fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share somethin' so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus]

Oh I'm, feelin' like ya livin' a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin' home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin' for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti] But who cares, you care

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

While you thinka think I'ma hit it up
Then look at the nigga you thinkin' you love c'mon love

We could go there me and you creep off all night
If you love it, in the mornin' awake with new light
If you lookin' like I ain't gonna handle his

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Why'all niggas is pussy, poonani, (Vagina)
Your (Monologue's) getting tired, now it's time to ride
You're print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane
Let east coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin' at the speed of sound
Tryin' to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin' their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out
Leavin 'em laid out, dead, in just a sport
Cause we ain't playin' up here in New York

Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find god
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringin' the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to (Lean Back)
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin' them Howard niggas, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the x is where the team be at

I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doin' shit for nothin', it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas want to murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

Your 6 with wide-screen TVs, in the head

Can't do that, love's like a tug-a-war match
You can't win, you fall in, get too attached

You wanna be where I'm at, feelin' me without climax
Nails diggin' in my back, head board outta wack
What you love about Ja is what caught your eye
Painful lies and sweet goodbyes, baby, why?

Damn, I should've never let you walk right out of my life
I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

I fell in love with you, see, like they do in movies
You were the generous type, you brought me things I didn't need
Promised to take care of me but then I pushed you to leave, yeah, yeah
Money don't make the man, I understand, since I let you go

Let you be my man just for your doe

I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

It's wrong for me to think this but I could have handled it
Me playin' you for a fool, frontin', so romantic
Just to get my wishes granted, I should've did what I had to do, oh
Now when I think it through, I could've been to you a real good girl

It didn't mean that this is your world, yeah, yeah, yeah
To satisfy all my needs I could've pleased you a little bit more

Should've been, could've been, would've been
But these thoughts I just ignored, oh

I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side

Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

I should've treated you right, I should've been by your side
But damn, I slept and let you catch somebody's eye
Now I can't even lie, it's killin' me inside

You don't even wanna talk to me, you don't wanna be with me anymore
You don't even wanna call at all, but you come around tryin' to hit me off
You don't wanna go out with me, I can't stand to see you outta line
But it's really killin’ me, you're not feelin’ me, I wish you were mine but

And the singles and the fives went to the bitches
Dubs is for wifin' in the club, no mention
But you know who you are, nigga stop flinchin'
Stop cuffin'; you may not think that it's a bitch
but life's a hoe and everybody's been fuckin'!
See that's what I believe in
With n o logic, no need for experience
To fuck the world would be a lifetime achievement
You make it cum then e'rybody jump on the dick
Y'all niggaz full of shit, that's why you fuckin' assholes
And never smell the shit stinkin' 'til you get shitted on
Fuck 'em all, not for nothin'

But this was the day after Tuesday, hump day
So I became receptive to the rule
Got cocktails for two, it was only me and you
Probably like a hangover
Had a fuck and get drunk and call my ex over
She will remain sober
But have you ever seen a bitch with her clothes on
Turn the lights off
Lit up some candles
She was the oj, I was the Smirnoff
Cancel, it's like the show's over
House lights off, everybody go home
Cause too much of petroleum might kill you

It's summertime, still got class
Still the best shot a nigga ever do that
It's time to get me drunk fast
Come on ship me down, butterfly effect
You so fly, I'm so high, so high
I can't lie no matter how bad I want you

And the diagnose is just something I could live with

To be in the deepest of waters, to feel like I’m snorkeling
Off shore and this so reassuring
That I’m still sick, in need of a donor

Am I drowning?

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world (they fought me)

Daddy’s here to deliver, the world is cold
So them tears you can tie them up
Just don’t wanna let ‘em running down your face
Baby the world is frozen
I told her if she shared it with me then it’d be ours
Like anything you maw
How can you give and drown?
Under water I can’t hear a sound but I
See the rain dropping like tears from God am I
Mother’s telling me that it’s a sign of wealth
When I don’t think the Lord is too fond of her
But there’s gotta be a reason
I’m not drowning, right?

Ja Rule,"Love thy hater
You know they say everything we hear is an opinion not fact
And everything we see is perspective not truth
The fewer the facts the stronger the opinions
And opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance, bitch

I’m hoping in heaven got a ghetto
So when I get there I can tell you to smile whole hearted
I’m back where I started
I’m prisoner of my own success
But hardly caring enough to know that I’m dead without it
No cribs, no cars, no champagne
No bright lights, no bitches, no big stage
But f-ck it I’m in a better place
And I’m talking in third person in case you couldn’t relate
Diary of a monster
Sometimes my mind fades to a place not even I can explain
'Cause there's a thin line between genius and insane
Guess which one I am, I think it’s obvious that

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

Yeah, And I say that to say this
Man if life is a bitch I’m gon fuck her then tell her that I love her
Not beneath her or above her but inside no rubber
That's my interpretation of mutherfucker
No lie, no truth my life is a little bit of both
Who’s who, who knows anymore
My choice is to get it in real moist so I can come hard
And the world is ours, better yet bitch mines
Shot at the moon just to be among stars
Then God alienated it and ended up on mars
Serenity understand it extraterrestrial that I is
Think I do it all because it’s obvious

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

Yeah, uh huh
Let me, I’m seeing my whole life ahead of me
And I’m feeling like this life can never be (naaah)
'Cause a nigga on a whole nother pedigree
I’m so far from home it feels like a million miles
And I’m long gone and ain’t no coming back
But really I never left
I’ve been silent yet at my the best
Ya’ll haters spread hatred like ?
And I still find ways to make crochet hearts
Like Kanye my 808?s is heartbreakers
Maybe me singing to your heats a mistake
Nah, Maybe I’m just before my time
Or maybe it’s just that obvious

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

Jacintha,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Jacintha,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

And the nights on Miami sidewalks
The booze and music driftin' from the barroom doors
A nickel and a dime the chili was cheap then we gotta worry about a place to sleep
Tried to get five on our rings but the man said four
Looking back on Miami sidewalks
Cryin' on each other's shoulder havin' them a hearty heart talks
Somebody must've been lookin' down from up above
Cause if we had anything goin' at all it must've been love

Night and day you'd never left my side
Now the shadows of the leaves on the grass beneath the trees
Are the only things that move across the lawn
As I stand here all alone and read the words upon the stone
I begin to realize you're really gone
Don't think it's just your troubled mind if suddenly you find
That's something brushed away the bitter tears you've cried
If you feel something touch your face and disappear without a trace
And leave a warm familiar feeling by your side
It's not the shadows of the leaves in the early autumn breeze
As they blow along the grass that's summer dried

Jack Bruce,"Pieces of mind
See how they ran
Prizes of sun
Still to be won
When the life is made of straw
Waves that pound against the door
Leave me at the place of throw it away throw it away 
Leave it today
Keep me dancing stop me grasping
Clouds that turn the dust on touching
Times I'm so far from what I want 

So much the same
Living in games
Pieces of cake
Until they break apart
The say the plane that comes to pass never rhymes
Now it burns on grass too steep to climb 

Best of friends
Until the flowers end
Mines have taken their place
Darkness in their face
Now the golden coach is here
Can you cure me of the fear
Should I move into the clear
Find a time in which I throw it away get out today 

Keep me singing stop me clutching
Rooms that turn to dust on clutching
Times I'm so far from what I want 

Merry-go-round
In a town without sound
Wings for hire
From the church with no choir
The burning ship is sailing
It will not leave without me

Jack Bruce,"You asked me to a party
To a house just by the moon
You gave me silver loving
The end was all too soon

You asked me to the theater
In a place quite near the sun
You gave me golden sunbeams
Your act was all in fun

Rope ladder, rope ladder
Rope ladder to the moon!

You asked me to a meeting
In a cottage in the snow
You gave me central heating
I can't forget the glow

You asked me to a weekend
Down by the stormy sea
You took me to a ceremony
And the sacrifice was me!

You asked me to a storm cloud
Up near the rainbow's end
Then you threw away the ladder
And gave me to your friend

You took me to a prison
And you said its chief was me
Then you locked me deep inside you
And thew away the key

I feel inside it's time for me to be going

And you shouting hey what about when you are an old man
Fortunately baby, I'd already locked the door

They say, there are men who are blue like me in the stars
Beards for the weird and bars for bizarre guitar men
Fortunately baby, I'd already joined the force

Good time train, well, it does not need any track
It wins the race to the place where I'm gonna pack up
Fortunately baby, I'd already grabbed the sky

All the days that the road has spent on me
Judges shout you must slave to be a freeman
Fortunately baby, I am never coming back

Dusty roads where they have gone
Sometimes traveling through the darkness
Met the summer coming home
Fallen faces by the wayside
Looked as if they might have known 
Oh the sun was in their eyes
And the desert that dries
In the country towns
Where the laughter sounds 

Oh the dancing and the singing
Oh the music when they played
Oh the fires that they started
Oh the girls with no regret

Sometimes they kept it
Often lost it on the way

Sometimes died in sight of day",Theme for an Imaginary Western

Messages and memories
Of all the things you've been

And the grinding of the stone
(And the grinding of the stone)

You do the best you can

Recalling all the hard miles
You'll have to swim again

I did not choose this life on cold island

Victories and voices
Keep calling you a saint

Looking through cold windows, at the autumn flying by
I wait for memories to come home
All this time, without you, and I search the sky
So sad, the sun is on its own

Love used to wear a sapphire smile
Maybe a diamond grin
The years we played were destroyed in the raids
All the fools that we've been

Look out at the wild world through the sweet and sour rain
I wish the ache would lose its sting
All these broken chances 'cause I missed the train

Here ghost wail and moan
Skeletons rattle trying to escape there prisoning coffins (Wicked Shit)
Grimlins and skulls gasp a death (ICP Tech N9ne)
You have enterd the Mad House

Sombody open the fuckin door and let me in!
The worlds are about to get me again
Shit ain't pretend I'm safer in the madhouse
Clinging to the selene like a spider
I'm out of your mind like frozen fire
Razorblade fingers scratchin my neck
Lost in the maze I found a dragon barbeque in the back
A arm came out of the toilet and squaws my balls
That shirt hurt got me head but holes in the walls
I wanna see you!
I hear you!
I catch spirits and ghosts by there invisible throats and then tear through (tear through)
Never scary boo bitch I'm a kamikaze
Swimmin through the living room watching joni and chachi
And then I realize I'm potsy trapped in the tv 
Sombody changed the channel and got the better of me

Your ain't never gettin in and we ain't never gettin out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

So many dimensions and lines except for these levels of dips and devil
Ain't been alright sense the ghetto better wait for my temper settle
Cause my mind is a madhouse the n9ne fittin spaz out
Player haters don't throw stones if you grind in a glass house
Sometimes when I lash out I pass out how sick and insanse and vain can this be
Wanna fly your little head like a frisbee six six triple eight forty six ninede nine thrisde
This strange and psychopathic homie this is not disney
The madhouse continues to pin you send you psycho bitches to the back of the venue
Then you slitther when like when I'm here in you or off in you
Then my homies 2 dope and Jay do you up somthin real ???
Level of madness extasy shrooms and acid
Beats release but you can't find me in lake placid
Finnaly in missouri dissily struttin with a bad bitch 
Her last kid was disastres ICP on some Mad Shit!

Tryin to be sneaky creeping behind me mutha facka I saw that rail
Maybe its a mirror or a different person he was grabbin his nuts and spittin and curseing at me fag!
There somethings in this life that I fail to understand even as even as a grown man I don't comprehend
Like how in the fuck did I walk up the stairs and some fucking how I ended up down here
Well laughing and giggleing like a little school girl with my homies Jay and Tech ain't even there Hmmm
What the fuck not a damn single bitch in this place but some ones figgin my nuts

Or a book or story in song?
Or did you hear some words for the first time today
And find yourself hurting alone?

When the lyrics start telling your story
And Shakespeare starts writing the play
Then those well chosen words by some
Old country verse held all your defenses away

Well, I thought I was over that story
I thought I'd forgotten that song
But old songs were new songs
For fools all alone

And we'll all come around
And we all will be found
Caught in the act of crying alone
Trapped in an old country song

But old songs were new songs
For fools all along

And we'll all come around
In that old country sound
Caught in the act of crying alone

And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Jack Convery,"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me
Understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just
Holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad
If our new love was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two

Jack Convery,"In old Savannah, I said Savannah
The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of a Southern brand
But here's what I don't understand

They got a gal there, a pretty gal there
Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say; I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas
Brother, she's the polar bear's pajamas

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight; they say an evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your B-V-D's
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah
Anytime a woman can take a great big pan
Start pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

Oh, she's sweet as sour milk",Hard Hearted Hanna
Jack Cooke,"Big Sam left Seattle in the year of ninety-two
With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon river and they found the bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain
Just a little south-east of Nome
Sam crossed the Majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northen lights a-runnin' wild
In the land of the midnight sun
Yes Sam McCord was a mighty man
In the year of nineteen-one

Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're findin'
North to Alaska go north the rush is on
North to Alaska go north the rush is on

George turns to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said Sam you're lookin' at a lonely lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home

Across the sand so I may keep

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

Jack Donahue,"Some people remember the first time
Some can't forget the last
Some just select what they want to from the past
It's a song that you danced to in high school
It's a moon you tried to bring down
On a four-in-the-morning drive through the streets of town

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a photograph taken in Paris, at the end of the honeymoon
In 1948, late in the month of June
Your parents smile for the camera in sienna shades of light
Now you're older than they were then that summer night

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a need you never get used to, so fierce and so confused
It's a loss you never get over the first time you lose

And tonight I am thinking of someone, seventeen years ago
We rode in his daddy's car down the river road

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand
Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

Jack Donahue,"I can recall the sound of the wind
As it blew through the trees and the trees would bend
I can recall the smell of the rain
On a hot summer night
Coming through the screen

I'd crawl in your bed when the lightning flashed
And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast
Its light all around your room

We lived on a street where the tall elm shade
Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade
That you held in your teeth as we lay on our backs
Staring up at the blue and the blue stared back

I used to believe we were just like those trees
We'd grown just as tall and as proud as we pleased
With our feet on the ground and our arms in the breeze
Under a sheltering sky

Twirl me about, and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
And when I look up at you looking down,
Say it was only a dream

A big truck was parked in the drive one day
They wrapped us in paper and moved us away
Your room was no longer next door to mine
And this kid sister thing was old by that time

But oh how our dreams went bump in the night
And the voices downstairs getting into a fight
And the next day a silence you could cut with a knife
And feel like a blade at your throat

Twirl me about and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it as only a dream

The day you left home you got an early start
I watched your car back out in the dark
I opened the door to your room down the hall
I turned on the light
And all that I saw
Was a bed and a desk and couple of tacks
No sign of someone who expects to be back
It must have been one hell of a suitcase you packed

Twirl me about, twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it was only a dream
