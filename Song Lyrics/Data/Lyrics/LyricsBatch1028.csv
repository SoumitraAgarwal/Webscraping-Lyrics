Area 11,"As I looked into the burning sky,
A tear forming in my eye
Memories of fallen dreams
And all those that have died.
Demons are possessing me.
Robbed of my eternity.
A cloud of ash that pierced the night;
I feel my hate take flight.

I'm choking on my own words and
I'm scared of backing down
Because the hope within us all
Is up in flames.
Twisted by my warring conscience,
The situation's pushing onwards.
Genocide
Forever taints your name.

This can't be, was this me?
I think I've lost control.
I caused this, I forced this,
Can I continue on?
I have caused this, I have forced this.
I caused this, I forced this, I caused this.

Mou oshimai da.
Betrayed by trust, forever left to scream.
Oh hold me closely and die in my arms,
And then take this secret with you,
And then take this secret with you.

I became your puppet master,
As you stared into my eyes,
Then stood and watched in horror
As you ordered them to die.

This could fuel The Revolution
This could be my last solution,
And all good victories
Come with a price.

Mou oshimai da.
Betrayed by trust, forever left to scream.
Oh hold me closely and die in my arms,
And then take this secret with you,
And then take this secret with you.

Mou oshimai da.
Betrayed by trust, forever left to scream.
Oh hold me closely and die in my arms,
And then take this secret with you,
Then take this secret with you.
Take my secret with you.
Take my secret with you.
Take my secret with you.
Just take my secret with you.",Euphemia

Area 11,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Area 11,"Cause I know that this will never work out
So it shouldn't even start
Cause I'm just a kid at heart

Rising through the clouds into light
That's from the stars; now you fall
Down into my arms

This is where we are from
The town where nothing goes on
Production line values we covert so high
Waiting for our own special moment to die

I got lost to find myself
Some quiet noise, some mental health
The street's alive with glowing light
I wanna be with you tonight

Cause everything's gone; it's been wiped out
The fire's spread to the basement now
Through every part of me

I feel a change in the pace
As hearts start to race
Down a path ripped from space

I know I should run and I should fight
But the look in your eyes:
I could die here tonight

Cause I don't know what you came here for
Rising through the clouds into light
That's from the stars; now you fall
Down into my arms

This is where we are from
The town where nothing goes on
Fear of failure, we're moving so slow
Like statues, c'mon get your coat time to go

I got lost to find myself
Some quiet noise, some mental health
The street's alive with glowing light
I wanna be with you tonight

Area 11,"A music box, a lullaby,
A restless sleep through an IV high
A whispered voice inside your mind
“One day I will find you”

I saw that you were lonely too
Something broken inside you
I reached out and took your hand
You reached out and you took me

I repressed that time
I locked it all inside
I locked it all inside
‘Cause it’s easier to hide
All the hurt, all the loss
All the lines between the dots
Everything that I forgot
I see it clearly

Regress into a child again
Do you feel it now?

Baby can’t you see that you’re losing your mind, that you’re losing your mind?
(Give me a warning, give me a warning!)
A shot to the head leaves it all behind, leaves it all behind
(This is a warning) and I’ll tear you apart

Reach out your hands to catch me
Reach out your hands and you tear me apart
Reach out your hands to catch me
Reach out your hands and you tear me apart

A music box, an alibi
But we are simply killing time
I wish I’d see inside your mind
I wish I’d seen inside you

Well this had to be common ancestry
Almost the same, but not enough
Never forgiven, but still in love

I repressed that time
I locked it all inside
I locked it all inside
‘Cause it’s easier to hide
All the hurt, all the loss

When their voices were soft

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
And they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.",I Dreamed a Dream [From Les Miserables]
Aretha Franklin,"L.A. proved too much for the man,
So he's leavin' the life he's come to know,
He said he's goin' back to find
Ooh, what's left of his world,
The world he left behind
Not so long ago.
He's leaving, 
On that midnight train to Georgia,
And he's goin' back
To a simpler place and time.
And I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia,
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine.
He kept dreamin'
That someday he'd be a star.
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true.
So he pawned all his hopes 
and he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket
To the life he once knew, 
Oh yes he did,
He said he would
Be leavin
On that midnight train to Georgia,
And he's goin' back
To a simpler place and time.
And I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia,
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine.

Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can

Though I may try and try
No one can satisfy this longing in me

The sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember

That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
and mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

Bright shining as the sun,

Aretha Franklin,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Aretha Franklin,"Without a word of warning
The blues walked in this morning
And circled round my lonely room
I didn't know why I had 
That sad and lonely feeling
Until my baby called and said we're through, ooo
Woah yesterday, this time I sang a love song
But today I'm singin' the blues

Mmm, it strikes me kind of funny
How love can be this way
We were lovers last night, honey
But I'm alone again today
It strikes me kind of funny
How fate can be unfair
I come out on the losin' end
In every, every love affair
Yes it must be, must be written for me
That I should be the one, be the one to always lose
For yesterday, yesterday, this time I sang a love song
Oh, oh but right now I sing the blues, oh yeah",Today I Sing the Blues
Aretha Franklin,"If you ever need me

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

It once was inspired, now it’s just another routine
I’m so afraid the masquerade is over

I love you in a place where there's no space and time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hide, hiding
But now I'm so much better, if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody, because my love is in there hiding

Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play

Well if you can do all these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me

And tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow

One night, I could not sleep
For ringing in my ear
A melody began to sing

Oh, at first
The words I could not make out clear
The smog fields lifted away

It said without love
(Without love)
There's nothing you can do
Yes, it did
It said without love

A plaything, that you could toss around at will

Just for a thrill
You made my life one sad song
Just for a thrill
You just led me along

Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill

Look for the silver lining
When e'er a cloud appears in the blue.
Remember some where the sun is shining, 
And so the right thing to do, 
Is make it shine for you.
 
A heart, full of joy and gladness, 
Will always banish sadness and strife.
So always look for the silver lining, 
And try to find the sunny side of life.

As I wash my dishes, I'll be following your plan, 
Till I see the brightness in ev'ry pot and pan.
I am sure your point of view will ease the daily grind, 
So I keep repeating in my mind. 

[Chorus]",Look for the Silver Lining

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can' t understand
Why I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or is it the sound of your hello dear
That music I hear
Oh why I get misty, whenever you're near

You can see that you're leading me on?
But it's just, just what I want you to do
Can I help it, how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

And on my own, see on my very own
That I wander through this great big wide world all alone
Never knowing my right hand from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, too much in love
I say I'm just too misty
Very very very much in love

But soft and sweet and dreaming

With eyes as black as coal that look down in his soul
And starts a fire there and then he loses control

He's going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in his garden

With eyes as black as coal that look down in his soul
And starts a fire there and then he loses control
And I'm goin' to beg his pardon yeah

Is such a big part of me.
If you must take your love away
Take it gradually.

Are you lonely like I am, tonight?
Have we lied to each other about this affair?
If so, don't make me suffer, just tell me you still care

Have you cried tears like I have, at all?
And do you wonder as I do, should I call?
I'll hurt for a lifetime not knowing my fate
Is there still any hope here or am I too late?

I wonder, I wonder
Where are you tonight?
Are you painting the town while I just sit around?

Bear fruits of poison lies

Born innocent

Denying themselves a real chance
To build a better world

It's all I ever think about

Baby In the heart of my heart I want more
Of the man who just walked through that door
The only one that my eyes see

Baby the moments have drifted away
And the hours became lonely days
You're the answer to what i have prayed
I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

[Chorus]

Baby, losing you's all that i fear
And I'm losing it when you're not here
I never could go on without you

Baby, I feel like a shower of light
And I need you right here by my side
I'm craving you all of my life

I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

[Chorus]

Aah you move me
Baby
Aah you move me

I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
All I ever think about (come to me baby)
All I ever think about (come to me baby)
All I ever think about

Aretha Franklin,"Sunshine blue skies please go away
The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.
I'm a man and I got my pride
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain

And sometimes I cry all through the night
Please oh please come, come back to me
And make my holiday bright
It's been a blue holiday my heart's in pain

Aretha Franklin,"I saw your face as I hurried past the cafe
And the rain felt like long lost tears
As it trickled down the window pane

And in a moment
All the years were simply washed away
'Cause when our eyes met, when our eyes met
There was nothing left to say

I caught my breath, I fell out of touch with time
'Cause it was you
With a part of me I'd forgotten that I ever knew

I stood to greet you and you held me
Just a little bit too long
Oh, but we've come so far, we've come so far
But the feeling's still so strong

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

That same perfume
Carries such a lot of memories of a time
When we dreamed sweet dreams
Never knowing they'd be left behind

Love is a memory, like a picture
And it never seems to fade
Oh, and I still believe, and I still believe
All the promises we made

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

And I still believe, I still believe
All the promises we made

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big.

You're lunching at twenty-one and watchin' your diet,
Declining a charlotte russe, accepting a fig,
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy,
And this could be the start of something big.

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend,
Who knows what's written in the magic book.
But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend,
Invite her in without a second look.

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at sardi's,
Or lying at malibu alone on the sand,
You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand.

This could be the start of something very big,
Why don't you play your part? 
Please give your heart to me....and see.
This could be the start of something wonderful,
Why don't you take a chance? 
Just try romance with me....and see.

Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money,
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine,
Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is,
And this must be the start of something...
This could be the heart of something...
This could be the start of something big.

And get down till it's done

Now watch this sketch as I stretch this mall
Too live to drive so we put it in park
With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too, one two, one two
And I say, jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's, I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood, definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it
Now listen, Mission Impossible
Keep it general like the hospital
Shake, rattle and roll, to rock wit' chu

We can make it, we can take it right to the top
Come on and never stop
Oh, and let's reach for the sky
And if we keep believing we can never go too high
Why don't we give it a try
Come on and keep reaching up
And don't you worry
No, you won't use up your stuff
No way to get enough
Do it till we get it right

Aretha Franklin,"There was a time when men were kind
Their voices were soft
And their words inviting

There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And that song was exciting

There was a time, and it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in days gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream
Aretha Franklin,"Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows

And was crippled emotionally
Somehow I made it through the heartace, yes I did
I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith
Kept my faith

And the river was deep 
I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me, uh uh

With and endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free
No, I don't regret a single moment, no, I don't
I know you don't, looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do) I just laugh

When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we share was meant to be
(I knew you were waiting)
(I knew you were waiting)
I knew you were waiting, (I knew you were waiting for me)

(I even thought that) I even thought that love
(I still believe) when the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) nothing can stop me now
(Knew you were waiting, know I knew you were waiting for me)

(I even thought that) when the mountain was high
(I still believe) oh, when the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) no, it didn't stop me
(Knew you were waiting for me, knew you were waiting for me)

(I didn't falter) oh yeah
(I still believe) oh, I still believe
(It didn't stop me) do you know it didn't stop me, now?
(Knew you were waiting) somewhere, some way, some place, somehow

When I got there 

Stealing kisses in the hall 
Before the first bell 
You smelled so fine 
Though we'd just met 
I guess you knew me so well 
You had the number to my heartline

Well, just between you and me

He was the first one 

(Maybe he'd seen enough)

Won't you please explain to me 
Why you left me behind you, yeah

On the average twice a week 
I think I see you 
On some avenue 
Someone laughs or shakes his head 
They way you used to 
I guess I got myself a loose screw 

I grew up and 
Had my share of adventure 
Well, I've had some fun 
But you never need 
To question my intentions 
Cause each guy is just another rerun

Aretha Franklin,"There's an old friend
That I once heard say
Something that touched my heart
And it began this way

I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been runnin' ever since
He said it's been a long time comin'
But I know my change is gonna come
Oh yeah

He said it's been too hard livin'
But I'm afraid to die
I might not be if I knew
What was up there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time comin'
But I know my change has got to come
Oh yeah

I went, I went to my brother
And I asked him, ""Brother
Could you help me, please?""
He said, ""Good sister
I'd like to but I'm not able""
And when I, when I looked around
I was right back down
Down on my bended knees
Yes I was, oh

There I've been times that I thought
I thought that I wouldn't last for long
But somehow right now I believe
That I'm able, I'm able to carry on
I tell you that it's been along
And oh it's been an uphill journey
All the way
But I know, I know, I know
I know my change is gonna come
Sometimes I had to cry all night long
Yes I did
Sometimes I had to give up right
For what I knew was wrong
Yes it's been an uphill journey
It's sure's been a long way comin'
Yes it has
It's been real hard
Every step of the way
But I believe, I believe
This evenin' my change is come
Yeah I tell you that
My change is come

I know that you've been
Tired of hearing the same old song

And some times
I get caught up in things that I do
And boy, I never pay attention at time
(It passes so fast)

Although I call you on the phone
Honey, I get a thing
Only one thing about reality
I feel like a fool and I do

You could be spending time with somebody else
But instead you're still at home all alone night and day

Aretha Franklin,"Woman, I can hardly express 
My mixed emotions and my thoughtlessness
After all, I'm forever in your debt
And woman, I will try to express my inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success

Ooh, well, well, doo doo doo doo doo

Woman, I know you understand the little child inside a man
Please remember, my life is in your hands, and woman
Hold me close to your heart, however distant don't keep us apart

Aretha Franklin,"Yes, it's love, so much love
You are the one

I can't admit that I was wrong
Took you for granted now I'm all alone
It was so silly all the things we say
And all the words of pain runnin' through my head

If I had the chance I'd let you know
I'll tell you that I never want you to go
These tears I cry won't let me rest
Till you return

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurts

It hurts, oh baby, you know you hurt me

I can't believe that you would leave me
I always thought you would stand by me
The thought of you in another arms
Is very slowly tearing me apart

What can I do to make you see?
Everything you need is here with me
I really miss the things that we used to build
And don't you miss the way I used to love you?

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work
And it's tearing me up inside
Every little bit hurts

You used to kiss me
You used to hold me
You used to love me
You used to touch me

All night long you made everything alright
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
Things have stayed the same
And all I'm really tryin' to say, I'm the one to blame

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't cry for you
There's not one day that goes by
That I'm not singing the blues

There's not one day that goes by
That I don't wish it could work

Aretha Franklin,"I have heard of a land on the far away strand,
'Tis a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high, where we never shall die,
'Tis a land where we never grow old.

Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old.

In that beautiful home where well never more roam,
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the King through eternity sing,
'Tis a land where we never shall die.

Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old.

When our work here is done and the life crown is won,
And our troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrow will end, and our voices will blend,
With the loved ones who've gone on before.",Never Grow Oldn

There was a rose I knew, I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Ashamed of the way you lied, played with the truth, hey, hey

Mmm, she never knew what hit her
Steal her honey, then forget her
A rose
She wears a flower
Tryin' to forget about you

Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you and sees nobody else
And now you're so tough tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings

Oh, oh, yeah
When she faces the mirror, yeah
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is still a rose
She wears a flower, tryin' to forget about you

Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby, girl, you hold the power

See a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see your all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow

Tough to be, but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself and love to love
Cause without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on

Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby, girl, you hold the power

See a rose is still a rose

Aretha Franklin,"Here we go with the trick questions
They bring up to break down confidence
Always throw out a sly comment
Like is your man faithful 
What time does he get home?

Don't worry I ain't gonna need your help
I'm gonna watch y'all go home by yourself
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love
Is a whole lot better than none

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool

Skip the drama, use common sense
You don't have love if you don't have patience
He's out in the street but don't forget
My twice a week and that almighty paycheck

See I don't even sweat it
I get so much happiness 
If I just put up with a lil' bit a bullsh**!
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love is a whole lot better than none

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool

Think no evil when somebody comes home
Hear no evil, I don't want to know
See no evil, I just wanna see love
Because somebody always takes care of everybody's wants
Don't interrogate 'bout how he spends his spare time
Whatever he chooses to do is fine
'Cause in my heart I believe he's all mine
'Cause you think I can't see
Doesn't mean that I'm blind

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Watch somebody running game
But ya never have a clue

'Cause deep down I know that it means goodbye

We've come this far by faith
Pick up your pace and don't you be late
I'm here to tell you about the good news
There's something about the path that we choose

Wisdom has built this house now
Integrity will bring your pride out
If you know how to pray the situation out
You'll get an answer, and there ain't no doubt

Monday, we held it together and
Wednesday, we had stormy weather and

Look here, what He'll do
Is keep testing you
And a beggar's no less than you
'Cause one day it could be you

So get your folks together for some church
Some good music, prayer, and service won't hurt
Even if you don't like the preacher
There's bound to be a thing or two he can teach you

Deceit is in the heart of them who imagine evil 
Righteousness is the fruit of the tree of all people
And if you want to live your life upright
Pray that the Lord will hold up the light

What you need is love on your side
The power of love won't be denied

Don't make the same mistake twice

Wednesday, we had stormy weather and
Friday, we prayed it all better 
And Sunday, we heard the good news (Repeat)

These are the greatest days of our test of time
We need to be walking with a made-up mind
Walk by faith, not by sight
Then all your battles, you know He will fight 

If the sky changes colors there's so many ways
This world's gonna be a better place some day 
If love and unity, you just believe
Then all your blessings I know you'll receive

Glory to God in the Highest 
Glory, Glory, Glory
Jesus, man who walked on water

Even when I close my eyes, I still see it

Passed away, now bitches wanna claim his name
I been with my nigga before he came in the game
No one's, no V's, we used to take the train
Just us and the Mafia goin' out to parties
I guess back then we was real nobodies
But he was my nigga, and I was his bitch
I rolled hard with him, how could I forget him
Had beef with yo wife that ain't patched up
But still got love for your kids
Even wrote 'em in my will
And I'ma make sure the fam keep a decent meal
No matter what I got to do, or who I got to kill
Shit is real, baby, there ain't no appeal
If I'm fucked up, imagine how Mrs. Wallace feels
Sometimes I sit and think how it would be if we was married
Of if I woulda kept the child that I carried
So to my ladies, don't think I haven't walked in yo shoes
Or thought this was only happenin' to you, righ'
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on this boo
Cuz trust me, I know exactly what you're going through

So I guess you know the story of how it all ends
Depressed, stressed, don't know who's my real friends
One thing's for sure, I can count on my mens
D-Roc, Money, L, Lil' Cease, and PD
My whole B.I. family, remind me of you
We miss you so much, I love you so much
Never thought life without you would be so rough
But I know we gon make it
We ain't happy, but we fakin'
And to New York, thanks for the support
And all our real fans, I'm shoutin' out the whole land
This is somethin' young kids just won't understand
How they took away this beautiful man
Who shared so many memories
I could go on and on, but a song can only be so long
It's been hard, but I told God that I put up a fight
So here's a Long Kiss Goodnight, Frank White

Don't you give up, be strong

Aretha Franklin,"They call me coquette, and mademoiselle,
And I must admit I like it quite well.
It's something to be the darling of all;
Le grande femme fatale the belle of the ball,
There's nothing as gay as life in paris ,
There's no other person, I'd rather be,
I love what I do I love what I see,
But where is the schoolgirl that used to be me

Ah, the apple trees,
Where at garden teas,
Jack-o-lanterns swung:
Fashions of the day,
Vests of applique,
Dresses of shantung,
Only yesterday.
When the world was young

While sitting around we often recall,
The laugh of the year the night of them all,
The blonds who was so attractive that year,
Some opening night that made us all cheer;
Remember that time we all got so tight,
And jacques and antoine got into a fight,
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,
I laugh with the rest it's all very bright.

Ah, the apple trees,
Sunlight memories,
Where the hammock swung,
On our backs we'd lie;
Looking at the shy,
'til the stars were strung,
Only last July,
When the world was young.

You'll see me in cape d'antibes, or in spain ,
I follow the sun by boat or by plane,
It's any old millionaire in a storm,
For I've got my mink to keep my heart warm:
And sometimes I drink too much with the crowd,
And, sometimes I talk a little too loud,
My head may be aching, but it's unbowed,
And sometimes I see it all through the clouds

Ah, the apple trees,
And the hive of bees,
Where we once got stung,
Summers at bordeau
Rowing at bateau,
Where the willow hung,
Just a dream ago,
When the world was young","(Ah, The Apple Trees) When the World Was Young"

He talked of life, he talked of life

For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.
Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.
Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,
Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamor and wine.
And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.
Are the apple trees, sunlit memories, where the hammock swung,
On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young.",When the World Was Young

Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your step
Until I get through to you
I've got to change your view baby
'Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do",Until You Come Back to Me
Aretha Franklin,"I can't get no satisfaction,
I can't get no satisfaction.
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try.
I can't get no, I can't get no.
When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination.
I can't get no, oh no no no.
Hey hey hey, that's what I say.
I can't get no satisfaction,
I can't get no satisfaction.
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try.
I can't get no, I can't get no.
When I'm watchin' my tv
And that man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be.
Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarrettes as me.
I can't get no, oh no no no.
Hey hey hey, that's what I say.
I can't get no satisfaction,
I can't get no girl with action.
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try.
I can't get no, I can't get no.
When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back later next week
'Cause you see I'm on a losing streak.
I can't get no, oh no no no.
Hey hey hey, that's what I say.
I can't get no, I can't get no,
I can't get no satisfaction,
No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction",(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction [Live]

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

To sit and chit and sit and chit-chat and smile

Don't send me no doctor
Fillin' me up with all of those pills
I got me a man named Doctor Feelgood
And oh, yeah, that man takes me off all o' my pains and my ills

Aretha Franklin,"Day after day,
Alone on a hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,

But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.

Well on the way,
Head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
or the sound he appears to make,
and he never seems to notice,

But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.

And nobody seems to like him,
they can tell what he wants to do,
and he never shows his feelings,

But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning 'round.

Ooh, ooh,
Round and round and round.

And he never listens to them,
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him,

I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.

No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

Aretha Franklin,"There's a very good reason
Why the holiday season
Is a wonderful time
For a boy and girl to fall in love

'Cause Santa and Cupid
Planned exactly what you did
When you kissed me by the mistletoe above

We stood there kissin' by the mistletoe

Kissin' by the mistletoe, love came to stay
And now it's Christmas every day

We stood there kissin' by the mistletoe
Tingle, tingle
Mmm and away we go, jingle, jingle
Kissin' by the mistletoe, love came to stay
And now it's Christmas every day

There is a heavenly treasure
More than money can measure
In the gift you get when you give your love
And I can tell
(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss)

'Cause whenever it's Christmas
If I never get this much
He ran my heart I remember very well

We stood there kissin' by the mistletoe

What they just don't know is in my heart
I'd be wishing, oh, that that someone was you

So, oh, it's all for you to decide
If you should decide to trap me once more
All you got to do, all you got to do is knock on my door

I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)

There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give

Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

We were more than sweethearts,

Don't know how it started,

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,

Everybody knows you left me,

To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

Ari Hest,"At the midnight hour you can feel the minutes fade
Licking wounds from yesterday, bracing for tomorrow's stage
I create these monsters, seems like every way I can
It's never my intention, but somehow it feels strangely planned

And this goes to show you
Ignorance is under, â??cause

I'd rather forget all about my past
Cruel how these moments never cease to last
And you could do better than this
If you refuse to hide
These monsters will subside

Story after story, squeezing fiction out of fact
Trying to face forward, but always looking back
Conjuring up danger when you know you're safe and sound
Once you start to question yourself, the road you take leads down, down

And this goes to show you
Ignorance is unde

How can I stay here where others would run?

Along the edge
They linger on the banks, in search of refuge

Don’t you know why

Laid my mandolin beside the door

One way out and no return
I watched the sun go down
Across the plains from Denver

Met a boy in the darkness
Handsome, tall and heartless
I loved him like an eagle loves the wind
Till I heard him say

Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He gets me my drinks for free
And hes quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, bill, I believe this is killing me.

Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place

Who never had time for a wife
And hes talkin' with davy who's still in the navy

Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But its better than drinkin' alone

And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that its me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar

How can we keep the feelings fresh, how do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love could be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones and we the oddest
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest

That's how I know

I can't, be your, only one
No I can't, be your only one

And your love is three time better, how could anyone forget
No I can't

Just let me prove to you what I know is real

I believe that love is synonymous
With heaven, such a sensual bliss
The way you touch me makes this life so good
A reward at the end of the long road

Got my mind made, I don't plan to leave
'cause you were meant for me, simple that may be
Why be complex, lovin' you is so easy

Mejor me voy despidiendo por qué sin embargo aquí sigo encerrado

I dedicate this selfie to the little guy
Who will outlast me when I'm done

In a thousand future lives
And with that
I bid adieu

Ariel Rivera,"All you see are endless skies
Like an ocean lit by fireflies
With a long deep breath
I speak my heart
Saying things
I'm not sure just what they are
A feeling catches me by surprise
You can see forever
In a lover's eyes

I can stop myself
But on I go
Finding feelings
I have never known
There's hope beyond
Your wildest dreams
And the feeling
Is nothing to extreme
In a flash
Tomorrow begins to rise
You can see forever
In a lover's eyes

I can see your world
Beautiful and new
And although I'm not sure
Where it's leading to
We will travel on
Our fate unknown
And for once
I know I'm not alone
It's a trade we make
A sacrifice
Love never ending
Is surely worth the price
If we survive
Love holds no greater price
You can see forever
In a lover's eyes

Ariel Rot,"Andaba medio perdido
Yo no sabía qué hacer
Sin trabajo, sin amigos
Sin nada para beber

Amontonaba problemas
No podía resolver
Ese ritmo cuesta abajo
Cuando te vi aparecer

Y dije
Ayúdeme, señorita
Ayúdeme, por favor

Al tercer día de ayuno
Fui a pedirle ayuda al señor
Y sentí que se reía
Al terminar mi oración

Andaba medio perdido
Ya no sabía qué hacer
Sin trabajo, sin amigos

Sin nada para beber

Ariel Rot,"Tantas veces me mataron, tantas veces me morí
Sin embargo estoy aquí resucitando
Gracias doy a la desgracia y a la mano con puñal
Porque me mató tan mal y seguí cantando
Cantando al sol como la cigarra
Después de un año bajo la tierra

Igual que sobreviviente
Que vuelve de la guerra
Tantas veces me borraron, tantas desaparecí
A mi propio entierro fui solo y llorando
Hice un nudo en el pañuelo pero me olvidé después
Que no era la única vez y seguí cantando

Cantando al sol
Tantas veces te mataron, tantas resucitarás
Cuántas noches pasarás desesperando
Y a la hora del naufragio y la de la oscuridad
Alguien te rescatará para ir cantando

I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
I wish you love

And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health
But more than wealth
I wish you love

That you and I could never be

Si è sciolto sopra il letto

Lentamente si apre il giorno davanti a me
Luce calda che l’orizzonte fa nascere
Cresce una mela su un ramo ed io vivo
Masticare la realtà nuda
Certamente poi mi servirà a non avere paura
È come guardi il mondo che poi
Ti cambia tutto dentro
E penso a te su questo su questo prato
Dove una volta per te ho cantato
L’alba è pronta ed io mi commuovo sempre

Come cambia il colore del mare,
Quando lo osservi per molte ore.
Le facce delle persone,
I posti dove hai cercato le meraviglie che poi hai trovato.
Ma perché vuoi capire l'amore?
Cosa c'è di così complesso da decifrare?

Padre perdonami, se ho fatto tutto male è solo colpa delle teorie.
Io sono pratica, ci provo a galleggiare e a fare i conti di logica.

Perché forse ho bisogno d'amore,
O forse ho soltanto voglia di contare

Quante parole che non dici e vorresti gridare,
Con il tempo vedrai esploderanno tutte nello stesso momento,
Tutte fino a farti sentire meglio.

Le frasi si sommano, diventano delle addizioni,
Dei labirinti di coniugazioni.
Uscirne è difficile,
Tuoi rischiare di naufragare in un lago di virgole.
Ma perché vuoi spiegare l'amore?
Sono solo due numeri prima da calcolare!

Quante parole, quante regole scelte da fare,
Con il tempo vedrai esploderanno tutte nello stesso momento,
Tutte fino a farti sentire meglio.

Nascono i fiori dalla tua bocca,
Pezzi di stelle,
Cose che avevi smarrito nel nulla,
Tracce di te.

Quante parole che non dici e vorresti gridare,
Con il tempo vedrai esploderanno tutte nello stesso momento,
Tutte fino a farti sentire meglio.",Quante parole che non dici

Li attraversi 
Guardo I tetti delle case 
Infiniti muri di parole senza amore 
Ma poi vedo te 
Ma poi vedo te 
Ma poi vedo te 
Se vedo te

Arisa,"Amore mio
Abbiamo vinto la guerra
E non c'è più niente al mondo
Che ci cambierà mai,
Solo se vorrai sarà così.

Proteggimi dalla neve e dal fango
Ma quante parole mi hai scritto sulle mani?
Grandi parole che non ho dimenticato mai.

E stai bene su di me
Come un vestito
Come la luna sulla pelle
Come la luce che invade la città
Come la felicità che piove su di noi.

Amore mio
Abbiamo vinto tutto
Le strade I cortili sono ancora pieni
E noi siamo qui piccoli
A perderci tra le galassie e I pianeti
Le promesse, le sfumature.

E stai bene su di me
Come un vestito
Come la luna sulla pelle
Come la luce che invade la città
Come la felicità che piove su di noi.

E stai bene su di me
Come un vestito
Come la luna sulla pelle
Come la luce che invade la città
Come la felicità che piove su di noi",Stai bene su di me
Arisa,"Cambiano le maree e gli anelli dentro agli alberi

E vive dentro ad ogni cosa

Arise [Metal],"I feel the shivers running down my spine, it wakes the powers of my
Undivine.
My mind betrays me I'm leaping back in time.
All those memories left behind, In the torture chamber where I lived to be:
All my purity is left in greed. Can't take control, my ego burns me out,
Everything seems so faded now.

[Chorus]
I've seen it, believed it, but deep inside I know that something is wrong.
I've been it, I've lived it but now I know - my schizophrenia is gone.

Feels like I'm trapped between two worlds, the doors are locked in either
Ways, I can hear my echo but there are no walls.
A sick brain in a tortured host.

[Chorus]
I've seen it, believed it, but deep inside I know that something is wrong.
I've been it, I've lived it but now I know - my schizophrenia is gone.

But I have kept talking, not a soul is listening but me, starving inside,
Dreaming of life.
Is my soul at a restingpoint?
Feels like I'm being torn apart.

Why, why did I ever let you go?

I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""

You know that I'm not that strong

Arizon Smoke Revue & The Blackwater Boys,"Tell me,
Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

Crying to be heard
A heavy heart
Carrying the weight of sorrow 

Talking about it
You were there saving me from darkness

Ooh on the day you came to me
The way that you paralyze - no disguise
I realize the power

Arlen Roth,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Arlo Guthrie,"This next song we're going to dedicate to a great American
Organization. Tonight I'd like to dedicate this to our boys
In the FBI.

Well, wait a minute. It's hard to be an FBI man. I mean, first
Of all, being an FBI man, you have to be over 40 years old.
And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the
Organization to be that much of a bastard. It's true. You just
Can't join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your
Natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a
Meaningful shape in today's complex society.

But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI. I
Mean, the job that they have to do is a drag. I mean, they have
To follow people around, you know. That's part of their job.
Follow me around.

I'm out on the highway and I'm drivin' down the road and I
Run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They
Gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you
Know.

I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether
They should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don't
Come back and they're stayin' with the car.

Or if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I'm 12
To 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that
When you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane
First, so that they know how many seats are left over for the
Half fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren't any seats
Left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that
You have to go.

Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't
Get on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What's he gonna
Do?

Every hand in the land
Shakes along with me
It don't seem that I can dream
Like I used to dream

Maybe that somebody is shaking me
If I fell I could tell
It may be that somebody is making me
Dream that you're forever
Gone away from me

Every toe that I know
Step away with me
I can't seem to get where
I want to be
Maybe it's my own foot
That keeps tripping me
Trip trap - flip flap
It must come to wherever from it comes
Through to me
I can't walk to where
My own dreams talk to me

Every face in this place
Take your eyes away
Blink if you think that
There's another way
Maybe it's my own eyes
That don't see the way
The time is blind
It may come to pass
That I will lose my mind
I can't live without the love I left behind
I can't live without the love I left behind



",Every Hand in the Land
Arlo Guthrie,"You know the guitar came to Europe with the gypsies 700 years ago
Spain brought the guitar to Mexico 400 years ago
U.S.A. picked a quarrel with Mexico and got Texas and California
And it also got the guitar and the guitar got us

It was Afro American people in the south
That worked out this way of playing it though
You know in Europe they usually play a guitar
But the Afro American peple worked out a way to play it
Just like a drum band

The base strings were played by a thumb with a steady beat
And the top strings were played
With the finger and got all the little off beats
Up in Syracuse there's a 92 year old woman
Who wrote a song, which some of you may know
She plays it, who knows it?

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

When I die just bury me deep
Down at the foot of old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old number nine
As she goes roaring by

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

When I'm dead and in my grave
No more good times do I crave
Place the tombstone at my head and my feet
Tell my friends that I've gone to sleep

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

Many lessons I have learned

Where I belong

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
Ridin' my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born

But as I sit here today
Many mile's I am away
From the place I rode my pony
Through the draw

Where the oak and black-jack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
And I feel back in those hills
Where I belong

Now as I turn life a page
To the land of the great Osage
In those Oklahoma hills
Where I was born

Where the black oil rolls and flows
And the snow white cotton grows
And I feel like in those hills

Running down the road
Make my get away
Everything I told you
Was just yesterday
Yes, You know I'm off again
Oh, and I've been told
You were there beside me
Running down the road

Walking down the street
Meet me down the line
Police car at my feet
They were there on time
Everybody's looking for
Something to explode
How can you afford the time
Running down the road

My feet are getting tired
My head begins to spin
Who of us is dreaming
You or me or him?
Yes, You know I'm waiting
While these times unfold
Looking backward briefly
Running down the road

I hope they play this song of mine
On the jukebox for a dime
Then if you leave 'cause something's wrong
You'll hear your cowboy sing an old time song

Oh babe, I love you so
This here is the only thing I know
It ain't right and it ain't wrong
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song
",Cowboy Song
Arlo Guthrie,"Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides
Upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun though it's glow is waxed in black
All except beneath the trees of Eden

The lamp post stands with folded arms its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Through its shadow's metal badge
All in all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head in the sand and then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden

The time rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle 'Black Madonna', two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey, pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what's not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden

The foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine
As friends and others, strangers from their fates try to resign
Leaving men holy and totally free to do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden
",Gates of Eden
Arlo Guthrie,"It was late last night when the boss came home
Asking about his lady
The only answer that he got was
She's gone with the Gypsy Davey

Gone with the Gypsy Dave
Go saddle me up my buckskin home
And my hundred dollar saddle
Point out to me their wagon tracks

And after them I'll travel and after them l'll ride
Well I had not rode 'till the midnight moon
I saw their campfire gleaming
I heard the notes of the big guitar

And the voice of the Gypsies singing
That song of the Gypsy Dave
It was there in the light of the camping fire
I saw her fair face beaming

Her heart in tune to the big guitar
And the song of the gypsies singing
That song of the Gypsy Dave
Have you forsaken your house and home?

Have you forsaken your baby?
Have you forsaken your husband dear?
To go with the Gypsy Davey
And sing with the Gypsy Davey

The song of the Gypsy Dave?
Yes I've forsaken my husband dear
To go with the Gypsy Davey
And I've forsaken my mansion high

But not my blue eyed baby
Not my blue eyed babe
She smiled to leave her husband dear
To go with the Gypsy Davey

But the tears come a-trickling down her cheeks
To think about her blue eyed baby
To think about her blue eyed babe
Take off take off those buckskin gloves

Made of Spanish leather
Come give to me your lily-white hand
And we'll ride home together
And home again we'll ride

No I won't take off my buckskin gloves
Made of Spanish leather
I'll go my way from day to day
And sing with the Gypsy Davey

",Lovesick Blues
Arlo Guthrie,"By Woody Guthrie

Ramblin' around your city
Ramblin' around your town
I never see a friend I know
As I go ramblin' 'round boys
As I go ramblin' 'round

My mother hoped that I might be
A man of some renown
But I am just a refugee
As I go ramblin' 'round boys
As I go ramblin' 'round

The peach trees they are loaded
The branches bending down
I pick 'em all day for a dollar boys
As I go 'ramblin 'round
As I go 'ramblin' 'round

Sometimes the fruit gets rotten
And falls on to the ground
There's a hungry mouth for every peach
As I go ramblin' 'round boys
As I go ramblin' 'round

Arlo Guthrie,"Uncle Jeff played the fiddle in his Colorado home 
And I backed him on the banjo so he didn't play alone 
We've got five generations of a fiddle playin' clan 
And it's nice to hear a fiddle by a fiddle playin' man 

Here's another song for Uncle Jeff Guthrie 
Written on the road by the light of the moon 
Thinkin' 'bout fiddlin' somewhere up in Michigan 
I hope that I can make it back to Colorado soon 

Well, my daddy had a fiddle, and he laid it on his son

Arlo Guthrie,"Children of Abraham, what's your story?
Killing each other for a piece of land

We died in your valleys and died on your plains
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes

Well I let the kids loose on the floor
And they ran round for a while or more
Till the manager with the broken smile
Said it's a dollar down and a quarter an aisle

Deedle lee dumb, deedle lee dumb
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb

I was down in the freezer upon my knees
Somebody was yelling that the price got freezed
There was a rioting mob, a strangling hold
I received the bill for the escaping cold

Deedle lee dumb, deedle lee dumb
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb

It was about this time that I was goin' insane
I went and picked the kids up in the other lane
Put back the food and ran out of the store
I ain't goin' back to that place no more

Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb

Well I'm tellin the truth now, I don't fib
I don't mind no women's lib
But if my woman don't want to go down to the store

As the snow settles white
There's a fire burning bright
In Massachusetts

And there's a house upon a hill
That keeps us from the chill
And by the grace of God
We will be in Massachusetts

You can tell me about the times you spent
In the Rockies and on the plains
Please don't think that I'm the last to say
That there ain't lots of other places
In this world that still remain
Beautiful and unchanged
But they're just not the same

The sun comes up to meet the dawn
And there's a day that must go on
There's another night that's gone
In Massachusetts

And I could spend all of my days
And remain each day amazed
At the way each day is phrased
In Massachusetts

You can tell me about the times you spent
In the Rockies and on the plains
Please don't think that I'm the last to say
That there ain't lots of other places
In this world that still remain
Beautiful and unchanged
But they're just not the same

Now if you could only see
I know you would agree
There ain't nowhere else to be
Like Massachusetts

And there's a house upon a hill
That keeps us from the chill
And by the grace of God
We will be in Massachusetts

Come on tell me about the time you spent
In the Rockies and on the plains
And please don't think that I'm the last to say
That there ain't lots of other places
In this world that still remain
Beautiful and unchanged
But they're just not the same as Massachusetts

I never know where you are coming from

My love I saw you first long ago
I didn't think then, now I know
How long it took love to grow

Oh babe, I long to hold you at night
We two together are so right
You make the darkness so bright

My love, we've had one hell of a time
And we've got over our crying
And we've come out of this fine

Because when two loves grow old
There can be no denying
That their love may soon grow colder
Yet that's when we started trying

Oh babe, this love we have must be for real
We've overcome, now it's sealed

Looked into your eyes this morning
You were far away
You must have known I was looking for you
You knew you couldn't stay
All these winds blowin' on me
Blowing in the nighttime lonely
Blew on over the ocean to you
Blew my words away

Put on your heavenly shoes babe
Walk around the clouds
You know that's where I'm bound to be now
I'm coming with the crowds
All these faces looking at me
Looking through me I don't mind
I just seen your face a-worrying
I loved you when you cried

Take my hand across the water
You won't leave no tracks behind
Step all over the moon lit ocean
It's only in your mind
All these thoughts just rip me
Who can heal a heart that's broken
Like the winds that blow unspoken
Blow my love away

Living now here but for fortune
Placed by fate's mysterious schemes
Who'd believe that we're the ones asked
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Arise sweet destiny, time runs short
All of your patience has heard their retort
Hear us now for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Can you hear the words being whispered
All along the American stream
Tyrants freed the just are imprisoned
Try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Ah but perhaps too much is being asked of too few
You and your children with nothing to do
Hear us now for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Victor Jara of Chile
Lived like a shooting star
He fought for the people of Chile
With his songs and his guitar
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Victor Jara was a peasant
He worked from a few years old
He sat upon his father's plow
And watched the earth unfold
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Now when the neighbors had a wedding
Or one of their children died
His mother sang all night for them
With Victor by her side
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

He grew up to be a fighter
Against the people's wrongs
He listened to their grief and joy
And turned them into songs
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

He sang about the copper miners
And those who worked the land
He sang about the factory workers
And they knew he was their man
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

He campaigned for Allende
Working night and day
He sang ""Take hold of your brothers hand
You know the future begins today""
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Then the generals seized Chile
They arrested Victor then
They caged him in a stadium
With five-thousand frightened men
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Victor stood in the stadium
His voice was brave and strong
And he sang for his fellow prisoners
Till the guards cut short his song
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

They broke the bones in both his hands
They beat him on the head
They tore him with electric shocks
And then they shot him dead
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Arlo Guthrie,"You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant
You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant
Walk right in, it's around the back
Just a half a mile from the railroad track
You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant

This song is called ""Alice's Restaurant
""It's about Alice, and the 
Restaurant, but ""Alice's Restaurant"" is not the name of the restaurant,
That's just the name of the song
That's why I call the song ""Alice's Restaurant.""

Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago, two years ago, on Thanksgiving, 
When my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the restaurant

But Alice doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the church nearby the 
Restaurant, in the bell tower with her husband Ray and Facha, the dog

And livin' in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of room downstairs 
Where the pews used to be, and havin' all that room (seein' as how they took 
Out all the pews), they decided that they didn't have to take out their 
Garbage for a long time.

We got up here and found all the garbage in there and we decided that it'd 
Be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump

So we took the half-a-ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW 
Microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction, and headed 
On toward the city dump. Well, we got there and there was a big sign and a 
Chain across the dump sayin', ""this dump is closed on Thanksgiving,"" and 
We'd never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in 
Our eyes, we drove off into the sunset lookin' for another place to put the garbage

We didn't find one till we came to a side road, and off the side of the side 
Road was another fifteen-foot cliff, and at the bottom of the cliff was 
Another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile was better than 
Two little piles, and rather than bring that one up, we decided to throw 
Ours down. That's what we did

Drove back to the church, had a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, 
Went to sleep, and didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone 
Call from Officer Obie. He said, ""kid, we found your name on a envelope at 
The bottom of a half a ton of garbage and I just wanted to know if you had 
Any information about it""

And I said, ""yes sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie. I put that envelope 
Under that garbage."" After speakin' to Obie for about forty-five minutes on 
The telephone, we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and he said 
That we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and 
Speak to him at the Police Officer Station. So we got in the red VW microbus 
With the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on 
Toward the Police Officer Station

Now, friends, there was only one of two things that Obie could've done at 
The Police Officer Station, and the first was that he could've given us a 
Medal for bein' so brave and honest on the telephone (which wasn't very 
Likely, and we didn't expect it), and the other thing was that he could've 
Bawled us out and told us never to be seen drivin' garbage around in the 
Vicinity again, which is what we expected

But when we got to the Police Officer Station, there was a third possibility 
That we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both immediately arrested, 
Handcuffed, and I said, ""Obie, I can't pick up the garbage with these here 
Handcuffs on."" He said ""shut up kid, and get in the back of the patrol car""

And that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car, and drove to 
The quote scene of the crime unquote

I want to tell you 'bout the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where this is 
Happenin'. They got three stop signs, two police officers, and one police 
Car, but when we got to the scene of the crime, there was five police 
Officers and three police cars, bein' the biggest crime of the last fifty 
Years and everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it

And they was usin' up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hangin' 
Around the Police Officer Station. They was takin' plaster tire tracks, 
Footprints, dog-smellin' prints and they took twenty-seven 8 x 10 colored 
Glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of 
Each one explainin' what each one was, to be used as evidence against us
Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner, the 
Southwest corner
And that's not to mention the aerial photography!

After the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was gonna put us in a cell

He said ""kid, I'm gonna put you in a cell
I want your wallet and your belt""
I said, ""Obie, I can understand your wantin' my wallet, so I don't have any 
Money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?"" and he said
""Kid, we don't want any hangin's
I said, ""Obie, did you think I was gonna 
Hang myself for litterin'?""

Obie said he was makin' sure, and, friends, Obie was, 'cause he took out the 
Toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and drown, and he took 
Out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars, roll the toilet paper out 
The window, slide down the roll and have an escape. Obie was makin' sure

It was about four or five hours later that Alice (remember Alice? 
There's a song about Alice)
Alice came by and, with a few nasty words to Obie on the 
Side, bailed us out of jail, and we went back to the church, had another 
Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, and didn't get up until the next 
Morning, when we all had to go to court. We walked in, sat down, Obie came 
In with the twenty-seven 8 times 10 colored glossy pictures with the circles and 
Arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, sat down

Man came in, said, ""All rise!"" We all stood up, and Obie stood up with the 
Twenty-seven 8 times 10 colored glossy pictures, and the judge walked in, sat 
Down, with a seein' eye dog and he sat down. We sat down

Obie looked at the seein' eye dog then at the twenty-seven 8 x 10 
Colored glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the 
Back of each one and looked at the seein' eye dog and then at 
The twenty-seven 8 x 10 colored glossy pictures with the circles and arrows 
And a paragraph on the back of each on and began to cry

Because Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American 
Blind justice, and there wasn't nothin' he could do about it, and the judge 
Wasn't gonna look at the twenty-seven 8 by 10 colored glossy pictures with 
The circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explainin' 
What each one was, to be used as evidence against us

And we was fined fifty dollars and had to pick up the garbage in the snow

But that's not what I'm here to tell you about
I'm here to talk about the draft
They got a buildin' down in New York City called Whitehall Street, where you 
Walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected and selected!

I went down and got my physical examination one day, and I walked in, sat 
Down (got good and drunk the night before, so I looked and felt my best when 
I went in that morning, 'cause I wanted to look like the All-American Kid 
From New York City. I wanted to feel like I wanted to be the 
All-american Kid from New York), and I walked in, sat down, I was hung down
Brung down, hung up and all kinds of mean, nasty, ugly things

And I walked in, I sat down, they gave me a piece of paper that said ""Kid
See the psychiatrist in room 604""

I went up there, I said, ""Shrink, I want to kill. I want to kill! I want to see 
Blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth! Eat dead, burnt bodies! I 
Mean Kill. Kill!""

And I started jumpin' up and down, yellin' ""KILL! Kill!"" and he started 
Jumpin' up and down with me, and we was both jumpin' up and down, yellin' 
""Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!"" and the sergeant came over, pinned a medal on me
Sent me down the hall, said ""You're our boy"". Didn't feel too good about it

Proceeded down the hall, gettin' more injections, inspections, detections 
Neglections, and all kinds of stuff that they was doin' to me at the thing 
There, and I was there for two hours three hours four hours I was 
There for a long time goin' through all kinds of mean, nasty, ugly things
And I was just havin' a tough time there, and they was inspectin', 
Injectin', every single part of me, and they was leavin' no part untouched!

Proceeded through, and I finally came to see the very last man. I walked in, 
Sat down, after a whole big thing there. I walked up, and I said, ""what do 
You want?"" He said, ""kid, we only got one question, have you ever been 
Arrested?""

And I proceeded to tell him the story of Alice's Restaurant Massacree with 
Full orchestration and five-part harmony and stuff like that, and other phenomenon

He stopped me right there and said, ""kid, have you ever been to court?"" And 
I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty-seven 8 x 10 colored glossy 
Pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one 

He stopped me right there and said, ""kid, I want you to go over and sit down 
On that bench that says 'Group W'""

And I walked over to the bench there, and there's Group W is where they 
Put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after committin' 
Your special crime

There was all kinds of mean, nasty, ugly-lookin' people on the bench there
There was mother-rapers father-stabbers father-rapers! 
Father-rapers sittin' right there on the bench next to me! And they was mean 
And nasty and ugly and horrible and crime fightin' guys were sittin' there 
On the bench, and the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one the meanest 
Father-raper of them all was comin' over to me, and he was mean and 
Ugly and nasty and horrible and all kinds of things, and he sat down next to 
Me. He said, ""Kid, what'd you get?""

I said, ""I didn't get nothin'. I had to pay fifty dollars and pick up the garbage.""

He said, ""What were you arrested for, kid?"" and I said, ""litterin'""
And they all moved away from me on the bench there, with the hairy eyeball 
And all kinds of mean, nasty things, till I said, ""And creatin' a nuisance"" 
And they all came back, shook my hand, and we had a great time on the 
Bench talkin' about crime, mother-stabbin', father-rapin', all kinds 
Of groovy things that we was talkin' about on the bench, and everything was fine

We was smokin' cigarettes and all kinds of things, until the sergeant came 
Over, had some paper in his hand, held it up and said
""Kids, this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-
Know-details-of-the-crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-
You-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-
Officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say""

And he talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he 
Said

But we had fun fillin' out the forms and playin' with the pencils on the 
Bench there

I filled out the Massacree with the four-part harmony. Wrote it down there 
Just like it was and everything was fine. And I put down my pencil, and I 
Turned over the piece of paper, and there on the other side in 
The middle of the other side away from everything else on the other 
Side in parentheses capital letters quotated read 
The following words ""kid, have you rehabilitated yourself?""

I went over to the sergeant. Said, ""Sergeant, you got a lot of god-damned 
Gall to ask me if I've rehabilitated myself! I mean I mean I 
Mean that you send I'm sittin' here on the bench I mean I'm 
Sittin' here on the Group W bench, 'cause you want to know if I'm moral 
Enough to join the army, burn women, kids, houses and villages after bein' a 
Litterbug""

He looked at me and said, ""kid, we don't like your kind! We're gonna send 
Your fingerprints off to Washington""!

And, friends, somewhere in Washington, enshrined in some little folder, is a 
Study in black and white of my fingerprints

And the only reason I'm singin' you the song now is 'cause you may know 
Somebody in a similar situation

Or you may be in a similar situation, and if you're in a situation like 
That, there's only one thing you can do

Walk into the shrink wherever you are, just walk in, say, ""Shrink, you 
Can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant"", and walk out

You know, if one person, just one person, does it, they may think he's 
Really sick and they won't take him

And if two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're both faggots and 
They won't take either of them

And if three people do it! Can you imagine three people walkin' in, singin' 
A bar of ""Alice's Restaurant"" and walkin' out? They may think it's an 
Organization!

And can you imagine fifty people a day? I said FIFTY people a day 
Walkin' in, singin' a bar of ""Alice's Restaurant"" and walkin' out? Friends
They may think it's a Movement, and that's what it is THE Alices's
Restaurant anti-massacre movement! And all you gotta do to join is to 
Sing it the next time it comes around on the guitar

With feelin'

You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant
You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant
Walk right in, it's around the back
Just a half a mile from the railroad track
You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant",Alice's Restaurant Massacree

And I still ain't had no sleep
She comes waItzing in the nighttime
Made of wings
She is dressed up like a bandit
With a hundred sparkling rings
Looking for my company to keep
Coming closer to me
She doesn't say a word
In the shadow of the carved rock tower
Where the sounds of the night
Were the only things we heard
In my darkest hour

She don't want to hear no secrets
She would guarantee me that
She knows there ain't no words
That can describe her
With her white silk scarves
And her black Spanish hat
She knows there ain't no way I can deny her
Yes her blue velvet perfume
Filling up the night
The guards are all asleep
That watch the tower
The moon light held her breast
As she easily undressed
In my darkest hour

Her father's in his chambers with his
Friends all gathered 'round
They are plotting their enemy's demise
With their last detail done
They await the coming sun
While I am staring in my lover's eyes
Her brothers and her sisters
Are all through for tonight
Pretending that they've just
Come into power
But she far most of all, knows that they
Can only fall
In my darkest hour

Hungry wings; their melodies
While my love awakens me
In the midst of the sunburst first light
Her hands are holding up the skies
As I hid my opened eyes
Every move just for herself
And that's so right
Soon I went along my way
With no words that could explain
As she began descending to the tower
Her safety now concerns me
Her circumstance to blame
In my darkest hour",Darkest Hour

Come all you old time cowboys
And listen to my song
Please do not grow weary
I'll not detain you long
Concerning some wild cowboys
Who did agree to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the range of the buffalo.

Well I found myself in Griffin
In eighteen eighty-three
When a man by the name of Creagho
Come a'walkin' up to me
Sayin ""How do you do young fella
And how'd you like to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the range of the buffalo"".

Well me being out of work right then
To that drover I did say
""My goin' out on the buffalo range
Depends upon the pay
But if you pay good wages,
Transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
On the range of the Buffalo"".

Well yes I pay good wages
And transportation too
If you'll agree to work for me
Until the season's through
But if you do get homesick
And you try and run away
You'll starve to death out on the trail
And you'll also lose your pay

Well with all the flatterin' talkin'
He signed up quite a train
Some ten or twelve in number
Of able bodied men
And our trip it was a pleasant one
Through all New Mexico
Until we crossed Pease River
On the range of the buffalo

It was there our pleasures ended
And our troubles all begun
A lightnin' storm come up on us
And made the cattle run
We got full of the stickers
On the cactus that did grow
And the outlaws waited to pick us off
In the hills of Mexico

Well the working season ended
But the drover would not pay
He said ""You spent your money boys
You're all in debt to me"".
But the cowboys never put much stock
In a thing like a bankrupt law
So we left the bastard's bones to bleach
On the range of the buffalo.

Arlo Guthrie,"There's a tavern up on the roadside, I must be coming into town
The moon must be in Aries, because the truck ain't slowing down
Pulled back on the throttle, I've been doing that all day
Looking ahead for a right-hand turn to carry me away

There's times for understanding, it don't seem like one of those
The times are too demanding when you're hanging by your nose
So why don't you just get out of here and leave me here to pray?
That one of these mornings the sun's going to rise and carry me away

Carry me over the highway
Carry me over the sky
Carry me over the loneliness
That I'm feeling here tonight

You know I'm feeling just like a riptide and I'm feeling a little scared
A twisted maze of old highways, nobody has repaired
It ain't nothing that can't be handled like an actor in a play
Who becomes enraged, jumps from the stage and gets a little carried away

Now all of your highways, don't mean much to me no more
I've been on all of your highway roads of that you can be sure
But I still get lost on all of them roads, I can't seems to find my way
I know there's one out there somewhere to carry me away

Carry me over the highway
Carry me over the sky
Carry me over the loneliness
That I'm feeling here tonight
",Carry Me Over
Arlo Guthrie,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

I remember when I met you
Underneath the evening sky
Now it seems I could forget you
Rescue me, I'm bound to die

All the promises we made there
With no words to understand
And though I've tried I've come up empty
Heart of stone, drowning man

CHORUS:
I'm going down for the third time
And I need a helping hand
The rooster crows and I'm sinking
Heart of stone, drowning man

Where are you, my dear companion
How much longer must you be
I'm all alone out on the ocean
When will you come and rescue me

It's too late for new beginnings
In this world I've left behind
There is nothing left worth keeping
Not a thing to change my mind

CHORUS

How far down the road to glory
Must we go without a sign
Caught out on these stormy waters
How can you treat me so unkind

Did you know from the beginning
That I'd dig this lousy hole
Oh, don't leave me here abandoned
In this dark night of the soul

CHORUS



",Drowning Man
Arlo Guthrie,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

And for myself I have no regrets
That time has taken what it soon forgets
A gambler's paradise in short vignettes

These stolen moments from the hourglass
A burning candle while the night-time lasts
Upon my pillow where my dreams float past

And all my memories seem to come alive
I think of everyone who still survives
And those who haven't may yet still arrive

I want to take the time to let you know
I've had a hard time letting feelings show
And through it all I love you even so

A poet's pleasure is to hear in time
The painter pictures what he's left behind
I close my eyes and it all leaves my mind

I sit alone and hear the sparrow sing
No way of knowing what tomorrow brings
I leave my solitude upon his wings



",Epilogue
Arlo Guthrie,"I dream in the morning
That she brings me water
And I dream in evening
That she brings me wine

From Puerto Penasco

There's a great hot desert
South of Mexicali
And if you don't have water
Then you better not go
Tequila won't get you
Across the desert
To Evangelina in old Mexico

And the fire I feel for the
Woman I love
Is driving me insane
Knowing she's waiting
And I just can't get there
Lord only knows that I've
Racked my brain
To try and find a way
To see that woman in old Mexico

I met a kind man
Who guarded the border
He said you don't have papers
But I'll let you go
I can tell that you love her
By the look in your eyes now
She's the rose of the desert
In old Mexico

And the fire I feel for the
Woman I love
Is driving me insane
Knowing she's waiting

In the event of my demise
Be sure to include this statement
When you are bent on closing my eyes
Thinking about what my life meant

Alone on a hill back in '65
Things looked a lot like changing
Singing our songs that we harmonized
Dreaming of worlds rearranging

And I don't know why I'm singing tonight
Maybe it's time someone told you
Just because you say you've seen the light
Doesn't mean nobody sold you

I can remember all of your smiles
During the demonstrations
Taking on what seemed like the whole world
Igniting the hearts of our nations

And together we sang our victory songs
Though we were worlds apart
Every thing then has now passed away
Except for the love in my heart

Sitting at home on computerized beds
Tryine to come to conclusions
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads
Ignoring the states of illusion

Drunk in a world of material wealth
No one can notice you falling
Fantastic flights once good tor your health
Now make you deaf to your calling

And all alone the prophet groans
With words as yet unseen
Who'll be awake when the master returns
Who will be lost in their dreams

So in the event of my demise
8e sure to include this statement
Only the words of love kept alive
Are worthy of not being wasted




",Prologue
Arlo Guthrie,"Every morning just as soon as it's light
Get out of bed and I'm feeling alright
Make me some coffee and I sit down alone
The rest of the day I'm on the telephone

Hang up, hold on
You got a dime so you come on so strong
Save your money and let me be
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me

I got a phone in my bedroom and one in the barn
A phone in my car and one in the yard
A phone on my saddle for when I'm out on the range
A phone in my pocket for when I'm down at the grange

Hang up, hold on
You got a dime so you come on so strong
Save your money and let me be
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me

Now with devaluation all over the land
The whole wide world has got more money in their hand
They'll be calling me up from Peking and Nome
I'm going to rip out my telephone

There's a river running underground
That roll along the clay
That took my body when I laid it down
And carried it far away

It's too damned dark for you to see
So I did not protest
My soul shook free, you can't have me
But you may keep the rest

The waters weep, the sickles reap
My hands are cold with sweat
The eagle screams with frightened wings
The dust does not forget

There's a river running underground
That rolls along the clay
That tempts the sould to the ocean cold
To with the body lay




",Underground

Poor Adam alone in Eden
Taking off his shoes
Tired of running around all morning
From his animal interviews

He awoke with a hand on his brow
Askign who are you
They spent the rest of their lives together
Making their debuts
Dressed in leaves and wearing blues

Some say one thing, some say two
Ain't much about it anyone can do
Keep on walking till my soles wear through
Wearing away my shoes

Evening comes and the sky turns red
Clouds of colors cover up our heads
Ain't it something just to lie here in bed
Just me and you

Oh Mary, wrapped up in glory
What are you going to tell your groom
How's he going to feel on the day of your wedding
What will your friends assume

Oh, but Joseph and Mary were married
The angels carried the news
What the Lord has joined together
The world must not undo

Thene's a wedding down at the church this morning
Let's uo wish them well
It's a beautiful day for getting married
I hope the weather lasts as well

It's been years since we've been married
I know we paid some dues
Now ain't it something just to lie here together
Just me and you
Outlasting the blues



",Wedding Song
Arlo Guthrie,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

There's trouble all around the world
Well, it looks that way to me
People don't know what to do
They don't know where they should be

But just one question still remains
To which we must respond
Two roads lead from where we are
Which side are you on

CHORUS:
Are you on, boys
Which side are you on
Which side are you on, boys
Which side are you on

Moses crossed the desert
With a band of weary men
For forty years they wandered through
The hot and burning sand

And Moses went and prayed alone
The weary vagabond
And lightning wrote these words in stone
Which side are you on

CHORUS

Jesus stumbling through the streets
On the road to Calvary
Nailed high to testify
With other local thieves

And as they hung there dying
One asked what lay beyond
That all depends the master said
Which side are you on

CHORUS

Some men work for little things
And some men work for more
Some men work for anything
And some don't work at all

And me myself I'm satisfied
To sing for God's own son
And ask you what I ask myself
Which side are you on



",Which Side
Arlo Guthrie,"I've been keeping on the run
I've been traveling with the sun
I've been singing all my life and getting by
Got to keep up with what's going on
In this place I've been so long
And I guess I'll just keep singing all my life

And it's so good to come home
To a woman all alone
Forgetting how sad loneliness can be
She will take me from this world
Then she'll gently take the world away from me

I'll be coming home at night
While the kids are sleeping tight
She'll be lit by firelight and looking fine
And the kids jump out of bed
Hello Daddy, what did you get
Did you think of anything on down the line

She'll be talking with her smile
Saying, honey, wait awhile
The kids have missed you, soon they'll be asleep
She will take me from this world
Then she'll gently take the world away from me

Oh the prophets and the sages
And the wise men through the ages
All that's written down on pages from above
Just can't adequately describe
What I'm feeling here inside
It's just useless to be living without love

And I'll take her by her hand
Just a woman and a man
Without trying to understand what we should be
She will take me from this world
Then she'll gently take the world away from me

You've got to give it all that you got
Honey that's the thing to do
You've got to give it your best shot
Even when the world's closing' in on you

It's not an easy life we're livin'
But in the end if it's love you're givin'
Don't be afraid, don't give it up
Give it all you got

There's people around who are standin' right by your side
Walkin' hand in hand, they could follow you up to the sky
But if you leave 'em alone, they'll be on their own
And then there'll be reason to try,
What's the use payin' dues when you got no reason why

CHORUS

What do you do when there's so much in you
You can't feel the road that you're on
Say what needs to be said, get it all out your head
And you're back on the road before long

CHORUS



",Give It All You Got
Arlo Guthrie,"By Aaron Schroeder & David Grover

Where are the dreams
We dreamed when we were younger
Where are the songs we never got to sing
Oh how cold were the nights we slept without each other
Time doesn't wait, but time won't pass us by

If I could only touch your life
With just one part of me
You'll know how much you're needed
And I'll know I finally succeeded
If I could only touch your life with mine

So green the trees and oh so blue the skies
When you are looking through a lover's eyes
Darling these are the days, our days of love and laughter
There'll be no time for tears, the doubts and fears will fly

If I could only touch your life
With just one part of me
You'll know how much you're needed
And l'll know I finally succeeded
If I could only touch your life with mine

If I could only touch your life
With just one part of me
You'll know how much you're needed
And I'll know I finally succeeded
Oh won't you let me touch your life with mine



",If I Could Only Touch Your Life
Arlo Guthrie,"Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

[CHORUS:]
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
I must declare that my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their head they bear
Ackie rice and salt fish is nice
And the rum is good any time of year

Arlo Guthrie,"Coming down the highway, running like a wind
Gonna beat the sunset to the coast and back again
Moving through the shadows, almost going blind
Living like a legend before my time

If the road don't kill me, baby, I'll see you in the spring
Making up for lost time between us seems like everything
If I can make it home alright, you know, I'll treat you fine
Living like a legend before my time

I know, it wasn't easy for you, baby
With your man out on the road
So I'll be coming home tomorrow
To try to help you carry the load

I'm running out of highways and bridges to burn
This kind of living is taking its toll on what I've learned
You know, it ain't easy leaving you behind
Living like a legend before my time

But someday, baby, I'll be coming home to stay
Wrapped up in your warm love every night and every day
Ooh, I'm going out of my mind
Living like a legend before my time

I know, it wasn't easy for you, baby
With your man out on the road
So I'll be coming home tomorrow
To try to help you carry the load

I'll be getting up early 'cause I know, I'm coming home
I'm so tired of living this legend life alone
Kick off your shoes, babe, we'll drink a little wine
Forget about living like a legend before my time

Forget about living like a legend
Just forget about the road
So, look out for me, darling
On account of your man is coming home

Arlo Guthrie,"The power of love can make a blind man see
Can bring a man to his knees
The power of love can make a sultan grieve
Can make a skeptic believe

The power of love is south of south
And scorches out all the doubt
The power of love is the name of names
And burns away all the pain

Can make a bigot meek

Arlo Guthrie,"If I could go back home to the place I was raised
I'd catch the next bus and be there in a few days
But I just can't do it, I was raised on the road
I've got no place to go to, so l guess I'll stay on

There's dreams that I've had, I wrote in songs yesterday
But the waves of the world have washed them away
Still I carry them with me wherever I go
They're my only possessions on this slow boat back home

I've kept all my memories buried deep in my heart
Where time cannot touch them and rip them apart
Still I look for the hour when I will be free
From constantly dying and living on dreams

If I could go back home to the place I was raised
I'd catch the next bus and be there in a few days
My dreams in my pockets, my life, that's gone wrong
They're my only possessions on this slow boat back home

Arlo Guthrie,"Way out in Reno Nevada where romance blooms and fades
A great Philadelphia lawyer was in love with a Hollywood maid
Come love and we will wander down where the lights are bright
I'll win you a divorce from your husband and we can get married tonight
Wild Bill was a gun tottin' cowboy ten notches were carved in his gun
All the boys around Reno left Wild Bill's maiden alone

One night when he was returning from riding the range in the cold
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart her love was as lasting as gold
As he drew near her window a shadow he saw in the shade
Twas a great Philadelphia lawyer making love to Bill's Hollywood maid
The night was as still as the desert the moon hanging high overhead
Bill listened awhile to the lawyer he could hear every word that he said

Arlo Guthrie,"Have you heard of a ship called the good Reuben James
Manned by hard fighting men both of honor and fame?
She flew the Stars and Stripes of the land of the free
But tonight she's in her grave at the bottom of the sea.

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names,
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James

Well, a hundred men went down in that dark watery grave
When that good ship went down only forty-four were saved.
'Twas the last day of October we saved the forty-four
From the cold ocean waters and the cold icy shore.

It was there in the dark of that uncertain night
That we watched for the U-boats and waited for a fight.
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion roared
And they laid the Reuben James on that cold ocean floor.

Now tonight there are lights in our country so bright
In the farms and in the cities they're telling of the fight.
And now our mighty battleships will steam the bounding main
And remember the name of that good Reuben James.",The Sinking of the Reuben James
Arlo Guthrie,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

The sun is sinking down
I'm standing 'round my window
You say you're going away
But I believe in love

CHORUS:
The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide us to where we ought to be
You and me

The moon is coming up
And I'm still here in prayer
You say you've had enough
And that you just don't care

But while the stars are coming out
And light shines from above
You tell me in my dreams
That you believe in love

You say you're going away
And even though you do

The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide you home again to be...

Last night I had the strangest dream
I'd ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war

I dreamed I saw a mighty room
Filled with women and men
And the paper they were signing said
They'd never fight again

And when the paper was all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads
And grateful pray'rs were prayed

And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
While swords and guns and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

Last night I had the strangest dream
I'd never dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war.

They love to sing this song

Down on the road again
Starting where the mountains left me
I'm up where I began

Where I will go, the wind only knows
Good times around the bend
Get in my car, goin' too far
Never comin' back again

Tired and worn, I woke up this mornin'
Found that I was confused
Spun right around and found I had lost
The things that I couldn't lose

The beaches they sell to build their hotels
My father's and I once knew
Birds all along sunlight at dawn
Singing Waimanalo blues

Down on the road with mountains so old
Far on the country side
Birds on the wing forget in a while
So I'm headed for the windward side

All of your dreams, sometimes it just seems
That I'm just along for the ride
Some they will cry because they have pride
For someone who's loved here died

Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth

By the fire in that neat little cabin

Arlo Guthrie,"Arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie

So you ask me my kind friend
Why I am sad and still
And why my brow is darkened
Like the clouds upon the hill

Rein in your ponies closer
And I'll tell you all a tale
Of Utah Carroll, partner
And his last ride on the trail

In a grave without a headstone
Without a date or name
My partner lies there silent
In the land from which I came

Long ago we rode together
We'd ridden side by side
I loved him like a brother
And I wept when Utah died

While riding up one morning
And our work was almost done
The cattle quickly started
On a wild and maddening run

The boss's little daughter
Who was riding on that side
Rushed in to stop the stampede
It was there my partner died

Lenore upon her pony
Tried to turn the cattle right
But her blanket slipped beneath her
And she caught and held on tight

When we all saw that red blanket
Each cowboy held his breath
For should her pony fail her
None could save the girl from death

When the cattle saw the blanket
Almost dragging on the ground
They were maddened in a moment
And they charged with deafening sound

The girl soon saw her danger
And she turned her pony's face
And bending in her saddle
Tried the blanket to replace

Just then she lost her balance
In the front of that wild tide
Carroll's voice controlled the round up
""Lie still, Lenore"" he cried

And then close up beside her
Came Utah riding fast
But little did the poor boy know
The ride would be his last

Full often from the saddle
He had caught the trailing rope
To pick her up at full speed
Was now his only hope

He swung low from his saddle
To take her to his arm
We thought that he'd succeeded
That the girl was safe from harm

But such a strain upon his saddle
Had ne'er been put before
And the cinches gave beneath him
And he fell beside Lenore

When the girl fell from her saddle
She had dragged the blanket down
It lay there close beside them
Where they lay upon the ground

Utah took the blanket
And to Lenore he said
""Lie still"" and quickly running
Waved the red thing o'er his head

He turned the maddened cattle
From Lenore, his little friend
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him
He turned to met his end

And as the herd came on him
His weapon quickly drew
He was bound to die defended
As all brave cowboys do

The weapon flashed like lightning
And it sounded loud and clear
As the cattle rushed and killed him
He dropped the leading steer

When I broke through that wide circle
To where poor Utah lay
With a thousand wounds and bruises
His life blood ebbed away

I knelt down close beside him
And I knew that all was o'er
As I heard him faintly whisper
""Good-bye, my sweet Lenore""

Next morning at the churchyard
I heard the preacher say
""Don't think our kind friend Utah
Was lost on that great day

He was a much-loved cowboy
And not afraid to die
And we'll meet him at the round up
On the plains beyond the sky""

So you ask me my kind friend
Why I am sad and still
And why my brow is darkened
Like the clouds upon the hill

Rein in your ponies closer
And I'll tell you all a tale
Of Utah Carroll, partner
And his last ride on the trail



",Utah Carroll
Arlo Guthrie,"Words and music by Jimmy Rodgers

Cattle prowl and the coyotes howl
Out on the Great Divide
Never done no wrong, just singin' a song
As down the trail I ride

Rattle snakes rattle at the prairie dogs
You can hear that mournful tune
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west
When the cactus is in bloom
Yodel...

CHORUS
Daylight comes and the cowhands yell
They call out every man
Throw my saddle on my old cow horse
I drink my coffee from a can
The sun goes down on the cattle trail
And I'm gazin' at the moon
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west
When the cactus is in bloom
Yodel . . .

Now we don't have cold weather
It never snows or rains
This is where the sun shines best
Out on the western plains
Some of the boys are gone away
But they will be back soon
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west
When the cactus is in bloom
Yodel...

CHORUS



",When the Cactus Is in Bloom
Arlo Guthrie,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold",Woody's Rag/Hard Work
Arlo Guthrie,"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
Oh how precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Shall I be wafted to the skies
On flowery beds of ease
While others strive to win the prize
And sail on bloody seas

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see",Amazing Grace

Solo le pido a dios
Que lo injusto no me sea indiferente

Arlo Guthrie,"This land is your land, this land is my land
From [the] California to the [Staten] New York Island,
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters,
[God blessed America for me.]
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
And saw above me that endless skyway,
And saw below me the golden valley, I said:
[God blessed America for me.]

I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me , a voice was sounding:
[God blessed America for me.]

Was a high wall there that tried to stop me
A sign was painted said: Private Property,
But on the back side it didn't say nothing
[God blessed America for me.]

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling;
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:
[God blessed America for me.]

One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple
By the Relief Office I saw my people
As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering if
[God blessed America for me.]",This Land Is Your Land
Arlo Guthrie,"When I was younger she'd come to me in dreams
Her face was hidden in the mountain streams
Her voice disguised as the sound of the wind
The rustling of leaves, she would call from within

Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead

So many memories of those years have passed
Beyond the confusion, that thought would last forever
The countless veils that I wore like clothes
Have been stripped away, now stand here exposed

Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead

In the night when the moon casts no shadows at all
We sat by the fire as she started to call
Out to all who would hear that the death of what's dead
Is the birth of what's living and her words filled my head

Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead

It's the life that lies sleeping when you think you're awake
Forever is real and the rest is just fake
And though volumes are written on this subject alone
She used three simple words and she brought it all home

Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead
",Wake Up Dead

Arlo Guthrie,"Warm me from the wind and take my haand
A song is sounding, softly singing
My song is cast upon the rainbow waves
Forever splashing in the sunlight
Prove to me there's a love still left
In all of this emptiness around me
Take me from the chilling of the evening

Though you know my love that I must go
A-following the winds that blow inside me
I've nowhere left to run or hide
Except if you will come and run beside me
And even if you do there'll be a lot for us to do
To keep believing
Take me from the chilling of the evening

And now my time has come down many streets
I'm coming from a night decaying
The song that itself sings is all alone
I cannot even hear it playing
Now to leave before I understand
Just what it is I'm leaving
Take me from the chilling of the evening",Chilling of the Evening
Arlo Guthrie,"Sail with me into the unknown void
That has no end
Swept along the open road
That don't seem to begin
Come with me a love me, Babe
I may be back again
Meantime I'll keep sailing down
This highway in the wind

Evenings just begin the days
And follows with the night
To love you and to be with you
And say that it's all right
Love me while you have me, Babe
I may be back again
Meantime I'll keep sailing down
This highway in the wind

There's times I feel like going 
And there's times I want to stay
Times that I ain't feeling well
And times I feel ok
Now you have time to love me, Babe
And I may have time agian
Meantime I'll keep sailing down
This highway in the wind

The fortune teller tells me
I have somewhere to go
I look and try to understand
And wonder how she knows
So I must be going now
I'm losing time my friend
Looking for a rainbow
Down this highway in the wind",Highway in the Wind
Arlo Guthrie,"Like the tree that grows so tall
Leaves turn gold and then they fall
They've gone down, now they've grown
They're going home

Mountain streams may run and flow
Clean the sands on which they go
Stretching down like it had known
It's going home

Sunrise early in the dawn
Slips away, then it's gone
Leaves the night to carry on
While it's going home

Once a man he lived and died
What he said death could not hide
Even though it's often tried
But he was going home

Now my friends it's time to go
And this love will live to grow
And I want you all to know
I'm going home",I'm Going Home
Arlo Guthrie,"Had a friend, a friend I could trust
He went into the park and got busted
Doing the ring-a-round-a-rosy rag
Went in the park late at night
And he put a lot of people over eighty up tight
He was doing the ring-a-round-a-rosy rag

Ring around, ring around rose
Touch your nose and blow your toes and mind
Doing the ring-around-a-rosy rag
(It really was a drag)
Ring around, ring-around-a-rose
Touch your nose and blow your toes and mind
Doing the ring-around-a-rosy rag

We ought to send Officer Joe Strange
To some Australian mountain range
So we all can do the ring-around-a-rosy rag
Would you like to put Philadelphia up tight
One mass ring-around-a-rosy
In the middle of the night?
We all should do the ring-around-a-rosy rag",Ring-Around-A-Rosy Rag

If all the doors were closed in heaven
Where would all the angels go
Would they just fly around forever
Or would they come down here below

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
Would there be angels here tonight
And would they live their lives among us
And share the darkness with their light

If all the doors were close in heaven
They'd have to close the road to hell
We'd all be stuck here with each other
There would be nowhere else to dwell

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
And everyone there had to leave
And death was nothing but a moment
Beyond the breaths you took to breathe

If all the doors were closed in heaven
Who would dare abuse a child
Or let a little kid go hungry
Or not return a simple smile

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
And the host of heaven was on the street
I wonder if they'd look much different
From the likes of you and me

So I hope they close the doors to heaven
And all the angels up above
Come and build a home among us
Remind us what it is to love

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
Would there be angels here tonight
And would they live their lives among us
And share the darkness with their light



",Doors of Heaven
Arlo Guthrie,"Lyrics by Glen Anthony
Music by Charlie Chaplin

My love, you are the song
That sings inside of me
The song is always the same
It starts with love and ends with your name

The more that I love you
There's more in you to love
And yet I just don't know how
I could love you more than I do right now
They say that love grows old
But our love turned to gold
You kissed my sorrows away
You touched my heart
What more can I say

Each day my life is new
For God blessed me with you
And when my life is all through
Without a word you always knew
That all my life my life was you



",You Are the Song
Arlo Guthrie,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee

Would it be a sin
If I cant help falling in love with you

Armageddon,"Riding high on burnished wings
And with a brazen eye
The buzzard waits to take its pick
Waiting on that helpless cry
In the time it takes
The moment that you're right off guard
Bridges that you thought you'd crossed
Got to cross 'em all again

Just as lightning strikes
Before the thunder
The buzzard falls upon its prey
Before it has a chance to wonder
But the meek will stand
Understanding nature
Seeing far beyond the plan

Take their place in time
Take their place in timeless structure

Out, out of the dark surrounding shadows
Tearing apart ? trying to get to me
Sometimes you'll see, sometimes you'll feel
Colder than steel, instantly real

Burn, burning with fire, from the depths of time
Enter my space to take my grace from me

Far down inside ? waiting with pride",Buzzard

Better yet, let's fuck in the bathroom
If we have room it's a full moon.

Chorus:
It's a full moon out tonight
Party people here just feel alright
The place is packed and the mood is right
Now have a good time y'all
A good time y'all
I know y'all niggas ain't come here to fight
Ain't nothin but love so don't be uptight
Black Latin Asian and White
(repeat)

There's some hoes in this house
It's thick like them hoes from the south
Toothpick froze in my mouth
Y'all chicks don't know what I'm about
I did ""Retropsect For Life""
They think I got a wife
But I got style to mine
So I dog 'em like Phife or Snoop.
Already boned 3 out the group with my crew I rock steady like the park
I hear foot steps in the dark
From them househeads
Dancin in the circle in the house like curfew
To work you to the bone
Old school cuts get me in a zone
In the line I get restless
I'm straight I'm on the guestlist
The red light specialist
Love is the message
From B-Boy to raver expressions
I get open like the bar at the rap sessions
Diggin in the crate with Armand
The phenomenon
Com think faster than a Muslim doing Ramadan
I'm a wand 
in otherwords I'm wildin'
It's a full moon and peoples is howlin

Chorus
(repeat 2 times)

Living a life that I can't leave behind

The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
Well every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way
I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?

I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment

Armand Van Helden,"Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear

Insomnia

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep
I can't get no sleep

Sometimes he'll call me up
When he wants to play with me, play with me, play with me

We play all kinds of games
We both play hide and seek
Sometimes he'll find me fast
Sometimes it takes him weeks

Am I bit too old for games?
Too young to have a spouse
I like to try new things
I just like playing house

Although it's make believe
I know what love's about
Don't need no diamond ring

I'm not a little girl
He's not a little boy
He comes into my world
And we share all our time, all, all our time, all, all our time

You look me in the eyes
And kiss me on the mouth
We both have separate lives
We're only playing house

Although it's make believe
I know what love's about
Don't need no diamond ring

Ooh, but it feels like he loves me
When he's below or above me
If he ever sleeps away
I know he's thinkin' of me

And it feels like I love him
When I'm below or above him
And if he ever sleeps away
I'll have sweet memories of him

Armandinho,"Por que você não sai de trás da nuvem,
Pro mar ficar mais lindo, só falta você
A minh'alma fica mais tranqüila,
A vida harmoniza quando vejo você.
Hoje eu caminhei a praia inteira,
Com os pés na areia, oração em alto mar
Lembrar você me faz, pensar besteira,
Vida é brisa passageira não deixa passar
Lembrar você me faz, pensar besteira,
Praia Brava Lua cheia, cadê Analua.",Analua

Fugir da Babilônia (2x)

Aqui eu sou marajá,
A natureza é minha luxúria,
Viver de frente pro mar,
Sei que DEUS me ajudará (2x)

Fazer uma casinha no alto do morro
é tudo o que eu pedi pra Jah
Sair dessa cidade soltar o meu cachorro

Brisa do oeste soprar,
Sinto a esperança no ar
Maré cheia ajudará

Nas coisas mais simples da terra,
Às vezes a paz de um sorriso
Pode desarmar uma guerra

Aqui to mais perto de DEUS,
Curtindo meu filho brincar,
Cidade vou dizer adeus,
Não sei se eu vou voltar.

Somos novios
Mantenemos un cariño
Limpio y puro
Como todos
Procuramos el momento
Mas oscuro

Para hablarnos, para darnos
El mas dulce de los besos
Recordar de que color
Son los cerezos

Armando Manzanero,"Entre tu y yo no hay nada personal, 
Es sólo el corazón que desayuna, come y cena de tu amor 
En el café de la mañana, la canción de la semana 
Que muchas veces me emociona y otras tantas me hace daño. 

Entre tu y yo no hay nada personal, 
Y sin embargo duermo entre mis sábanas soñando con tu olor, 
Vives aquí en mis sentimientos, me ocupaste el pensamiento. 
Quizas te añore más no hay nada personal. 

Aunque inventes los detalles y te encuentre en cada calle 
Yo te juro que no hay nada personal. 
Sacas a flote mis tragedias y de repente las remedias. 
Me haces loco, me haces trizas, me haces mal. 

Y así en los dos no hay nada personal 
Te llevo en cada gota de mi sangre y en el paso de mi andar. 
No necesito arrinconarte ni antes de dormir besarte 
Y es que en nosotros ya no hay nada personal.

Armando Manzanero,"Sin noticias la vida y el mundo me esperan a diario
A donde yo vaya me sales al paso
Todavía me sigues, siempre vas conmigo
Y por más que espero, no hay noticias tuyas

Sin noticias la noche callada me trae tu aroma perfumando al viento
Mi cama vacía reclama tu cuerpo que fue mío un día
Luz de ayer de magia que aun sigue encendida

Sin noticias mantengo con vida las ganas de verte
Y mis puertas están siempre abiertas a todas tus suertes
Sin noticias descubro de nuevo que yo no te olvido
Que los besos que un día me distes los llevo conmigo

Sin noticias la noche callada me trae tu aroma perfumando al viento

Armando Noriega,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Armando Noriega,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence
Armando Noriega,"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you

A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

Armando Trovaioli,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Armin van Buuren,"For each forgotten kiss,
For all the memories,
For all the times a look,
Said all we had to say,

You played your part so well,
A modern Romeo,
You came on Cupids wings,
And then you flew away,

When you touched my face
When you call my name
I'm burned with desire

[Repeat x2]
When you touched my face,
When you call my name,
I'm burned with desire,

But you left me in the rain

For every sleepless night,
Forever in your arms,
For every hour spent,
Lost in the reverie,

You broke your promises,
No shame and no regrets,
You burned the bridges too,
An endless mystery.

When you touched my face (So beautiful)
When you call my name (My name)
I'm burned with desire

Armin van Buuren,"Leave me on the outside
Where I can feel the rain fill off my shoes
Cover me with kisses
And I will soon forget what I've been through

Run away forever
Leave me with no forwarding address
Find another lover
And leave me in the motion of undress

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I never asked you for anything
I never wanted this

Take my hand and look into my eyes

Will I stay but rather I would get away
I'm scared that I won't find a thing

I have to learn, have to try
I have to trust I have to cry
Have to see, have to know
That I can be myself

I see it all I'm sure but
Do I know what's right
I thought I knew but it turns out the other way
I am scared that I won't find a thing

I have to trust I have to cry
Have to see, have to know
That I can be myself

And if they're not, not in my way
I'll stare here in the distance
But I'll grow up to be just like you
I'll grow up to be just like you

Why would I try to

Can't you see?
If I let it go, will we reveal a sign of devotion?

Sometimes there's a moment
Sometimes we don't see
Now we stand to frighten, scared to believe

Now I wait for you
Till you wake me, from my sleep
And I'll wait for you
Let my voice be, yours to keep

The touch of your hand, on me
A night everlasting, comes too deep
Don't make me wait, for what I need
This passion is burning, deep in me

Sometimes there's a moment
Sometimes we don't see
Now we stand to frighten, scared to believe

Now I wait for you
Till you wake me, from my sleep
And I'll wait for you

And when its love seems the only conclusion,
That I'm guilty of,

Mmmm, oh yeah...

And you whisper to me when you,

Sometimes the way that you act makes me wonder,
What I am to you,
Sometimes I can't stand the way that I'm acting,
To be part of the things you do,
Often I've asked you for too much of your time,
I've been stealing,
And when I dream of the fear that you're leaving,
I reach out...

So many times have I asked you to tell me,
That I'm your girl,
Time after time I have needed a reason,
Just to get inside your world,
So many times have I asked you to ask me,
How it feels to love,
And when its love seems the only conclusion,
That I'm guilty of,
Oh baby then you,
Put your loving arms around me,
And you whisper to me when you,
Put your loving arms around me,

Of a bright neon bay

O how I feel all that I need
Under my thoughts under my fears

They make my soul complete

Little things and all they bring
Are fragments bitter sweet

Oh I'm still craving
To have you by my side

I know our love is fading
But soon it will shine

[Chorus 1]
And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out of my head
And my brain its going wrong

[Chorus 2]
And I will live today
And I will love tomorrow
No matter what is said or done
Even if its going wrong

Even if its going wrong
Even if its going wrong
You're burning out my head

I keep searching
Forever in your eyes
I'll be careful
But soon we will shine

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

Even if its going wrong 
Even if its going wrong
You're burning out my head

Even if its going wrong

[x3]
You're burning out my head
And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow

You're burning out my head

Won't you wait for me
Care for me

Where ever you go I'm home
I'll follow you

You're in my head in my heart in my soul
The air I breathe

You're in my head in my heart in my soul
The air I breathe

Yeah you're my favorite need

I'll follow you

When everything seems lost
I'm stuck and falling down
You will guide me home
So promise me

You'll stay with me
Won't you wait for me
Care for me
And never say never

Stay with me
