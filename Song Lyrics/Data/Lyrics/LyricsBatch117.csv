And One,"Imprisoned in the cell of hell
My execution sealed by law
Since years I'm longing for your smell
But hope is ending at the door

Your phone is ringing once a week
It's good to hear a voice like home
Just twenty seconds left to speak
My love died with a busy tone

But this day something takes too long
Instead of hello just a noise
The number's right, this voice is wrong
It's killing time, I have no choice

What will happen to me
Tell me which love's killing the mercy
A dead man's swimming over the sea
He won't to be (the one who will feel you)
Now it happen to me
Tell me who's gonna die in the deep sea
Killing the mercy (who will feel you?)

I hear the footsteps on the floor
A jailer's scream, a falling key
My life is ending here once more
The time has come to kill me free

With the barrel pointing at my face
I'm knocking on her sinful door
The trigger seals the act of grace
She'll never call me anymore",Killing the Mercy
Andain,"Woke up today in casts of blue
And helplessly pretending
We'll get better over time
Quit bars and chains, the road anew
I got away still under you

So please don't make more promises to me
And please don't take everything from me
And I will breathe in every word you mean
If you could please promise them to me

Oh oh oh

Fell on the way to getting through
Collect the days of bad things, so it's better all the time
I never notice shades and hues
Away and safe still under you

So please don't make more promises to me
And please don't take everything from me
And I will breathe in every word you mean
If you could please promise them to me

Oh oh oh

So please don't make more promises to me
And please don't take everything from me
And I will breathe in every word you mean
If you could please promise them to me",Promises [Original Mix]
Andain,"The pills, the chills, until it fills her still, the thrill,
No will to stop this feeling.
The lights, all night, the bass, no trace of pain,
No blame, no name, forever smiling.
The dawn all gone, the pain, the blame,
The taste, the waste, the haste of love is born.
Blank eyes are hard to ignore.
Can't bear to stare anymore.

The sun, the sun, can't bog the fog
The grey remain it fades into everything.
Get up, get up, the clock won't stop,
Must talk to work, usurp the desperation.
Trucks zoom, day looms, smell fumes, loud boys, such noise
A car, a jar breaks on the street.
Blank eyes are so hard to meet.
Can't bear it's too much to see 'cause,

She sings her ave maria.
What is this happening for?
And nothing seems to free her
Longing for more.

With friends, no friends, moods tent to fall and stall the call,
It all means less than nothing.
It tears the glare of doubt, the shouts, just hear the fears
And tears that ring in the head.
Time bides, hope dies, inside feel sore, long for the date,
Must wait just one more week.
Blank eyes fill so easily.
Who's there to fill all the need but,

She's singing ave maria.
What is this happening for?
And nothing seems to free her
Longing for more.

The pills, the chills, until it fills her still, the thrill,
No will to stop this feeling.
The lights, all night, the bass, no trace of pain,
No blame, no name, forever smiling.
The dawn all gone, the pain, the blame,
The taste, the waste, the haste of love is born.
Blank eyes are hard to ignore.
Can't bear to stare anymore.

She's singing ave maria.
What is this happening for?

She's singing ave maria.
What is this happening for?

Andain,"Turn up the sound make it feel louder

Open the dark side of me
Find what your faith needs to be
Help me gain focus on you
Heart bleeds I know what to do

Turn up the sound now
Make it feel louder
Who is this playing
Are you still here
Who's all around now
Are you still listening
What are they saying
Words that aren't clear
Turn up the sound now
Lost in the crowd and
I haven't heard this one before
Turn up the sound now
What are you saying
No I'm not listening anymore

Please don't confess to the sin
Unless you are set to begin
Fallout seems more than just trust
Walls down dive into us",Turn Up the Sound
Andanzas 2,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17 [To Be Seventeen Again]
Andee,"What's up with you 
And that Caroline girl
Heard she was fine, 
Is she rocking your world
Love may be blind
But I'm not
Baby no I'm not

At first it was fresh
Bet the sex was good
Then when I left, 
You said next, you should
Make up your mind
But you're not
Ready, no you're not

Sooner or later, 
Waking up at her home
It's gonna start feeling like I was never gone

Inside your head
It will be like I was never gone
It won't be long
Before it feels like I was
Never gone, never gone, never gone
Like I was never gone, 
Never gone, never gone
Never gone

Heard things were getting pretty serious
She's moving in by the end of August
She's doing fine but you're not
Baby no you're not

Does she know you've been calling me at night
Saying ""I miss you, baby you were right""
Does she know that
You are not ready
No you're not

Sooner or later, 
You'll get a dog, buy a home

It won't be long
Before it feels like I was
Never gone, never gone, never gone
Like I was never gone, never gone, never gone

You'll see my eyes in your wedding cake
Picture my child in your daughter's face
And try your best to be moving on
But it's still gonna feel just like I was never gone

Inside your head
It will be like I was never gone
It won't be long
Before it feels like I was
Never gone, never gone, never gone
Like I was never gone, 
Never gone, never gone

Inside your head
It will be like I was never gone
It won't be long
Before it feels like I was

Andee,"I talk before I think
I say some crazy things
I have foot in mouth disease
And there may never be a cure for me

And I laugh when I wanna cry
I hide behind a smile
But I really do mean well
Even though it may be hard to tell

And I know that there will come a day
When you wish that I was more than this
And as hard as I've been trying to change
You can be sure that I know
Sure that I know

Let's get the sorries out of the way
Let's get the sad look over your face
'Cause it hurts me more to say
That I could make you hate me, hate me
When baby you're the best thing best thing
That ever happened to me, to me
Let's get the sorries out of the way
Out of the way
Out of the way
Out of the way

Baby I'm probably gonna damage you
Without even meaning to
I will cover you in bubble wrap
But it just doesn't work like that
I've been let down before
Every day there's another war
But I will be your front line
I'll fight your fight just like
Like it was mine

Let's get the sorries out of the way
Let's get the sad look over your face
'Cause it hurts me more to say
That I could make you hate me, hate me
When baby you're the best thing, best thing

Let's get the sorries out of the way
Out of the way
Out of the way

It's only poison
If you can't admit
That we hurt the ones we love the most
And baby you are it

'Cause it hurts me more to say
That I could make you hate, me hate

Anders Bergcrantz,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Anders Holst,"She waits for me at night
She waits for me in silence
She gives me all her tenderness
And takes away my pain
And so far she hasn't run
Though I swear she's had her moments
She still believes in miracles
While others cry in vain

It's all about soul
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion
It's all about soul
'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion
She's got to be strong
'Cause so many things getting out of control
Should drive her away
Why does she stay?
It's all about soul

She turns to me sometimes
And she asks me what I'm dreaming
And I realize I must have gone
A million miles away
And I ask her how she knew
To reach out for me at that moment
And she smiles because it's understood
There are no words to say

It's all about soul
It's all about knowing what someone is feeling
The woman's got soul
The power of love and the power of healing
This life isn't fair
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold
You've got to get tough,
But that ain't enough
You got to have soul

There are people who have lost
Every trace of human kindness
There are many who have fallen
There are some who still survive
And she comes to me at night
And she tells me her desires
And she gives me all the love I need
To keep my faith alive

It's all about soul
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow
It's all about soul
Who's standing now?

Who's standing tomorrow?
You've got to be hard
Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n' roll
But that's only part,
You know in your heart
It's all about soul

Anders Jormin,"Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tant",Gracias a La Vida

Anders Osborne,"Half a mile from the county fair
And the rain came pourin' down
Me and Billy standin' there
With a silver half a crown

Hands are full of a fishin' rod
And the tackle on our backs
We just stood there gettin' wet
With our backs against the fence

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

Then the rain let up and the sun came up
And we were gettin' dry
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned

And he dropped us up the road
Yeah, we looked at the swim and we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Let it run all over me

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

On the way back home we sang a song
But our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man from across the road
With the sunshine in his eyes

Well he lived all alone in his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you
And he said Hey! There you are

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Get it myself from the mountain stream

And it stoned me to my soul

That out of this I'm coming strong

Open to so many things            
Now she has become a small town girl

She fell down-down, down, down, down in Holland
Oh yeah, a ha, oh yeah, a ha

She had the picture of me as the man
To take her worries away
I tell you I did everything I can
But I had to go my own way

And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe,"In 1954 the British Government, 
In order to maintain the balance
Of power between East and West, 
exploded their first atom bomb at Woomera. 
They failed to contact all of the Aborigine peoples 
atthe time. The Aborigines still call this 
'The day of the cloud.'

Dreaming by the sky
The scent of colours
In the flowers

Believe it's small
In many ways
It holds the key
That divides the super powers

This road is never lonely
To England they are tied
They were blasted by the Silver Cloud
There were blasted to the wall alive

This place, this place ain't big enough for stars and stripes
Counting out the statesmen
Bungling one by one
Spelling out this segregation
So the catchword be
Looking after number one
They release the fear inside
Are human after all
So begins our dream time
They hunted like the dinosaur
We the pure
They the savage innocent
How we crush our existence after all
Come on

For without them
We are lonely
This England we are blind
Like all the Empires crumble
Will surely change the tide

This place ain't big enough for red and white
This place ain't big enough for stars and stripes

This place, this place
This place is theirs, by their birthright
This place

The sun gives better reasons
United we are blind
To deliver our existence
Keep it up
Keep it up
This human tide, give it some

We can break the ties
Of recent changes
Know the ones who
Hold the key

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa

Will not be patient no more

I don't want to hide
I want to run wild
Don't want to patient
Will not be patient
Let me just fly
One time only try
Don't want to patient
Will not be patient no more",Patient
Andi Starr,"Take me down to your healing waters.
Take me down to your healing waters.
Talk to me like a good friend.
I want to talk to you like a good friend.

But they say I can't know you.
They say I don't know you.
I want to know you.
I think I know you.

You came before me and said,

'You have eyes but do not see,
ears but do not hear.'
I want to see, I want to hear
the beauty in this mess of things,
your beauty in this mess of things.

Take me down to your healing waters.
Take me down to your healing waters.
Talk to me like a good friend.
I want to talk to you like a good friend.

But they say I can't know you.
They say I don't know you.
I want to know you.
I think I know you.

Baby, talk to me like a good friend.

I want to talk to you like a good friend.
