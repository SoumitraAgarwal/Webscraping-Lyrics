Lawson,"Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money
Imagine if money just grew on trees
I would spend the whole day planting seeds
I wish that I could give you everything
And treat you to the world's most beautiful things

I know you don't ask for nothing
You don't want material
But I want to show you heaven
And you know someday I will

I'd give you every diamond ring
Get that beach house by the sea
We'd be living like kings and queens
If I had money, money, money
Get you every pair of shoes
Saint Tropez on a yacht we'll cruise
We'd have nothing in the world to lose
If I had money, money, money

I know that being rich can't buy your love
Even if we're broke we won't give a fuck
'Cause you and me will always be enough
But you know I ain't giving up

I know you don't ask for nothing
You don't want material
But I want to show you heaven
And you know someday I will

I'll give you every diamond ring
Get that beach house by the sea
We'd be living like kings and queens
If I had money, money, money
Get you every pair of shoes
Saint Tropez on a yacht we'll cruise
We'd have nothing in the world to lose
If I had money, money, money

Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money

Ah, ah, ah
If I've got you (ah)
We'd have nothing in the world to lose
If I've got you (ah)
We'd have nothing in the world to lose

I'd give you every diamond ring
Get that beach house by the sea
We'd be living like king and queens
If I had money, money, money
Get you every pair of shoes
Saint Tropez on a yacht we'll cruise
We'd have nothing in the world to lose
If I had money, money, money

Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money (where's the money, where's the money)
If I've got you (where's the money)
We'd have nothing in the world to lose

We'd have nothing in the world to lose",Money [Acoustic]
Lawson,"You're not the girl I used to know
How the hell did you get so cold?
I bet you kick yourself to know
Where I've been since you let me go (yeah)
Now you wanna be with me (yeah)
But you let your colors show
And it's a long way home (home)

Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you brokenhearted
I thought you were all I wanted
All good since the day we parted
Now table's turned,
Lessons learned,
You got burnt, yeah
Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you broke, brokenhearted

La la la

I was standing in the dark girl,
But now I'm in control
And we're a million miles apart
But tell me why you sold your soul
'Cause now you are the lonely one
Since you let your colors show
Baby it's a long way home (home)

Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you brokenhearted
I thought you were all I wanted (wanted)
All good since the day we parted
Now table's turned,

La la la

La la la (Yeah)
La la la (Hey, Lawson, what's up?)
La la la (Yeah)

It's funny how the table's turned
I used to go for you but I was not your main concern
(So it burned) I had to let it burn
Expect the unexpected you never know what you learn
You never know what you do or what you'll get in return
See life is like a mission, you only get what you earn
But you would be in attention you really didn't deserve
But now we're feeling vicious
I kicked the bitch to the curb
And you have been booted
That's just how we do it
If I had a remote then you would be muted
But you made your choice and now you feeling foolish
But ask me how I feel
I don't give a mass of two shits (Ha!)

La la la

Hey girl look at what you started

Now you're living, now you're living, now you're living with a broken heart
Now you're living, now you're living, now you're living with a broken heart

Lawson,"People stop to turn and stare
Everywhere she goes
Dollar signs and crimson hair
She will steal your soul
Sets her sights on billionaires
All she wants is gold
She is straight up rock and roll
I'm telling you she knows

She know oh oh oh ee oh oh
She know oh oh oh ee oh oh

Nobody does it like Juliet
Juliet, what you do to me
The way she does it is criminal
Physical and it's killing me
Nothing wrong in these allegations
She know oh oh oh ee oh oh
Nobody does it like Juliet
Juliet, you are haunting me

Pulls you with her perfect smile
Pretty soon you're done
One more sucker pays the price
Thinking you're the one
Many men have tried and failed
Captured by her bold
Stay away from Juliet
You will lose control

She know oh oh oh ee oh oh
She know oh oh oh ee oh oh

Nobody does it like Juliet

Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh

You say that you wanna live your life,
That you wanna take some time away from you and me,
You say that you'll always love me still,
But you won't ever know until you've wasted all your time,

Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh

Everything I learned from you is never gonna be true,
'Cause everything we had in life has gone, gone, gone,
I said I'd give my heart to you,
But you don't even want me to,
Everything we used to be is gone, gone, gone,

Babe, now you're like the rest of them,
Never be the same again,
Not able to return,

Everything I learned from you is never gonna be true,

Lawson,"There's a place we know
What's cold enough won't grow
We have seen the dark
And the dark took its toll

And the journey waits for no one
If no one breaks the mould
And our hearts are stronger
Than we know

That you and I could learn to love again
After all this time
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one
That you could still believe in me again
And after all our trials
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one

To awake I know
We made it through the storm
And someone saves their sweet embrace
For you and you alone

That you and I could learn to love again
After all this time
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one
That you could still believe in me again
And after all our trials
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one

Silence says to remember
We remember
To our souls in the shadow
In the shadows

That is how I knew you were the one
And that is how I knew you were the one",Learn to Love Again
Lawson,"Sitting here wide awake
Thinking about when I last saw you
I know you're not far away
Close my eyes and I still see you
Lying here next to me
Wearing nothing but a smile

I gotta leave right away
Counting cracks along the pavement
To see you face to face
Thinking about the conversation
I know I'm not one to change
I've never wanted nothing more
But as I walk up to your door

I'm standing in the dark
She's dancing on the table
Looking through the glass
She's someone else's angel
It may sound stupid that I'm wanting you back
But I'm wanting you back, girl
And now I'm standing in the dark dark
Oh dark dark

All I wanna do is hide
But I can't stop myself from staring
Wishing his hands were mine
I can't stop myself from caring
And as he turns down the lights
I'm feeling paralysed
And as he looks into her eyes

I'm standing in the dark
She's dancing on the table
Looking through the glass
She's someone else's angel
It may sound stupid that I'm wanting you back
But I'm wanting you back, girl
And now I'm standing in the dark, dark
Oh dark dark, oh dark dark, oh dark dark

Lawson,"Lights out and it's cold now
And there's nothing but an empty room in front of me
I'm wiped out and the line's down
And there's no sound like there used to be with you and me.

Can't sleep tonight
Keep on wondering why
I didn't see the signs, I didn't realise
Now I'm frozen
I had it all
Couldn't want anymore, more
But everything's stolen.

And now I realize I could have been a better man
I took it all for granted when I should have took your hand
You were the only thing I needed but I couldn't see
Just look around, there's nothing left of me
Everything's stolen, stolen, yeah
Everything's stolen, stolen, yeah

Words out, I won't stand down
Got your face up now on every wall of every street
I retrace every step I made back to
The place where it used to be, you and me.

I had it all couldn't want anymore, more
But everything's stolen.

I knew you had to leave me
But that don't make it easy, no no

You were the best of us
Gave me all you had but I messed it up

Lawson,"Some things I can live without
Like the way that you let me down
Don't wanna have to read about it
Couldn't even tell me face to face
Always doing it the easy way
Left wondering how long you planned it.

You're moving on to someone
And I don't belong to no one.

I can't do this heartbreak anymore
It keeps getting harder
Holding on to love's impossible
Like climbing a waterfall.

Head down in a crowded place
Then I saw ya and I walked away
I wonder if you saw me leaving
Didn't really wanna have to say
How ya doing where you been these days?
That's just the way I'm feeling.

Coz you're moving on to someone
And I don't belong to no one.

I can't do this heartbreak anymore
It keeps getting harder
Holding on to love's impossible
Like climbing a waterfall.

Yeah, I tried for you
Yeah, I died for you.

You went and left it all behind
You didn’t tell me
You didn’t warn me
Don't I ever cross your mind?

Friday night, broken plans
Then I see you, holding hands
With that guy, now it’s clear
As I watch my world disappeared

You went and left it all behind
You didn’t tell me
You didn’t warn me

Oh and I should have known
That I after everything
You were so cold, so cold...

Don't I ever cross your mind?

Lawson,"Lay with me on a street in the city
Find the still in the middle of crazy
Is this all that you wanted?

Just a leaf floating round in the shadows
Holding on tryna find out how to let go
When you think you got all that you wanted

Feel the ground shaking
Slowly we are waking up

There’s a red sky
Overhead tonight
That’s how I know
It’s gonna be alright
It’s gonna be alright

There’s a pier reaching out from the seaside
Breathe it in, breathe it out, open your eyes
Is this all that you wanted?

Feel the waves breaking
No more time wasting
Slowly we are waking up

There’s a red sky
Overhead tonight
That’s how I know
It’s gonna be alright
It’s gonna be alright

Beautiful wonder
Where did you come from?
Writing your name on the horizon
Filling the sky up
Burning like fire

Lay Quiet Awhile,"I've been waiting so long,
Just watching the phone, for you.
To wait, it takes, 
Love that's for real
And all, that I feel, inside to do.

I come prepared, to look in your eyes
And walk side by side,
With you--baby, baby.

Listen for tender words, I'd like to say
Like I love you today, and I'll wait
For you.
 
It's crazy, if you think, we're just friends.
Loving when, infatuation ends.
The wait for you, baby it now begins.

You sigh, when I come close to your heart.
You cry, from the start,
Please wait for me.
Your mind, shows, places you go,
And things you don't know.
Someday you'll grow.

Climbing a mountain high,
Your love I desire.
Inside my heart cries for you.

The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day...
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day [Layo & Bushwacka! Remix]

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.

simply rotten to something worse

I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

Lazarus," 

How can I be torn from the pages of history? huh?
How can my name scraped off the pyramid walls
when I sat with Pharoahs and Kings?
You think you know, but you have no idea

This track's here it's like a breath of fresh air
That shaved through sunrays families suffer on Sundays
Had to run astray, pack up and run away
Fountain of youth, found it, feel like da younger A
Make sure my son okay, shit, that's the da mission
College tuition, hope he get accepted to Princeton
If not got his bail for prison
I know the pressures of the oppressor It's hell living
Feel like I'm Mel Gibson, killing 'em kindly finally
Niggas untied me mami, love the punani, but I
Can't make you my Boni never, made for the cold weather
Hatas y'all know better, how can I fold? I was told to hold it together
Listen, no intermissions, I am, so in position, like, Ali and Liston
Who could? box me to distance, try me
Now the police call to give orders to creep on ya
I master the street corners relax in the feet sauna and
Fuck if y'all don't like I'm here and I'm shown niceness
Appear in my own likeness, I zone as my own phychic

Flow if a niggas holding my clothing'll get you open
I'm toasting in bitches posting approaching wit mixed emotions
And ready like military I'm varied like Ben and Jerry's
Comparing me to him is scary I'm leery as cemeteries
And losing is not inside me stay moving from paparazzi
I'm proving the angels got me, I'm cool but my game is cocky
And money can never make me, my guns they don't come wit safeties
I hung wit the ones that's crazy I come from the front of Macy's
Shopping and dropping eighties show stopping wit proper ladies
I'm hearing a lot of maybe's but nigga it's hot as AZ

Ha ha ha
Eyo it's a wrap baby, we got 'em right now, going platinum man, 202k
Brooklyn Stand up!

Lazlo Bane,"When I was young
I never needed anyone
And makin' love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't want to be, all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live, all by myself anymore

Some times I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure",All by Myself

And that cigarette you're smoking 'bout to scare me half to death
Open up the window, let me catch my breath

Lazyboy,"The warmest welcome to everybody reading the manual
The manual gives you the basic information
About the ingredients and the six step easy to follow guide
Please pay attention to the useful advice and the helpful tips
As we lead you through

Ingredients
You need, a small piece of thick paper as a mouth piece
The most common is to use the top side
From a hard top cigarette pack

You need large size rolling papers
One of the best brands on the market is smoking
Because their rolling papers are very thin
And are the perfect size

You need tobacco
The finest tobacco is hand rolling tobacco
But a second possibility
Is to use the tobacco from a normal cigarette

You need, pot, grass, ganja, marijuana
It has various names
But they all refer to the following three main types

Weed, weed is the bud from hemp plants
The effect is usually uplifting and mellow
Hash, hash is the pressed pollens and resins of the marijuana plant
You will experience a more relaxed feeling
And a stronger effect than weed

Skunk, skunk is the artificially grown hemp plant
And is usually the strongest of the three
There are different ways to make a joint
But we have produced this six step easy to follow guide

One, if you have hash you need to heat it and crumble it
If it's weed, you need to remove the seeds first
And then crumble it as well

Two, roll the mouth piece
Fold the end of the paper three times
And then roll it in to a cylindrical form

Three, take the rolling paper
And hold it with the gum side on top away from you
Four, now mix the weed, hash or skunk with the tobacco
On the rolling paper

A good mix makes the joint burn nice and smooth
But be careful
Half a gram is enough to get four people stoned
If you're beginners

Five, begin rolling
Place the mouth piece in one end of the rolling paper
Then start rolling from the middle going outwards
Let your thumbs do the walking
And try to give support and pressure with your fore fingers

Six, wet the glue and seal the joint
Now you have a joint
It?s up to you what you want to do with it",The Manual [Chapter 4]

No matter what race they are
Pray to God, love everybody'
Whoever loves you love them back

You know love is like a big pot hole
You can look at it but don't fall in it

Love? Well we've been married almost fifty years
You have to try real hard and work at it
And look away

Love it hurts and love is the truth
Love never lies, love is not jealous
And love is beautiful

Be faithful to the one you love
Remain true to the one you love

Be nice to everybody
And you know they'll do the same to you
They'll be nice to you

Be open to love, don't get blinded by love

Love is my Harley Davidson American made
Nothing like it in the world

I'm first in everything
If I can't love myself, I can't love you

Love the flower love the trees love everything

When you open your eyes in the morning
You say it's a love for me I'm happy

Don't settle no matter how old you are
If you're a girl thirty years old and your biological clock is ticking
Coz you feel like you have to have a child
Unless you find a person
Don't settle
Keep looking
Even if you don't find that person till your forty or forty five
Keep looking
Because once you do you'll find your soul mate
It's a love like no other

Follow your heart that it

Don't go after the beauties
That's only skin deep

There's a very thin line between
You know being open to love
And just letting someone take advantage of you

Keep it with god and in your heart
And it works out pretty good
You can't be evil, you gotta have good in your heart
So as I find me a girl, I show her what love is

Go with the flow

Never lose respect

Don't get your heart broken

Respect each other always
Of course we need love
Like in a relationship its like a roller coaster up and down
Like if I go in to another room and wait and count to ten and let it go

Be careful with it be very careful
But enjoy it at the same time
I mean don't be too weary

I think its all about yourself
Love yourself then it all kind of
It kinda goes out from that direction
I think a lot of people try to find things and people and cause
Without searching for it within themselves
You got to hit the base first
Or its all kinda hollow

Best thing to do is it talk about it
Whatever it is just talk
Even if it risks the other person getting angry
Whatever
You don't go to bed angry at each other
If you talk it though
I mean all the way though
At the end of it your back in love again
It's the cure all
It's the fix

Is there a recipe to love?
Communicate

Love is giving and forgiving
And that's the way it should be
Every one should love each other
Because there should be no hate in the world
Period
If everyone loved each other
There would be no problems in the world today
We would all be at peace
I believe in peace

Yo, love yourself above all else
Because you may have all your feeling up in somebody else
Love yourself more than anybody else

Love is the meaning of life
Do one cool thing to someone else
Each day

Make it
Whenever your gonna have love
Your gonna have pain
Just accept it

Women without a man is nothing 
Without her man is nothing 

Women have their faults 
Men only have two 
Everything they say and everything they do 

Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage 
They've experienced pain 
And have bought jewelry 
Women have two weapons 
Cosmetics and tears 

I'm a perfect house keeper 
Every time I leave a man I keep his house 
No women has ever hated a man 
Enough to give him back his diamonds 

Why don't women blink during foreplay? 
They don't have time 

Man women boy women girl

Men forget everything 
Women remember everything 

A girl can wait for the right man to come along 
But it doesn't stop her from having fun 
With all the wrong ones in the mean time 

The real reason why it's so difficult to find men 
Who are sensitive, caring and good looking
Is because they all have boyfriends already 

A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife spends 
A successful women is one who can find such a man

Women driver really means 
Someone who doesn't speed, tailgate, swear, make obscene gestures 
And has a better driving record than men have 

It's a guy thing really means 
Irrational, illogical, stupid and extremely low 

Oh don't fuss I just cut myself, it's no big deal 
Really means 
I'm about to die but before I die 
I want you to remember me as a strong proud man

Lazyboy,"The warmest welcome to everybody reading the manual 
The manual gives you the basic information 
The ingredients and the six step easy to follow guide 
Please pay attention to the useful guide and the helpful tips 
As we lead you through 

Ingredients 
You need 
A small piece of thick paper as a mouth piece 
The most common is to use the top side 
From a hard top cigarette pack 

You need large size rolling papers 
One of the best brands on the market is smoking 
Because their rolling papers are very thin 
And are the perfect size 

You need 
Tobacco 
The finest tobacco is hand rolling tobacco 
But a second possibility 
Is to use the tobacco from a normal cigarette 

You need 
Pot, grass, ganja, marijuana 
It has various names 
But they all refer to the following three main types 
Weed, weed is the bud from hemp plants 
The effect is usually uplifting and mellow 

Hash, hash is the pressed pollens and resins of the marijuana plant 
You will experience a more relaxed feeling 
And a stronger effect than weed 
Skunk, skunk is the artificially grown hemp plant 
And is usually the strongest of the three 

There are different ways to make a joint 

But we have produced this six step 
Easy to follow guide 

One, if you have hash you need to heat it and crumble it 
If its weed, you need to remove the seeds first 
And then crumble it as well 
Two, roll the mouth piece 
Fold the end of the paper three times 

And then roll it in to a cylindrical form 
Three, take the rolling paper 
And hold it with the gum side on top away from you 
Four, now mix the weed, skunk or hash with the tobacco 
On the rolling paper 

A good mix makes the joint burn nice and smooth 
But be careful 
Half a gram is enough to get four people stoned 
If your beginners 
Five, begin rolling 
Place the mouth piece in one end of the rolling paper 
Then start rolling from the middle going out wards 
Let your thumbs do the walking 
And try to give support and pressure with your for fingers 
Six, wet the glue and seal the joint 

Now you have a joint 
It's up to you what you want to do with it",The Manual (Chapter 4)
Lazyboy,"[ Chorus: ]
One life, one shot, one move, one God 
This is the truth yeah 
Word up for the lazy boy 
Word up for the lazy boy 
This is the truth 

You don't win silver you lose gold 
Stop earning the right to be 
You won the day you were born 
If you don't know what direction you should take 
You don't know where you are 

Success is a matter of luck, ask any failure 
Never let a fool kiss you, or let a kiss fool you 
We are born naked, wet and hungry 
Then things get worse 

Your success is measured by your ability to finish things 
Skepticism is the beginning of failure 
Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names 
There is no such thing as right or wrong 
Only consequences 

[Chorus]

All men are born equal 
But quite a few get over it 
We are the people our parents warned us about 
Sometimes I think the sure sign that life exists elsewhere in the universe 
Is that that none of them tried to contact us 

Be nice to nerds 
Chances are you'll end up working for one 
Do not get mad with others 
Because they know more than you 
It is not their fault 
If you do not change your beliefs 
Your life will always be like this 

Fantasy is as important as wisdom 
Do not try to satisfy everyone 
The biggest lie you can tell yourself is 
When I get what I want I will be happy 

[ Chorus ]

Don't take life too seriously, you won't get out alive 
It maybe your sole purpose in life 
Is to serve as a warning to others 
Life is shorter than expected 
What you're willing to accept is exactly what you're going to get 
You have control without being controlled 

Creativity is great but plagiarism is faster 
You are the very reason why everything happens to you

It's a natural plant that grows in the dirt. 
Do you know what's not natural?
80 year old dudes with hard-ons. That's not natural.
But we got pills for that.
We're dedicating all our medical resources to keeping the old guys erect,
But we're putting people in jail for something that grows in the dirt?

You know we have more prescription drugs now.
Every commercial that comes on TV is a prescription drug ad.
I can't watch TV for four minutes without thinking I have five serious diseases.
Like: ""Do you ever wake up tired in the morning?""
Oh my god I have this, write this down. Whatever it is, I have it. 
Half the time I don't even know what the commercial is…
People running in fields or flying kites or swimming in the ocean.
I'm like that is the greatest disease ever. How do you get that?
That disease comes with a hot chick and a puppy. 

The schools now… It is all about self-esteem in the schools now.
Build the kids' self-esteem, make them feel good about themselves.
If everybody grows up with high self-esteem, who is going to dance in our strip clubs?
What's going to happen to our porno industry?
These women don't just grown on trees. 
It takes lots of drunk dads missing dance recitals before you decide to blow a goat on the internet for fifty bucks.
And if that disappears, where does that leave me on a Friday night with my new high speed connection?

Masterminds are another word that comes up all the time.
You keep hearing about these terrorists masterminds that get killed in the middle east. 
Terrorists masterminds.
Mastermind is sort of a lofty way to describe what these guys do, don't you think?
They're not masterminds.
""OK, you take bomb, right? And you put in your backpack. And you get on bus and you blow yourself up. Alright?""
""Why do I have to blow myself up? Why can't I just…""
""Who's the fucking mastermind here? Me or you?""

Americans, let's face it: We've been a spoiled country for a long time. 
Do you know what the number one health risk in America is? 
Obesity. They say we're in the middle of an obesity epidemic.
An epidemic like it is polio. Like we'll be telling our grand kids about it one day.
The Great Obesity Epidemic of 2004.

""Oh, it was horrible Johnny, there was cheesecake and pork chops everywhere.""

Nobody knows why were getting fatter? Look at our lifestyle.
I'll sit at a drive thru. 
I'll sit there behind fifteen other cars instead of getting up to make the eight foot walk to the totally empty counter.
Everything is mega meal, super sized. Want biggie fries, super sized, want to go large. 
You want to have thirty burgers for a nickel you fat mother fucker. There's room in the back. Take it!
Want a 55 gallon drum of Coke with that? It's only three more cents.

Sometimes you have to suffer a little bit in your youth to motivate yourself to succeed in later life.
Do you think if Bill Gates got laid in high school, do you think there'd be a Microsoft?
Of course not.
You got to spend a long time in your own locker with your underwear shoved up your ass before you start to think,

I was about to give it to him and then I thought he was going to use it on drugs or alcohol.
And then I thought, that's what I'm going to use it on.
Why am I judging this poor bastard.
People love to judge homeless guys. Like if you give them money they're just going to waste it.
Well, he lives in a box, what do you want him to do? Save it up and buy a wall unit?
Take a little run to the store for a throw rug and a CD rack? He's homeless.
I walked behind this guy the other day. 
A homeless guy asked him for money.
He looks right at the homeless guy and says why don't you go get a job you bum.
People always say that to homeless guys like it is so easy.
This homeless guy was wearing his underwear outside his pants.
Outside his pants. I'm guessing his resume isn't all up to date.

From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached

From this position
I can say ""serious"" or ""cop-out"" or ""hard to define""
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death

You on the outside
Me on the inside
There's advantage to both

And me being uptight
And you being all right
There's advantages to each

From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home and have learned a little more about my neighbourhood, which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat

So it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

So it's pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

With you on the keystroke
And me in the gang blank
There's advantages to both

And you have been all right
And I have been filmed being ridiculous
Oh, eat it, Michael Musto
You're no Bruce Valance

I have been untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each

And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?

I'm paralyzed and looking through you
But if nothing's right, we try anyway

As we compromised an arrogant person
I'm amazed at my decision to blame

On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we learned from fact magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night, so you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up, because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from your TV

So times have been tough, and times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, erased out
But honestly, and be honest with yourself, how much time do you waste? How much time do you blow every day?

So pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

The return of the police

With you on the inside
Me on the outside
There's advantage to both

With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each

From this position, I feel affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly, I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it

Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

A couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

For an instant, you could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized regret anyway

Una luce chiara si affaccia lentamente
Offre la visione di grandi bolle bianche
La gente che le abita vive un nuovo giorno
Una nuova festa oggi come ieri.
Non ci son segreti nelle sfere trasparenti
Si specchiano nell'aria si contagiano la gioia
Limpidi e sereni volano I pensieri
Le donne e le cicale discorrono d'amore.
Le case di cristallo si muovono col vento
Scorrono le valli, rimbalzano sul mare
Ruotano leggere nel sorvolare I monti
Lasciano una scia come una cometa.
Quando cala il sole il vento si riposa
Si fermano le sfere e formano un villaggio
La gente si ritrova e si corre incontro
Per un'altra festa mentre muore il giorno.

Mi son svegliato all'improvviso
Con tanto freddo intorno
Guardo se see'è il sole.
Ma che cosa mi succede
Ho un gran buco qui sul petto.
Cerco di uscire dalla stanza
Ma la mia porta è chiusa
Non posso più volare.
Cosa è cambiato questa notte
Se ho voluto star con lei?.
Storia o leggenda dammi la chiave
Flauti incantati devo seguire
Mentre sognavo un'altalena
Oggi qualcuno mi ha preso il cuore.
Scende la sera breve
Quante finestre già si chiudono
Torna più grigio il fiume
Forse una perla rester& sospesa.

Illuminata dalla tua immensa statua.
Dona libertà per il tuo amato eroe accolto e poi nutrito
Ora è molto triste, sai, rivuole la sua terra
Anche se la notte era tanto calda sotto la bandiera di stelle.
Ora una barca ha costruito sotto il sole rosso e spietato
Ha innalzato la bianca vela e aspetta sereno
Il tuo soffio di vento.

Oggi si scava il sogno sulla rovente sabbia
E il fiume sudore disseta radici nuove,
Fugge il miraggio e un Paradiso già si rivela,
Il fiore d'arancio profuma così il deserto.
Occhi che fissano il vuoto rimpiangono
Figli lontani dispersi nelle città.

Stringono in pugno collane di perle nere;
La frutta dorata che il sole dona come rugiada
Semina rabbia, nei fossi sacrificata.

E conosci solo chi ora gioca con te.

Per te il tempo non ha più valore,
Ciò che hai fatto ieri tu domani rifarai.
E nei tuoi sogni
Parli con gli angeli.
In un cerchio chiuso di pazzia
Hai perduto la tua giovinezza
Come un fiore tolto dal ramo a primavera.
Dai un nome a tutte le farfalle
E confessi al vento I tuoi amori.

E sul muro bianco si disegna
Il profilo di una donna con il suo bambino.
E cosi... felice ti addormenti.

And a fever grip's your soul

Hit you like a storm

That could do a boy more harm

I called you here today for a bit of bad news

And since this is our last date together 
I want to hold you just one more time

Don't look back
I want to remember you just like this

And say goodbye
 
I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me 'till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry

I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet another guy

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.

And to follow the star wherever it went.

And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.

Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Do my love will stand in the mist of the storm can
You hear me calling from a broken wall cause love 
I don't know why love is

Was it just a dream
When you said to me
That there is someone new in your life
You could have at least lied
The truth just scared me

Even if,
You mean the whole damn world to me
I can forget you
Wait and see
I can be strong even without you
I can't waste my life forever
Hoping you'd come back to me
But deep inside
I know I'll be waiting here for you

It's just that I recall
Back when I was small
Someone promised that they'd catch me
And then they let me fall

And now I'm fallin'
Fallin' fast again
Why do I always take a fall
When I fall in love

You'd think by now I'd learn
Play with fire you get burned
But fire can be oh so warm
And that's why I return

Turn and walk away
That's what I should do

Lately its mind is all its own
It would go far and wide
Just to be near you

Even the stars, shining up bright
I've noticed when you're close to me
Still it remains a mystery.

Anyone who's seen us
Knows what's goin' on between us
It doesn't take a genius
To read between the lines

And it's not just wishful thinking
Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

I ask myself why
I sleep like a baby through the night
Maybe it helps to know
You'll be there tomorrow
Don't open my eyes (ooh hoo-hoo)

I'll wake from the spell I'm under
Makes me wonder how (tell me how)
I could live without you now.

And what about the laughter
The happy ever after?
Like voices of sweet angels
Calling out our names

And it's not just wishful thinking

Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

All my life, I have dreamed of this
But I could not see your face
Don't ask why to such distant stars
Can fall right into place.

And it's not just wishful thinking
Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself

Why must not death be redefined?

And whirl on a pane of glass

The hands of he and the promise that she is blessed among women

But it's so hard to break somebody's heart

Once lust has turned to dust and all that's left's held breath

And love is not illusion, love illuminates the blind

If I fell into you, would it be close enough
If I finally let you in, would you show me what love is
If I had nothing to give

If you came to me empty handed
I'd bring the ocean to bring you home

Lately its mind is all its own
It would go far and wide
Just to be near you

Even the stars, shining up bright
I've noticed when you're close to me
Still it remains a mystery.

Anyone who's seen us
Knows what's goin' on between us
It doesn't take a genius
To read between the lines

And it's not just wishful thinking
Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

I ask myself why
I sleep like a baby through the night
Maybe it helps to know
You'll be there tomorrow
Don't open my eyes (ooh hoo-hoo)

I'll wake from the spell I'm under
Makes me wonder how (tell me how)
I could live without you now.

And what about the laughter
The happy ever after?
Like voices of sweet angels
Calling out our names

And it's not just wishful thinking

Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

All my life, I have dreamed of this
But I could not see your face
Don't ask why to such distant stars
Can fall right into place.

And it's not just wishful thinking
Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need
A lonely place to be
So I learned to depend on me

Chorus:
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I lived as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
Is the greatest love of all

That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love

Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in a dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

Like a bolt out on the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

You are a friend of mine
And babe is this all we ever could be?

You tell me things I've never known
I shown you love you've never shown
But then again, when you cry
I'm always at your side
You tell me 'bout the love you've had
I listen very eagerly
But deep inside you'll never see
This feeling of emptiness
It makes me feel sad
But then again I'm glad

Feeling restless inside
Wanting you

And I don't know why
I'm jealous of the people who
Are not afraid to die
It's just that I recall
Back when I was small
Someone promised that they'd catch me
And then they let me fall
And now I'm fallin'
Fallin' fast again
Why do I always take a fall
When I fall in love
You'd think by now I'd learn
Play with fire you get burned
But fire can be oh so warm
And that's why I return
Turn and walk away
That's what I should do
My head says go and find the door
My heart says I've found you
And now I'm fallin'
Fallin' fast again
Why do I always take a fall
When I fall in love
Help me I'm fallin'
Fallin' fast again
Why do I always take a fall
When I fall in love
(It always turns out the same
When I fall)
Lovin' someone, losin' myself
Only got me to blame
Help me I'm fallin'

Maybe I'll make it after all
Maybe this time I won't fall
When I fall in love",Fallin'
Lea Salonga,"After all the tears I've cried
You'd think I would give up on love
Get off this line
But maybe I might get it right this time

I was there as passion turned to pain
Sunshine turned to rainy days
Yet here I am
Ready to begin once again

All my life I've been a dreamer
Dreamin' dreams that always broke in two
But I still believe in love
And I love believing
Maybe you can make my dreams come true

Here content with who I am
I'm reachin' out my hand to him
Once again
At least I know I've made myself a friend

All my life I've been a dreamer
Dreamin' dreams that never quite came true
But I still believe in love
And I love believing
I'll keep on dreaming
Because I still believe in love

I still believe in love
And me
And you
I still believe in love",I Still Believe in Love

My morning starts to shine with teardrops in my eyes
And here I am alone starting to realize
That my days would be brighter
If I could learn to hide
The feelings that I have for you
Keep hurting me inside

Then my day begins with simple thoughts of you
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you
Sharing dreams with each other
And making them come true
Holding one another
Saying ""all I need is you""

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always be with you

Now my nights would end with just one wish, that's you
To hold me in the dark and help me make it through
'cause the pain that's inside me
Would simply melt away
If I had you here with me
And promise me you'd stay

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always be with you

(instrumental)

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always
My love will always be with you

You know some kids ask us what happiness really is.
Well, to me happiness is a hamburger, going to the movies, new clothes.
Well, what's your happiness, gerard?

Gerard:
My happiness is a hotdog sandwich, new rubber shoes, new t-shirts,
New jeans and also my favorite part of happiness is love.

Lea:
Happiness is two kinds of ice cream
Finding your skate key, telling the time
Happiness is learning to whistle
Tying your shoe for the very first time
Happiness is playing the drum in your own school band
And happiness is walking hand in hand

Gerard:
Happiness is five different crayons
Knowing a secret, climbing a tree
Happiness is finding a nickel
Catching a firefly, setting him free
Happiness is being alone every now and then
And happiness is coming home again

Lea:
Happiness is morning and evening

Gerard:
Daytime and nighttime, too

Both:
For happiness is anyone and anything at all
That's loved by you

Gerard:
Happiness is having a sister

You'll be part of a love that you see
Someone's waiting for you

Always keep a little pray'are in your pocket
And you're sure to see the light

Lea Salonga,"I watch the world go by in silence
Deep in the night in silence
Time going by so slow
I think about the morning
And it warns my heart
Because tonight I'm going back to the one I love
And by tomorrow with the dawn I'll be there
And he'll be beside me

Sunlight, oh, sunlight
Bring me the love I'll need to guide me
Shining deep inside of me
Sunlight, oh, sunlight
Show me the way

I look at the stars and I pray for morning 
Counting the hours till morning
Thinking about his smile
His sweet smile
I'm standing on the promise of a brand new day
I couldn't face another night staying all alone
I know he needs me just as much as I need him
So, baby, I'm coming home

Sunlight, oh, sunlight
Bring me the love I'll need to guide me
Shining deep inside of me
Sunlight, oh, sunlight
Show me the way
Ooh ohhhhh, yeah

And when I hold him
I won't let him let me go, no no no
No more running far and wide
I'm gonna stay right by his side

He's my sunlight

Pretending he's beside me
All alone
I walk with him 'til morning
Without him, I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way, I close my eyes and he has found me
In the rain
The pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever and forever

And I know it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although I know that he is blind
Still I say there's a way for us

I love him
But when the night is over
He is gone
The river's just a river
Without him, the world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers

I love him
But every day I'm learning
All my life I've only been pretending
Without me, his world will go on turning
The world is full of happiness that I have never known

I love him
I love him
I love him
But only on my own",On My Own

Singing so they here what's on your mind
And when you look around you'll find
There's more than one voice
Singing in the darkness
Joining with your one voice
Each and every note another octive
Hands are joined and fears are locked

If only one voice would start it on its own
We need just one voice facinf the unknown
And then that one voice will never be alone
It takes that one voice

It takes that one voice

Just one voice singing in the darkness
All it takes is one voice
Shout it out and let it ring
Just one voice
It takes that one voice
And everyone will sing

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

And checks to see if she is standing there
After years of traveling around
With the reindeer hooves above the ground
Never made the missus run away

Figure skating she played hard to get
In his red suit he slid past
Who could resist that charming laugh?
He said he would teach her how to fly

Under mistletoe before the rush

And time would heal all hearts
Every man would have a friend
That right would always win
And love would never end

The comfort in the sound of a lullaby
The innocence of leaves in the spring
But most of all the moment when love first touch me

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly
Until the hands of time would choose to wave goodbye

Take care, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they're both give a very strange sensation
When you're lost in a magic of a kiss

Your lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time, it isn't fascination or a dream
That will fade and fall apart
This time it's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart

Something in your eyes
Though I could be wrong

Winter is here
And the all the roses lie
Deep beneath the snow
That's where lover's go to hide
From pain and sorrow

Never for sure, when your luck will turn
Waiting out that snowy day
Hope for a cure
That someday you'll learn
Why love keeps on going
There's no one there

Pardon me, Sir
I think it's up from here
Take this one from me
One day you'll feel free to fly away
Wherever you want to

Never can tell, where the dawn will break
When you find your shoulder to cry on
After a spell, you won't feel the ache
And you'll forget the corner you've been living in so long

To move along

Unable to love for your made out of stone

Who are you and what have you done with my heart?

A word that sounded like a name
And it hurts me more than I can bear

But still
I still believe
The time will come 
When nothing keeps us apart

Did you get a little gold?

Take him to some shady bower, save me from the wrath of this man,
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this man, man.

Pray tell me that I'm free to ride,

To see what fifteen cents could do.

One meatball, one meatball,
He could afford but one meatball.

The simple dinner he had planned.
The guests were startled, one and all,
To hear that waiter loudly call, ""What,

Hey, this here gent wants one meatball.""

Said, ""Some bread, sir, if you please.""
The waiter hollered down the hall,
""You gets no bread with one meatball.

""One meatball, one meatball,

Is a suitcase and a trunk

Is when he's on a drunk

Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
It's a sunny day and the sky is bright
Take her to the mist everything is right
No need to make bets cause I met a bookie
Today is the day the whole school plays hookie
Why? Cause I called Dinco D and Brown
Cutmonitor Milo brings the sound
Before I do that I play myself like a jerk
Make sure momma jamma took her body to work
Okay she is gone so I jet to the phone
Let the whole world know nobody's home
It's Busta Rhymes and I'm feeling irie
Come on over cause I'm having a party
Milo did the right thing and brought the ride
The sound's too pissed now the party's live
Tickets in effect, everything's sweet
As I zoned in my bus, all I had to say is ""That beat""
That beat, just keep the same old beat
Check it out y'all, come on, come on
Just keep the same old beat

[Dinco D]
On the fourth day of school, hookie wasn't here
Today's the first day of a brand new year
There's girls that's rubbing butts around the room
Fellas feeling good cause the gates is boom
Zoom to the doom of a sugarplum toon
Me, Busta, and Brown is gonna rock the mic soon
With a huh! here we go in June
Power cat with the snap in the rules
Throw a misses out, this is all street news
You choose, don't lose a views
Prices move in like cruise a bruise
Stacked on a four pack stack of freaks
I guess I'll play hookie for a couple of weeks

Six A.M. and I hear my alarm
Rushed to the phone, I called Vietnam
He's asleep so I leave a message
At the tone, you know time is of essence
Quickly I jumped straight into the shower
The baby powder, cause I can't smell sour
Get dressed, put on my Nike Airs
Come my hairs, go upstairs
Walk outside to the fruit stand
And Dre, Kane, he's the 40's in hand
Powercat Geronimo is in the distance
The fifths are coming, the fifths are coming
Hit up, lit up the blunt and I'm straight
Quarter to eight and my day looks great
Walked to the school with about 40 feet
That means the squad is 20 deep
I zoned

Got a chicken in the room and he's trying to hide, yo
Next is my man (Who?) Gary Gennew
Half of the mob and a case of brew
Rumpletilz with the Diggum Smacks
A get through the door with the Cracker Jacks
Classic from Medina cold looking very hard
Next to the door came the yardman Scard
Into my crib to find the inchie at last
Kallie any crew with my boy Shabazz
Shake it time iller to settle the score
Then Powercat through the locks on the door
Bugging at the jam like I'm cyclone
Now an hour to seven come to find out that I'm zoning
Huh, check it out, yeah

No school? Cool
I'll just fool around off school grounds
Too many kids doing bids in detention

Prepare the wine to a reggae cut
Not (not) not (not) who (what) what?

Leave the dance before she causes some harm
I go out the backdoor with a hard bone
Look at the clock and then I start to zone

[Charlie Brown]
Got to the hive, no one was there
Truant officers began to stare
Called Dinco D but he's not home
Drop another quarter into the phone
Call Busta Rhymes, what's up my man?
(Having a party, understand?)
Where's Dinco D, you know, the D?
(Here's the phone) (Sup C.B.?)
I'm coming (Hurry up, hurry up!)
Milo started throwing on all the cuts
Walking to the crib and I heard ""Hello""
Turned, it was Epitome and Shemello
Told them the scoop and I kept stepping
Almost had to stop and I started sweating
Rob pulls up, he says ""Come on get in""
Place was packed with stupid skins
Got to Busta's crib and grabbed a 40

Grabbed the gold tone microphone

Off into my walked dawn missions, why?
'cause the brothers that I knew with the rise drove by
Only nice in the days looking down the road
Seeing beautiful girls with the car load
Yeah yeah yeah they are screaming,
Wish I had a little ride on my own,
But since I don't there is my sobb story
My missions will continue as I keep on stalking
Stamina was dying from the constant walking
Right before the moment I began to car to my man Ridle
Who had a some moving on
I thought he wouldn't know that's my dying
Where are the others nammy you beat and kept driven
Now in my heart they do a big hole
'cause my little, little, little toes
Started jumping on my end soul
It was frigity burn and then I said wait, I got pride
It's time to get my own ride
I came up with the scheme and got paid
I had no other choice but go at knowledge of tray
When I got my transport, I got kind of steam G up
'cause I got cherry pet further
Now I'm feeling good 'cause I'm off my feet,

Four minds of two kinds run one with the sun. 
I love my father, mother, my brother, and the sisters 
That come from all over the place to trace the base. 
Inspector Clouseau I wonder is true though. 
Oh no, no more security. 
Nets straight human casualties 
call for raw regrets in beat societies. 
Lessons must speak, 
Stand be strong. Keep away from weak in the years long. 
Life leaders let loose leading leftbacks. 
And misguided youth letting leaks lack. 
Levels of truth. Look ma' no hands. 
Lend likes lots of love only lasting cause I'm asking. 
Could we be above average not savage, 
But near newly more duty, more than terror.

Hey Mr. Sneaky-one don't try to read my mind. 
Just worry about getting yours, because I'm getting mines. 
Leaders made a commitment to keep this type of music. 
Livin' forever. 
Whatever, whatever. 
We live in an era where errors aren't made to 
Remain an error, but I think that's kinda better. 
Understand that word and how you use it. 
Rap is business music, Hip-Hop is cultural music. 
Now you get to see the one sun getting super dumb. 
Dance around because you know that we doin' it for fun.

Mr. Parasite, I got your big surprise
Mad effective as you vision my perspective, hot shot
Look at what you got, a super ache infected speed knot
Yo, it seems stunning every time I see the fraud coming
Hundred miles and running, time to back the tools and start gunning
Let me tell you something, you ain't saying nothing with your fussing
Now you got my cussing, bake you like a muffin full of stuffing

You know I love they way it's going down (Going down!)
I'm the one knight supreme (Being all seeing)
Soul with the role (No I'm not European)
Operator, operator, put me on hold
Stories untold, watch the dollars unfold
Watch women approach me with the inviations
Previous engagement, speculation
I hate when my girl says ""Give me some space""
On the telephone, and never to your face
I paid my dues, so lick the balls!
In the summer, in the winter, in the spring, and in the fall
I'm romping and ripping, the needle ain't skipping
Gymnasiums and stadiums the crowd be flipping
The new to the next, and of course the nextus
The greatest, the grandest, of course you expect this
In cash, boom bash, slash, grammatical
Continual residual, flow is radical
All that, and a bag of Chips Ahoy
Tell your homeboys to bring the noise
Sunrise to sunset, yes you will remember
Born on the 19th day of September
Peace to mom-do, that's see dot B dot
Not for cock block, so stop and don't jock
So take is faker snakr, phonograph no paper
Just a philly for the ride, slide, peace see you later!
What's next? (I know you love the way it's going down!)

Ex the excess, your best bet check it
(Move it along) Cause I really can't tec it
Your cement mentality will end up in casualties
I got the right one, baby, and no you can't follow me
Got pieces of a dream I need to put together
I ain't checking for nobody who's tougher than leather
Whether I'm in or out of state, it doesn't make a difference
Why the constant complaining about my real appearance?
Saying ""Milo do you love me?"" You're always asking
What are you looking for action or romancing?
Now who the hell you think you're gassing? (What's crazy?)
Don't treat me like a Care Bear that's always smiling
I like drinking booze and sometimes wilding
Don't act new baby (Huh!) Or haven't ya heard?
Keep 110 mph inna me Dusinburg
Keep the main on taining at an even rate
One Newport breath taker in the morning and you know I'm straight
(What's next?) Voodoo hex, 666 years of sorrow
Broken by the strength of the 7
Just do the knowledge and don't ask no questions
(I know you love the way it's going down!)
I hit up a green light crossing and I am passing
On the road to riches, 4 by 4 riding over ditches
Next with the misses, hugs and kisses, the switch you missed
Cause mental fixes, erasional addiction
So complex, flex! (Time to have sex!) Now ask yourself what's next
You love the way it's going down!

The sun will come out, but don't doubt the D (Tomorrow!)
Let me see Dinco you can come out and play now
If you want to, but only if you want me to
or do strange dimensions of the pensions pile
Dispensers of bad fencers sensors while
(Busting loose) takes over your mentioning how
It came to be in '93 with what you see now
In the corners where you go sporting cones
Only a lonely homely Jones make clones
Tone dial phone girls grown close to testes
Jingling chrome press sewn Leaders aren't lefties or jet skis
Or what you call your animal when your pet pees?

Pray every night I'll make you happy
If I'm real bad will you punish me
The contact hurts but at least you're touching me
Can't you see can't you read please read me please
Hard to believe I'm your flesh and blood
Watch your mistakes swimming down my face
Jump up and down and I'll even fall
To your feet you're stepping on me
You're hurting me you don't notice me you're hurting me
I'm screaming I'm breaking I'm grieving get angry
I'm rebelling I'm trying I'm losing be proud of me
I'm sickening I'm learning please notice me I'm your baby
Am I all you hoped that I would be 
Must be no boundaries guess no one cares
What's mine is mine and what's yours is mine to get
I'll make you listen until you're blue
The contact hurts but at least I'm touching you
I'm raping I'm craving I'm begging get angry
I'm weakening I'm regretting I'm sorry be proud of me
I'm invisible I'm multiplying
I'm pleading I'm killing
Am I all you hoped that I would be

Who said I can't alter my mind
Who said the puzzle needs each piece
Who said say your seven Hail Marys
And who are they to say
You keep invading me with your
Self-righteous camouflage uniform
Can't you let me be
Who I want to be

You can't tell me what's right
If I lose my mind
I wonder what I'd gain tonight

Just livin' a real life

Ohh can someone save me
Ohh hypnotize me

Yes I do need to feel love
And I used yours like a glove
But the memories come flooding back

Now the picture is clear
I can finally hear

Let habits form praise the Lord

Do they mean more than me

Trying to give you all your lines
Trying to walk away without a move
Trying to catch your eyes

Are you scared of me

Finally I know you fell
I climb into your body
Climb into my own cell

Don't think too much you'll go blind

The sun is shining in my sky
And no rain can touch me
Feel I could run a million miles
Nothing's gonna change me
Feel I could climb a mountain
And yet still be grounded

Now I stand where I belong
'cause I know what's going on
I got it worked out in my head
And if I stumble or I fall
I know I'll be stronger

Leah Haywood,"I heard you walking through my door
I studied every footstep
I tried to listen through the floor
I love to hear you sleeping

So pretty is your face
I feel so inadequate
But know it keeps me breathing
When I see your face I feel alive

And this face that I'm hiding behind
Can't contain what I feel inside

[Chorus]
One word to say what's on my mind
It's a word that I just cannot find
I sometimes wonder when I'm with you
Is it love makes me feel like I do

Your presence I cannot ignore
No matter how hard I try
I struggle knowing I want more
You're all consuming my mind
Spend my days imagining
You're here with me don't go away

And this world that I'm hiding inside
But it's you that keeps it alive

You walked by my door and you smiled
You put this hope in my heart

Never wanted no one like I want you now

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Quando ele sai contigo
Sinto tanto ciúme
Eu não tinha costume
De dividir alguém assim
Parece até loucura
Ficar te vigiando
Mas eu queria tanto
Seu amor só para mim

Por que será que eu pago esse preço
Pra ter às vezes sim, às vezes não
Apenas uma noite de carinho,
Aumenta ainda mais a solidão

Quando o champanha, corria a rodo
No alto meio da granfinagem

Nisto, chegou um peão
Trazendo na testa o pó da viagem
Pro graçom ele pediu uma pinga
Que era pra rebater a friagem

E falou pro dono eu tenho má fé
Quando caboclo que não se enxerga
Num lugar destes, vem por os pés

Deve barrar a entrada de qualquer
E principalmente nesta ocasião
Que está presente o rei do café

Quem tem milhões de pés de café
Por este rico chão brasileiro

Sua safra é uma potência
Em nosso mercado e no estrangeiro
Portanto, vejam que este ambiente
Não é pra qualquer tipo rampeiro

Com um modo bem cortês
Responde o peão pra rapaziada
Esta riqueza não me assusta
Toco em aposta qualquer parada

Cada pé desse café
Eu amarro um boi da minha invernada
E pra encerrar o assunto eu garanto
Que ainda me sobra uma boiada

Foi um silêncio profundo
Peão deixou o povo mais pasmado
Pagando a pinga com mil cruzeiros

Depois que eu senti sua mão me tocar 
Eu não tive medo nenhum de sonhar
Me livrei da saudade de alguém que eu queria
Tanto esquecer

Um copo de vinho pra comemorar
O amor e o carinho que você me dá
Deitado em seus braços nem lembro que ela 
Já me fez sofrer

Um copo de vinho na sede de amar
Na hora do beijo e do nosso prazer
Ela foi embora, mas Deus nessa hora 
Me trouxe você

Quando você pediu que a gente desse um tempo
Meu coração bateu sofrendo em silêncio
Me deu vontade de pedir não vá embora

Pode secar o mar

Quando o champanha, corria a rodo
No alto meio da granfinagem

Nisto, chegou um peão
Trazendo na testa o pó da viagem
Pro graçom ele pediu uma pinga
Que era pra rebater a friagem

E falou pro dono eu tenho má fé
Quando caboclo que não se enxerga

Deve barrar a entrada de qualquer
E principalmente nesta ocasião
Que está presente o rei do café

Quem tem milhões de pés de café
Por este rico chão brasileiro

Sua safra é uma potência
Em nosso mercado e no estrangeiro
Portanto, vejam que este ambiente
Não é pra qualquer tipo rampeiro

Com um modo bem cortês

Esta riqueza não me assusta
Toco em aposta qualquer parada

Cada pé desse café
Eu amarro um boi da minha invernada
E pra encerrar o assunto eu garanto
Que ainda me sobra uma boiada

Foi um silêncio profundo
Peão deixou o povo mais pasmado
Pagando a pinga com mil cruzeiros

Que não se faça de arrogado

E perguntar pelo rei do gado",Rei Do Gado

Leandro y Leonardo,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared,
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know

Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, le le le le le le le

Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains, mmm mmm

LeAnn Rimes,"Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of a favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

See how far I can go
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain

In our front yard
I thought by now that they should all be gone.
With winter 'round the corner
Snow on its way
Surely something must be wrong.
Then in that old oak tree I finally saw her
Where she sat gazing down upon her mate
And the song that she was singing
Seemed to say ""I'll be right here""
""I'd like to go, but your love's made me stay.""

He's got a broken wing
And that's why he can't fly
She just can't leave him there

They won't give up

What they seem to have found
To love our families
When trouble comes around
I'll bet that God saw fit

Were so gallantly streaming.

Who cannot seem to give

I found what I believed
Always hoped for the day
When my heart would find you
Now my heart's beside you
You are in my life

In your arms I know where I belong
I've never known this feeling, oh
But it feels like home
In your eyes I know what I can be
You've opened up your heart to me
Oh, and it feels like home

It doesn't matter where I've been
Or what I've been through
Cause I know I've been waiting
Every day of my life
To be with you, to be with you

In your arms I know where I belong
I've never known this feeling before
But it feels like home
In your eyes I know what I can be
You've opened up your heart to me, oh
And it feels like home

When I'm with you baby, it feels like home
When I'm with you baby, it feels like home

LeAnn Rimes,"Went through the attic today  
Found a note you wrote packed away. 
And I started reliving the past  
When I saw his face. 

Suddenly  to my surprise  
I felt a tear fall from my eyes. 
The heart never forgets  
No the heart never forgets. 

You can find someone  
And live your life  
Put an old memory out of your mind  
But the heart never forgets. 

A face on a crowded street  
An old movie on T.V., 
A song on the radio 
Can bring it all back. 

Years roll by, 
One by one, 
All things change, 
But there's always someone, 
The heart never forgets, 
No the heart never forgets. 

You can find someone, 
And live your life, 
Put an old memory out of your mind, 
But the heart never forgets. 

The heart never forgets, 
No the heart never forgets. 
You can find someone, 
And live your life, 
Put an old memory out of your mind, 
But the heart never forgets. 
No the heart never forgets.

LeAnn Rimes,"How do you cool your lips
After a summer's kiss
How do you rid the sweat
After the body bliss
How do you turn your eyes
From the romantic glare
How do you block the sound of a voice
You'd know anywhere

[Chorus]
Oh I really should have known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes
Your casual good-byes
By the chill in your embrace
The expression on your face
That told me you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive

How do you numb your skin
After the warmest touch
How do you slow your blood
After the body rush
How do you free your soul
After you've found a friend
How do you teach your heart it's time
To fall in love again

Oh you probably won't remember me
It's probably ancient history
I'm one of the chosen few
Who went ahead and fell for you
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch
I fell too fast, I feel too much
I thought that you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive

LeAnn Rimes,"If I woke up tomorrow
And my eyes could not see
In darkness there'd be beauty
Of the love you shown to me

Deeper and higher
Cause I've been loved
More than anyone deserves

If tomorrow for some reason
Somehow I could not hear
In silence there'd be music
Of a love that's always here

Cause I love longer and wider
Deeper and higher
Cause I've been loved
More than anyone deserves

And if I woke up in heaven
And I could not feel your touch

LeAnn Rimes,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

",The Lord's Prayer
LeAnn Rimes,"There was a mountain and there were three trees 
There was a good man and there were two thieves 
A man called Barabas was doomed for the tree 
But Jesus took the middle one and Barabas went free 
I love that man in the middle because I know he first loved me 
Praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary 
The middle man made it possible that I could go free 
A hill called Golgotha the place of a skull 
No yellow flowers, no trees in bloom the scenery was so dull 
Three crosses stood black and bold against a darkened sky 
And not from pain but a broken heart that middle man died 
I love that man in the middle because I know he first loved me 
Praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary 
The middle man made it possible that I could go free

LeAnn Rimes,"Feel the cold wind blowing-winter's coming on
Tis the season, so they say
If you need help believing 'cause your spirit ain't too strong
Hold my hand--we'll push that cloud away

Put a little holiday in your heart
It'll put a little shuffle in your step
Give you a song that you can sing
With a melody you can't forget
And if you want to join in a little harmony
To keep the world from tearin' apart
Well you know where to look
Yeah--you gotta put a little holiday in your heart

There's a man on the corner who doesn't have a name
People pass and turn their heads away
But to share a simple kindness would set your heart aflame
And you'll get more than you'll ever give away

Put a little holiday in your heart
It'll put a little shuffle in your step

Well you know where to look
Yeah--you gotta put a little holiday in your heart

It starts with you, it starts with me
That ain't no stranger, he's family and it don't matter if we agree
It all comes down to love

LeAnn Rimes,"Look how the wind carries the sea 
And see how the soul supplies what it needs 
The rain falls, the sun shines and a flower breaks reed 
And it all works together, why can't we 
And I have seen children at play in the park 
Skin shades of ivory, red, yellow and dark 
While my eyes saw colors their little hearts could not see 
They were playing together, why can't we 
Why can't we 
Why can't we 
I can love you and you can love me 
Why can't we 
Why can't we 
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be 
Why can't we 
And I had a dream about a lion and a lamb 
They were laying together and there was peace in the land 
And so it became precious 'cause there were no enemies 
And I woke up and wondered, God why can't we 
Why can't we 
Why can't we 
I can you love you and you can love me

Hurry up before it gets too late

A little to the left
A little to the right
A little bit longer
All the way tonight
I close my eyes, my body
Tenes
Boy your touch hits all my
Senses
Don't stop
Come on

In the middle of the night

And I'm suspended
In your arms
As I melt from your touch

Don't explain it away
Cause, it just ain't my thing
All this articulating
Just a little heartbreak
Why make it more than it seems
I'd much rather
Get back to dreamin' my dreams

See cause I've been thinkin'
we'll meet again someday
But until we do

LeAnn Rimes,"Ever since I was a little child
I was told to do no wrong
The angel in my mama's
Precious eyes
Could be a devil with a heart 
Of stone

I couldn't help myself,
Just had to go my way
Now I've got hell to pay

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm a twisted angel
Flying wild and free
Yeah I'm a twisted angel
Flying to heaven on a 
Broken wing

Back when I was daddy's little girl
He brought me up on the 
Rolling Stones
Thrown into the flame,
Thrown into the world
That's when I learned how
To rock n' roll

Look's like everything
Has gone my way
But I've still got hell to raise

But the devil's up my sleeve

LeAnn Rimes,"Little Carrie Ann what a beautiful girl
From the moment she was born
She was always perfect
Whole town said, "" Why can't you be more like her?""

Lights go on and she's ready to spin
On stage doing all the things she's told to
Puts on a show in front of the whole damn world

I pray to the heavens to try to save her soul
Cause that sweet little angel is not the girl I know

[Chorus]
She gets wound up
She gets higher by the minute
Turns the sound up
To drown out all the pain
They all think they know her
But no one really knows
That she goes a little crazy sometimes

She parks her car at the top of the hill
Only inches from the edge
Where she's almost falling
Stares at the sky till she's drowning in the rain

Nice dress, nice smile
What a wonderful child
If they knew all the lies she's told them
It's too complicated for her to explain

She prays to the heavens to try to save her soul
Cause the sweet little angel is close to letting go

I used to need you
I used to hang on every word

It used to please you
To try to make me

My heart for your help

We're together but living separate lives

So want to tell you I'm sorry
Baby I can't find the words
But if I could, then you know I would, yeah

No I won't let you go, know what we can be
I won't watch my life, crashing down on me

How far we've come still surprises me

Staring back is the man
I used to be

With you
How I long for you

Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not


How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again

Must be a guardian angel

And give my life

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

round and round, we've all gone mad
Scream it - I got it bad

Bad for speed and burnin' candles
At both ends till I'm unraveled
Bad for jumpin' off the edge
Without a net because I can

But I got somethin' that gets me goin'
And I'm already gone

LeAnn Rimes,"Love is a lot like a garden
You throw your whole heart into
Once I was easily started
The hard thing to do
Was following through

But I want to with you
Make a love that will last forever
I want to with you
make a life we can live together
Baby I promise you
Every time I laugh
Every tear I cry
Every long night I live through
I want to with you

Life is a lot like a battle
When love is under attack
Once I was easily rattled
I'd run just like that
I wouldn't fight back

But I want to with you
Make a love that will last forever
I want to with you
make a life we can live together
Baby I promise you
Every time I laugh
Every tear I cry
Every long night I live through
I want to with you

Once upon a lonely time
I didn't want to share my life
But now I find in everything that I do
I want to with you

Every time I laugh

LeAnn Rimes,"Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky
Ice shouldn't burn or a bumble bee fly
If you feel so happy, then why do you cry
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense 

Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas
Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense 

[Chorus]
Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'
You can win when you're losin'
Stand when you're fallin'
I can't figure it out
Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation
Nothin' short of amazin'
Wish I could explain it
But I didn't know how 

The way that we dance
The reason we dream
That big Italian tower
Oh, how does it lean
Somethin' so strong shouldn't make me this weak
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense 

[Chorus]

Like the lights of Las Vegas glowin' out of the sand
A jumbo shrimp or a baby grand
How you touch my heart when you hold my hand

LeAnn Rimes,"Got a date a week from Friday with a preacher's son
Everybody says he's crazy; I'll have to see

I finally moved to Jackson when the summer came
I won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves

I'm probably going on and on
It seems I'm doing more of that these days

I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh, you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
'Cause if I never see your face
I probably wouldn't be this way

Mama says that I just shouldn't speak to you
Susan says that I should just move on

You ought to see the way these people look at me
When they see me 'round here talking to this stone

Everybody thinks I've lost my mind
But I just take it day by day

I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh, you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes I feel an angel's touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much

Nothin' short of miracle when you find the one you're lookin' for

Isn't a wonder that we got this far

Some people aren't lucky like us
Some people they just give up
And when the hard times fall and the thrill of it all is gone
They leave it in a cloud of dust
It's sad to think that some won't find it
And others wouldn't recognize it even when it comes
We're all at the mercy of the will of love
And some people yeah
Some people aren't lucky like us

Two lonely souls that just stumbled into fate
Look how much we've been given baby in spite of all of our mistakes
I will never forget I'm been blessed with the gift of lovin' you
And when the goin' ain't easy baby
A little faith will pull us through
Thank god we have each other we can hang on to

Some people aren't lucky like us
Some people they just give up
And when the hard times fall and the thrill of it all is gone

To have someone you can laugh with someone you can cry with
Tell all your secrets to
To have someone who won't judge you someone who just loves you
No matter what they stand beside you

Some people they just give up

A place to plan a future, a place to keep the past
A place to raise some kids, and what's wrong with that, wrong with that

Running like a river so deep

I wanna get lost in the dark and know you're near, know you're near

Getting me thinking that there might be a little bit more than what I'm working for

And all the things I loved I thought were gone
You take me home

And separate all that was lost and found

The grass ain't greener where it doesn't grow

I want to shed my skin if I feel the urge to fly
I will fall on my face to bruised and broken

To save myself I don't want to save myself
I just want to live out loud feel the rush that's all around
I light the flames to feel the burn trouble everywhere I turn
There's freedom in the lessons learned and beauty when the loves returned

I want to breathe like it's my first breath
I want to bleed when I'm put to the test
I want to dig down deep and find out who I am
And I will love like a love lost to scared and open

That I'm looking through
Show only the beauty
'Cause they hide all the truth

And they let me hold on to the good times, the good lines

And they keep me from feeling so cheated, defeated
When reflections in your eyes show me a fool

LeAnn Rimes,"There's a little boy, in our neighborhood.
His name is Charlie Jackson, and he's really lookin' good.
I had to go and see him, so I called him on the phone.
I walked over to his house, and this was goin' on.

His brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie.
His Momma was in the kitchen, cuttin' chicken up to fry.
His Daddy was in the backyard, rollin' up a garden hose.
I was on the porch with Charlie, feelin' love down to my toes.
And we were swingin' (swingin')
Aw, yeah now we were swingin' (swingin')

Little Charlie he's as pretty as the angels when they sing.
I can't believe I'm out here on his front porch in this swing,

Yeah, and we'll be swingin'. (swingin')
Yes, we'll be swingin'. (swingin')

And Charlie is my lover, and he has been since the spring.
I just can't believe it started on his front porch in this swing.
Just a swingin'. (swingin')

Sharing so much joy and cheer

Singing songs about Jesus

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Leaves' Eyes,"To say that all of those words meant something
Would be to say that your petty wars killed everything
And I wonder if we ever had one of those moments
Because I can't count the times
I tried to cut away the dead, hoping to grow up again
How much I tried to kill the smiling boy
The burden of falling out of the womb
How much ""not enough"" I ever received
I will solve these dreams before I wake up this time
This loss weighs, it will always weigh",Lyset

Do they speak my language?
Will they come my way?

Stay and swim back and forth

Quem avisa é o Zé do Caroço 
Que amanhã vai fazer alvoroço 
Alertando a favela inteira

Que existisse outro Zé do Caroço (Caroço, Caroço) 
Pra dizer de uma vez pra esse moço 
Carnaval não é esse colosso 
Nossa escola é raiz, é madeira 
Mas é o Morro do Pau da Bandeira 
De uma Vila Isabel verdadeira 
Que o Zé do Caroço trabalha 
Que o Zé do Caroço batalha 
E que malha o preço da feira 
E na hora que a televisão brasileira 

Distrai toda gente com a sua novela 
É que o Zé põe a boca no mundo 
É que faz um discurso profundo 
Ele quer ver o bem da favela

But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight

Ayo I'll probly never be the type to spend two bucks on Von Dutch
But I wan touch hearts, see help the Man up, seen
I come to do what the Lord say
Got my lifestyle flipped to fit His forte yeah
I'm up early like moms and grits
Getting fed daily bread 'til my mind is script'd
And my rhymes intent is to point straight at the cross
Without using clever lines and hits
I know you'd probably be impressed if I cleverly used my melody
To share Christ without using His name heavily
But I'd rather be saying His name so much you could never get me confused
Or discredit me
'Cause I don't wanna do this, I used to be a Judas
It's only Christ in me that got me tryin' to make it through this
I'm givin up time, givin' up rhyme
'Cause it ain't about me getting mine dog I'm nothing

I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight

Ain't nothing sweet about me dog but Christ within
Prior to that your boy lived a life of sin
If you catch me givin' up money so folks can eat
It's really God working through me, dog I'm not that sweet
And there ain't a bone in my body that's naturally good
And without the fruit of the spirit I'm actually hood
Basically it ain't nothing great in me
But graciously my God likes replacing me
With His own characteristics traits and things
The wages earned from sin He erased them things
And gave me a new family tree
That the creator of creation hisself related to me
So if it seem like I shine bright in the limelight
Or I might think I'm tight man it's a lie right?
I'm gritty like J-Silas guess my worth
Man without Christ Jesus I'm less than dirt. I'm nothing

I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight

Cats say they gon' change the game
This is Christian rap, why they barely using the savior's name
Got flows saying they rhyme is tight
Christ gave us breath to spit God gave us the mind to write
We don't deserve to shine, naw We just clay
I just came to lift up Christ and not what's my name
When I drop this flow it might sound ridiculous
But Christ smack dab in the middle so conspicuous
Homey it's not clever word play is not what the Word say
Christ in Him crucified all day e'ry day
But have it your way and blab your name
And Christ died you just trying to grab the fame
It's nothing but sound bites nothing but loud pipes
Speakin' in vane man we nothing without Christ
We should use our last breath to rep the King Jesus
You shouldn't have to know our name after we leave here

I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that
Got me spittin' on the mic tonight
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
I'm nothing at all, it's Christ inside that

I feel your pain homey, I got the same story
But since you came to Christ you got to bring His name Glory
No more living in the darkness, no more living heartless
'Cause you got that Holy Spirit dwelling inside your carcass
Your life's been changed up, rearranged up
You've been reborn and you don't have to do the same stuff
You live regenerate, you get the benefit of Christ crucified
But you got to live in it, God is preeminent
And forgiveness is unlimited, but stop and

As they reaching for the cats who
Steppin into hell while they flossing new shoes
Packin gats and flossin new coupes
Making hoodrats doin' the do, acting a fool
But the jigga that figures pullin the trigger
With vigor can make him bigger needs to get in with the Cox Grave Digger
'Cause you live a life sin thats the wages of death
If you livin by the gun that's the way into debt
But if you living the life and living it right
Put your fist in the sky with all of your might
Til you way out of breath, chest pumping all hard due to heavy palpitations
Thirsting for the Lord with Heavy salivation
But you ain't fraud you'll pull a sinners card
'Cause you love the Lord and His habit of salvation repping like Steven
Getting stoned for the stone you believe in
Or slinging the stone into the dome of the heathen Philistine men

Lecrae,"Christ through faith
I talked to a cat the other day
And he was like;
""Man I really wanna come to Christ
But I gotta clean my life up first, get my sins together""
I told em, I used to think that way too
I thought I had to change myself before I could come to Christ
But Christ changed me
Let me tell you my story, it starts like this

It's 5:46 in the mornin', tossin' and turnin'
Chest burnin', sermons in my head keep reocurrin'
Havin' visions in my head of a kid
Cryin' at the feet of the Father, for all the wrong things that he did
Now I'm sweatin' in my sheets can't sleep
My mind keeps tellin' me I'm six feet deep
Don't remind me, even though I'm still alive I can't tell
The way I'm living my life I feel I'm going to hell
God they telling me I should accept you
That you had to leave the world, cause the world left you
Reason I can't change, like a mystery to me
So I make believe there really is a heaven for a G
Even though they say you loved the world so much, you shed ya blood
God I feel I'm too messed up for love
They tell me come as I am but I smell like smoke
My whole lifes full of sin cause it's all I know
The bible told me that you died for my sins
If I believe in Christ, it'll save me from the end
But I'm scared to ask you, to save me my heart
So evil, I got thoughts, that's full of hatred hurtin' people
I thought at first I had to clean up my life
Now I'm hearin' I just need to cling to the light
I'm ready to do it, but Lord I pray you understand
My life is a mess, will you take me as I am

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me
Will you take me as I am

I'm sick and tired of trying to me the man, my daddy never taught me to be
I'm grown up now, life ain't what I thought it would be
I made many mistakes in my past I can't fix
Now I'm staring at this crusifix tatted on my wrist
Is it true what they telling me, am I just crazy
Did ya bleed on the cross, for my sins to save me
But why would ya die for me
My whole life I've been working for Satan, while He fed lies to me
And now I'm hearing too much, trying to get a true touch
Of a love that can change me, I'm all screwed up
Figure Hell is what I deserve
But your word says we all fall short so I guess we all outta burn
Teach me I wanna learn
How you could save a wretch like me, before death says it's my turn
I think I finally understand
No matter my past, you'll still take me as I am

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me
Will you take me as I am

My father had a few last words to give
I be telling people the reason to live
The reason to die, united with the King in the sky
This life is passing us by, I got no reason to lie
You'll never give the world enough, they'll hunger for more
They figure there ways are nuthin to the wonderous lord
More security than the man that left you
More love than the moms who kept you
He'll always accept you
Be everything your supposed to
Let Christ rule ya heart, mind, body and soul cause He chose you
And if the world don't know you
It don't matter you're Gods child and he'll never disown you
Ya purpose on earth is far from worthless
That's why ya glorified like ya life's been purchased
And it don't matter if the world don't seen us
We still mean the world to Jesus

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me

Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me
Will you take me as I am

Yeah, we're saved by grace through faith
It's not works
Ain't nuthin you can do, ain't nuthin I can do
That could get us this grace salavation that we got man
It's only Christ
So if you feel like you gotta clean yourself up
Before you can come to Him
Forget it
Just come to Him
He'll take you as you are, and he'll change YOU
From the inside, out",Take Me as I Am

Lecrae,"Father God, I'm prayin' to you for somebody
who knows you Lord but just hasn't
hasn't been seein' you in the right view lately, Hear me out

Father, I'm prayin' for a friend he and I are pretty close
and out of all my friends for this one I'm concerned the most
He say he readin' daily but he ain't really learnin'
He been in church but say that he ain't moved by any sermon
His face weak, he ain't prayed in a week
he wake up and just weep with his face in the sink Lord
you gotta help my man, I'm prayin' for him daily
he ain't sinned but it just seem as if he goin' crazy
He say he feelin' trapped, can't even head up 
the mall coz every lady's half-dressed temptin' him to lust and fall
He keep the TV off, videos just make him feel 
that he ain't really nothin' without money, girls and shiny wheels
The other day he told me that he felt less a man 
coz he ain't have a five-year plan or a piece of 
land and man it's crazy coz his family think so much of him
plus he got a godly wife who always showin' 
love for him but he's strugglin', even though he talk to me
I tell him what to do but he don't listen when he oughta' be
I'm scared for him coz there's people that look up to him
he got some younger siblings who been changed by 
what he's done for them but is it done for him
Lord don't let it be, if he don't wanna talk to you then 
Father hear from me, is it done for him
Lord don't let it be
if he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me

Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, yeah, I'm prayin' for you

God, his condition is worsen since we were 
last conversed and I'm with him now and he ain't 
doin' well and this I'm certain
He say he tryna' trust you, doesn't wanna disgust 
you but he was in the mist of sinners
and did not discuss you and just today his anxiety's 
got the best of him, he knows Christ but 
for hours refuse to rest in Him
he's not the best of men but Lord 
I know he really loves you and I can't understand 
why lately he's not thinkin' of you
People trust this dude, you could crush this dude
Father he needs more of you I pray you touch this dude
what can I say to him? I'm determined to pray for him 
Father empty and brake him I pray you'll just have
your way with him, coz there's a change in him 
and the effects are strong, I pray you open up his
heart before the next song and when he gets home
I pray he'll open up the sixty-six book love
letter you wrote and soak it up coz he ain't
hearin' You and he ain't feelin' me and God
I know it's killin' You because it's killin'
me and matter of fact there's somethin' else
he's concealin' see, the person that
I've been prayin' about is really me

Lecrae,"Carlos was born in killa cali
Was walking down an alley and caught a 
Bullet in his head that left him bleeding badly
He lost everything at that moment except his life
He lost his hearing lost his movement and he lost his sight
He laid there in a coma
But man nobody cared
The gospel preached in his neighborhood? nobody dared
But los got up out the coma got and was able to hear
A missionary shared the gospel to his open ears
He got saved got trained got discipled
Back to hood
You could find em preaching the bible
He led a homie to christ from his same hood
Part of church plant
Come on now ain't his name good
This is blessing but I'm stressing that this is not the norm
We need leaders and belivers to help carry it on
But who would minister in a sinister part of town
I pray if jesus is calling you that you would be found

Eric used to go to bible study as a kid
He got older and started doing what the hood did
A rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life
But the jammed up so them beat him nice
He woke up in the hospital singing bible songs
Praise god he had a place to learn the bible from
But then he gets saved and wanna preach christ they 
Make him change his whole culture and way of life
He gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie
Go to seminary
By then all of his boys will die
Jesus came to invade culture outta nazereth and used 
A couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous
The feet are beautiful if only they'd go
If ain't nobody in hood preaching how will they know?
Eric is better used taught trues in his context
Somebody please plant a church in his projects

In luke 4 16 on down to 21 jesus says 
He's messiah says hes the chosen one
But more than that he quotes isaiah
That shows our savior targets oppressed 
Captive blind and the broke I'm saying
Had a heart for the poor had a heart for the low
And 1st john 2:6 is way we should go
In dueteronomy even tho they under the law
The tithes every third year the poor got em all
I ain't sayin you wrong if you live in burbs
I'm sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting
Man if you ain't burdened please pick up your word an
Tho this world is going down while we here we can serve him
We bring this to the streets because we knew the streets
I pray that more would be burdend to have beautiful feet
You never knew the streets but truth is what you preach
I pray to god you'd be burdened for beautiful feet
Go, go, go (run with those beautiful feet)
Go, go, go
You hold the truth that saves so run and shout it to the world
They can't believe in something they ain't never heard

Lecrae,"It's like I'm tired of life
Lord I'm wrong, why I can't get right?
And when it's dark, why it can't get light?
Why it can't be light?
It's so heavy, why my sin won't let me see the end?
Come get me!
Please come get me!
My thoughts, my mind, my ways all evil
I'm s'posed to be Your people, I'm s'posed to see Your sequel
I said I'd never leave You
But I'm so left, I ain't right
Lord, I'm sleeping with death
Man, I'm cheating with death
Am I deaf? It's like I don't hear You
I say that I'm a Christian, but it's like I don't fear You
I'm on a selfish island and I am nowhere near You
God, I really need You even though I don't appear to
I'm drinking out a broken cistern that could never hold water and I'm gonna get burned
Though I try, I never satisfy to quench this yearn
I hear You calling, but it's like a fight for me to just turn
Lord, I deserve to burn

I'm feeling schizophrenic
Maybe I ain't saved, 'cause I gotta get high just to block out all the pain
Seen death, seen hurt, seen a whole lot of things
But instead of running from it I'm running away from change
It's like I'm outside in the ice cold weather
The rain's coming down, I keep getting wetter
I know I'm getting sick and I could die any second
But still I refuse to let Your truths make me better
I'd rather eat flies and maggots instead of bread
And it's killing me slow, but I can't get it through my head
You were stabbed, You were murdered
And for me is why You bled
But I spit on your bloody face as if I never cared
Lord, how dare I compare my pain?
Your father turned his back
And You were left to hang
I don't know why You did it, that I can't explain
How can You love this sinner who's desecrated your name?
Lord, I deserve the flames

I know I tell lies
I know I do dirt
Apart from You, I'm nothing, but You can give me worth
I don't know if I know You
But still I know I should
I know these days are evil and only You are good
I've come to this conclusion that I would like to change 
'cause all the world's money and fame cannot sustain
I know that I should turn but that's the hardest thing
Cause do I really feel that having Jesus is a gain?
The world is so tempting
Satan is a beast
He hypnotizes my eyes to say the least
But Jesus be my treasure! To know You is to live
And I am here dying, trying everything there is
All I need here is You
Help me turn 'way from sin
Lord, give me grace to turn away and the fear to not give in
I know that I'm not perfect but I could rest in Him
I know I don't deserve it but still I take your hand
Lord, let me take Your hand

Help me Lord before there's no time left
I ain't living I'm just breathing to death
Your ways are perfect and they lead me to rest
Mine are evil and they lead me to death",Breathin' to Death
Lecrae,"Yeah she may look gritty
When her man come back she gone look so pretty 
She the Church
You might see her acting crazy
Be patient with her tho cause she still God's baby 
She the Church
Before you dis her get to know her
Jesus got a thing fo her and died just to show her 
She the Church
She ain't bricks and buildings
She all of God's people Men women and children

A building of beings being constructed
Christ is the cornerstone
Foundation build on another and you's a goner holmes
She' built on em, supported by him
Conformed to him, now she's a body of bodies who transform through him
A temple that breathes we are the halls
We are the floor board or more we are the walls
Manifold wisdom of God no longer a mystery
The church is the pinnacle of our salvific history
One flesh union homie
The Tri-union is glorified through our corporatized communion
Still the present reality is she was born a casualty though she's made alive
She's affected by depravity
Once lived in sin and enslaved by her lust and
Folks catch her slippin and they turn away disgusted
She's a work in progress Christ is the head of her
And He wash her clean with the words that he done said to her
She's already pretty but she's really not dressed 
And sometimes she look silly but she's far from a mess
Yes, please so don't be dissin cause Jesus done paid grip an
And if you didn't then should caller her Misses
I'm talking bout the church

Her name is ecclesia meaning the the assembly
Bows to (the Trinity) No other Divinity
A body family and community she is all one
But on earth you see her in congregational small ones
A microcosm or a small scale example
But yes it is the church even though it's just a sample
Invisible spiritual
Physical visible
Not a brick temple never that simple
This a not a building
She is not bricks
She's a world changer but ain't bout getting rich
Perpetrating fakes cause a lot of folks to hate
Plus her hands get dirty and her feet get scraped
And sometimes her body parts start acting outa place
Legs tryna be arms
Arms thinking they the face
But she'll never be replaced with a one man 
Band or a small Taliban with no body in command

Some don't get it so they hate
They say she's on a paper chase they say she's really fake
So they go start a ministry so they can do the work
But they don't understand how Jesus feel about His church
And yeah they make disciples
They got plenty conversions
They take care of the widows and the orphans they be workin
But none of them are churchin
No church structure
No elders and no discipline
They don't have a conductor
And they so they don't submit
But quite a few of them baptize
People how I pray that you'd look at this thing from God's eyes
Take responsibility inside the whole council 
Not just the area where you might have a mouthful
Who should people submit to
Who will conduct the discipline
If excommunicated what body will they be missing then
Look at Ephesians 4 where Paul gets practical
1st timothy and Titus if you thinking I'm irrational",The Bride
Lecrae,"Ou done had it with this, if broke is a habit I guess you back at it again
You need a change

Man you need some answers cause you just lost your moms to cancer
You really need a

You done tried almost all the drugs
And from Vegas to NY you been to all the clubs
You wanna change
You tried new shoes and clothes
But after while you still low so you know you gotta change
Maybe if you could get a new you or new crew
A new do, that would suit your change
A new somebody to lay with
Cause the last 5 just ain't make it they all betta change
A brand new car on sixes the one you got 
Now needs fixing and plus an oil change
You tried a new place
New clothes, new tastes
New ways, new face but you still need a change

You don't really know what you were put here for but before you go
You looking for a change
You trying find a home you can call your own cause 
You way too grown to making that chump change
Life's too short you been down to long

Now you got oprah on thinking maybe she 
Can help you out your hopeless zone
She gone change you
You even tried the church the pastor 
Gave you bunch of rules they ain't seem to work
You don't change
You tried another one tho that gotcha 
Feeling good inside and gotcha runnin fa mo and mo change
But all about you not God not truth
Just because you wear the suit don't mean you been changed
Christ is just a means to money, plus health
Your like the master and hes the dummy
No change

Well if not that then maybe it's better to be 
Confused and forget all facts and all change
Still been chasing change, and look where it 
Gotchu depressed ain't a thang not u ain't making no
You tried to find God
The horoscopes and stars
Ain't get very far
So far no change
What if life ain't supposed to be gravy
Fulla hurt pain, death, rape, murder and craziness
If God made everything Good then you still 
Gotta live in the hood what's really good
It goes back to Adam in Eden when he ate 
That fruit believin somehow that he could
Man disobeys God now both are at odds
And life is just hard cause our hearts need
You can't find hope in cars
Hope in money, or people
Only hope in God he can change you
Jesus felt the pain, he was hated, hurt
Slandered and slain his death brought
Be a slave to your sin, hate God love money
Love lies, Christ died so you can be changed
It's kinda fun for a while but you'll lose that smile
When your lights go out
And the pain won't change",Change
Lecrae,"I'm so desperate, I can't believe I've sinned against you
Create in me a clean heart (I'm so sorry)

Can't stand to see my own reflection so I hang my head
Feel like a disappointment like the scum of the earth
I'm so hurt I know you see I can't cover my dirt
My souls dying hearts weak and I can't even cry
I'm sposed to run to you but WHY I'm such an evil guy
The sun's shining but for me it's the darkest of days
Try to pretend it never happened but the guilt remains
I leave the house it feels like everybody knows I did it
Feels like they reading my mind and know the sin I committed
Through your blood I'm aquitted but my heart doesnt get it
Oh God I'm desperate for Help cause I'm grieving your Spirit
I couldn't sing in the sunday service, Lord I felt fake
And when they started communion I just made an escape
I'm in need of your grace
Feels like you hid your face
Lead me back to cross and show me my sins erased

I'm waste deep in my pity
Is Satan tryna trick me and tell me you won't forgive me
Cause it's startin to get me
Jesus help me quickly I hate wrong I've done
I know we all fall but I feel like the only one
Feels like I should be shunned
Should I punish myself
I know it's dumb cause by your death all my sin has been dealt
But my sin is been felt
I didn't want to do it
But what I want to do I don't
I swear I'm gonna to lose it
Try to open my bible I need to read your pages

I need you Lord but my guilt has got me feeling so faithless
Help me see where your face is
Take me back to the basics
Help me find my joy in you and not people and places
My sin is ever before me I turned my back on you
Oh father break and restore me to bring me back to you

Have mercy on me God according to your steady love
Wipe away my transgression and wash me in your blood
Create in me a clean heart renew a right spirit
Don't take your Spirit away your Presence keep me near it
I'm waiting patience on you Lord I know you hear my cry
Restore your Joy in me
For you alone I live and die

It's you I Glorify cause you don't want my sacrifice
You want me broken and contrite trusting in the Christ
I confess to you my sin and you show me mercy
I turn away from it demonstrating that you are worthy
Over lust, over pride, over all sin
Is my affection for Jesus is who died for all them
I was lost now I'm found I was toss to the ground
My sin weighed on me heavy but I am no longer bound
As sure as Christ wears the crown
I know that grace will abound
And even when I feel lost I know in You I am found",Desperate
Lecrae,"I know a lot of people out there scared they're gon' die
A couple of them thinking they'll be livin' in the sky
But while I'm here livin' man I gotta ask why, what am here fo' I gotta figure out
Waste my life no I gotta make it count
If Christ is real then what am I gonna do about
Everything in Luke 12: 15 down to 21
You've really gotta go and check it out
Paul said if Christ ain't resurrected we've wasted our lives
Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus being alive
Everyday I'm living tryin' to show the world why
Christ is more than everything you'll ever try
Better than pretty women and sinning and living
To get a minute of any women and men that you admire
It ain't no lie

We're created for Him
Outta the dust he made us for Him
Elects us and he saves us for Him
Jesus comes and he raises for Him
Magnify the Father why bother with something lesser
He made us so we could bless Him
To the world we confess Him, resurrects Him
So I know I got life
Matter fact better man I know I got Christ
If you don't see His ways in my days and nights
You can hit my brakes you can stop my life
Then I lost my rights
I lost my life
Forget the money cars and toss that ice
The cost is Christ
And they could never offer me anything on the planet that would cost that price.

Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my

Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life

Armed and dangerous
So the devil just can't hang with us
Christian youth them will stand with us
Living and driven, given a vision, fulfillin' the commission he handed us
London to Los Angeles, the rap evangelist
My daddy wouldn't abandon us
I gotta backpack full of tracts and I keep it on the Johnny Mac
So are you ready to jam with us
So let's go, give me the word an let's go
Persecution let's go
Tribulation let's go
Across the nation let's go
Procrastination let's go
Hung on the cross in the cold
Died for the young and the old
Can't say you never know
Heaven knows how many souls are going to hell or to heaven so we gotta go in to get them

Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my

Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life

Suffer, yeah, do it for Christ
You're trying to figure what to do with your life
If you make a lot of money hope you're doing it right
Because the money is God's you better steward it right
And stay focused, you ain't got no ride
Your life ain't wrapped up in what you drive
The clothes you wear, the job you work
The colour your skin, naw you're a Christian first
People get to living for a job
Make a little money start living for a car
Get 'em a wife a house kids and a dog
Then they retire they're living high on the hog
But guess what they didn't ever really live at all
To live is Christ and that's Paul I recall
To die is gain so for Christ we give it all
He's the treasure you'll never find in a mall
Your money your singleness marriage talent your time
They were loaned to you to show the world that Christ is Divine
That's why it's Christ in my rhymes
That's why it's Christ all the time
See my whole world is built around Him He's the life in my lines
I refused to waste my life
He's too true to chase that ice
Here's my gifts and time 'cause I'm constantly trying to be used to praise the Christ
If he's truly raised to life
Then this news should change your life
And by his grace you can put your faith in place that rules your days and nights

Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my

Lecrae,"I know you might a seen on the TV
You hear on the radio and CD(fall back)
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me you might wanna (fall back)

The enemy crafty and misleading
That's why I use the word of God to Lead me
And I ain't eating everything they feed me
Tryna deceive me so I gotta fall back

Lies in them songs lies on television
No telling what lies on the television
Learned sacrasm, sexism, racism
Learned to worship money cars
Learned to hate Christians
All the Christians in the movies so typical
Alcoholic, child molesting, hypocritice and mystical
They say since everyone is doing it it's normal
But Jesus says be transformed and don't let them conform you
You ain't thin enough you need diet
You need a psychic everybody does it you should try it
Spring break hit the beach what you sposed to do?
Be careful what you let the media impose on you
You learned how to find peace from TV shows
You learned how to ride clean from them videos 
In 30 seconds a commercial have you mixed up
(call now and we can have your whole life fixed up)

These days if you watch the, box you should block your
Mind in these times, and them lies that could lock you
They telling girls in our world to be hot stuff
And telling dudes link with crews on the block tough
Plus I'm feeling like they mock us
They think that God is old school like a box cut
But I'm sure that His flock's tough
And we can judge what is bug, and live pleasing in 
His sight when the clock's up
I hope we gazing through His lens with eyes
So we can defend what it is when we get they lies
It's on that cash that they fix they mind
Man they always sayin cheese like it's picture time (be easy)
Tell em cool it with the mind games
I'm chasing Christ, I'm renewed in my mind frame
And removed from them tired games
Then say my life it ain't mine man
We must remove the damaged parts like a tire change

Be rebel let the word of God lead you
Satan uses media to tempt you and deceive you
He will lead ya leach ya leave ya
So be careful as you navigate thru media
Take heed fo gravity get the best of you
And you find the concrete bench pressin you
Use the word of God to help filter all that
Before you fall into the trap you better fall back

You know what I call that? I call that maturity
Learnin how to fall back so you can live in purity
Learnin how to walk that and saying them you ain't luring me
The media is meeting us with lies but He's curing me (be easy)
I know them guys trying to hype you
But cling to the Lord's Word, flee from them vipers
We spitting aiming at your heart like snipers
We'd like fa you to desire God like Piper",Fall Back
Lecrae,"Go hard or go home
Lord use me up

Lord kill me if I don't preach the gospel
I'm still in my 20's- but I'll die if I got to
Already dead- so forget my flesh
I done been crossed over see the full court press
I'm a full court mess if the lord don't use me

Running from my trials thinkin everythangs groovy
If the cross don't move me then I don't wanna breath no mo

If I ain't seeing christ potna I don't wanna see no mo
Rep every day withouth worrying about bruising
I been to china mayne I seen some real persecution
If u didn't know em would ya life look the same
Can they tell you value jesus by the way you rep his name?
Man what's the point of living if I'm living for myself
Lord empty out my life before I put you on the shelf so for 
God I got hard I don't' wanna die tonight
It's too many people living who ain't heard about my christ
Go hard or go home
Lord use me up

Went to asia had to duck and hide-for sharin my faith
They tell me water it downwhen I get back to states
They say tone the music down you might sell a lot a records
But it's people out here dying and none of em heard the message
Took my wifey on mission trip central america
Shared her testimony 40 people stood and stared at her
When she said jesus shoulda seen it was insane cause 
40 out of 40 never heard of jesus name
Aw mayne we ain't focused on the war we just kickin it
Worried bout our image and our space up on the internet

Take me out the game coach
I don't wanna play no mo
If can't give it all I got and leave it out there on the court
Thank you for the grace for the will and the desire
Got me
Living for your glory stead of living to retire
But I pray I'll never tire of going hard for messiah
I don't need no motivation you the reason I'm inspired

Go hard
Go home, go hard
Go home

That's what that is baby
That what that mean
That what that mean

That what that is baby
That what that mean
That what that mean

Wha-what that mean?

That mean that we, should be out up in ok streets

Not just in houses with our bible's summrizing what we read

Man this ain't deep (man this ain't deep)
Why we ain't doing what we read

It's like we sleep (it's like we sleep)

But sinners sleepwalk when they sleep

So why can't we (so why can't we)
The redeemed of the lord

Act out, what he said
And make a scene for the lord

Action-cut, say what, like we was the director

But you better get a grip like movie sets, and get to stepping
(martin)
I know you done it
Da-done it, da-done-and heard it all
You was going hard for the lord before you heard this song

But don't play yourself to save ya self
And walk in fear

Scripture's like a mirror
The truth is closer than it appears",Go Hard
Lecrae,"These brothas passin me and they all rollin 
Fly coups they throw some d's on but they still ain't got the truth
They blow they cheese on it then they die and what's the use
I'm so secure in jesus all I want in life is fruit
I I don't need no fast money
Nope
Don't need a fast car
Yeah the faith is a race but I't ain't a nascar
Homeie you and god got beef cause you keep 
Chasin money like them hundreds got feet

Buddy wanna be rich but even 50 done said that 
He still feel hungry even tho he got bread
Make em throw away they life got em runnin from feds
Love of money's like crack both of em will leave you dead
When you die and face god ain't nothing left to be said
Instead of chasing the truth you take a lie to the head
And homie all I can do tell you what jesus said
Repent and turn from your sin cause the kingdom of god's at hand

People they want chesse american mozzerella
The enemies rat trap might snap any second
'm like that dude in matthew who after finding a treasure
Gave all he had to get it that's a real go getta
People dying over wood grain chrome and some leather
They got expensive tastes but the faith tastes better
I know the ice wet but the living water wetter
But don't believe me read the 13 letters
Or you can the torah the gospel and all the prophets
But homie I promise you'll never profit chasing profit

Now look at 1 timothy 6 it's so clear
You chase the money and wind up in a snare
Now a vow of poverty no it's not there
But you pursue god the rest he takes care
You don't step on his back in order to get rich
If you do then you're in sin and ordered to repent
You come come to christ for god
You come to daddy for worship
He ain't take that cross to fund your vanity purchase
Even though we all agree that death is certain
It seems we believe there's banks beyond earth (that's crazy)

Money dough cash paper
If it was a woman I promise I used to date her
Now that we broke up she be callin ya boy a hater
Cause all I do is use her for golorifying my maker
My treasures in heaven christ is my satisfaction
If I was broke I'd be richer than folkv never had em
God is the gospel not a new bentley
Was empty and he gave us life and that's plenty
Get me homie I could spend six centries
Simply saying I'm satisfied in the sensie
An it's sickening, that knowing god ain't 
Enough we gotta tell em they can get rich quickly
Now this is heresy
False it's not true
2nd corinthians chapter 8 and verse 2
Read that and please believe that forget c-note man 
They pockets was e-flat
They still had joy",Got Paper
Lecrae,"Yeah they tell me sugar coat it, dumb it down but I can't
Might as well could deny the Jesus and be ashamed but I ain't I'm a saint
Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint
It's the only We hope we got dats why I'll die for the faith I'm a saint

Used to be where I could only trust me and myself
And then that Heavy
Metal devil that could send em straight to he'll with it
Thought it
Was no helping it my selfishness was celibate I sell a bit but I make
Sure I don't sit up in that cell a bit
I'd yell a bit but only when
Hurt came for certain
Illiterate ain't know that the word came
But
Then that that light hit me and unblinded me
Jesus paid a price me

That's how I gained the right ta be the son of God I'd like to be

Changed my heart and gave me a desire for his work mayne
Kill me if you want but
I'm gone get back out that dirt mayne
Not yet what I'm
Gonna be but not what I used to be
Bless his name forever who would
Chose me and start using me
Used to love my sinning fulla greed fulla
Hate
I might say that I love Jesus
But that talk was really fake
I'd
Be lustin for ya cousin if it wasn't for his Grace
Yeah he took me outta
Nothin and he made ya boy a saint

You got to understand Jesus agreed back in eternity 
to sign a bloody covenant and take a deadly turn for me
He ain't just agree he fulfilled it to the death of em
He took that bloody cup that's meant for us str8 to the neck
And yeah he swallowed all that bitterness
That pain and affliction
Ain't a soul in hell with pain comparable to this one
Brought me to repentance
Homie I'm blood purchased
And daily I'm conformed to his holiness so I worship
Jesus finished the work
He resurrected on High
That means he beat death and best believe so will I
See some believe they can fly
But I believe I can die
Resurrect leave the earth
And live forever with God
He will march through the sky while the stars sing his praises
The planets dance around and the universe is amazed
And me I get to gaze upon his beauty for days
Man if I could be anything baby I'd be a saint

You might think I'm crazy like some kinda urban misfit
But first I
Hated church I'd only pray to give my wish list
I'd be just like you
Doing my dougie in the club folk
I promise I ain't it choose it I was chosen to loved on
Eyes low blowing dro that's the life I used to
Know
But Jesus chopped me up and slowed me down just like that
Houston flow
A dead man until somebody hit me with the hardest facts
The Gospel hit my heart I guess that's what you call a heart attack

I'm looking at Ephesians 2 like what did Jesus see in you
Nothin
By
His grace he chose to love on folk like me and u
And I don't
Understand it homie I Neva planned it
I was chasing money and fast
Women and man
Then I met the great I am
Son of man
Or the lamb

Snatched ya boy up outta hell
And got working for his plans
Used think I was the man
Til I met em
All that arrogance and pride I dead em and fo'get em

Lecrae,"Hair, check!
Shoes, check!
A brand new fit, lookin' cool, check!
I'm lookin' in the mirror like oooh, yes!
To cover for an insecure dude, check!
But she won't feel me and they won't like me
If I ain't in them J's or them brand new nikes
Let's dig deeper inside my psyche
When it's all said and done even I don't like me
He live in the gym and his hair stay faded
Late model car so they think he made it
He's Christian, he gave his life
But he still ain't satisfied in the savior Christ
Still finds his identity in looks and cars
If he only knew that he ain't have to look so hard
If he looked in God
It may seem odd
But he be so satisfied, he can leave it all

I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no

I'm not the job I work
You can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

Got her hair done, toes, nails
Is that Her, well it's hard to tell
Cause she's so caked up in all that make up
It's like she tryna make up for what she ain't but
She's a saint, but so confused
Cause she's been rejected by all these dudes
That tell her on a scale of 10 she's a two
But that ain't true
If she only knew
In Christ she is loved, she secure and accepted
Never be rejected by God whose elected her
Her beauty is her Godliness
And she ain't gotta flaunt it cause it's obvious
Identity is found in the God we trust
And any other identity will self destruct
Identity is found in the God we trust

I'm not the job I work
You can't define my worth

My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

Hey, how do I gain success
Why do I say I'm blessed, huh
Is it the car that I drive
Or the place that I rest
Or the way that I dress, now, now
Is the cause of my pride
The stage and the set
Or my face in the press, now, now
It's the applause that dies
When the praise is less
If my face is depressed, then, then
It's cause my value and worth is in the volume of the work I produce in the booth
It's a prize and a curse if defined by the perks when the truth is through
Man I won't feel like I don't want to live no more, no more, no more
Cause they don't like me, like they did in 04, 04, 04
So I swallow my pride empowered by God, I'm complete in Him
He's got peace God's priest, I'm in
In His presence weak is strength
Meet His kin
We His brethren
Read this list
Me forgiven
He's dismissed guilt and my sin

I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no

The one you used to call your friend
I know you ain't forgot me?

Oh yeah you always get me caught in sin

Here you go with that again
You act like we ain't cool or sumthin
Let's go smoke a Kool or sumthin
Talk and sip a brew or sumthin

Naw man I ain't trusting you
Ain't nothing but lust in you
Thanks be to God I obeyed the teaching I was entrusted to
Cause when you pass by you just want ya boy to backslide
Have me feeling sick like I'm coming down off a crack high

Man that's a flat lie
You act like I'm the bad guy
You know when me and you get together we have a grand time
Let's take it back. All the way to like the 6th grade
Last thing on your mind back in the day was trying to live saved
Remember house parties, kissing in the dark?
Man that was innocent fun come on

NOW don't start
See dawg I live by the Spirit so I don't gratify
All them old sinful desires that never satsify

Aye come on KILL THAT!
Look me in my face and tell me I'm a lie
You ain't feeling chasing women, getting drunk
And getting high, stacking money, staying fly
Living up the playas life, we was
Having fun now gone try to be religious guy

Aye Yo man first of all LOWER YOUR VOICE! Who you talkin' to?
Handcuffed in August '02 I got caught with you
Truck flipped over on 35 that was all from you
I'll mess around and lose my life man tryna walk in you
I'm standing on these stages and got these people believing me
What I look like trying ta gratify this disease in me

So Now I'm a disease? Man please. I got yo back dawg
I ain't saying drop the Jesus and be a rap star
All I'm saying is when it's you and me let's be real folk
We ain't gotta be selling drugs and tryna kill folk
Maybe just a lil

What? A lil this, a lil that, a lil BET late at night
That's like a lil crack, see you ain't gone lie to me
I see how you be tryna be
BET tonight becomes addiction to pornography
And that's in no way honoring the God who's ruling sovereignly

Man you know you miss them old days

Yeah you right possibly
But after that I sober up and think of Jesus holding up
His skin up on the cross for all them drunken nights I'm throwing up
Every thought of blowin up is captured in his flowing blood
I start thinking Philippians 4:8 when you showing up

You know I ain't gone quit right?

Yeah I know but I'm dead to you
And one day I'll be present with Jesus who died and bled from you
Colossians 1:15 that's the God that I trust in

In doing so he has crushed sin",Indwelling Sin

I know when you hear this beat it sound like something to step with
But morals and music you want them separate
Like garnish on the side something ya'll don't mess with
That christo-centric rap electric
You might like rap that's wild and wreckless
A soap box for lots young and restless
They got ya head bobbin til ya lose ya necklace
Or betta yet bobbin til it leaves you neck less
You know where death is, where no more breath is and 
3rd graders learn how to leave you chestless
Where god is dissed, dismissed and distant and far 
From their hearts cause they hard and wicked
Sin hates god for real
That's he's rarely talked about and he don't get the mass appeal
You might see sin sharin' a meal that it eats while 
It cheats on the spouse out seeking a thrill

They walk in the church dressed flyer than sea birds
She came to see him he hopin' to see her
They motives ain't right and they heart ain't either
And over god they choose to feed they fever
See he don't understand that it's christ who bled for
Every second glance every turn of his head yo
And she don't really get that
Jesus did that
For every time she fantasize about his six pack
They sure like al b
To connect like his brows be
And with they bodies spit in god's face so foully
Sin so
Bad it's a liar
It's says we on the throne tells god to retire
It's says he ain't enough
And it says we want more
Is says he ain't just and it says he ain't lord
Sin is the laugh at his power
Rape of his mercy
Mock of his patience
It say he ain't worthy

I been duped and been schemed
Like the lord was cool with my sinning
Mocking the cross living unrepented
My sinful life kept us so
Distant
I know lord and been king
Let him run your life like a
Simmons
Then you'll start loving his righteousness and we start
Looking just like his kids

Live free by his mercy and grace
Live free by his mercy and grace and tell the world I'm gone
Live free by his patience and peace
Live free by his patience and peace and tell the flesh I'm gone
Live free by his joy and love
Live free by his joy and love and tell the lust I'm gone
Live free by his truth and just
Live free by his truth and just and tell the hate I'm gone",Live Free
Lecrae,"Yeah, I got a question, after the show
After the set, after the music stops, what's next? 
Are we just writing songs or are we concerned 
With uniting a people to follow 
The great commission of christ
Yeah let's get it, let's go

Back in the day I was a lunch line rapper
After that I guess I was a punch line rapper
Then I got saved and sometime after
Ya boy came back as a frontline rapper
And when I say the frontlines, that's not a front line
I'm out here preachin' christ on the frontlines
And no it ain't about rockin' stages 'cause 
Some of my engagements are out on the pavement yeah
I'm out to take the bible, create disciples
Who make disciples, disciple-cycles
That's why I want the beats to knock so after 
The music stops you can meet the rock I pray
That you would know him well, this is like show and tell
It's more than a show, I'm showing you emmanuel
So yeah I'm hopin' that you're likin' the flow 
But it's only so you could know that 
God I'm writing it for let's go

After the show, after the set
After the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer, disciples
Will you open your bibles after the music stops
After it's over, after it ends
After the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that christ is king?
Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops

I recorded a couple songs some fast some slow
So the listeners would know the importance of the show
The importance of the show not to excite 
These folks but make god's truth relevant
Ignite these folks
Discipleship is our call but we make disciples
This is not a suggestion, create disciples
The teachin' is a process, it's not overnight 
And it's not a stage and a mic nah, it's life on life christ 
Walked with twelve, ate with twelve
Talked with twelve, shaped the twelve
Invested in 'em well you could say that he made the twelve
Who made many more, who made plenty more
Now it's on you and me if there's anymore
1 teach, 2 teach, 3 teach, 4 teach, 5 teach
6 teach, 7 teach more, this is what we've been commissioned
It's the reason why I write
So that you could hear the truth
Not so you can say I'm tight whoa

After the show, after the set
After the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer, disciples
Will you open your bibles after the music stops
After it's over, after it ends
After the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that christ is king
Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops

So, we write this for the right the speak of was righteous
And then we mic check for a culture who likes the hypeness
Some say we keep it crunk, some say we hype man
We just wanna pump the resurrection of the christ man
We in the -burbs and the hoods that's hostile
We share a common view like synoptic 
Gospels and you know we keep a couple young dudes 
Around us and teach 'em the same truth god used to ground us
This is a lifestyle so, when the mic's down 
I pray people follow christ when they turn the lights down
I pray that everybody playin' this song will be 
Challenged by everything I had to say in this song
I don't do this for the money
I don't do this for fame, I don't do this so 
The industry can know my name, I do this in hopes 
To glorify yeshua the king, if you're feelin' me 
You know you should be doin' the same let's go

After the show, after the set
After the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer
Disciples, will you open your bibles after the music stops
After it's over, after it ends
After the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that christ is king
Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops",Rebel Intro
Lecrae,"This song right here is for everybody out there looking for truth
And who says, ya know, we all in the same boat
Christians, Muslims, everybody like that'(yo)
You're looking for truth
(Oh) I got some answers man
(So good to me) uh let's get into it.

Let's go'
Night and day I ain't scared to sayin we different
They play the prostitute, but they like to say they just intimate
Idols in their heart, they can't seem to lose the grip on it
Seem em walking in the direction they can get crippled with
Our world is different like Whitley and Wayne, mayne
They say we look the same, but we ain't chasin' the same thing
It all boils down to they think everything is relative
Jesus might as well be a South American president
Very evident they say that Jesus was heaven sent
They lifestyle reflects that they worship they self instead of him
They don't acknowledge the Christ
If they did, they wouldn't worship themselves by the way that they live
All these rappers say they got guns that spray of 16
I got a Luke 9 that can take all 16
That's the Bible, the one they call
But they don't care about the author,
They think he's a joke

Man, see some folks say,
""All truth is relative, it just depends on what you believe.""
You know, ""hey man, ain't no way to know for sure who God is or what's really true.""
But that means you believe your own statement,
That there's no way to know what's really true.
You're saying that that statement is true.
You're killing yourself. If what's true for you is true for you
And what's true for me is true for me,
What if my truth says yours is a lie' Is it still true' Come on man!

I promise everybody is askin the same questions,
""Who am I' What is my purpose and my direction""
Probably believe that you exist for no other reason
Than self satisfaction, hedonism, and pleasing things
Life's about you gettin' yours and being happy
Even if it means a divorce and switchin' families
Your job, your house, your car, your spouse
It's all for the glory of you else you out
You go to school, get ya degrees, and get a job
So you can make a whole lot of cheese, 'cause life's hard
You never thought of livin to please a real God
And that's the reason He made you
(See) He gave you breath to breathe, the chest to breathe it
So you can taste and see He's the best, believe it
He made us for His glory, and not for your own, homie
Our God is holy'you should repent and die slowly'

See, there's this thing called ""Secular Humanism"",
It says man is the source of all meaning and all purposing.
You know what I'm saying
We're just the result of a big cosmic explosion.
We don't really have a purpose or meaning,
So we just come up with our own purpose.
We're the source of our meaning and our purpose.
How can a man, which is the product of chance,
A finite being be the source of purpose and meaning
You can't! You're created with purpose man!
Get with The Creator yo!

Man, everybody got a problem with God
And when you mention the Christ,
Then they really get to turning the knob
But some say they roll with Christ
Cause some rappers made him seem like
He was cool with all the sin in they life
No!
But then some say,
""How could God exist when all this evil stuff in the world keep persistin""
Wrong question, ask again
How come God ain't let you feel the wrath from sin'
What you thought last night deserves a first class flight to Hell
Where God doesn't dwell, you got that right
But he brought back life on that cross that night
Christ died
You ain't know that it cost that price'
All of God's anger poured on His Son
Been together through all eternity
Now He was shun
Praise God for the life that was won for us
Ain't got a beef with God because the Son was Christ

Look, man, some people say that God ain't real
Cause they don't see how a good God can exist with all this evil in the world.
If God is real then He should stop all this evil,
Cause He's all-powerful right'
What is evil though man
It's anything that's against God.
It's anything morally bad or wrong.
It's murder, rape, stealing, lying, cheating.
But if we want God to stop evil, do we want
Him to stop it all or just a little bit of it
If He stops us from doing evil things, what about lying,
Or what about our evil thoughts
I mean, where do you stop, the murder level,
The lying level, or the thinking level
If we want Him to stop evil, we gotta be consistent,
We can't just pick and choose.
That means you and I would be eliminated right
Because we think evil stuff.
If that's true, we should be eliminated!
But thanks be to God that Jesus stepped in to save us from our sin!
Christ died for all evilness!
Repent, turn to Jesus man!""",Truth

Lecrae,"If this life has anything to gain at all
I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you
Can't walk this earth alone
I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone

With every breath I take, with every heart beat,
Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street
Every glance, every dance, every note of a song
It's all a gift undeserved that I shouldn't have known
Every day that I lie, every moment I covet
I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning your judgment
I, without the cross there's only condemnation
If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration
So in times that are good, in times that are bad
For any times that I've had it all I will be glad
And I will boast in the cross, I boast in my pains
I will boast in the sunshine, boast in his reign (rain)
What's my life if it's not praising you
Another dollar in my bank account of vain pursuit, I do
That count my life as any value or precious at all
Let me finish my race, let me answer my call

If this life has anything to gain at all
I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you
Can't walk this earth alone
I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone

Tomorrow's never promised, but it is we swear
Think we holding our own, just a fist full of air
God has never been obligated to give us life
If we fought for our rights, we be in hell tonight
Mere sinners own nothing but a fierce hand
We never loved him we pushed away his pierced hands
I rejected his love, grace, kindness, and mercy
Dying of thirst, yet, willing to die thirsty
Eternally worthy, how could I live for less?
Patiently you turn my heart away from selfishness
I volunteer for your sanctifying surgery
I know the spirits purging me of everything that's hurting me
Remove the veil from my darkened eyes
So now every morning I open Your Word and see the Son (Sun) rise
I hope in nothin', boast in nothin', only in your sufferin'
I live to show your glory, dyin' to tell your story

If this life has anything to gain at all
I count it lost if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you

I recognize I am not my own, so before I fall

Glory was solely meant for you
Doing what no one else could do
With all I have to give, (With all I have to give)
I'll use my life, I'll use my lips (My Lips, Yaaa)
I'll only glory in your Word
What gift to me I don't deserve
I'll live in such a way that it reflects to you, my Praise

Listen to me now, I love you girl.

Ya know I had to do a love song
To let the whole world know bout my love jones ,

And when I said I do, I meant that
Its trip that, you let me lead you
Cause I'm a mess and sometimes I need you
And I need you, to understand
That I'm dying everything tryin to be a better man,

I put that on my momma,
I love the way you play your part through my drama
Long nights, long flights, trips outta town
Ya keep my head up when it was hanging down
Down like four flats on a lack
I let you down and you still keep coming back

Girl I love ya cross my heart and I hope to live to make you smile,
Cause I don't deserve you. So for all the times you held me down,
Listen to me now, I love you girl.

Out here trying to save the world,
Cant forget about my baby girl
And baby girl, you so tight its true to me sometimes I wonder why you fool with me
Cause foolishly I'm prone to hurt you,
Call you grace cause I don't deserve you
I recall cold nights, no lights, low dough nights
You ain't fussin you was there the whole night sayin its alright,

So faithful, Far as beef yeah we done had a plateful
But we ate it up and we made it up
Cause our view of the Lord wasn't great enough
No divorce cause what God brought together,
We will never tear apart, gonna fight and never let up.
And when I get up I'm back down on my knees,
Thank God my rib's the best part of me.

Lecrae,"I just wanna be like you,
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like,
I just gotta be like you

Dear, Uncle Chris, Uncle Keith, Uncle Ricky,
Before the Lord get me, I gotta say something quickly
I grew up empty since my daddy wasn't with me, shoot,
I wasn't picky I'd take any male figure you
Stepped in at the right time,
It's 'cuz of you that I write rhymes
You probably never knew that
I loved the way you used to come through,
Teach me to do the things that men do
True,
You showed me stuff I probably shouldn't have seen,
But you had barely made it out your teens,
Took me under your wings
I wanted hats, I wanted clothes just like you,
Lean to the side when I rolled just like you
Didn't care if people didn't like you,
You wanna bang, I wanna bang too
Skyline, pyru
If you would've died, I would've died too,
You went to prison, got sick, lost your pops,
Yeah, I cried too
You never know who's right behind you,
I gotta a little son now and he do whatever I do
But it's something deep inside you,
That tell you it's gotta be more than doing what other guys do,
They had nobody there to guide you
But I followed your footsteps and this shouldn't surprise you,
You realize you, You realize you, you,
Yeah,

I just wanna be like you,
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to,
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like,
I just gotta be like you

Now all I see is money, cars, jewels,
Stars
Womanizers, tough guys, guns, knives, and scars,
Drug pushers, thugs, strippers, fast girls, fast life
Everything I wanted and everything I could ask life
If this ain't living and they lied well,
I guess I married an old wives' tale
Wow, fail
I don't know another way to go,
This is the only way they ever showed
I got this emptiness inside that got me fighting for approval because I missed out on my daddy saying, way to go,
Ain't get that verbal affirmation or know how to treat a woman,
Know how to fix an engine,
To keep the car running
So now I'm looking at the media and following what they feed me,
Rap stars, trap stars,
Whoever wants to lead me
Even though they lie they still tell me that they love me,
They say I'm good at bad things at least they proud of me

I just wanna be like you,
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You're teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like,
I just gotta be like you
(Like you)

I was created by God but I ain't wanna be like Him,
I wanna be Him
The Jack Sparrow of my Caribbean
I remember the first created being,
And how he shifted the blame on his dame
For fruit he shouldn't have eaten,
And now look at us all out of Eden,
Wearing designer fig leaves by Louis Vuitton
Make-believing
But God sees through my foolish pride,
And how I'm weak like Adam, another victim of Lucifer's lies
But then in steps Jesus,
All men were created to lead but we needed somebody to lead us
More than a teacher,
But somebody to buy us back from the darkness,
You can say He redeemed us,
Taught us that real leaders follow God,
Finish the work 'cuz we on our job
Taught us not to rob
But give life, love a wife like He loved the Church,
Without seeing how many hearts we can break first
I wanna be like you in every way,
So if I gotta die everyday
Unworthy sacrifice
But the least I can do is give the most of me
Because being just like you is what I'm s'pose to be
They said you came for the lame,
I'm the lamest
I made a mess, but you say you'll erase it,
I'll take it
They say you came for the lame,
I'm the lamest
I broke my life, but you say you'll replace it,
I'll take it.

And the taste so appealing it's got a grip upon my soul
These honey dip lies mesmerize me
Pride's got its crooked fingers twisted all inside in me
Fools walk the path I'm on, never to be seen again
Sipping on seduction while we eating on some secret sin
(No one will ever know) says the whisper in my ear
And I know I should be over this, but I ain't seeing clear
And I ain't leaving here, unless somebody save me
Walking to my grave letting evilness enslave me
Evil looks so lovely covered in her lace of lies
And the silky smooth seduction just manipulates my mind
Her fabrical fabrication is fueling my fascination
While I'm intoxicated she starts her assassination
I'm losing all my honor and my years to the merciless
Giving all my life away but I'm just so immersed in this (Killa)

Molded your lungs for the breath that He gave you
Not to mention the day He saved you
And when He opened your eyes by the spirit Christ was raised through
Did I mention that He forgave you?
And had His flesh ripped off for the sin you was enslaved to
Now it seems you too far gone, you wanna turn back
But you're unsure if you'll be welcome home
So you figure you just leave it alone

He intercedes on behalf of a sinner's deeds
This is an intervention because the Lord hurts

You forgive my depravity, You are my reality

With cold water we drink, hot water we cook
But lukewarm does nothin', it just sits and it looks
If that's you, imagine these as the words of Christ
""I remember you loved me, I remember your light
It used to shine bright, but now it's so dim
It used to be about us, but now it's 'bout them
You can't win playin' heart games
But I love you even when your light's off in your dark shame
When you lay down and profane me
Or when your bloodstream contains the things that would defame me
When nobody knows that you claim me
Or when you mess your life up, get mad, and wanna blame me
I still want you back, I won't punish you
I took that on the cross, because I wanted you
I might discipline and chastise
But if you got what you deserve you'd be in hell with other bad guys""

You made it this far, and that's a big move
But your addiction is hurting your other friends too
Some of 'em miss you, some of 'em dissed you
But they was hurt and struggling to forgive you
And they hated how addiction got the best of you
Chose a lie when God promised the best for you
If you realize you're livin' in sin

I'ma blow your high (Eyyy!) I'ma blow your high
I know you're trying to free your mind
But you just wasting time
And Jesus is alive

The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
Who by the unrighteousness they request the truth
For although they knew God, they did not honor Him or give thanks to Him
They became futal in their thinking
They exchanged the truth of God for a lie
And worshiped and served the creature instead of the creator who is Blessed Forever
Amen",Blow Your High
Lecrae,"Started with hangin' posters on my bedroom walls.
To battle rappin' for status up in the school halls.
Just call me double sushi, thought I was too raw.
And hip-hop was my home, I had my shoes off.

6'3 in high school, well skip a hoop dream.
If I don't blow up then maybe I'll try this school thing.
I went to college to do my family a favor,
But I couldn't pick a major cuz I wanted to be MAJOR.

I tried sellin' work, but it didn't work.
So I worked, shopping center clerk, finna go berserk.
Lunch break, see me writin' 16's over Mickey D's,
Skippin' class, makin' beats, over 60 keys.

And I love that even though I'm just chasin',
Selfish ambition couldn't tell your boy nathan.
Watch out all you rappers cuz they finna let 'Crae in,
But I was sleepin' on the Son, like a Days Inn.

And you can have the money, and you can have the fame.
For me I want the glory, I'm livin' for the Name.
See life is just a picture, I see outside the frame.
I'm livin' for a Kingdom that I ain't never seen.

And imma chase that, imma imma chase that.
Found the key to life and best believe that imma play that.
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that,
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that.
I remember chasin' the green, feelin' blue.
Only check I'm countin' is the mic check, 1-2.
All I wanted was the money and the fame and the new,
Somebody on my arm when I walk inside the room.

All I wanted was doom.
The same kind Alexander the Great felt when the earth ran out of room.
He conquered all he could, but yet he's feelin' consumed.
By this neverending quest for glory he couldn't fuel.

Like a typical fool,
(I would go hard) shootin' for the moon,
But there's only one sun (Son), no co-star.
Chasin' glory I shouldn't own,
Instead of living to make His name known,
I'm runnin' after His throne.

I thought bein' on TV where everybody could see me
Was nothing short of the easiest way I could see to please me.
I'll never be who I used to desperately wanted to be,
I'm too worried 'bout the Lord gettin' credit instead of me.

And you can have the money, and you can have the fame.
For me I want the glory, I'm livin' for the Name.
See life is just a picture, I see outside the frame.
I'm livin' for a Kingdom that I ain't never seen.

And imma chase that, (Glory) imma chase that.
Found the key to life and best believe that imma play that.
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that,
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that.

I used to wanna do it big.
When you're only focused on yourself that's small.
And they, they used to tell me as a kid,
That I could do anything that I want, except fall.
And now that I recall, I was chasin' my goals.
And everytime I caught'em they multipled into mo'.
I never even thought about whether the Lord approved,
Call it selfish ambition, I call it, ""I'm makin' moves.""

But history repeats itself, evil's what it is.
'Cause Lucifer was cast away for doing what I did.
Created by the God who spoke the earth into existence,
Instead of chasing the Father's glory, he was chasin' his.

He lies to us all, told Adam he could ball.
""Why you followin' God when you could go get it all?""
I'll tell you what's better, or better yet worse.
Chasin' your own glory by doin' the Lord's work.

So holla if it hurts, but we were made for greater.
Our greatest satisfaction is making His name famous.
So if we're never named among the greatest,
They don't critically acclaim us,
Ain't nothin' to be ashamed of, we gave it up for the Savior.

Imma chase that, imma imma chase that.
And the Lord's goodness, you should - you should taste that.
And you ain't livin' 'til you livin' for His name, yeah.
(Glory) imma chase that, imma imma chase that",Chase That (Ambition)

While you was in the crib playing with legos I was out there trying to give blocks

Before you heard about Jeezy, boy. I was already on some Trap-or-Die

What you know about sitting in a jail cell, felonies, murder case,

One way, hell's gate but the Lord stepped in
Chose to, show grace. Could have been layed in the box, dawg

I'm a party so hard that the law tryin' to find me
I pray to God they ain't find me. But then I hear a {whoo-whoo}
Lookin' in the rear view when they are right behind me
Roll down my window, ""Boy, what's your name?""
'Cause you was doing 85 in the passing lane with no traffic, man
Then I give them my ID, and guess what they say
""This boy here crazy, now that's just Crae""
And I was psycho, wild as the hun is
I go like the Chi, doing whatever I wanted
Until I was confronted, heard about Jesus and I changed
They're like man what you do, somethin' bout you just ain't the same.
I was dead. The old me was nothing but a sucker
Sucked the life out of my mother, just to get the stuff I wanted
Now I'm milk carton status and different, can't explain it
Put the APB out on me, if they find me, that's amazing.

These folks is killing for less money than they can borrow

Coloring cartoons of strangers who getting strangled
And the daughter let a stranger, the school call him a counselor
Do some dirty things, but he promise that he would counsel her
Baby momma can't identify the man that killed him
It's the same low down dealer that she always get her pills from
And the son is getting older, streets is making him colder
But his momma's out cold, cause she ain't never quite sober
His sister's 15, but you probably think that she grown up
'Cause she was with some men, acting way too grown up
And don't nobody care though, the schools ain't teaching

And the people won't hear more metaphors and word-play
My sister's sick of stripping, she need hope up in my words, man
She pull up to the mall where she valet her little Mercedes
Wishing she had some romance, healthy family, couple babies
And the gentleman she love, he already got a wife
So she's accepting her plight, she's a lady of the night.
And she saw 'em in the park with his daughter, they holding hands
Arm around his woman's shoulder, he ain't give her not a glance
She accepts her sad reality, she doesn't stand a chance,
One woman gets the man, the other woman gets the dance.

Lecrae,"[Verse 1: Propaganda]
Slang came from a land where they suffer from the effects of depravity like gang bangin' and earthquakes.
Most famous no namers split a brain and plant a taste for the King of kings. I know it's a strange concept.
Pedalin' redemption boy what more can I say make me and Lecrae been trying to make Him famous since ninety three.
Fillin' these 58′s with phrases that would deem us unfit to succeed among these heathens.
It's so crucial in the belly of the crucible that you would understand that stage like your morning candle.
It's handin' out cancer that's why fame was never the aim and the back is the front – homie left side up!
That's a concept

Misconception
Those deadly habits have me losin' my cool...
It's what your frame of mind has chosen.
I'll leave your brain stimulated...

[Verse 2: Braille]
So many mis... conceptions- missin' the mark- mis-directed- drivin' reckless and aggressive
Fueled by our false perceptions- our methods need corrections-
Spittin venom in their face and violate the ones we should protect it's an attempt to motivate
Neglect our obligations place the blame on someone else point out the flaws in other people and take the focus off ourselves
Those who have been abused – view leadership as illegitimate so they don't think it's necessary to play by the rules or submit
They see authority as nothin' more than a power-trip – they don't want to be plugged into it
They'd rather see that power stripped – get it? Power strip... It's unfortunate
Disproportionate the door is wide open for false teachers to twist the truth and distort it
No examples left to follow left to our demise actin' foolish but can't see it so we're wise in our own eyes
The life and crucifixion of Christ is a beautiful depiction of service and submission – within a leadership position

[Verse 3: Odd Thomas]
You probably have it all figured out, right? Like your the type that believes that if you act right then that just might make you righteous in God's sight
You've been a really good person, you followed the good book as much as you could, you probably didn't go to church as much as you should, but it's all good
I mean you never really killed anybody, never really steal from anybody, you never lusted much, or did much, touching of any bodies.
You never use the Lord's name in vain, and you respect you neighbor, you try to maintain peace, love your enemies and not hold on to anger
You really believe that you could receive God's favor by your good deeds and right behavior
But you're dead in your transgressions and need a savior
Cause you could never win God's approval with the removal of sinful discretions – your righteous acts of removing God's wrath is in fact the biggest misconception...

[Verse 4: Lecrae]
Since my conception I've been riddled with deception
Televised lies devised to lead a blind insurrection
Against the resurrection - and the greatest misconception the world believes the Christian is foolish without direction.
And they knock it they knock it but what does it profit a prophet to be socially ostracizing no we ain't stoppin' the mocking
But if there is anything I can do to raise the stock in the market for a Biblical worldview then there's no longer an option
Here with the humble beast, ain't no subtleties, ain't no tongue in cheek, this is what I mean, they don't understand anything about the faith I believe, and they want to belittle me
But it's cool though. They just know the pseudo, the fake faith, the false one, the western God that's man made, not the Biblical Awesome
Toss em' – Pick up the Reasons for God by Timothy Keller and read it, there is a God you should believe in and his name is Jesus...",Misconception
Lecrae,"[Verse 1:]
(And they say) You only live once so live it up tonight
I hope we live twice cause I can't wait to give up this life
Don't get me wrong I love my fam and my experience
Been around the world and back seven wonders I done seen 'em
Number eight is just us wonderin what happens when we perish
And I don't want no regrets I'm a tell the ones I cherish
That I love 'em thinking of 'em on this red eye flight to Paris
If I die before I wake at my wake please tell my parents
That your son will positively wake in paradise
Life is like a pair of dice so watch the ones you rollin with
Roll the clip of my life you gon' see a bunch of empty bottles
Broken hearts and blurry nights, Facebook likes and twitter follows
I'm not livin for today cause tomorrows looking pleasant
And the future is a gift even though this is the present
Yea I do believe in heaven but my actions ain't the key
Them gates remain locked if everything follow me

[Hook:]
So let em know that when I come to the end of my road
And they ask me was it worth it
The hurting, the pain, and the life I chose
I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart heart heartbeat
I'll tell 'em I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart heart heartbeat
And I die with no regrets

[Verse 2:]
You not a leader cause they follow you on twitter
And you not a man based up on your age and your gender
If you die tonight you'll probably die a boy
Chasing toys objectifying these women thinkin they gon' bring you joy
Don't you want more than last night's braggin rights
What's yo life?
I know it's hard to think about underneath these flashing lights
Scratch the surface money's worthless when it comes to finding purpose
If you keep the end in focus you can't keep it when it's over
And when it's over there's something else starts
Only thing that's really gon' matter is that hope inside your heart
What you trusting in what you lusting in
For that busty momma that's strutting in
And you popping bottles you throwing dollars
That's cool but partner this just in
That you gon' live forever whether you want to or not
Some of us gon' end up holy some of us gon' end up hot
Tell this life to keep my problems kiss my momma when I'm gone
Tell her I have no regrets and I'm home I'm home

I think they think they know me, I think they think they get it
Some holy water, crucifix 'n mix it with some lyrics
But this ain't that and that ain't rap, we're going in lock the front door if I ain't back
They feelin you, Crae, it's cool, I'm respected, but I won't be a slave to acceptance
I got my co-sign from the master, so maranatha
They like the flow, oh they go'n love the message

Nah, I'm sure that they'll reject it, but that's what they supposed to do

Say they married to the game but mayne they souls stay itchin'

Hey Bun call from Texas, told me Crae, I get it,
You are no impostor, you spit it how you live it
Them inmates tellin me keep spittin 'n don't quit it
Cause when that music play they ain't worried about the sentence
25 to life boy the dead has risen, so tell Sing Sing, the king is coming back to get 'em.
I'm so reckless with my message I don't care tho, call me a weirdo, but I'm an heirloom
And if I say it, then I mean what I say, boy I live for the truth and I die for the way.
And when that inspiration hit me I write it, while try to fight it
If I'm thinking too hard, don't try it, they'll never buy it.
And if they don't buy it, they don't buy it, okay, I get it.
They want inherited wealth, so I'm giving them the business

You are not the product of all of yo life's misshappnins

Made in His image, most of y'all don't hear me
Looking for identity in the things that you givin
The gift, not the giver mayne it's cold in the winter
When you face your life existence stop looking like you's a winner
That S class Mercedes, Bugatti, yeah that Bentley
Won't fit up in my coffin when I die, can't take em with me.
But still I let em tempt me, and show me what I'm worth
But none of then can solve my problems or my hurt.
Reject me

This is not the first time I'm far from just gettin my feet wet
And this is won't be the last time I tell the world about your love and they tell me I'm a reject

Money don't solve it all, man, look what happen to Dion
I bought my dream house, but only made me wake up
It all falls down even if you got ya' cake up

Confessions of a millionaire, lifestyles of the famous
There's nothing I can't I have, you say it looks so amazing
Well, I would trade it all away for my sanity
Confessions of a millionaire

I've flown first class, flown private jets
Rode in the foreign cars, still so unimpressed
'Cause after she spent all that money on her chest
She thought it make her life better, but she finds she still depressed
Ain't nothing wrong with havin' it, matter fact, go and get it
But if you find identity in it then go 'n forget it
You gain the whole world but lost the only thing ya' own
'Cause everything else is just a temporary loan

Lecrae,"Turn the music up inside my session
These folks gotta hear my message
You put that beat on, I beat on this track to relieve my stressin’
I see more trials than Cochran, while TV tryna’ box me
Them magazines ain't on my page, but ain’t none of that gon’ stop me
Keep the fame and acclaim, I won’t be a slave for a chain
And why stay the same for the change, let’s talk ‘bout change for a change
Mundane, killa’ bang, sell cane for the gain, pump vanity in your veins
No, they hopin’ I quit, ‘fact they hopin’ I die, no, they hopin’ I'm plain insane
‘Cause they know I ain't playing, got my faith on display
And I got some ridas behind me, and they mean what they saying
Knock, knock. Open up. We at yo’ door. Hope you prepared now
And I think it's clear now, potna’ we here now
And don't plan on goin’ no where, consider yo’self infested
And these strings all up in yo’ veins, consider yo’self infected
And what we say we live out, ‘fo we give in we give out
And when we die we come back, tell Death he’ll never win out
They ain't never stop us, pop us, drop us, watch us pop right back up
And we never gone die, that’s why we ride & rise like Pac got back up
Go’n back up, call back up, everybody go home, just pack up
We plugged into the Highest power, that why we ain't gotta act tough
No poker faces, just smokin’ aces, my house is full
My temple is a dwelling place, my Master’s masterful
You just full of yo’self, you just food on the shelf
Eaten for breakfast, talkin’ reckless ,boy I know the chef
You don’t want he’s cookin’, it’s not easy to stomach
And your words will be eaten, folks’ll be readin’ yo’ vomit
The recipe for disaster asks for blasphemy
And as for me, ask for me, I give you gravity",The Drop (Intro)

I been had it, I been done, I promise that it's all empty
They say they ridin’ Bugatti's, man, put some babies through college
Quit tryna’ act like the trap is cool, ‘cause we tired hearin’ that garbage
Hey, bags of white, pints of lean, I been on dope boys since a teen
But this ain't what we meant to be, and y'all don't make no sense to me
You pump fakin’, ain't shootin’, ain't killin, ain't doin’
Half them thangs you say you doin’, but 116 we stay true an’
Ain't dope dealin’, ain't Po pimpin’, talkin’ ‘bout my own folk killin’

In his song he say he gansta’ but he not

Say he makin’ money, cashin’ big checks
(Fakin!)
While his chain leavin’ green on his neck
(Fakin!)
I’m not impressed

So I guess that make you, yes that make you
That make you a faker!

He was all juiced up, thought he was Tupac
‘Til ‘dem boys caught him, hit him with them two shots
Now, he in the station singin’ like he T-Pain
The bullets made him lean, now I guess he’s 2 Chains
He bought that big-league cannon, wrapped it ‘round a 300
Now matter how you put it, boy, that’s still a 300
Stop that fakin’ and the flatchin’ cut it off
Frontin’ like your paper longer than the Power Ball
He think he Scarface, guess he ain’t seen the movie
Keep on fakin’ ‘til you face down in a Jacuzzi
With some killas in you room with some real guns
That don’t make noise and ain’t plastic but they real guns

Real recognize real; introduce ya’ self
Careful with that cannon boy; you might just shoot ya’ self
Somebody wake em’, tell em’ to stop fakin’
Before they end up lyin’ in the woods buck naked
These killas fulla’ them demons, while you pretendin’ you Scarface
You ain't really no ghetto boy, why you fakin’ that hard face?
That just made him furious; somebody call Fishburne
Tell these boys in the hood 40 cal hits burn
And hell burns hotter, I turn to the Father

Hey, I know you think you the one, homie
But can’t nobody escape gravity

Yes sir, it’s about to go down
It’s spiralin’ to the ground, but I don’t think it’s gon’ slow down
This fallen world is fallin’, this building’s ‘bout to blow down
We just goin’ in circles, we don’t get another go ‘round
(It’s goin’ down) What happens when your life is leveled, bro?
A storm is comin’, can’t nobody’s levies hold,
It’s heavy, bro, but I gotta let you know
It’ll help you look beyond this world like a telescope
(It’d be easy) Yeah, stack your money in the air
‘Til it’s rainin’ hund’eds all around your atmosphere
(It’d be easy) You can build a mansion sky high
‘Til can’t nobody see the roof when they drive by
But death’ll hit you like a drive by
And to that stuff you acquired you gotta say “Bye, bye”
I ain’t gon’ lie, you might go down in history
But everything will go down eventually
Everything is falling (down)

[Chorus]
Everything is falling down, down, down.
It’s goin’ down
It’s goin’ down
I see the sky fallin’
It’s goin’ down
And ain’t no way to solve it
It’s goin’ down
I hear the Lord calling

It’s goin’ down, rather comin’ down wit’ it
Cold world, condition is sin, here is the illness
It’s sickenin’, affliction so erotic, sickness so hypnotic
Desirin’ this virus even though we know it’s toxic
Godless, hallowin’ the gods that is counterfeit
We live from ‘de party o’ ‘de dearly departed
The darkness is flowing from my nostrils
We’re so psychotic, we still partyin’ like we not sick
YOLO, homie, so pour another glass
Roll another one up, let’s put on another mask
Another bundle o’ cash, another shorty to bag,
Same thing e’eryday, groundhog under grass
Man, turn the music up cuz I don’t wanna hear the truth
‘Bout the things I’m living fo is dead and I’m the living proof
Shoot, the sky’s fallin’, ain’t no need to panic
Unless we party ‘til it cracks, seeing Jesus standin’
Coming down

[Chorus]

You scared, I’m not
There’s a time for everything,
A time to be born and a time to die
There’s a time when the world as we know it will end
When that is, I don’t know
But it is goin’ down

Listen, it’s goin’ down, down, down holla’ “Mayday!”
Them fiends looking for candy and them dealers got that pay day
I seen them child soldiers; they was loading up some AK's
Ain’t playin’ Modern Warfare. Don't you know ain’t a war fair?
Scales are never even, but they be triple beamin’
They keep them fiends fienin’, the Devil stay scheming
And dreamers steady dreamin’, but ain’t no hope here
Ain’t no satisfaction in money, women, and clothes here
Oh yeah! Them Christians in Christian Audigier
Hey, can't some young men say the stuff we gotta say
‘Cause everything is fallen, it could happen any day
Your world come tumbling down and ain’t no way to get away
You ain’t never gon’ say you ain’t hear it from Lecrae

[Chorus]",Falling Down
Lecrae,"But should I fall
I'm still free from it all

Round of applause, I pause to take a photo op
None of it's real; it's just Photoshopped
Crop out my flaws then my failures, my aches and all my ailments
Now I'm picture perfect, take all my dirt and conceal it
Really, I no better than any
But they pay me a pretty penny to sit and look pretty
Not to big, not skinny, be whatever these fans demand of me
'Cause otherwise they probably wouldn't love me
The show goes on even after the curtains close
I smile and pose, put my signature on they clothes
They lift me up so high that I'm surely about to fall
The higher that I go the more unforgivin' they are
No grace and no exceptions, all they want is perfection
The man in the mirror can't even see his reflection
You live for their acceptance, you die from their rejection
But even if I fall, I fell in the right direction

[Chorus]
Cameras flash, the curtains call, the credits roll down the screen
Critics laugh, they hate us all as they applaud
But should I fall
I'm still free from it all

Life is a cage, a prison of everyone's approval
Fight for acceptance and struggle so you don't ever lose it
But livin' for their acceptance has got us stressing
Insecure people obsessed with leaving impressions
Ladies spending time on their faces painting pretty lines
To you and me it's make-up, but to her, it's a disguise
You look her in her eyes and see her soul cry
'Cause living for other people's got her living a lie
Hadn't slept in day, close his eyes and he pray
Someone would miss him if he fell like a star out of space
But I'm sure they'll replace him, just a name and a face
They say they love you, but it's easy to fall from their graces
Live for everyone else gotcha losin' yourself
Why be slave when made to be free from the guilt?
To be free from the shame, you are more than a name
If you go down you got the freedom to get up again

[Chorus]

Every moment is passing; just let 'em go
In fifty years, man, who cares? We'll be super old
Many winners will lose, many heroes will fall
And if that's me I'm still (free from it all)

[Chorus]",Free from It All
Lecrae,"It's gravity
Keeps pullin' me down

I pen songs for the perishin' and parishioners
Them hearers and them listeners, the home and the visitors
This is not a game, you can't tame or make it purty
They say the earth cursed, so our mouths stay dirty
There's mud on the track, a slug in ya' back
Police done pulled you over wit' a gun in ya' lap
And you ain't the power to make it through this parade
The workers can't keep the profit everything here is vain
My job oppressive, I strive for my blessin's
The pastor so corrupt it's hard to ride with his message
Riches destroy the owners, the government think they own us
My onus is to keep the police from ridin' all up on us
Leavin' money to kids who spend it on getting' blitz
Say, what's the point of livin' to give it up in the end
Then again, all my sin has been pinned to the cross
I know I'm free forever from this land of the lost

[Chorus]
Yeah, every time I think I'm flying
I'm just falling
So close to touching the sky
But gravity keeps pulling me back down
But I can't stay here forever
I want to go, ooh one day! 
I want to go
Somewhere where there's no gravity

Somebody told me there was no such thing as truth
I said, ""If that's the case then why should I believe you?""
Murder, money, and mayhem, every place that I lay in
My problems follow suit, I'm tailor-made for this, ain't I?
It's deep. You wanna go deep? I'll take you deep
Reality is really just cheap
Yo' eyes wide open apparently, but you sleep
And everything you have in your hands you'll never keep
So why hold on, I flow on to go on, before long I float on
Eternal life is what I'm thinkin' I'mma bank my hope on
Believe me, easy is irrelevant
The devil want us burning for the hell of it
Elephants in the room say we can't talk about impending doom
Or we gospel rappin' or preaching people out of they shoes
It's cool, I'll be that dude. We glued to our depravity, 
Until somebody free us from this gravity. Fly!

Them beams on blocks including my own pops
Homie I seen too much to drink them two cups
Can't lean on the lean already way too screwed up
Was way to gone I was way to cold
Fifty yard hail Mary I was way to thrown
I was Tarzan raised by gorillas and the beasts
High on them trees when I gorilla'd the beast
Then that truth came hit me got me outta my grave

When it's all said and done
You and I are the lucky ones
We fought many
And we'll fight the night until we see the sun
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones
We are here

Under the sun, I found we were left to drown
Evil abounds, weight is pullin' us down
No sight or sound, impaired to His care
Chasing after the wind, running after the air
Deserving of desertion, servants of destruction
And everyday we taste of a grace that we're unconcerned with
My sin I should be burned with, I'm guilty, filthy, and stained
But He became a curse, drank my cup and took my pain
And for that he reigns, through faith I'm changed
And I don't have a reason why he loosened up my chains
I don't believe in luck; I believe in grace
But they say we're lucky cause we seen your face
And we heard Him call us, and He heard our answer
And He gives us second chances when we throw our hands up
So weary and broken, hopin' His arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into focus
(I guess we the luck ones, huh?)

[Chorus]

You're greater than my shame, guilt, my doubt, and my past
Fortunate to trust in you cause I've doubted your plans
I've questioned your ways, every question I raised
Is foolishness compared to mountains, the wind, and the waves
You're so mindful of us, we rise from the dust
You love these cheating, beating hearts and these eyes full of lust
Gave us power to fight it, though we cower in quiet
We have the faith to start a riot; how can we deny it?
Fire inside us that you kindle when it starts to dwindle
And simply put I'm sinful so your love is essential
I don't believe in luck, no, I believe in grace
But they say we lucky cause we seen your face
Lord, we heard you call us, You heard our answer
And you give us second chances when we throw our hands up
I'm weary and broken, but your arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into your focus

See, I'm not sayin' I'm always right
And I ain't sayin' that I'm perfect

I'm glad that I got it

Lecrae,"Yeah

Awakened from my slumber by the thunder, lightning clapping
Raining on my window pane and praying I make something happen
A preacher's prophecies never bothered me when I was younger
Sitting on my Grandma's lap, as she cried I often wondered
What was her tears for?
Could it be for my grandfather?
Or maybe she felt for me 'cause I'll see more of those cold tomorrows
Then she see the world will up and turn on me
'Cause the morals that she often spoke were meant for 1923
I fall asleep off in her arms, a Psalm was spoken
The Lord is surely my shepherd, he lead me to the water
Thought that often stuck with with me
Amongst the wolves that run the streets
Out here paying dues to lose
I pray your angels come for me
A non-believer I never have and never could be
Lord give me time to peep the signs I should see
Sipping got me feeling like a player riding clean
Bending corners hoping I might find my Savior on the curb
I rarely go to Church
False prophets rocking Prada so I rarely feel the word
Jezebels lurking in the pews on the first
Preacher's weaker than the deacon 'cause it's hard to fight the urge
It's hard to live and serve when you on the Devil's turf
Sell your soul for the low with no sense of what it's worth
Don't get it twisted, I ain't no saint, I ain't no pastor
But prayer ain't just for cloudy days and natural disasters
Aware of what comes after, I bet you ain't for sure
I was warned that Heaven ain't the only place to go
I'm doing what I can cause there really ain't much time
I leave this in the Lord hands
I'm tired of crying

Yeah, close it

Man down
Hope and pray and say I can’t turn (Man down)
He will find you, this world will grind you down
Don’t you be another (Man down)
Hope and pray and say you can turn (Man down)

Don’t be afraid to say

Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Am I bias? I been pious put my nose up in the pews
Like Paul I bear good news
They think I'm pall-bearing
My message sounds like death to these hearers as they perish
Scaring to think we on the brink of death
But no one stops to look for answers on what happens next
Got a couple scriptures from my grandma
Sayings from a preacher
But can't live out these standards that we heard it takes to reach 'em
But when I look at Jesus
He live the life I couldn't
Suffered for my crime so I wouldn't
I used to have to sneak into movies 'cause I couldn't afford to pay
Explain to me how someone paved my way
When I hear K.R.I.T. Confessing I respect him
Cause most of us be lying like our lives don't need perfecting
Nothing that we can muster, nothing that we can change
Admitting that we're imperfect, offending God with our games
Look I'm just being honest so don't take me for no lame
I seen it for myself, I'm a product of this thing
Now I found true religion, and it's not inside a denim
And 'em overpriced shades are never giving us vision, let's go

Man down
Hope and pray and say I can’t turn (Man down)
He will find you, this world will grind you down
Don’t you be another (Man down)
Hope and pray and say you can turn (Man down)
I seen another to know, so urgent
Keep callin'
Help is just one call away
Don't be afraid to say

The key to life: money, power, respect
Louie this, Gucci that, two private jets
Big money, big business, watch that paper stack
Treat life like a game, it ain't pool but I'm racked
Up, big bucks, no whammys
I swear I prolly lump somebody head for a Grammy
My heart black as the Lambo Kim bought for Kanye
And I ain't fronting, I'm just telling ya'll what God say
Blood thirsty
Seek my own will since the day that Adam cursed me
The lust for power go to ya' brain if you let it
You say, ""What up dog?"" I hear ""god."" I'm so dyslectic
Sit on the throne, it's really a toilet, heart is septic
I have no power, I get handed death, I must accept it
It's hard to see the light when you never listen

Well, I'm a genius in my dreams
Even if I was, it was stitched inside my genes
I'm self-inflated, self-infatuated
And somehow I convinced myself I finally made it
The truth is I was made like the mob
Geppetto put me together; my strings lead to God
Pride come befo' the fall, I seen it in the script
So if you see me fallin', prolly a power trip

I roll with the Trinity, this is sorta the Matrix
A hard pill to swallow: we're evil to the core
Wicked power exploits the poor, and it brings war
Power can be a field of dreams loaded with land mines
We know the ruler so you can't say these are bad lines

We Invictus, this sin sickness is in us
Running a muck and causing that mischief, tell me this then, ""Who could really fix us?""

Lecrae,"Now, I'mma tell the world, tell the world, tell 'em
I'mma tell it everywhere I go
Tell the world, tell 'em
Yeah, I'm a billboard
Tell the world, tell 'em
And I'm broadcastin' like a radio
Tell the world, you ought to know
I'm brand new

I know one thing's true
I don't even really deserve to know you
But I am a witness that you did this, and I'm brand new
So, I'm ready to go
And I'mma tell the world what they need to know
A slave to myself, but you let me go
I tried getting high, but it left me low
You did what they could never do
You cleaned up my soul and gave me life
I'm so brand new, and that's all that matters
I ain't love you first, but you first loved me
In my heart I cursed you, but you set me free
I gave you no reason to give me new seasons
To give new life, new breathin'
But you hung there bleedin'
And ya' died for my lies and my cheatin'
My lust and my greed, and
What is a man that you mindful of him?
And what do I have to deserve this lovin'?

Tryna make the moments last
Holdin' onto the past
But like a hero in a dream
Christ came and he rescued me

Tell the world
You ought to know, I'm brand new

I can't offer you nothin'
But your care and kindness keeps comin'
And your love is so unconditional
I get butterflies in my stomach
I got the old me in the rearview
Now the new me got a clear view
And I was so dead, I couldn't hear you
Too deep in sin to come near you
But you drew me in, you cleaned me up
So take me home, beam me up
Before you do, just let me tell the truth
And let these folks know that I done seen your love
And it's everlasting, infinite
It goes on and on, you can't measure it
Can't quench your love
They can't separate us from the love of God
There's no estimate
My face look the same, my frame ain't rearranged
But I'm changed, I promise I ain't the same
Your love's so deep, you suffered and took pain
You died on the cross to give me a new name
Ain't nothing like I've seen before, I got a beaming glow
I was low, down, and dirty, but you cleaned me, Lord
You adopted me, you keep rocking me
I'mma tell the world, and ain't nobody stopping me

Tryna make the moments last
Holdin' onto the past
But like a hero in a dream
Christ came and he rescued me

Lecrae,"[Chorus]
War, pain, violence should stop!

4-fever, 9 millimeter
‘Dem a’ want a heater 'cause the streets is finna heat up
Six million ways to die; choose 10
And if he don't die then he probably do ‘em again
From passionate catastrophe, to genocidal blasphemy
No respect for humanity, they resort to insanity
Head bang on the glass, call it window pain
Jumping out the window tryna’ get my frame through the frame
Close range; when he point, I just blank-out
Felt my heart sank when that bang thang rang out
Now you got yo thang out, you take life, you give it
You took his life away, but you gave yours up to system
No wanna listen, no reason for livin’
We bought the lie we can't be forgiven for all our sinnin’
Killin’ is the religion, service is in a prison
Ignorance got a slave and our name in the mentions

[Chorus]

Bad man, bad man, gun man, bad man
Squeeze bullet, pow-pow. Body bag man.
No bother with no war. No bother with no violence.
No bother with the six-feet-rest-in-peace silence

Grew up under Tupac: bible verse and two glocks
Say we ready to die, see a ghetto in the sky
Couldn't be more wrong than right shoes on the left feet
Highway to hell and we fighting for the best seat
No heart, bullet’s got no name
Little boys wanna bang but ‘dem barely got a brain
‘Dem barely got aim, but they shooting for nothin’
They rob a sister of her brother for a couple a hund’ed
They thinkin’ that life is cheap but it's expensive as ever
They'll be sentenced to forever for them heartless endeavors
I try to tell ‘em (simmer down brethren), but they like whateva’
Too scared of being broke to think about being betta’
Plus, we get bombarded by all these images of bravado
You ain't really a man if you don't follow these models
But the weakest ones follow, the strong reconsider
You can forgive much if you understand you forgiven

[Chorus]",Violence
Lecrae,"I get a little weak sometimes
Teach me the way, night and day


Oh, I'm under pressure, man, I'm under pressure
Been tryna walk it out I keep ended up a stretcha'
Problems in life'll stretch ya', ain't got it all together
They say the change comin', but it's feelin' like forever
Oh, I'm on mission, they probably think missin'
Some screws, but it's these three nails that keep me drivin'
If God ain't with me, I know that I'm gon' fail
And ain't a wish in the well that can wish ya' boy well
Cells eaten by cancer got me lookin' for answers
Doctors say my daughter won't grow up to be a dancer
Just walked out that funeral, I'm right back in my cubicle
Lord, I'm ready for heaven; I'm just waitin' on the cue to go
Feel like givin' up and just blamin' it on my daddy
He never meant to have me, and problems keep comin' at me
I wanna walk with Jesus, but my legs too heavy
I'm hopin' prayer works 'cause the walls can't hear me
Come on!

So I drop to my knees and I scream with my might
I'm know that these walls can't hear me
I say, ""Lord, please won't you hear my cry?""
I know that these walls can't hear me
Maybe if I plead and I sing out loud
I know that these walls can't hear me
Jesus come walk, come walk with me now
'Cause I know that these walls can't hear me

Oh, D Wade died first, now my Uncle Skip gone
Then I lost my grandpa, and that's when it hit home
That people keep leavin' me, this world keep deceiving me
They sellin' me false hope, and I keep believing it
Come on!
I promise I think I'm going insane
Come on!
And gravity pullin' me down the drain
Come on!
My boys in Afghanistan goin' crazy
Staring at them pictures of they babies
Bullets flyin' everywhere, prayin' they gon' make it home
Lord, give 'em Hope. Without it, what else they bankin' on?
Everything is fallin' all around me, put yo' arms around me
Sinkin' in my sorrows got me drowning
Tempted to empty bottles and throw 'em off in wind
Devils lurkin' 'round the corner, just waitin' for me to sin
I pray that you sustain me and keep me from givin' in
Ain't gotta get me out; just get through to the end!
Lord Jesus, come on!

See I need some healing
'Cause I'm losing feeling
Lord won't you please hear my cry, yeah
Let your love rain from the sky",Walk with Me

Hey, I know you think you the one, homie
But can't nobody escape Gravity

Yes sir, it's about to go down
It's spiralin' to the ground, but I don't think it's gon' slow down
This fallen world is fallin', this building's 'bout to blow down
We just goin' in circles, we don't get another go 'round

A storm is comin', can't nobody's levies hold,

We're so psychotic, we still partyin' like we not sick
YOLO, homie, so pour another glass
Roll another one up, let's put on another mask
Another bundle o' cash, another shorty to bag, 
Same thing e'eryday, groundhog under grass
Man, turn the music up 'cuz I don't wanna hear the truth
'Bout the things I'm living fo is dead and I'm the living proof
Shoot, the sky's fallin', ain't no need to panic
Unless we party 'til it cracks, seeing Jesus standin'

You scared, I'm not
There's a time for everything, 
A time to be born and a time to die

Listen, it's goin' down, down, down holla' ""Mayday!""
Them fiends looking for candy and them dealers got that pay day
I seen them child soldiers; they was loading up some AK's
Ain't playin' Modern Warfare. Don't you know ain't a war fair?
Scales are never even, but they be triple beamin'
They keep them fiends fienin', the Devil stay scheming
And dreamers steady dreamin', but ain't no hope here
Ain't no satisfaction in money, women, and clothes here
Oh yeah! Them Christians in Christian Audigier
Hey, can't some young men say the stuff we gotta say
'Cause everything is fallen, it could happen any day
Your world come tumbling down and ain't no way to get away

Is where they thought I came from after my ship had landed
Truth is I had this meeting with God and confessed my sin
And he gave me this new beginning all I could do then was pen it
All down in my notebook, just a lot of verses
Me learning how not to curse was like learning to write in cursive
She still flirting with me even though we up in church
And I'm fighting to memorize all these verses up in the word
You would have never seen it coming
A couple months ago I'm getting high with my cousin
And fast forward now around campus I am buzzing
Not really but it felt like that, it felt like rap was just another passion
Never thought I'd be at the Grammy's talking about my fashion
You don't believe in God? Well how do you explain what happened?
I promise we ain't plan it, now Christians unashamed from Zambia to Manhattan
Still looking for the pattern? Come On

What would it take to make you believe?
More fire from the sky? Another part in the sea?
The honest truth is, that you ain't got the power to see

I wouldn't call it gospel music, but I'm Christian though
And this what happen when a Christian flow
Now it's funny cause I don't really got a home
And this industry saying leave him alone
Unless he become a clone
Have me singing the same old songs, no power in 'em
But I'm too hard to understand, I'm an algorithm
And evidently it's evidence I'm a resident
Of somewhere that you know that you oughta be but you never been

Apparently, you can't tell the fake from the real
And these rappers getting all sensitive in my ears
Insecure whining makes it harder to hear
But uhh, that ain't here nor there
I swear I respect the kind of reject that
Wanna rebel and just reflect on real things like feelings
But these feelings are kinda suspect
Look, I came from a past so shameful
Took advantage of the girls by the handful
Had no remorse recourse was a boy until I ran into the source of the voice
Telling me everything I was on was wrong
Yessir, I was on my throne
Now I hear the same thing, same thing
But I hear it in a song and they wanting me to sing along
Woah, that's trifling, for a grown man that's stifling
I was on the same path for the wrath
I just never got paid for the trash I was writing
But like lightning, that light came and struck me
My life changed, and then suddenly
I met The Lord, and it wasn't even a Sunday
Maybe, one day, someday, you'll give ya' life up to Jesus
Instead of giving ya' life up to pieces
That's gon' rust and fade when you cease

You slow me down cause you know me now with my phony smile
And I'm acting like it's all copacetic
It's so pathetic, so juvenile
Know what you do
You keep me cool in the summer

In grade school out blasting my Outkast

Money money money sex drugs and the coroners
All this killin' but where the bodies at
All this money where the Bugattis at
But dig a lil deeper
And you'll find another insecure man sittin' in a 2 seater
The same little boy that got beat up
Plenty pains in his past you could bring up
Nobody ever told him he could be more than he is
But inside he's a leader
I didn't know who was inside me either
Striving to be a captain
Hopin' I could date a cheerleader
Tryna get me a throne of my own so I could put my feet up

Somehow he still makes these melodies with my felonies
I ain’t buyin' nothin' they sellin' me what you tellin' me
Broken pieces actin' like we ain’t cracked
Man we all messed up and cain’t no one escape that
We some broken people
Came from broken homes
Broken hearts inside of a broken soul
Alcoholics, the addicts
English, African, Arabs
Ain’t no riches to fix it
You still broke when you have it
If you ain’t breakin' bad and you still chasin' the habit
It ain’t no wonderland so we still chasing the rabbit

Work just like me

Regardless of our money we all broke together
And if we don't swallow our pride we gon choke together
Tryna hold onto our lives with these clumsy hands
Fell off the wall of purity
Doing that Humpty dance
Forget the king's horses
Forget the king's men
The King is coming to put us back together again
Been fighting since my daddy left
Fighting for approval
Think I don't know tryna get this world to love me is futile

We are outsiders, outliers

I will fear no evil, for you are wit me

I honestly grow insecure as I get older
'Cause even when you hot there comes a day when you get colder
Comes a day when you slower, time is taking its toll
45 On the back of the jersey upon your soul
I'm scared of letting go, I don't know what the future holds
My nightmares are having nightmares
I'm quite scared of what's right and fair
How I fear an eternity
Will I hear well done when he's turning me?
Will I hear you care too much about all this stuff that really don't matter?
You chase the wind and you don't want it
Got to the top of a 2 foot ladder
What's after I can capture all this mess my heart was after?
Will I end up empty-handed when I stand before my master?
Did I master the mathematics of a passive disaster?
Add in my selfish ambition
All the while, subtracting what matters
I don't know

At late nights, I can't sleep
Will I fall? Will I peep?
Through the curtains, all I see, fingers pointed at me
And they watching, and they watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking，thinking bout‘
At late nights, I can't sleep
Counting cash, counting sheep
Through the curtains, all I see fingers pointed right at me
And I'm watching, and I'm watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking, thinking bout'it all

In high school, we tried to act all tough
I remember a couple times, I couldn't back that up
Like when I ran from them vatos, scuffing up my zapatos
Scared of losing my high, I was so embarrassed inside
If I could go back in time, I would stand and say something like
I ain't never scared, never scared, never scared
I'm lying, I'm scared of these thoughts in my head
I'm scared of possibly pushing people right over the ledge
When I say I pledge allegiance to the struggle
Then, I turn around and buckle
Under stress and under pressure
Bible on my dresser that can teach my pain a lesson
But I rather not address it
Address that's in depression
I'm scared if I confess it
That you gon' look at me like I'm something less
And I'm such a mess

C'est lui qui a peur d'admettre ses craintes
Et c'est lui qui ne pourra pas les surmonter
On trouve la liberté dans la confession
Et la liberté dans la reconnaissance

And it just so happen, I'm wrestling with my status
I'm trying to see me like He do, not focusing on this madness
They count on me, count me out on a count of they fear and doubts
Keep account of my wrongs, trying to keep me inside they house
Some just keep me around, I wonder what that's about
Yeah! They wanna be politically correct, I suppose
But, I'm comfortable in my skin
While they just pretend in they clothes
I'm scared of falling and failing in front of all of my foes
And I feel some friends are unfaithful
So, I keep my small circle closed
I don't want no handouts or favors, no functional saviors
I'ma tell that truth till it kill me and I'm chilling with my Creator
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus to all of my haters
For the ones that think I forgot him
And the ones who won't let me say
I ain't scared no mo'

At late nights, I can't sleep
Will I fall? Will I peep?
Through the curtains, all I see, fingers pointed at me

Remember back in '02
When I was in school and actin' a fool
My soul got saved
My debt had been paid
But still I kept running off with my crew
Sex on my brain and death in my veins
Had a main thang we stayed up til 2
Smokin'
Waking and bakin' we naked
My body was lovin' it
Soul was hatin' it
Time and time after time
Our bodies grew close the girl was so fine
Heard a heart beat that wasn't hers or mine
The miracle of life had started inside
My God
Ignored the warning signs
Supressed that truth I felt inside
I was just havin' fun with this
I'm too young for this
I'm thinkin' me myself and I
Should I sacrifice this life
To keep my vanity and live nice
And she love and trust me so much
That whatever I say she'll probably oblige
But I was too selfish with my time
Scared my dreams were not gone serve
So I dropped her off at that clinic
That day a part of us died

I was barely in the first grade
Got teeth mission'
Watchin' Tom & Jerry
Tryna go outside so I can play
I was told to watch out for strangers
Keep my eyes peeled for danger
Folks workin' late I had a baby sitter
I ain't 'bout to sit here and name her
I was almost 8 when she came in late
Woke me up with a game to play
Did a few things that's hard to say
And told me to keep that secret safe
Now how a young boy supposed to deal
I'm tryna act like it ain't real
Had my innocence just stripped from me
And I still don't know how to feel
And I wonder how to address it
Can't tell my family too messy
So I just embrace it it's hard to face it
I'm too ashamed to confess it
So I kept it in and ain't speak
Didn't think it hit me so deep
So into it I got promiscuous
And only God could help me get free
But I been forgiven
My Savior risen
I'm out the prison
I know that
I got the power to say to no to all of my struggles
God will control that
Every time we slip and we fall
Gotta get back up and fight on
We are not defined by our past
The future look bright
I see the light on

Always on a trail of another female
Well, well they say my papa was a player
So my dishonesty is honest in me baby
Somehow in college greek letters made me cuter
All the time on line I still couldn't compute it
Uh, I pledge girls then it's on to the next girl
My next girl eventually be my ex girl
But its' funny how it all unfolds
I done finally found a woman I ain't never letting go whoa

Ooh she looking bad (Don't do it)
I wonder if she got a man (Don't do it)
I don't see no wedding band (Don't do it)
I promise you don't wanna go through it (Take it from me)
You don't want no problems (You don't want no problems)
You don't want no problems (You don't want no problems)
You don't want no problems G

It ain't nothing like a good woman
If you got you one of those, be good to 'em
Keep it a honey love, everybody want it
But the lies and the lust keep lying next to us, but
I got past, and now I'm known to pass it
Up from my passion and I ain't here blastin'
Born a sinner just like any man standing
Couldn't keep standing so God sent a stand-in
If you creepin' when you feel desire creep in
I know another way to win that don't involve cheating
Don't involve another heart broken into pieces
When a girl call you tell you she saw you on Peach St
Meet pretty underscore nice features
Had a couple drinks and had yourself a little piece and
Now you feel like the man in the streets pull 'em to the crib
I see your pants in the street, man

Ooh she looking bad (Don't do it)
I wonder if she got a man (Don't do it)
I don't see no wedding band (Don't do it)

You see, that's my cousin, that was my sister, like my friend
No, I don't wanna hear it

They say that
Time waits for no man
Nah, they probly lyin'
'Cause time waits on me like a servant all of the time
But, uh
I know some people who actually servin' time
Committed to this grind
Or just committed some crimes
Some times
I wish I had some more time to think
And all the time in the world is all the time I need
And I know eternity's callin'
But my mind
Too busy racin' to pay any mind
Spent a whole lot of money on a watch
Ironic cuz I got it
But I hardly sit and watch
The time tick by
I spend time tryna buy it to own time
I never thought that I was only
Wastin' my own time
Who holds time?
They say he'll be coming in no time

On the corners in the alleys
I see conans and cowards
Scared to question their existence
Like ain't no final hour
Can we blame the sins of a reverend for all our irreverence
Does my time spent on earth qualify me for heaven
Did we tick him off by wastin' all of these ticks on this clock
Or is he graciously givin' me time to give him my heart
I'm sure it's the latter
Sure that it matters
And I believe
I've been given all this time
So I can try and redeem it
Or make the most of this stop watch that I'm racin'
You stop and watch you ain't racing
You erasing yo minutes
You can't replace 'em
At the end of yo days
When eternity's in yo face
You had one life to offer up in his service or lay to waste
So my Rollie's tellin' me to roll out
Make investments with my time

Good afternoon from the flight deck
Were cruising at 37,000 feet and we just passed over the coast
We will be beginning our descent in about a 30 minutes
Like to take this opportunity to welcome you to America
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa ta na na na na

Uh  I was made in America land of the free, home of the brave
Right up under your nose you might see a sex slave being traded
And will do anything for the money
Boy, a momma might sell her babies
Sell porn sell pills anything to pay the bills
Anything to bring that pay
Gotta scratch that itch gotta scratch them ticks
Ain’t rich but I might be
And I'mma shoot these flicks I'mma turn these tricks anything for a slight fee
Yea made in America
Momma told me that I belong here
Had to earn our stripes had to learn all rights had to fight for a home here
But I wouldn't know a thing about that
All I know is drugs and rap
I probably could have been some kinda doctor
Instead of holding guns and crack
I was born in the mainland
Great-grandpa from a strange land
He was stripped away and given bricks to lay
I guess you could say he a slave hand
But I was made in America
So I don’t know a thing about that
All I know is uncle Sam look-in for me working on his corner so I know I gotta pay tax
Gettin' paid in America
I was raised in America
And this is all I ever known
If I’m wrong then you better come save me America

Man I’d die for America
I serve my time for America
Got shot shot back with the war
Got back and ain’t nobody give a jack in America
I could lost my life boy I lost my wife
I can’t even get right in my home land
Pulling sweats hold ticks paranoia
Looking out for a threat in own land
I was trained in America
How they get up in the planes in America
People running into buildings
Taking out them buildings
People getting killed in America
And I’m still in America
Though America ain’t feeling me
I went to war for this country
Turn around came home and you rid of me
When y’all free here saying you don’t wanna be here
Well you probably couldn't breathe here if I didn’t load a couple magazines here
Y’all just complain in America
I’m jumping out of military planes for America
Aye I was made in America
That's why I’m out here saving America
I got a brother in the cemetery now
Cause he wanted y’all safe
And everybody want the freedom but nobody want to hear about-face
We bled for America
To keep y’all fed in America
But whats the point of talking a lot of y’all don’t really even care America

Heard everybody rich all I gotta do is run jump kick
I'm a hit in your area
So please pick me America
I know you probably never loved me
You never hear about me on the news
And you’ve probably never been to my country
I hear you selling education and got clothes that you throw away
Got plenty food in your nation
I can tell cause a lot of y’all are over weight
I already work for y’all
I’m at a sweatshops making these shirts for y’all
Naw I ain’t gettin money
Go to bed hungry but I make some exports for y’all
Y’all don’t know a thing about that
You was made in America
I’m trying to find me a ticket
Where the sky is the limit catch a plane to America
It should be plain to America
Y’all blessed people got it made
Heard y’all don’t play no more
Y’all ain’t saved no more
Y’all looking for another way
Well I hope it ain’t true
But I’m packing my suit
Farewell to my mother land

I wish I never held back
Wish nobody had to sell crack
Then I may have seen my dad a little more
Maybe I can dream a little more
But I still wishing on stars in the sky
Wish a lot of people was alive
And I probably passed on a whole lot of truth
But I know about a whole lot of lies
Man I wish I had me a time machine
I would tell Martin it was all a dream
And I wish like Ray J back in 06
Guess it worked ‘cause I got my chick
And I wish like Kellz did
If I could change the clock
Man I’d change a lot
And I probably wouldn’t be so selfish
I woulda gave a lot
Man I’m ashamed of that
I wish I coulda told O thank you
Before it got way too late
I wish I woulda worked on my jump shot
But time just fades away
I probably wish too much
I know I pray less than I should
I know I did too much
I take it all back if I could

Wish I had another chance
Maybe I’ll do better
Maybe I’ll do better
Maybe I’ll do better
Every time I think about all of my mistakes
I just wanna turn it around
Be like oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
If I never went there, I would never know
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Maybe I can turn it around

I wish I didn’t do it but I did it
Man it happened last night
Man I wish I would try to act like you ain’t never lost your sight
And I don’t even do it for the money
Except when I do it for the money
Trying to find yourself and you find yourself doing things in the dark kinda funny
I wish I had ten more wishes
I swear I got ten more visions
And life is a game that I can’t stop playing
Baby gimme like ten more minutes
I’m almost finished
I wish I had a little more time
I gotta whole lot of goals I wish I could achieve, I believe Imma lose my mind
Before I get to those
Yeah I miss the goals
But my shot was off
Can't tell what I lost until I count the cost
But I probably missed my calling
Wish I was a little bit taller
Wish I was a baller
Then again every time I get a little money
I be looking at the next man like he smaller
I can’t call it
And I wish I didn’t go and get high on the one first date
I was all zoned out, paranoid like “did you hear that noise""
And I know she probably thinking I’m cray (crae)
No pun intended
I wish I repented
A little bit quicker
Then again I didn’t pull the trigger
I know I said I have no regrets but I sure do wish every chance I get go figure

Wish I had another chance
Maybe I’ll do better
Maybe I’ll do better
Maybe I’ll do better
Every time I think about all of my mistakes

There was lynching and bombing going on and the gangs were there to protect
What people don't understand is that a lot of the leaders died
Medgar Evers (has been shot), Bunchy Carter (has been shot)
Fred Hampton (has been shot), MLK (has been shot in Memphis Tennessee)
These youngsters didn't have any direction
No leaders to look up to so they imploded on themselves

They say that Crip stands for Community
Revolutionary Interparty Service
Way before the genocide and the murders
A little after integration was the verdict
When bombs might go off at the Sunday service (baow)
They protectin' they community
Then it turn into diplomatic immunity
Then a fight against oppression was the pressin'
Now they keep on losin' battles and they started losin' unity
Now they beat each other blue-black
Force fed self hate 'till the truth crack
Got they own folks hidin' on the rooftops
They ain't finna take no more, they finna shoot back (baow)
Now they bond like a family they all bloods

And what are you gonna do? 
The factories have closed and no one's hiring anybody from the urban community

And it's eighty-nine percent black, you don't see the irony?
What it do to a psyche, it's simple, you don't like me
What I'm 'posed to do now?
Delusional calling that system criminal justice
Where the rich and the guilty are safer than the poor and the innocent
Why would we listen?
When American churches scuff they Toms on our brother's dead bodies
As they march to stop gay marriage
We had issues with Planned Parenthood too
We just cared about black lives outside the womb just as much as in
Young man gon' find purpose somehow
And a nation was at least around
And when them vice lords told him he was of royal decent
And that war on drugs felt much more like war on the poor
He figured forget it
So why don't you come stay a while?
Tell us that the son of man walked on Egyptian
And Eastern soil and wasn't just a Western construct
Or master used to control us
But what the Master used to free us
And it was a crooked system just like this that left the King of Kings bloodless
Yeah, we are truly a descendant of a King
Only his reign is infinite
And being right is a distant second to the joy of compassion

Is it tracks, is it facts?
Is it trap, is it rats?
When metaphors, you ready for the medics stored inside it

Initially made in the Lord's image, dynamic
Nothing lackin', magic couldn't make it happen

That ain't complaining but how can they be mad at all?
King dreamed a dream but we seen scenes that'll make us awe
Change the channel, we channel all of this energy
Pretend to be savages, we ravage our so-called enemies

But it look like us ain't gon' make it less we shake it
We can't look back much
Turned around to give a helping hand

Real recognizing real, and if they don't love me like Pac

When I took off everybody else stalled
I don’t really understand what ya’ll on
What ya’ll want
I can’t live, can’t be free
I can’t be here

Gave up all the best of my years
I done gave everything
I ain’t gained anything
Just pain and more sadness
Just broad strokes and blank stares
No details and no canvas

I done got everything off my chest
But I got one more thing to confess

Never sell my soul I'mma sell my ship
I failed you all because I failed to help
Just know I failed myself
But faith keeps me from folding
It’s all I got left I’m left here with no one
I ain’t choose You but You say I’m chosen
And when I feel lost the cross all I hope in
I lost my religion but I found God
Sounds odd but I’m better at seeing how far
Did I come from the dark is the nights to the light
Irregardless of all of my many flaws

I ain’t livin' for your love
Case dismissed I don’t need another judge
I done got everything off my chest

To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end.
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
the tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?
* Chorus: All of my love, all of my love, All of my love to you. (repeat)
The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Aryan one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
his is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find

Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.

The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.

Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time

Runs straight and high.

And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
And the forests will echo with laughter

There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard

Took my seed from my shaking frame 
Same old fire, another flame

From the deep behind the sun

Left me barely holding on 

With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand 
When we know the time has come 
Lose my senses, lose command 
Feel your healing rivers run 

Is it every time I fall 
That I think this is the one 
In the darkness can you hear me call

Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come

To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
As love in the halls of plenty overrun
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast 
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed 
But no one seemed to question in anyway
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'

Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.

The woe of aftermath,
The drums will shake the castle wall,
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on.

Shoot straighter than before.

That lights the face so cold.

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah

All the fears that she's been hiding  
And it seems pretty soon ev'rybody's gonna know. 
And her voice is sore from shouting  
Cheering winners who are losing  
And she worries if their days are few 
And soon they'll have to go. 

[Chorus]
My my my I'm so happy  
I'm gonna join the band  
We are gonna dance and sing in celebration  
We are in the promised land. 

She hears them talk of new ways 
To protect the home she lives in, 
Then she wonders what it's all about 
When they break down the door. 
Her name is brown or white or black, 
You know her very well, 
You hear her cries of mercy 
As the winners toll the bell.

There is a train that leaves the station 
Heading for your destination, 
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more.

Well, I just got into town today 
To find my girl who's gone away 
She took the Greyhound at the general store 
I searched myself I searched the town 
When I finally did sit down 
I find myself no wiser than before 

She said we couldn't do no wrong 
No other love could be so strong 
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer 
Now she took my heart she took my keys 
From in my old blue dungarees 
And I'll never go to Texas anymore 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I took her love at seventeen 
A little late these days it seems 
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for 
I took her word I took it all 
Beneath the sign that said ""you-haul"" 
She left angels hangin' round for more 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I thought I had it all sewn up 
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
But folks said she was after something more
