Rod Stewart,"This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that come, bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, 'cuse I, I love you
Yes I do, I love you
This old heart, is weak for you

I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me, leaves me incomplete
I'm here for the day, gone for a week
But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I want you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
Tell them all about it, shout all about it
That I love you
This old heart, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you
Yes I do
I love you
This old heart, is weak for you
I love you, this old heart ,is weak for you
I love you, this old heart ,is weak for you
I love you, I weak for you, cry for you, this old heart",This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)
Rod Stewart,"There's a light,
A certain kind a' light
That never shone on me.
I want my life to be, to live with you.
To live with you.
And there's a way, ev'rybody says,
To do each and ev'ry little thing.
But what does it mean
If I ain't got you, if ain't got you?

'Cause you don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, 
To love somebody 
The way I love you.

If I pray
I see your face again;
But I know not where to find
You ain't got to be so blind
I'm blind, so very very blind
I'm a man, 
Can't you see what I am?
I move heaven and earth for you
But what does this man do 
If he ain't got you, if he ain't got you?

'cause you don't know what it's like, baby,
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, 
To love somebody 
The way I love you, I love you, I love you

'cause you don't know what it's like, baby,
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, 
To love somebody 
The way I love you, I love you, I love you, ha

Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Oh baby

You don't know what it's like
You never never know what it's like
To love somebody, 
To love somebody 
The way I love you, I love you, I love you
Yeah
You never, never know what it's like,
Honey
Ooh baby
I love ya, I love ya, I love ya
God almighty, I love ya",To Love Somebody [#]
Rod Stewart,"Yeah
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You've been bored for a long, long time.
You need love and so do I
Let's turn it all around.

I don't want an everlasting thing,
I don't care if I see you again
So grab your coat and honey tell your friends
You won't be home,
You won't be home,
You won't be home.

Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything 'cause I want you to.
Just don't hurt me, baby.

Yeah
I don't really want to challenge you
Marry you or remember you.
I just want to make love to you
For twenty four hours or more.
Or more

I'm only looking for a fantasy,
An interlude from reality
Don't want nobody tryin' to rescue me
So rock me babe,
Rock me babe,
Rock me, rock me.

Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything 'cause I want you to.
I want you to

And tomorrow morning we won't cry
You go your way, honey, I'll go mine.
I'm the one who didn't waste your time
Remember me this way.

And if you never see my face again,
Think of me as a permanent friend,
The one who loved you like a hurricane
Then disappeared,
Disappeared,
Disappeared.

Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything 'cause I want you to.
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me

Tonight you're mine
Tonight, always tonight you're mine.

Do anything that you,
Do anything that you want me to,
You want me to, you want me to,
You want me, want me , want me,
Just do anything
Anything your heart desires, babe.",Tonight I'm Yours
Rod Stewart,"Let me tell you about a place, somewhere up in New York way
Where the people are so gay, twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' trouble on the run
Oh man you'll find the old and young twistin' the night away

Here's a man in evening clothes, how he got here I don't know
But oh man, you ought to see him go, twistin' the night away
He's dancing with a chick in slacks, she's moving up and back
Oh man, there ain't nothing like twistin' the night away

Feel much better

Here's a fellow in blue jeans, who's dancing with an older queen
Dolled up in her diamond rings, twistin' the night away
Man you ought to see her go, twistin' to the rock and roll
Here you'll find the young and the old twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin', everybody's doing great
They're twistin' man, twistin', they're twistin' the night away
Twistin', you know they're twistin', twistin' the night away
They're twistin', twistin', man twistin' the night away

Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' trouble on the run
Oh man you'll find young and the old twistin' the night away
Here's a man in evening clothes, how he got here I don't know
I don't know but man you ought to see him go
Twistin' the night away",Twistin' the Night Away
Rod Stewart,"Can I tell you what you mean to mean
You're as central as the air I breathe
Almost impossible to believe that you're mine
You're like weekends all year long
Under a hot Jamaican sun
You are a winner at a hundred to one
Yes you are

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees honey

What am I gonna do I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away

One in a million oh so rare
A nightengale in Berkeley Square
And baby I ain't goin' nowhere without you
You are the goal that wins the game
The very last bus home in the rain
You're like rock and roll and champagne
All in one

Something you've got is something I need right now
Let's not mess around any more
I'm down on my bended knees honey

What am I gonna do I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
What am I gonna do I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away

I'll be a sleek one of a kind
And so difficult to define
I could drink a case of you any time

The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel Tower
A national anthem an April shower
Tomorrow's fashion and now I've found you
I'm complete

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees honey

What am I gonna do I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away

I'm like a schoolboy in your hands
I want to get up and sing and dance
You see one hell of a happy man standing here

Individually quite unique
You really swept me off my feet
And baby you look oh so neat
With nothing on",What Am I Gonna Do (I'm So in Love with You)
Rod Stewart,"Its late and she's waiting and I know I must go home
But every time I start to leave they play another song
Then someone buys another round and wherever drinks are free
What's made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me

Baby's begged me not to go so many times before
She says love and happiness can't live behind those swinging doors
Now she's gone and I'm to blame to late I finally see
What's made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me

Baby's begged me not to go so many times before
She says love and happiness can't live behind those swinging doors
Now she's gone and I'm to blame to late I finally see
What's made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me
What's made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me
What's made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me",What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)
Rod Stewart,"Hey baby, I want to say somethin' to ya', listen

Sometimes when I get out of my head
And I say all the wrong things
Sometimes I know I stay out late at night
And I get back fighting, hey babe
Somehow all my plans
Keep slippin' through my hands
And I end up crying, but listen
I can be a millionaire
Honey when you're standing there
You're so exciting

You can make me dance, you can make me sing,
You can make me do just any old thing, and I love it

Sometimes I want to get up so early
And get away from here girl
Summer's gone, and before long
North winds blow, that bring the snow
I'll keep us warm girl
My schemes it seems, are merely dreams
Fading with each morning, hey babe
But this old heart of mine
Is far too proud not to keep on tryin'

You can make me dance, you can make me sing,
You can make me do just any old thing, yeah baby

Ah yeah

So little bird don't fly away
Want you here every day
Don't ever leave me
I'd rather lose both my eyes
Than never see your smiling face again girl

'Cause you can make me dance, you can make me sing,
You can make me do just any old thing
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,
You can make me do just any old thing

Hey babe
Keep on loving me babe, yeah
Keep on loving me babe
Just keep on loving me babe
Just keep on loving me babe
Just keep on loving, ooh babe

Just keep on loving me darling
Just keep on loving me darling
Just keep on loving me darling
Just keep on loving me darling, darling, darling, darling
Ha ha

Woo, alright
Hey baby
Oh darling
Keep on loving me darling
Just keep on loving me darling

Just keep on loving me darling","You Can Make Me Dance, Sing or Anything"
Rod Stewart,"Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket and a head full of dreams.
He said somehow, some way, it's gotta get better than this.
Patti packed her bags, left a note for her momma, she was just seventeen,
There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye.

They held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so excited.
We got just one shot of life, let's take it while we're still not afraid.
Because life is so brief and time is a thief when you're undecided.
And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands.

Young hearts be free tonight. Time is on your side,
Don't let them put you down, don't let 'em push you around,
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view.

Paradise was closed so they headed for the coast in a blissful manner.
They took a two room apartment that was jumping ev'ry night of the week.
Happiness was found in each other's arms as expected, yeah
Billy pierced his ears, drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh!

Young hearts be free tonight.Time is on your side,
Don't let them put you down, don't let 'em push you around,
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view.

Young hearts be free tonight.
Time is on your side.

Billy wrote a letter back home to Patti's parents tryin' to explain.
He said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way.
But there ain't no point in talking when there's nobody list'ning so we just ran away
Patti gave birth to a ten pound baby boy, yeah!

Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side.
Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side.
Young hearts be free tonight, time in on your side.

Young hearts gotta run free, be free, live free
Time is on, time is on your side
Time, time, time, time is on your side
Is on your side
Is on your side
Is on your side
Young heart be free tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah",Young Turks
Rod Stewart,"Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around

Do you feel what I feel
Can we make it so that's part of the deal
I gotta hold you in these arms of steel
Lay your heart on the line this time

I want to breathe when you breathe
When you whisper like that hot summer breeze
Count the beads of sweat that cover me
Didn't you show me a sign this time

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around, around

Do you feel what I feel
Do you feel what I feel
Ah can you see what I see
Can you cut behind the mystery
I will meet you by the witness tree
Leave the whole world behind

I want to come when you call
I'll get to you if I have to crawl
They can't hold me with these iron walls
We got mountains to climb, to climb

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning  my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around",Broken Arrow
Rod Stewart,"Sometimes I wonder 
what this old world's comin' to
where it's all gonna end
'Cause I work all week
try'n' to save me a dollar
but I get further in debt
But now on in
I'm gonna spend time lovin'

We're goin' out dancin'
We're goin' out dancin'
Chase our blues away

I know a funny little place
down on main street baby
where the band will play all night long
They play some hot rock 'n' roll to fine syncopation
and a brother on the saxophone
We got one chance baby
gotta be now or never
Yeah I know as I'm broke
We're gonna make this weekend last forever
come on honey put on your coat

We're goin' out dancin'
We're goin' out dancin'

Chase our blues away

I've been lovin' you for seven years I won't forget
and I know it's been hard sometimes
open up the wine let's pretend we just met

We'll get home in the morning
while the milk man's calling
and the early birds start to sing
I will roll you some breakfast
and we'll jump into bed
and we'll start all over again
So hang on tight baby
we'll go flyin'
give your man a big kiss
We're gonna boogie on down
from the Bronx to Manhattan

come on baby dancin
Take away our blues tonight
take away my blues tonight
Just as long as we're dancin'

Rod Stewart,"Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

For the morning sun in all it's glory
Meets the day with hope and comfort too
You fill my life with laughter, somehow you make it better
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love less defined
And its yours and its mine
Like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one

Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love less defined
And its yours and its mine
Like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one

Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

Take away all my sadness, fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do",Have I Told You Lately
Rod Stewart,"If only I'd ever listened
to all of my closest friends,
and knew that it was over
and the party had to end.
If only, I'd have noticed
the sadness in your eyes,
she'd still be in my arms tonight
if only.

If only I'd have realized
the unimprotance of being cool,
to give a kiss,
maybe just say,
""Darling I love you.""
If only I'd said I'm sorry
I'd have been a much better man,
she'd still be in my arms tonight,

if only.
There's an emptiness
that fills my heart
now that she's not here.
I loved her more than my own life,
something I've always feared,
if only.

If only I'd come home at night
instead of stayin' out for one more drink,
if only I'd been unconcerned
what the other guys may think,
if only I'd held her tight,
but I guess it's too late now.
Oh how blind can one man be,
if only.
Whoa but I will not be sad
after all the fun we've had.
You live some
and you learn some, if only.

If only I could convince her
the importance of one more chance,
if only God would allow me
one more celestial dance,
If only I have the nerve
to call her up and tell her how I feel,
she'd still be in my arms tonight,
if only.

But it's only love
and love ain't real,
it's only a four letter word.
We spend half our lives chasing after it,
how wonderf'ly absurd,
if only.

Oo whoa but I will not be sad
after all the fun we had.
You live some and you learn some,
whoa but I will not be sad
after all the fun we had.
You live some and you learn some,
you learn some. if only.

If only I'd come home at night
instead of stayin' for one more drink

Rod Stewart,"One can have a dream, baby
Two can make a dream so real
One can talk about being in love
Two can see how it really feels

One can wish upon a star
Two can make a wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make a light shine through

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
just me and you
You know it takes two

One can have a broken heart
living in misery
Two can really ease the pain

One can be alone in a bar

One can go out to a movie
looking for a special treat
Two can make that single movie
something really kind of sweet
And one can take a walk in the moonlight
thinking that's it's really nice
But two lovers walking hand in hand

Rod Stewart,"Here is a story that is bound to amuse ya
(about a fine young couple startin' out in life)
A dedicated husband and a real fine worker
(who lived for his children and his beautiful wife)
But one night in Dallas at a computer convention
(he got so loaded he could hardly stand)
Woke up with a heavy head and a strange girl beside him
(returned home a worried guilty man)
But inside his coat his wife found a note
It said ""Thanks for the good time Can I see you again""
She asked him ""Why oh why"" Tears rollin' down her eyes
""would you give it all up for a moment of glory"" glory

Packed up all her bags and returned to her mother
(Two small children clinging to her dress)
Hurt and disillusioned but never down hearted
(she picked up the pieces of her broken life)
And meanwhile back in Boston the culprit lie thinkin'
(trying to find the answer in a bottle of wine)
Fired from his job and missing his children
(he didn't care one way if he lived or died)
Oh what a crying shame nobody else to blame
for one night of pleasure he had given her pain
Oh how it was so hard to climb so far to give it all up
for a moment of glory, glory

As the months rolled by and accusations fly
the bloodsuckin' lawyers know they're in for a kill
The gold war begins she's takin' off her rings
Close friends take sides while the waters are still

Phone rang twice in his stone cold appartment
(it was his little boy Johnny and his sister Beth)
They said ""Daddy we miss you would you talk to Mommy""
(a line of communication he had sadly missed)
She said ""Now don't get me wrong this is where you belong""
I said ""Good-bye children we can work it all out""
""But don't you ever forget how this family has bled
'cause you give it all up for a moment of glory"" glory

Won't you give it all up
you give it all up 
Won't you give it all up
you give it all up
",Moment of Glory
Rod Stewart,"Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo to the alley down below

Let's dance together just for the night
Let's don't worry about the future or nothin' else
'Cause just like the music's sayin' you gotta take chances
Go ahead just do it and trust yourself

There's a soul in the city
Watching over us tonight
There's a soul in the city
Saying everything's gonna be all right

So bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo to the alley down below

They wish us luck
But they think we're just dreaming
Let's prove them wrong baby
'Cause you know what luck is
Luck is believing you're lucky
That's all and showing just a little bit of faith

There's a soul in the city
Watching over us I swear
There's a soul in the city
There's a whole world waiting out there

Listen
I got plans for us
Playing like a skip on a record
Through my head all night long
But when we walk that darkened stairway
And step out on the roof
I know what we're feeling can't be wrong

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo to the alley down below

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo to the alley down below
Let the Temptations sing it one time
Bring over some of you old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo to the alley down below

Bring over some of you old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo to the alley down below

Bring over some of you old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go

Rod Stewart,"A friend of mine called up,
said, ""I fin'lly had some luck-
Could I have a minute of your time.
I met a girl last night
try as I might,
I can't get her off of my mind.
She walked in the room and right then I knew
I fin'ly found somebody for me.
But to tell you the truth,
I don't know what to do.
Should I go ahead or wait and see?""

I said, ""Give it all you got,
no holding back.
Let a light in your soul.
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all?
Than to never love at all?""

Now I'm the kind of guy
who's normally quiet shy.
On romance, I don't know a thing.
But when she led me to the floor,
never danced before.
Suddenly my feet had wings.
I know that she wnats me,
I want her too,
but I'm so confused.
I can't think straight.
I feel so alive,
but on the other side,
should I go ahead or should I wait?

I said, ""Give it all you got,
no holding back.
Let a light in your soul.
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all?
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all?"".
Than to never love at all?""

So, when the music starts
to flow from your hearts
like the coming of an early spring,
whe nthe river starts to flow
between your soul to soul,
may no man ever come between.
Die in her arms if she wants you to.
Be thankful for each passin' day.
When your odds collide,
let your spirits fly
and pray to God it's here to stay.

And I said, ""Give it all You got,
no holding back.
Let a light in your soul.
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all?

Give it all you got,
no holding back.
Let a light in your soul.
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all,
than to never love at all,
than to never, never love at all?""
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all?
",No Holding Back
Rod Stewart,"I picked her up about a quarter to nine
My brother told me I was wasting my time
A woman like that'll only cause you confusion
But go ahead you may find it amusing
She came to the door wearing a suit and tie
Her hair cropped short I couldn't figure out why

Rebel heart don't be a loner
Rebel heart I'm your lover
Rebel heart I wanna discover
Where you from and where you belong
And everything that turns you on

I wanted to dance but she flatly refused
I told her jokes but she was not amused
Tried to kiss her but she wouldn't stand still
Started thinking this was overkill
Next thing I know I was flyin' for cover
It was her steady girlfriend and a live-in lover

Rebel heart why don't you try it
Rebel heart you can't deny it
Rebel heart you may like it
I'll change your mind if you'll give me time
About everything that's on your mind

I stayed awake all last night fantasizing about you baby
You know I'd walk a million miles across broken glass
Or a red hot Arabian desert
If I could just have one night in your long brass bed

Evening wound up on a very sad note
I drove her home and then she went for my throat
She said, it's fairly obvious I ain't attracted to you
You bore me to tears honest you do
And by the way I can't stand your British
I said, don't start something, honey, you know you can't finish

Rebel heart I won't forget ya
Rebel heart I'm glad I met ya
Rebel heart give me an answer
Where you're from and where you belong
And everything that turns you on

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me I knew that it had to be

I'd lift you up with my own arms honey
I can't get enough
I'd walk down Fifth Avenue entirely naked
I promise I won't drink, swear, womanize
I'd go to church every Sunday
For just one night with you

Rebel heart I'm your lover
Rebel heart I wanna discover
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Rebel heart I won't forget ya
Rebel heart I'm glad I met ya
Rebel heart give me an answer
Oh yeah oh yeah
Rebel heart I won't forget ya
Rebel heart give me an answer
Oh yeah oh yeah",Rebel Heart
Rod Stewart,"Across the street the river runs
Down in the gutter life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running down under cover
Of a helicopter blade

The flames are getting higher
In effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still alive
Somewhere someday
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words I love you
Rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Light up my darkness
Light it up
Light it up
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you, baby

Rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Oh, yeah

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle
Of a slot machine
Love may still exist
In another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

Rod Stewart,"He wakes up in the morning like a newborn baby
The message on the machine says ""you're driving me crazy""
His feet don't touch the ground
he can hardly wait to see her tonight
Now every new song on the radio reminds him of her
He says hello to strangers and he's singing in the shower
The sign in his eyes says this guy's got a problem so nice so nice
She don't know what she's doing to him
Every day's like Christmas it sure ain't a dream

When a man's in love when a man's in love
he'll fight like a tiger fly like a dove when a man's in love
He's early on the job and all his friends begin to sense
his attitude has changed he's serene and contented
His feet don't touch the ground he can hardly wait to see her tonight
And he calls her on the telephone about a dozen times an hour
She's flattered by the avalanche of attention and flowers
He tells all his buddies ""Boys, I've finally found someone for me""
She don't know what she's doing to him
Every day's like Christmas it sure ain't a dream

When a man's in love, when a man's in love
ain't nothin' too hard or too tough when a man's in love
When a man's in love, when a man's in love
he'll fight like a tiger fly like a dove when a man's in love

When a man's in love

She dominates his every thought and dream and conversation
He talks about her constantly with an air of jubilation
There ain't nothin' in the world he wouldn't do to make her little face smile
But oh don't it make you want to smile and dance
May God bless us all with a little romance

When a man's in love, when a man's in love
she's in his heart and running through his blood
when a man's in love

When a man's in love
he'll fight like a tiger, fly like a dove
when a man's in love
when a man's in love
There ain't nothing he can't do
when a man's in love

You are everything and everything is you
Oh you are everything and everything is you

She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so, tell me so, baby

He's acting shy, looking for an answer
Come on honey, let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother

They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know

They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singin'
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinkin'
Outside it's cold, misty and it's rainin'
They got each other, neither one's complainin'

Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie""

That it rolls and flows all down her breasts
See for me that her hair's hanging long

And a wound that would never heal

Rod Stewart,"When the rain came I thought you'd leave
'Cause I knew how much you loved the sun
But you chose to stay, stay and keep me warm
Through the darkest nights I've ever known
If the mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Then I know I love ya

Oh the snow fell without a break
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years
I couldn't believe you kept a smile
Now I can rest assure that knowing that we've seen the worst
And I know I love ya

Oh I never was good with romantic words
So the next few lines come really hard
Don't have much but what I've got is yours
Except of course my steel guitar
'Cause I know you don't play
But I'll teach you one day
Because I love ya

I recall the night we knelt and prayed
Noticing your face was thin and pale
I found it hard to hide my tears
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down
No mandolin wind, couldn't change a thing
Couldn't change a thing, no no

Rod Stewart,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

It was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear
It soothes his sorrows, heals the wounds
And drives away his fear

Must Jesus bear the cross alone
And all the world go free
No, there's a cross for you
And there's a cross for me",Amazing Grace
Rod Stewart,"Now a country boy named Shorty
And a city boy named Dan
Had to prove who could run the fastest
To wed Miss Lucy's hand

Now Dan had all the money
And he also had the looks
But Shorty musta had that something boys
That can't be found in books

Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across
That's what Miss Lucy said
Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across
You know it's you that I want to wed

Wait a minute
Now Dan had been in training
About a week before the race
He made up his mind old Shorty
Would end in second place
You know Dan with his long legs flying
He left Shorty far behind
Shorty heard him holler out
Miss Lucy that you'll soon be mine

Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across
That's what Miss Lucy said
Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across
You know it's you that I want to wed

But Shorty wasn't worried
There was a smile upon his face
'Cause old Lucy had fixed the race
And just like that old story
About the turtle and the hare, you know that thing
When Danny crossed over the finish line
He found Shorty waiting there

Cut across Shorty, Shorty, cut across

Rod Stewart,"Spent time feelin' inferior standing' in front of my mirror
Combed my hair in a thousand ways, but I came out lookin' just the same
Daddy said, son, you better see the world
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing, don't lose your head to a woman that'll spend your bread
So I got out

Paris was a place you could hide away, if you felt you didn't fit in
French police wouldn't give me no peace, they claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the left bank, minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot, when all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused

I moved on
Down in rome I wasn't getting enough
Of the things that keep a young man alive
My body stunk, but I kept my funk at a time when I was right out of luck
Getting desperate, indeed I was looking like a tourist attraction
Oh, my dear, I better get out of here for the vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no, no

I moved right out east, yeah
On the peking ferry I was feeling merry, sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slant-eyed lady by the light of an eastern moon
Shanghai lil never used the pill, she claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh, people, I was glad I found her
Oh, yeah, I was glad I found here

I firmly believed that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slant-eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God, I was glad I found her

And if they had the words I could tell to you
To help you on your way down the road
I couldn't quote you no dickens, shelley or keats
'Cause it's all been said before
Make the best out of the bad, just laugh it off
You didn't have to come here anyway, so remember

It's a yearnin' for my old back door
I realize maybe I was born to lead
Better swallow my silly country pride

Goin' home, running' home
Down the gasoline alley where I started from
Goin' home, and I'm running' home
Down the gasoline alley where I was born

When the weather's better and rails unfreeze
And the wind won't whistle 'round my knees
I'll put on my weather suit and catch you in the rain
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door

Goin' home, running' home
Down the gasoline alley where I started from
Goin' home, and I'm running' home
Down the gasoline alley where I was born

But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
I'd be singing in my alley if I could

And if I'm goin' away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'd be askin' of you
Don't bury me here it's too cold

Take me back carry me back
Down to gasoline alley where I started from
Take me back, won't cha carry me home down

Rod Stewart,"Ever seen a blind man cross the road
Trying to make the other side
Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride

So what becomes of you my love
When they have finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your Granddad had to sweat so you could buy

Once I was a young man
And all I thought I had to do was smile
You are still a young girl
And you bought everything in style

Don't think that I could come back
You're doin' so well without me girl
You'd laugh if you'd know'd where I'm at

You knew me when it was all my world
Somehow it's all passed me by
But don't let on to my friends Jo dear
That things ain't turned out as planned

You bore my child then I left you aside
I don't expect you to forgive
But Jo I can say in a funny old way
I was sure that I had it made

I still possess a photograph
My memory to refresh
But fade it may Jo I can say
I was sure that I had it made

You bore my child then I left you aside

I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and prob'ly raised

My face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise darling
I'll see you on God's golden shore

Through this open world I'm about to ramble
Through ice, snow, sleet and rain
I am about to rob the mornin' railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train

I'm goin' back to Colorado
Place that I started from
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me

Rod Stewart,"As I was out walking on the corner one day
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay
His face was all covered in the cold sidewalk floor
I guess he'd been there for a whole night or more

He was only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leaving nobody to carry it on
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

A blanket of newspaper covered his head
The step was his pillow
The street was his bed
One look at his face
Showed the hard road he'd come
And a fistful of money
Showed the coins that he'd bummed

He was only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
Leavin' nobody to carry it on
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

Does it take much of a man
To see a whole life go down
To look on the world
From a hole in the ground
Too late for your future
Like a horse that's gone lame
To lie in the gutter
And die with no name

He was only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
Leavin' nobody to carry it on
Only a hobo, but one more is gone",Only a Hobo

If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all

Ah but only if my own true love is waitin'
Yes and if I could hear her heart a softly poundin'
Only if she were lying by me
Would I rest in my bed once again

I can't see my reflection in the mirror
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echoes of my footsteps
And can't remember the sound of my own name

Ah but only if my own true love is waitin'
Yes and if I could hear her heart a softly poundin'
Only if she were lying by me
Would I rest in my bed once again

There's beauty in the silver singin' river
There's beauty in the sunlight in the sky
But none of these, and nothing else
Can steal the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

Ah but only if my own true love is waitin'
Yes and if I could hear her heart a softly poundin'
Only if she were lying by me

But to settle down and write you a line
I've been meaning to phone you but from Minnesota
Hell it's been a very long time
You wear it well
A little old fashioned but that's all right

Well I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking
Or he wouldn't get in touch with me
Oh I ain't begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know that you wear it well
There ain't a lady in the land so fine

Remember them basement parties, your brother's karate
The all day rock and roll shows
Them homesick blues and radical views
Haven't left a mark on you, you wear it well
A little out of time but I don't mind

But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out
Tryin' to get a letter through

Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you

Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh and I wear it well
I don't object if you call collect
'Cause I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'

nothing in my life 
Would ever be the same

Tears in my eyes 
As he sung ""These Arms Of mine"" 
But angels needed a soul man 
For the celestial blues band 
They took him home (took you home) 

Oh, what I'd give to see 
That red mohair suit and hear 
""Dock Of The Bay"" 
Or Sam in his two tone 
Singin' ""Bring It On Back Home"" 
What a show that would be

Thank you Muddy 
For the sounds you made 
Thank you, Sam, thank you, Otis

He gone North for a while
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here in style

By the way, that's a cute hat
And that smile's so hard to resist
But what's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
She wanted a whole man, not just a half
She used to call me Sweet Daddy when I was only a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh

In order to deal in this game
Got to make the Queen disappear
It's done with a flick of the wrist
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

You know, a woman like you should be at home
That's where you belong
Taking care of somebody nice
Who don't know how to do you wrong

Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

You know you can make a name for yourself
You can hear them tires squeal
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal

You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before ya came in the door
They say, in your father's house, there's many mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor

Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
Got to have done some evil deed
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed

They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail
Steal a lot and they make you king

Rod Stewart,"Down by law, on Baker Street 
Lay your head back on, this field of dreams 
Then close your eyes 

There's a few that, find love 
On Sundays down by the sea 
And they wash clean, like angels 
(And they wash clean like angel's wings) 
High above the waves so free 

I have no words to say to you 
I have no dream to take you to 
I have no ring for you to kiss 
Baby, all I have is this 

Pray for grace, keep the faith 
Walk on down the road 
Wait for me, look for love 

Are you fearless? Reckless? 
Homeless and all alone? 
Can you make love, heal things? 
Make my heart go wild again? 

I have no words to say to you 
I have no dream to take you to 
I have no ring for you to kiss 
Baby, all I have is this

I have no dream to take you to

Rod Stewart,"Driving home from the highland line
We done some gigs on the Clyde and the Tyne
They flew us in from a Hamburg strip
The taste of Dusseldorf still on our lips
And on the bus there is a friend of mine
We go way back to the scene of the crime
We sit up front and share a cigarette
And try to remember what we tried to forget

He say Do you remember?
He say Do you recall?
I say yeah I remember, oh, I remember it all
Every time that cold wind blows
Every time I hear that sound
Late night trains shunting down by the river
I remember windy town

We come so far and we move so fast
Making hay see it all go past
Round the world and round again
Up and down on that gravy train
but every time that cold wind blows
Every time I hear that sound
The east coast cross winds on the cold wet stone
I remember windy town

The freezing corners and the empty streets
The burning passion and the cold wet feet
Three tricky miles home every night
Dodging from the shadows underneath those amber light
No car for kissing and nowhere to go
Except inside each other and I loved you so
I held your face as you shivered in the rain
Girl I´ll always love you and I´ll love you again
Oh everytime, everytime
Every time that cold wind blows
Every time I hear that sound
Late night trains shunting down by the river
I remember windy town
Every time that cold wind blows
Every time I hear that sound
The east coast cross winds on the cold wet stone
I remember windy town",Windy Town

Rod Stewart,"Spent some time feelin' inferior
Standing in front of my mirror
Combed my hair in a thousand ways
But I came out looking just the same

Daddy said, ""Son, you better see the world
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing don't lose your head
To a woman that'll spend your bread""
So I got out

Paris was a place you could hide away
If you felt you didn't fit in
French police wouldn't give me no peace
They claimed I was a nasty person

Down along the Left Bank minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot
When all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused, I moved on

Down in Rome I wasn't getting enough
Of the things that keep a young man alive
My body stunk but I kept my funk
At a time when I was right out of luck

Getting desperate indeed I was
Looking like a tourist attraction
Oh my dear I better get out of here
For the Vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no no

I moved right out east yeah, listen
On the Peking ferry I was feeling merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slit eyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon

Shanghai Lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh people, I was glad I found her
Oh yeah, I was glad I found her

I firmly believe that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be

The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slit eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God I was glad I found her

And if they had the words I could tell to you
To help you on the way down the road
I couldn't quote you no Dickens, Shelley or Keats

Ah listen
It's funny you know when you sit down
And think about what you had
About the friends you used to know
What happened, where did they all go
Can you remember happy hours
Spent drinkin' and thinkin'
We thought we could change the world
And we never, never, never, never, never
Never thought we could get much older then

We were the ones who loved to love the right to love
We'd bring it on home with the right song
Played at the right time
What happened to the girl that you loved once and left
Young man did you break her heart
Did she live, and did she marry,
Did she ever think on your face again
Ah now hold on a minute

I wouldn't change a thing if I could live it all again
Ah yeah

I think what you say is all so right
But I find it hard to jog my memories
Don't worry Lou you may never get another chance yeah

Yes I think what you say is all so right
But I find it hard to move my memories
Say it again with a lot more feelin'

And I think what you say is all so right
But I find it hard to find my memories
Don't sing so serious you make me feel so sad

But if I was true to myself
I would probably find it was a tear in my eye
That stopped me from believing you
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry don't worry

You know my tongue gets tired
When I think back on all of the things we do
But I wonder if I'll remember these few precious things
As years pass me by
Ah when young bodies that've grown older
And mind's become dimmer

And who am I to judge you
In what you say or do

To see the real you

I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance and all it's strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through all the insecurity
Some tenderness survives

I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
I watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by

At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I want to hold ya till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides
Subsides",Sometimes When We Touch
Rod Stewart,"When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heart beat away

When I need love
I hold out my hand and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be traveling forever
It's cold out but hold out and do like I do

When I need you 
I just close my eyes and I'm with you 
And all that I so want to give you baby
It's only a heart beat away

Should I stray to the house on the hill

I was raised in a clinic down in oklahoma,
There were many things I did not possess.
Well I never complained, because my father said,
""son you get your chance before you're my age"".

But can't you lose your suit? ""

And the fold in my trousers it ain't straight.
Still I know a good cloth when I see one.

And get myself a smooth outfit.

Tried to light a lift but all in vain
With your sock on your head
And that old coat on your back

Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowed
Laid your head on an isle like me
With the Times on your face
And that old coat on your back

It just kept you from withering away

Oh, that old school coat to keep you
From the wind, and that ain't all

Who'd stand by you through thick and thin

If I knew all your names, I'd call ya' your bloody names
Here's one that we did when we was here
Were many of you here last night?

Alright, well I changed me shirt anyway
No, I haven't changed me trousers

Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My love has found another, gone away
Withered up my future, my life is filled with gloom
Day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain

Curse so badly, I don't want to go outside
Everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I've got to cry, 'cause crying sheds the pain
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain
I wish it would rain

Let it rain

Looking down at my tear stained face pressed against the window pane
But I search the sky desperately for rain
'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops, no one will ever know
When I'm crying, crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain
I wish it would rain

Rod Stewart,"Every face that crammed this hall
And in this room our hats were hung
And words were written and songs were sung
And we held our glasses high
And we dared to reach for the sky
And we never would grow old
When we were the new boys

And on these streets we were like kings
We'd roll and tumble, fight and sing
And in these smoky pubs the yarns were spun
And many a sweetheart was lost and won
And on these green fields we played for pride
No quarter given, no compromise
We were lovers and we were sons
When we were the new boys

Behind this cellar door on cheap guitars
We played our blues til the early hours
No one listening but a few old friends
We never dreamed it could ever end
This was our moment, this was our space
This was a jewel of a time to have graced
But they're all sweet memories now
When we were the new boys

All my life I've been running
down the side of this hill
But way down deep in my heart
don't want the water to ever be still

All these friends have long since gone
Blown and scattered like autumn leaves
Some are lawyers and some are thieves
Some are now behind the sun
But I'll never be afraid
From the cradle to the grave
I learned my lesson and I learned it well
When we were the new boys

Rod Stewart,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,

And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free

And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.

Who must be in the know
Say so little to me 
They allow you to go

When you're near 
There's such an air 
Of spring about it
I can hear
A lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change
From major to minor

Rod Stewart,"You put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.

I could look out the window or stare at the wall,
But really it didn't matter, no, I just didn't care at all.
Could be sitting by the water, counting every stone,
Cause nothing means nothing when you're empty and on your own.

[Chorus]
But you put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.
Makes me so much stronger,
I'm amazed at the change in me.

Well, I knew what I was doing, I was running away,
Busy going nowhere, just wasting the time of day.
Walking down the road, kicking up the stones,
Nothing means nothing when you're empty and on your own.

Rod Stewart,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Don't Come Around Here (W/ Helicopter Girl)

Someone to lean on
Someone to take you away

And somewhere to walk to
I need to remind you someway

Whenever you need me
I'll make the time
To be with you
To be with you

A night to remember
The rain in September
I want to share it with you

The month by the ocean
We swore our devotion
Would make all our wishes come true

Whenever you need me
I'll make the time
To be with you
To be with you

I want you to know I've never before
Felt this way
No other words can say
I was lost just yesterday
Until I found you

Rod Stewart,"Uh, oh, here she come
She got them gold hot pants on again
Yeah, man
I wanna talk, but I dunno
She's a Peach

She was dark, she was tan
She made me glad to be a man
She was young, she was smart
Just one glance and she stole my heart

The kinda girl you wanna teach
She's a Peach

Summertime, feelin' fine, getting wild
All that's on my mind
Here she come, dressed in red
Get her done, is all that's in my head

Her hot pants can't hide her cheeks
She's a Peach

She was pure, every ounce
I was sure when her titties bounced
Every way, she's a winner
Turn a gay preacher to a sinner

No one you want your mama meet
She's a Peach

This is a girl plays hard to get
I would die if I kissed her
I would try, but I'm last on her list
She's so cool and I'm so ugly

I'd be a fool to think she could love me
This kinda girl's always out of reach
She's a Peach

A telephone that rings, but who's to answer?

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations

While the sun is bright or in the darkest night

Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost at such a cost

When you change with every new day

Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time, lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind, ain't life unkind?

Don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door

I know your name is Rita
'Cause your perfume smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor, guitar

You won't need to much persuading
I don't mean to sound degrading
But with a face like that
You got nothing to laugh about

Red lips hair and fingernails
I hear your a mean old Jezebel
Let's go up stairs and read my tarot cards, c'mon

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me, oh yeah

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me, oh rock on

So in the morning
Please don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door

Yea I'll pay your cab fare home
You can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the morning when I wake up, c'mon honey

Stay with me
Stay with me
'Cause tonight you gonna stay with me
Sit down, get up, get down

Stay with me
Stay with me
'Cause tonight your going stay with me
Hey, what's your name again
Oh no, get down, whoo, hey, oh no, woo, get yourself home, slow down babe",Stay with Me

A couple of bucks from you

I'm an innocent victim
of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No-one speaks English
And everything's broken
And my strength is soaking away
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me

Now the dogs they are barking 
and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me
You tore my shirt open

And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old bush mills I staggered
You buried the dagger
Your silhouette window light
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me
Now I've lost my St. Christopher
Now that I kissed her

And the one-arm bandit knows
And the maverick China man
with the cold-blooded sigh
And the girls down by the striptease shows go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me
No I don't want your sympathy
Fugitives say

that the streets aren't for dreaming now
Manslaughter dragnet
and the ghost that sells memories
Want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
And you can ask any sailor
And the keys from the jailor

And the old men in wheelchairs know
That Mathilda's the defendant
She killed about a hundred
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
And it's a battered old suitcase
in a hotel someplace

And a wound that would never heal
No prim-donas the perfume is on
and old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street-sweepers,
The night watchmen flame-keepers
And goodnight Matilda too
Goodnight Matilda too.",Tom Traubert's Blues (Waltzing Matilda)

Rod Stewart,"Ever since I was a kid in school
I messed around with all the rules
Apologized, then realized
I'm not different after all

Me and the boys thought we had is sussed
Valentino's all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But, boy, we broke some hearts
 
In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb, blank faces stared back at me
But nothing ever changed

Promises made in the heat of night
Creepin' home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
And blamed it on the wine
 
I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win
 
Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
Are slowly wearin' thin
Susie, baby, you were good to me
Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end

I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win
 
Now you ask me if I'm sincere
That's the question that I always fear
Verse seven is never clear
But I'll tell you what you want to hear
I try to give you all you want
But giving love is not my strongest point
If that's the case, it's pointless going on
I'd rather be alone
 
'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong
Pouring my heart out in a song
Owning up for prosperity
For the whole damn world to see

Quietly now while I turn a page
Act one is over without costume change
The principal would like to leave the stage
The crowd don't understand",I Was Only Joking [Single Version]
Rod Stewart,"Early in the morning I can't sleep
I can't work and I can't eat
I've been drunk all day, can't concentrate
Maybe I'm making a big mistake

Caught me down like a killer shark
It's like a railroad running right through my heart
Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave 
Feel like I'm running on an empty gauge

Oh no not again
It hurts so good
I don't understand
Infatuation
Infatuation

There's a whole world waiting out there

And step out on the roof
I know what we're feeling can't be wrong

There's a train a-coming
You don't need no ticket
You just get on board

All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank the Lord

For the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast

Faith is the key
Open the doors and board them
There's room for all
Amongst the loved the most

There ain't no room
For the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind
Just to save his own

Have pity on those
Whose chances are thinner
'Cause there's no hiding place
From the kingdom's throne

Of spring about it

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Down in the gutter life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running under cover of a helicopter blade

Burning down the bridges of my memory

Where they're downing only deer a hundred steel towns away

No never will I roam for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing

Light up my darkness, light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley I've got my eyes all over you baby, oh baby

With the words I love you rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing, I'll be sailing, ah yeah

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yanking back the handle, no expression on my face

Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you

Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work

Songbirds sing; winter turns to spring.
Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the spell.
I know such enchantment can be, ''cause it happened one evening to me:
That certain night, the night we met,
There was magic abroad in the air,
There were angels dining at the Ritz,
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.
I may be right, I may be wrong,
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.
The moon that lingered over London town,
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown.
How could he know we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars;
It was such a romantic affair.
And, as we kissed and said 'goodnight',
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
When dawn came stealing up all gold and blue
To interrupt our rendezvous,
I still remember how you smiled and said,
""Was that a dream or was it true?""
Our homeward step was just as light
As the tap-dancing feet of Astaire

Steals across the meadows of my heart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Rod Stewart,"Yeah
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You've been bored for a long, long time.
You need love and so do I
Let's turn it all around.

I don't want an everlasting thing,
I don't care if I see you again
So grab your coat and honey tell your friends
You won't be home,
You won't be home,
You won't be home.

Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything 'cos I want you to.
Just don't hurt me, baby.

Yeah
I don't really want to challenge you
Marry you or remember you.
I just wanna make love to you
For twenty four hours or more.
Or more

I'm only looking for a fantasy,
An interlude from reality
Don't want nobody tryin' to rescue me
So rock me babe,
Rock me babe,
Rock me, rock me.

Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything 'cos I want you to.
I want you to

And tomorrow morning we won't cry
You go your way, honey, I'll go mine.
I'm the one who didn't waste your time
Remember me this way.

And if you never see my face again,
Think of me as a permanent friend,
The one who loved you like a hurricane
Then disappeared,
Disappeared,
Disappeared.

Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything 'cos I want you to.
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me

Tonight I'm yours,
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me

Tonight you're mine
Do anything,
Do anything
Tonight you're mine,
Tonight you're mine
Tonight, always tonight you're mine.
Do anything that you,
Do anything that you,
Do anything that you want me to,
You want me to, you want me to,
You want me, want me , want me,
Just do anything
Anything your heart desires, babe.",Tonight I'm Yours (Don't Hurt Me)
Rod Stewart,"Who's that knockin' on my door?
It's gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you again, comin' round for more?
Well, you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning make sure you're gone
I'm talkin' to you 
Hot legs, you're wearin' me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, are you still in school?
I love you honey
 
You got a most persuasive tongue
You promise all kinds of fun
But what you don't understand, I'm a working man
I'm gonna need a shot of vitamin E 
By the time you're finished with me
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, you're an alley cat
Hot legs, you scratch my back
Hot legs, bring your mother too
I love you, honey
 
Imagine how my daddy felt
In your jet black suspender belt
Seventeen years old, he's trudging sixty four
You got legs right up to your neck
You're makin' me a physical wreck
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs in your satin shoes
Hot legs, are you still in school?
Hot legs, you're makin' me a fool
I love you, honey
 
Hot legs, you're makin' your mark
Hot legs, keep my pencil sharp
Hot legs, keep your hands to yourself

Rod Stewart,"Wake up, Maggie I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home 
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts
 
The morning sun, when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes, you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried
 
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band 
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie I wish that I'd never seen your face
I'll get a ride home one of these days",Maggie May [DVD]
Rod Stewart,"Poor old grand-dad
I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways

They'll trap you, then they use you
And before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

The can-can, such a pretty show
Steals your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
The dressing rooms are gray

They come on strong and it ain't too long
For they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more then she's fast asleep
Leave's you twinkling with the stars

Poor young grandson
There's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn, just like me
And that's the hardest way

I wish that I knew what I know now

Rod Stewart,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day

May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Rod Stewart,"This day and age we're living in
Gives cause for apprehension
With speed and new invention
And things like third dimension

Yet we get a trifle weary
With Mr. Einstein's theory
So we must get down to earth at times
Relax relieve the tension
And no matter what the progress
Or what may yet be proved
The simple facts of life are such
They cannot be removed

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss,
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

Well, it's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

Times don't change, right?
Sing it to me, Latifah

Oh, I'm singing it to you right now
'Cause we're talking about

Like a daisy I awake
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,
I don't even shake.

Men are not a new sensation;
I've done pretty well, I think.

And yet, where it counts she's adapt enough

I'm lying in bed,
Holdin' you close in my dreams;
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
And comin' apart at the seams.
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough;
I know you were tryin'
To give me the best of your love.

Beautiful faces,
Loud empty places
Look at the way that we live,
Wastin' our time
On cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give.

The same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above,
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.

Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love,
(You get the best of my love.)
Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love.

I'm goin' back in time
And it's a sweet dream.
It was a quiet night
And I would be alright
If I could go on sleeping.

But every morning'
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today.
You see it your way,
And I see it mine,
But we both see it slippin' away.

You know, we always had each other, baby.
I guess that wasn't enough.

And when I come to her when the sun goes down

Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day

Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul

Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friend's missing

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friend's missing

I ain't missing you and there's a storm
That's raging through my frozen heart tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friend's missing

I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I can't lie to myself
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I'm lying to myself

Oh yes, 'cause I ain't missing you
Missing you, missing you, missing you, oh yeah
I ain't missing you at all",Missing You
Rod Stewart,"You always won, everytime you placed a bet
You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet
Everytime they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk
You always said, the cards would never do you wrong
The trick you said was never piay the game too long
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

And you're still the same
I caught up with you yesterday
Moving game to game
No one standing in your way
Turning on the charm
Long enough to get you by
You're still the same
You still aim high

There you stood, everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say

'Cause you're still the same
You're still the same
Moving game to game
Some thlngs never change
You're still the same

When I saw you and him talking
Something deep down in my soul said, cry boy

So you see I love you so much
I don't want to see you leave me baby

Because I used to love her but it's all over now
Because I used to love her but it's all over now
Well I used to wake the morning get my breakfast in bed
When I got worried she'd ease my aching head

But now she's here and there with every single man in town
Still try to take me for that same old brand
Because I used to love her but it's all over now
Because I used to love her but it's all over now

She used to run around with every single man in town
Spent all my money playing her fast game
She used to put me down, it was a pity how I cried

Rod Stewart,"Did you ever stand and shiver
While looking at a freezing river
Have you froze to the bone
With just a coat to keep you warm

To keep you from a howlin' wind
To keep you from a howlin' wind, now listen

Have you perished in the drizzling rain
Tried to light a lift but all in vain
With your sock on your head
And that old coat on your back

To keep you from the drizzlin' rain
Oh, to keep you from the drizzlin' rain, goodbye

One more time

Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowed
Laid your head on an isle like me
With the Times on your face
And that old coat on your back

That kept you from withering away, good God
It just kept you from withering away

I know

And did you ride a lift on a steam train, now listen
Had the misfortune not to pay your fare
Thrown off the next stop
Thrown in the doorway of a shop

With that coat to keep you from the wind
Oh, that old school coat to keep you 
From the wind, and that ain't all

Have you had some good friends on the road with ya
Who'd stand by you through thick and thin
Here's to Kevin and Ben, Susie and Len
And that coat which never lets you down

It never, never, never lets you down
It never, never, never lets you down

That old coat which never lets you down
That old coat which never lets you down

Kept me from the drizzlin' rain
And oh, kept me from the drizzlin' rain",An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down [Album Version]
Rod Stewart,"Ever seen a blind man cross the road
Trying to make the other side?
Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride?

So what becomes of you my love?
When they have finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy, baby

Once I was a young man
And all I thought I had to do was smile
You are still a young girl
And you bought everything in style, listen

But once you think you're in, you're out
'Cause you don't mean a single thing without
The handbags and the gladrags
That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy

Sing a song of six-pence for your sake
And take a bottle full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake
And bake them all in a pie

They told me you missed school today
So what I suggest, you just throw them all away
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old granddad had to sweat to buy

They told me you missed school today
So I suggest you just throw them all away
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old granddad had to sweat to buy ya

Rod Stewart,"Oh yeah
In these days of changing ways
So called liberated days
A story comes to mind of a friend of mine

Georgie boy was gay I guess
Nothin' more or nothin' less
The kindest guy I ever knew

His mother's tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest

Pa said there must be a mistake
How can my son not be straight
After all I've said and done for him

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Leavin' home on a Greyhound bus
Cast out by the ones he loves
A victim of these gay days it seems

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way

Accepted by Manhattan's elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George

Along the boulevards he'd cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of seventy-five
He said he was in love I said I'm pleased

George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell

Deciding to take a short cut home
Arm in arm they meant no wrong
A gentle breeze blew down fifth avenue

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passer-by
There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone

A leather kid, a switchblade knife
He did not intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night

The sight of blood dispersed the gang
A crowd gathered, the police came
An ambulance screamed to a halt on fifty-third and third

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie's life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote

He said ""never wait or hesitate
Get in kid, before it's too late
You may never get another chance
'Cause youth a mask but it don't last
Live it long and live it fast""
Georgie was a friend of mine

Don't go away

But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

A sentimental fool am I
To hear a old love song
And wanna cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch my heart
Saying together forever
Breaking up never

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

Precious memories keep a lingering on
Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce
The happiness we spent
We used to dance on the music
Make romance through the music

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning

Rod Stewart,"Each day through my window
I watch him as he passes by
I say to myself ""what an incredible guy""

To have a love like that
Must surely be a dream come true
Out of all the women in the world
He belongs to only you

But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Soon we'll be married
And raise a family
A cozy little home out in the country
With two kids or three

I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream
How real it all seems

Ohh but it was just my imagination
Once again runnin' away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Every night on my knees I pray
Dear Lord hear my plea
Don't ever let another take his love from me
Or I will surely surely die

His love is heavenly
When his arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality he doesn't even know me

Just my imagination
Once again
Runnin' away with me
Ohh just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

I have visions of many things

Some kind of peace of mind baby

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who cares
Always moving and going nowhere

All is lost there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Rod Stewart,"Ever since I was a kid in school
I messed around with all the rules
Apologized, then realized
I'm not different after all

Me and the boys thought we had is sussed
Valentino's all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But, boy, we broke some hearts
 
In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb, blank faces stared back at me
But nothing ever changed

Promises made in the heat of night
Creepin' home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
And blamed it on the wine
 
I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win
 
Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
Are slowly wearin' thin
Susie, baby, you were good to me
Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end

I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win
 
Now you ask me if I'm sincere
That's the question that I always fear
Verse seven is never clear
But I'll tell you what you want to hear
I try to give you all you want
But giving love is not my strongest point
If that's the case, it's pointless going on
I'd rather be alone
 
'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong
Pouring my heart out in a song
Owning up for prosperity

So you see I love you so much
I don't want to see you leave me baby
Most of all I just don't, I just don't want to be free

I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace child
When the reflection in the glass
That I been held to my lips now baby
Revealed the tears I had on my face

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some are gone and some remain

With lovers and friends, I still recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one, compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way

Rod Stewart,"Wake up, Maggie I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home 
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts
 
The morning sun, when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes, you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried
 
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band 
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie I wish that I'd never seen your face
I'll get a ride home one of these days",Maggie May [BBC Radio 1 Performance] [#]

Beautiful morning
On this beautiful morning
On this beautiful morning
On this beautiful morning
Here with you

Driving down the highway on a Friday evening
Me and my lady had stopped for leaving
Early stop leave the city behind us
Good to be the kid that cares alot
We got just us

We going Starbucks a doner and a coffee
That's when I notice it was all around me
And do today and there's gotta be a winner
Rolling out the summer we're tired of winter

Still left on we're climbing all of our years
Still had hair on a true to fear
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky
Oh my God, ain't it good to be alive

[Chorus]

No hesitation and we check into our hotel
Down about a woosh about a mile at the disco
Up toss the bed in a room that I seen you
I just sat here loving that person in me

Don't you worry 'cause I'm back in my case
Get down to the beach and let the sun on your face
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky
Oh my God, ain't it good to be alive

'Cause we keep tryin going fast
Let's make everything last, oh ye

We cook, get drunk we all fall down

Rod Stewart,"I remember when you were only seventeen
You were the finest girl that my eyes had ever seen
I guess you found it hard to simply just ignore
This scruffy beat up working class teenage troubadour

So we fell in love and I tuned your heart
With my out of tune guitar
You were wonderful, you were mystical
And the envy of all of my friends
Seems like only yesterday
Under the stars on Brighton Beach

Oh what a time it was
What a time to be alive
Remember Janice and Jimmy
Kennedy and King
How they cried

I sang to you the songs of Lamb and Jack
You were Greta Garbo and I was Cadillac
And we played so hard and we loved so hard
Seemed we never ever slept
There were crazy days, there were wonderful days
And I loved you with all of my heart
Seems like only yesterday
Under the stars on Brighton Beach

Your daddy had plans that did not include me
And he won't stay away from your door
And I dreamed how I dreamed I could steal you away
To some far distant shore

Then early one morning
I awoke to find you gone
You wrote 'I love you baby
But it's time for me to move on'
And so my teenage heart laid scattered on the floor
I swear to God I could not have loved you anymore

And as I sit here the night ,playing with my kids
Wondering where you are in this world
Did you find your man, are you happy now?
Do you ever stop and think about me

How I long for yesterday
Under the stars on Brighton Beach",Brighton Beach
Rod Stewart,"I spit on the streets in San
Called the record and company man
My enthusiasm filled the room

I was young and I was keen
With the devil in my stream
As I hollowed at an old blues tune

We can't sign your sign
'Cause we're doper than the mole
That you had on your nose and your clothes
I should thank you gentleman
For this life that you brought me
Now move on down the road

I remember how I used to say

[Chorus]
They can't stop me now
The world is waiting
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd
They can't stop me now
The tide is turning
I'm gonna make you proud

Well nothing was tough
But I couldn't get enough
Out this rhythm and blues I crave

I was singing in the parks
Singing in the clubs
Then along came agony

All the things he said to me
And all the things I heard
I had a point to prove

I will climb this mountain
With this god given gift
If it's the last thing that I do

And I remember thinking

[Chorus: x2]

Born to ramble
Born to sing
In a new world of rock n roll
Woman in particular
Feel my heart will cry
And if I hold my song

Thanks for the faith
Thanks for the patience
Thanks for the helping hand
Thanks for the love
Thanks for the guidance
Thanks for the talk and pride

The finest woman that I've ever known
The finest woman that I've ever known
Shine a light on this love of mine
The finest woman that I've ever known

My days were lonely and my nights were long
My life was empty and my dreams were long gone
I was hanging with the brothers in crime
My only lover was the red, red wine
I was just about to call a cab to take me home
Standing right there, talking on the phone about

[Chorus: x2]

She does not drink, she does not smoke
I rock her world even though I'm stoned

Six foot one with a golden heart
Calculated ready with them thighs

Rod Stewart,"The congregation sang
We knelt and prayed
As we stood before God
On that beautiful day
The church bells rang
And the champagne flowed
As our friends gather round
For the wedding photo
But here we are barely five years on
An' our whole world's fallin' apart

All the plans we had together
Up in smoke and gone for ever
Poisoned by the lawyer's letter
It's over
I don't want our kids to suffer
Can we talk to one another
You were once my light, my lover
It's over
Rumours and whispers tear me apart
That I know you better than that

Inseparable were we
With a breeze in our sails
Now I feel a chill wind
On the marriage that failed
And I pray as I divided
They've taken their sides
Now they'll all sit back
And watch the circus arrive
I don't stand here tryin' to focus the blame
But I'm hurtin' deep down in inside

All the pain an' all the grievin'
When did we stop believin'
Too late now to stop the bleedin'
It's over
What's the sense in pointin' fingers
Who's the saint an' who's the sinner
They're ain't gonna be a winner
It's over
Oh, my dear, what happened to us?
Tell me, where did it all go wrong?

What's the use in keep on fightin'?
All the tears, all the cryin'
Why do we keep denyin'?

'Cause a girl in college has stolen your heart
And so my estimation of the situation
Is I bet you can't stand being apart

Listen son you gon to find a sense of perspective
Ain't no use to bury your weight in the sand
Although I kinda like your evolution of spirit
You know you got to fall before you learn how to stand

Nobody's gonna know what it's like
To walk a mile in your shoes
Such most sayin it's a wonderful world
But you make it it's up to you

Let yourself fly, let yourself cry
And years will disappear in a blink of an eye
There's music in your head , and it holds your plans
Then handle be heaven wenches in your heart
So love the life you live
And live the life you love

Everybody here has been asking about you
When's that boy of yours gonna be coming home
And when I hear the bells ringing down at the school yard
Kinda reminds me of when you were young

You know you gotta polarize your concentration
I know that girl of yours gonna understand
Never underestimate the power of affection
When you got the world in the palm of your hands

Don't go looking for the pot of gold
Or the light miracle mile
Hundred has lost in your home backyard
Be talking it could take a while

Walk down the aisle, with that big old smile
Collect your diploma with your head up high
Study with your soul, 10 weeks left on
We'll always remember, let the good times roll
Another life you live
And live the life you love

Nobody's gonna know what it's like
To walk a mile in your shoes
Such most sayin it's a wonderful world
But you make it it's up to you

So walk by the lake hand in hand
Try and see the sunset in the far away land
Tell her you love her don't be afraid
And keep every promise that you ever made
And love the life you live
Live the life you love
Love the life you live
Live the life you love

You gotta love it
You gotta love it
Make the most of it
You only got one chance

But right now I got one thing on my mind

I may be down but I'm not out as long as I got you

This job of mine is on the line 'cause the batter is about to close
You feel the pinch of hardship when the winter winds blow
I would've borrowed from the bank but I don't think they're listening

I'll be right by your side

But I think about you every minute now
No don't forget me now that we're apart
Just open up that great big loving heart

Teach your children how to sing and dance

I'll be right by your side

Try to be the best you can
She'll come crashing to every man
And always take the higher ground
I'll be right by your side

It's the power of a woman and the weakness of a man

The well rehearsed tease and the things that you said
The erotic suggestions and the next metaphors
Made me want you more

Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me
Over and over again
I'm addicted to your sexual religion
And I don't feel no shame
Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me
Over and over again
I'm a helpless disaster in the temple of love
A slave to the pleasure and pain

When you're out on the dance floor
I'm checking your hips
And you let down your hair and your pop those lips
You're a heartbreaker honey and I can't let you go
You drive me out of my mind

And this drug that you're dealing is a powerful stuff
Your loving is working and sometimes not
You're a angel of Eden and an angel of love
And I just can't work you out

Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Rod Stewart,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Rod Stewart,"I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Rod Stewart,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa

And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

Haunted by the ghost of you

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying

I love a bellavino when the sun goes down
But unfortunately one thing has led to another (yes it has)

I've struggled more than once to put the key in the door
Fallen flat on my face on the disco floor
But if I die I'm gonna die laughing (now listen)

I've sung and I've danced in the streets of Paris
Discovered my trousers up an old oak tree
I've walked half naked through the hotel continental (but you know what)

And I'm glad I did what I did when I did it
Make no mistake about that
And I'm glad I said what I said when I said it oh yeah (but I)

It was the drink that made me do it
I know sometimes I blew it
It was the drink that made me do it
Every time, every time

I've skipped a lot found out and I've lost my socks
Even spent the night in a telephone box
I'm a sucker when I hear ""one more for the road""

I've woken up with women that I hardly knew
Wine is the cause of silly tattoos
I've raised hell where hell didn't need no raising

But I'm glad I did what I did when I did it
Make no mistake about that
And I'm glad I said what I said oh yeah

It was the drink that made me do it
Sometimes I guess I blew it
It was the drink that made me do it
Every time

Oh yeah
Ah yeah

So the moral of the story stick to tea and cakes
If you take to the drinking you're gonna make mistakes
I wouldn't change a thing if I could do it again (no I wouldn't)

It was the drink that make me do it
Sometimes I knew I blew it
It was the drink that made me do it
Every time every time

When the sole of my shoe lets in rain
When the heart's tired of running and the milk's gone sour
Will your feelings still be the same?

When the match won't light so the flames don't tremble
And the years are condemning us, too
I'll need a soulmate to hold me and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you

When I think of life as a chance not taken
Or as a compromise tinged with regret
When the kids leave for breeding and the TV's king
Will you tell me we're not done yet?

Will you think of me as a distant island
Or will you come with me to the moon?
I'll need a soulmate to hold me and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you

Give me asylum and I'll keep the faith
Keep me in coffee and so safe
And I'll feed your cats and I'll paint walls
And I'll be your one-night stand

Will you come with me in the certain knowledge
That the catch is there's no catch at all?

Slide over here
Let’s keep each other warm
Shelter from the storm
Come closer to me
Give me a little of your time
Tell me what’s on your mind

It’s a beautiful evening and I don’t want it to end

All right, stay with me tonight
Oh, I promise I’ll treat you right
Stay with me tonight
Under the cold, clear, cool moonlight

And when the sun comes up I’ll be holding you close to my chest
I’m gonna love you some more and I’ll bring you your breakfast in bed

Rod Stewart,"I was just a little boy without care
I remember looking up and seeing you there
I never wandered too far from your sight
'Cause all the love I needed was there in your eyes

We grew up in a war zone city with a cast iron wind
Broken lives, darken streets, and twisted steel
But around our house the sky seems so blue
And on a wing and prayer we just muddled through

And we always kept the laughter and the smile upon our face
In that good-old-fashion british way with pride and faultless grace
I shall never forget those childhood days for as long as I shall live
And I'll always find my way back, always find my way back home

Tell me why in wars that made our family strong
As our defiant little island weathered the storm
There never seemed enough on my plate
You said be grateful, say grace, don't complain

How can I ever thank you for the lessons that I've learnt
And the precious warmth and comfort that I've felt at every turn
And the roses sacrifice their lives for freedom and for peace
I will always find my way back, always find my way back home

I'll give you stories, operation burning skies
And our nation with its back against the wall
Like a wide-eyed school boy I hang on with the record
Stories I was too young to recall

And we always kept the laughter and the smile upon our face
In that good-old-fashion british way with pride and faultless grace
I shall never forget those childhood days for as long as I should live
And I'll always find my way back, always find my way

And we always kept the laughter and the smile upon our face
In that good-old-fashion british way with pride and faultless grace
I shall never forget those childhood days for as long as I should live
And I'll always find my way back, always find my way back home

We shall fight on the beaches
We shall fight on the landing grounds
We shall fight in the fields, and in the streets
We shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender",Way Back Home
Rod Stewart,"Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand yes I am

In the days between the hours
Ivory towers, bloody flowers
Push their heads into the air
I don't care if I ever know
There I go

Don't push your love too far
Your wounds won't leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
Did someone bow their head?
Did someone break the bread?
Good people are in bed
Before nine o'clock.

On the pad before my eyes
Paper cries, tellin' lies
The promises you gave
From the grave of a broken heart
Hmm

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am oh

I sit here in my lonely room

Don't you know that people cry's a lie, oh
Don't you push your love too far,
You know your wounds won't even leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
And don't you forget what I say

In the city lights at midnight
Fragments of a life led searching
Settle in a mess of colour

Mustve known stone loneliness
I see the seas horizon
Bend and sympathise with the blue sky

Throw your light across the square
Be my guide and take me there

Place towers at my feet
Lead me down through every street

Rise and toast the devil in you
Feel him catch his stride with angels
Chatterin rails and cracklin wires
Coast to coast deliver love and war
Honey from the bay of plenty
Soothes the northern voice of anger
Crashin waves neath the flash of storm
Trash the skies and it must be love
I feel my souls horizons
Stretch in sympathy with her smile

Search and play once again

Brave words in bold relief
No time to get old, no belief

Bigger, brighter is how the world looked to me
But filled with my face staring straight back through me
Bigger, brighter, better and I was sold forever
Down no great river just an endless sea

A love supreme, one hell of a team
No messy birth or dirty death just the in between
Holding tight to what we thought was right
But begin to squeeze and love leaves
Boy, where you been

Yeah, I was young chewing gum acting like a dumb-dumb
All at sea woe is me let's get numb
Fast times, high hopes
Too whacked to push back the envelope

But filled with your face staring straight back through me
Bigger, brighter, better and I was sold forever
Down no great river just an endless sea

You and I sail on stormy waters unaware of what we've got
Some say, "";Let it go, ride the tide feel the flow"";
I sense bombs below
Can't wait to detonate them

In the light of the eternal
Im gonna be your mirror
And you can mirror me
Ill see you in the bright star
Cushioned by the dark sky
Reflected in the river

So cold on my skin,
To the diamond-light stars long ago

Saw the sun slidin down,
On the dyin embers of an empire
See their faces appear,
Everyone who was ever sold out and laid low,
Their voices submerged
In the sound of a choir

And revealed is the real world,
And it feels like my world
From the crystal cold winter,
So petrified and numb
That the blazing-bright sun overthrows,
The river of brightness flows

See, it starts with a glint
Of a sparkle in the eyes,
And a breath becomes a word becomes a deed
And if the deed is done right,
The whole worlds set alight,
But if you hesitate it goes,
And youre damnin up the river
Just to figure how it flows,
If thats the price of knowin,
Maybe I dont wanna know

When the city's steppin' out to play
She cuts a dash in tenement grey
Her memory lingers then fades and turns to black

And try to know the one who shuns the world for inner space
And nothing comes between the sadness and the scream
Exploding rooms of pain; dematerialize again
And gogo bars filled with showgirl stars and Friday set aflame
With crashing cars, sunburst guitars, amphetamines and fame
And crawling from the smash, aliens all slain
A beam of light and a flash, lifts you up to where
You know that you can choose to
Never have to feel that way again

About the nature of time

Why don't we just go outside?

Roderick Harper,"Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
 
Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low

Roderick Harper,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When

Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man 
You betta BREATHE 

You niggaz can't share my air 
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear 
And I'm gettin better year by year 
Like they say Juan do 
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through 
And I pace myself 
I know these money hungry bitches want to taste my wealth 
But I keep em' on a diet 
Embrace they health 
Or either keep em' on a quiet 
And space myself 
And just take a deep breath 
I got em' grabbin' they chest 
'cause it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best 
And they in they worst 
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
And I ain't just layin a verse 
I'm sayin the facts 
I came back with some sicka stones 
That got these broke niggaz lookin at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone 
Every chick I bone 
Can't leave the dick alone

Lookin like they need oxygen mask-es 
I make it hard to BREATHE 
But I keep the glocks in the stashes 
'cause the cops want to lock and harass us 
And make it hard to BREATHE 
They has to react 
Like havin' a asthma attack 
When they see the plasma in back 
You dudes are wheezin' behind me 
My flow is like a coupe, breezin at 90 
That's the reason they signed me 
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts 
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut 
How I address the haters and under estimaters 
And ride up on them like they escalators 
They shook up and hooked up to respirators 
On they last breath talking to investigators 
I'm a breath of fresh air 
And a fresh pair 
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue

Rodger Fox,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Rodger Fox,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were",The Way We Were
Rodgers & Hammerstein,"[Laurey:]
Why should a woman who is healthy and strong
Blubber like a baby if her man goes away
A weeping and a wailing how he's done her wrong?
That's one thing you'll never hear me say

Never gonna think that the man I lose
Is the only man among men
I'll snap my fingers to show I don't care
I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck and I'll brush my hair
And start all over again

[Chorus:]
Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn
Before I do

Many a light lad may kiss and fly
A kiss gone by is bygone
Never have I asked an August sky
Where has last July gone?
Never have I wandered through the rye
Wondering where has some guy gone
Many a new day will dawn
Before I do

[Together:]

[Chorus]

[Laurey:]
Never have I chased the honeybee
Who carelessly cajoled me
Somebody else just as sweet as he
Cheered me and consoled me
Never have I wept into my tea
Over the deal someone doled me

Many a new day will dawn

Many a red sun will set
Many a blue moon will shine

Rodgers & Hammerstein,"I'm a girl, and by me that's only great!
I am proud that my silhouette is curvy,
That I walk with a sweet and girlish gait
With my hips kind of swivelly and swervy.

I adore being dressed in something frilly
When my date comes to get me at my place.
Out I go with my Joe or John or Billy,
Like a filly who is ready for the race!

When I have a brand new hairdo
With my eyelashes all in curl,
I float as the clouds on air do,
I enjoy being a girl!

When men say I'm cute and funny
And my teeth aren't teeth, but pearl,
I just lap it up like honey
I enjoy being a girl!

I flip when a fellow sends me flowers,
I drool over dresses made of lace,
I talk on the telephone for hours
With a pound and a half of cream upon my face!

I'm strictly a female female
And my future I hope will be
In the home of a brave and free male
Who'll enjoy being a guy having a girl... like... me.

When men say I'm sweet as candy
As around in a dance we whirl,
It goes to my head like brandy,
I enjoy being a girl!

Says he loves ev'ry silken curl

Rodgers & Hammerstein,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might As Well Be Spring
Rodgers & Hammerstein,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Till the stars fade from above.

Rodgers & Hammerstein,"When I was a boy, world was better spot
What was so was so, what was not was not
Now, I am a man, world have changed a lot
Some things nearly so, others nearly not

There are times I almost think
I am not sure of what I absolutely know
Very often find confusion
In conclusion, I concluded long ago

In my head are many facts
That, as a student, I have studied to procure
In my head are many facts
Of which I wish I was more certain, I was sure
Is a puzzlement

What to tell growing son?
What for instance, shall I say to him of women?
Shall I educate him on the ancient lines?
Shall I tell the boy as far as he is able
To respect his wives and love his concubines?

Shall I tell him everyone is like the other
And the better of the two is really neither?
If I tell him this I think he won't believe it
And I nearly think that I don't believe it either

When my father was a king
He was a king who knew exactly what he knew
And his brain was not a thing
Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to

Shall I, then be like my father
And be willfully unmovable and strong?
Or is it better to be right?
Or am I right when I believe I may be wrong?

Shall I join with other nations in alliance?
If allies are weak, am I not best alone?
If allies are strong with power to protect me
Might they not protect me out of all I own?

Is a danger to be trusting one another
One will seldom want to do what other wishes
But unless someday somebody trust somebody
There'll be nothing left on earth excepting fishes

There are times I almost think
Nobody sure of what he absolutely know
Everybody find confusion
In conclusion, he concluded long ago

And it puzzle me to learn
That tho' a man may be in doubt of what he know
Very quickly he will fight
He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so

Oh, sometimes I think that people going mad
Ah, sometimes I think that people not so bad
But not matter what I think, I must go on living life
As leader of my kingdom, I must go forth
Be father to my children and husband to each wife
Etcetera, etcetera and so forth

If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way
Everyday I try to live another day
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way
Everyday I do my best for one more day

But is a puzzlement",A Puzzlement
Rodgers & Hammerstein,"I'm as corny as Kansas in August,
I'm as normal as blueberry pie.
No more a smart little girl with no heart,
I have found me a wonderful guy!
I am in a conventional dither,
With a conventional star in my eye.
And you will note there's a lump in my throat
When I speak of that wonderful guy!
I'm as trite and as gay as a daisy in May,
A cliche coming true!
I'm bromidic and bright as a moon happy night
Pouring light on the dew!
I'm as corny as Kansas in August,
High as a flag on the Fourth of July!

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Rodgers & Hart,"The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love",Dancing on the Ceiling
Rodgers & Hart,"Once I was young, yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps
Once I was young, but never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was
Then you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Once I was old, twenty years or so
Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show
Once I was old, but not too old for fun
I used to hunt for little girls up my imaginary gun
But now I ain't for only one

Rodgers & Hart,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew, and never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad (Coward)
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's OK
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I'm alone when I lower my lamp

can pay for their ticket and rent me!
Butchers and barbers and rats from the harbors

Rodgers & Hart,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again

To get into my hair again

Rodgers & Hart,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

",Nobody's Heart
Rodgers & Hart,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Overture
Rodgers & Hart,"Sing for your supper
And you'll get breakfast

If their song is sweet to hear

And you'll get dinner
Dine with wine of choice
If romance is in your voice

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's A Small Hotel
Rodgers & Hart,"This can't be love because I feel so well 
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs

So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours

She was just Miss Jones to me

Behind his grandpa's plow an' two great mules.
When he turned ten years old, on May 8, '53.
He grew up fearin' God in Washburn, Tennessee.
The closest thing he had to a Dad was his Uncle Bob.
An' he could only dream of things like little league baseball.
An' that little boy, with big blue eyes and calloused hands,
Huh, became my old man.

Well she was a Kentucky girl, born on Valentine's Day.
The fourth child of five to my Grandma, Eula May.
So shy and beautiful with sunset hair and emerald eyes.
Her Daddy spent his life workin' in the coal mines.
Now in my eyes, all my life, my Daddy's been a Saint.
But even Saints need Angels to show them the way.
And over thirty-seven years ago, he asked for Margaret Lynn's hand.
And that Angel married my old man.

And there were times I tried to buck, the truthful things they said.

'Cause my folks are just like mountains, I looked at from afar.
But now the closer I get to them, the bigger they are.

Rodney Atkins,"She said, 'I've been up all night and half-scared to death
I can smell the liquor on your breath
I paid for your rehab with my IRA
Boy, your daddy's be turning in his grave.'
She said, 'son, I've done all mama can do
I can save myself, but I can't save you.'

He said, 'I wished you and Jesus would get off my back.'
They said his truck was doing ninety when he crashed
I bet it gets so quiet in heaven sometimes
Even God cries when an angel's hands are tied

They said, 'honey, grown-ups do this all the time.'
And tears welled up in their little girl's eyes
They said, 'now, it's not something that you've done
It just that mommy and daddy don't get along.'

She said, 'do you guys mean that you need a time out
And that daddy's gonna move to a different house?'
They said, 'you'll have two bedrooms; you're a lucky kid.'
She said, 'what about Checkers, where's he gonna live?'
I bet it gets so quiet in heaven sometimes
Even God cries when an angel's hands are tied

She prays, 'angels, watch me through the night
Stay by my side till morning light

Keep us together and happy.'

But there is one speech from high school
I'll never forget

Rodney Atkins,"I woke up the same way this morning
Like a stranger in my own life
Tired and confused with too much to do
Nothing left for my kids and my wife
Oh, I clung to that first cup of coffee
Praying, 'God, won't you show me what's real?'
Then out in the distance I saw through the window
A man on a tractor with a dog in a field

The dog walked just like it was smiling
The man drove like the world was all right
The tractor hummed on like a part of a song
That you sing to your children at night
His work was laid out there before him
In rows of green; his whole life was revealed
Oh, what I wouldn't give if I could just live
Like a man on a tractor with a dog in a field

[Chorus]

Let me do what I'm doing
Let me be where I am
Let me find peace of mind
On my own piece of land
When I'm lost, help me to let go
And find someway to feel
Like a man on a tractor with a dog in a field

There I was watching and wondering
My wife came down and sat beside me
She said, 'it's not about living another man's life
It's about seeing your own differently.'
Oh, this home that I love and my children
What more could one man hope to yield?
Then she touched my face
And said, 'there's more than one way
To be a man on a tractor with a dog in a field.'

Rodney Atkins,"Well, we grew up down by the railroad tracks, shootin' bibis at old beer cans
Chokin' on the smoke from a Lucky Strike somebody lifted off his old man
We were football flunkies, southern rock junkies, crankin' up the stereos
Singing loud and proud to ""Gimmie Three Steps,"" ""Simple Man,"" and ""Curtis Low""
We were big, ya know

Got some discount knowledge at the Jr. College where we majored in beer and girls
It was all real funny till we ran out of money and they threw us out into the world
Yeah, the kids that thought they'd run this town ain't a-runnin' much of anything
Just lovin' and laughin' and bustin' our asses, and we all call it all livin' the dream

But these are my people, this is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we got and then some
It ain't always pretty, but it's real
It's the way we were made, wouldn't have it any other way
These are my people

Well, we take it all week on the chin with a grin till we make it to Friday night
And it's church league softball, holler 'bout a bad call, preacher breaking up the fight
Then later on at the Green Light tavern, well, everybody's gatherin' as friends
And the beer's a pourin' till Monday mornin', and we start it all over again

And these are my people, this is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we got and then some
It ain't always pretty, but it's real
It's the way we were made, wouldn't have it any other way
These are my people

We fall down, and we get up
We walk proud, and we talk tough
We got heart, and we got nerve
Even if we are a bit disturbed

Woo, come on

These are my people, this is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we got and then some

Rodney Atkins,"I had every intention of getting hammered here tonight
I gave my truck keys to the bar keep
Said, 'Dave, don't you dare let me drive.'
In the middle of this bottle
I drank my train of thought off track
So I've gotta stop drinking
Or start rethinking my reason for throwing them back

'Cause it's just wasted whiskey trying to drink you off my mind
There ain't enough bourbon behind this bar
And I ain't got that kinda time
So I'm gonna stand while I can and raise my glass
Toast every time you kiss me
'Cause drinking to forget about you
Is wasted whiskey

So here's to new beginnings and to the memories
And cheers to your mama and daddy 'cause they were right about you and me
And here's to Millsap on the jukebox and to your new friends you've found
And here's to our joint account

Rodney Atkins,"Driving through town, just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldn't have the toy
Till his nuggets were gone
A green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
As fries went a flying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well, then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with ""s,"" and I was concerned
So I said, ""Son, now where did you learn to talk like that?""

He said, ""I've been watching you, dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food, and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah, we're just alike, hey, ain't we dad?
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you.""

We got back home, and I went to the barn
I bowed my head, and I prayed real hard
Said, ""Lord, please help me help my stupid self.""
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my son's Scooby Doo night light
He crawled out of bed, and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands
And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend
And I said, ""Son, now where'd you learn to pray like that?""

He said, ""I've been watching you, dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you

Yeah, we're just alike, hey, ain't we, dad?
I wanna do everything you do

With tears in my eyes, I wrapped him in a hug
Said, ""My little bear is growing up.""
He said, ""But when I'm big, I'll still know what to do.""

""'Cause I've been watching you, dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you

Rodney Atkins,"Well I heard he needed some help on the farm
Somebody with a truck and two strong arms
Not scared of dirt and willin' to work
Till the sun goes down
So I pulled up and said I'm your man
I could start right now and we shook hands
He said the fence needs fixin',
The peaches need pickin'
And the cows need bringin' round

I was haulin' hay, I was feedin' the hogs
And that summer sun had me sweatin' like a dog
So I cooled off in the creek
Then it was back to work in the daggum heat
I was cussin' out loud, thinkin' bout quitin'
Lookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't
Cause just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter

She was just gettin' home from Panama city
She was all tanned up and my kinda pretty
When her eyes met mine
I was thinkin' that I would sure love my job
As the days got shorter our talks got longer
The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
So we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up
Every chance we got
We were down by the river all night long
When the sun came up I was sneakin' her home
And draggin' my butt to work
With the smell of her perfume on my shirt
I'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind
With that sun beatin' down on this back of mine
Just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I fell in love with the farmer's daughter
We got married last spring
Whoa and there ain't no better life for me

I'm still haulin' hay and feedin' the hogs
And that summer sun has me sweatin' like a dog
So I cool off in the creek
And she brings me outta glass of sweet ice tea
I'm on the tractor and shes on my mind
And I can't wait till its quitin' time
And just when I think it can't get no hotter
I come home to the farmer's daughter
Yeah, the farmer's daughter,

Hey baby",Farmer's Daughter

Changin' my mood, a little George Strait 1982

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey

what a field looks like full of corn and cotton

I dribbles that ball till the grass was gone and the ground was brown and flat. Me and Daddy played horse and the cows all ""mooed"" and we laughed. I was lucky and I didn't even know it growing up like that.

I learned the birds and the bee's from the cats and the dogs, & a frog starts out as a pollywog. The best blackberry cobbler is made from scratch, and worth every one you get from the briar patch. I found out firewood will warm you twice, once when you cut it and once when you light it. & I can't help but smile when I look back, cause I was lucky and I didn't even know It growin' up like that.

There was an old wooden barrel hind my grandpa's house where we threw our tatter peels and coffee grounds, say you want to catch catfish long as your arm, son you gotta have a night crawler farm.

Rodney Atkins,"I packed up my pick-up at seventeen
With uncle Bob's old Martin guitar and a dream
Went from singin' in church
To singin' for tips in a honky-tonk
Till I became a jukebox flash
Play anything from Zeppelin to Cash
As a hard headed hard livin'
Cover singin' cover of my own self
Forgot who I was and where I was from
Then early one morning my daddy showed up

Lifelines, where would we be without lifelines
When we're lost at sea the devil's got you thinking
That the boat ain't sinking, but you're boots are getting wet
That's the thing about lifelines, they tell you the truth
When you won't reach you have to get a hold of you
You're lucky to find a few in your lifetime
Thank God for lifelines

These days I come home every Sunday afternoon
Mama always says ""I was just thinking about you
How's my favorite son?""
""Say, you mean your only one?
Oh I'm good, almost as good as your gravy""
She said, ""Your sister stops by with her kids everyday
But the horse has been tough they're gonna be OK
Your daddy keeps them busy watching Barbers on the Water
Let some Castor cares away""
She said, ""Son I know you gotta make money
But don't forget to make time to slow down and stop by
Have a real piece of pie, here""

Lifelines, where would we be without lifelines
When we're lost at sea the devil's got you thinking
That the boat ain't sinking
But you're boots are getting wet
That's the thing about lifelines they tell you the truth
When you won't reach you have to get a hold of you
You're lucky to find a few in your lifetime
So thank God for lifelines

Where would we be without lifelines
When we're lost at sea the devil's got you thinking
That the boat ain't sinking
But you're boots are sure getting wet
That's the thing about lifelines they tell you the truth
When you won't reach you have to get a hold of you
You're lucky to find a few in your lifetime

Rodney Atkins,"I miss my baby so much after being gone
Out on that lake at fishin' all weekend long
So I bought her flowers and a bottle of the good stuff
But when I walked in I knew, well I didn't bring enough

'Cause she ain't as happy as I am to be home
If looks could kill I'd be cold as a stone
I'm already ready to kiss and make up
Looks like tonight I'm out of luck oh no
Cause she'd rather fight than you know what

Had reservations at that Japanese steak house
Don't need to go where they're throwing knifes around
Just take my ear for love all the wrong I've done
Just get it over while she tears me a new one

She ain't as happy as I am to be home
If looks could kill I'd be cold as a stone
I'm already ready to kiss and make up
Looks like tonight I'm out of luck oh no
'Cause she'd rather fight than you know

What I'd like to do if I could just somehow
Get her in the mood oh but I can see right now
She ain't as happy as I am to be home
If looks could kill I'd be cold as a stone
I'm already ready to kiss and make up

Looks like tonight I'm out of luck oh no
'Cause she'd rather fight than you know what
I might be sleeping in my truck
'Cause she'd rather fight than you know what

Don't you like what I got you?

Well just a little hint, oh don't give up just yet
What made you think that love was gonna be so easy
Well she's a girl ain't she

Does she get to you, like no one else
Could she make your life heaven or a livin' hell
Did you think beautiful would drive you so crazy
Oh she's a girl ain't she

Is she on your mind every other thought
Is there nothing you wouldn't do for her just because
Does she hold your heart in her hands
Did she walk into your life and change your plans

Did she want a ring, did you tell her no
Or is it on her finger now, yea I thought so
Does she always get whatever she thinks she needs
Well she's a girl ain't she

Is she on your mind every other thought
Is there nothing you wouldn't do for her just because
Does she hold your heart in her hands
Did she walk into you life and change your plans

Does she have her momma's big bright eyes
Did you ever think something so small could change your life
She can melt your heart with a just a smile can't she

Rodney Carrington,"Well, I remember way back when I was just a boy,
Goin places with my mom and dad,
It used to scare me to death, how momma used to act
After six or seven beers she's had.
We were sittin at a table when momma got disabled
All the liquor runnin to her head,
Soon I got to chokin', daddy wasn't jokin' when he grabbed me by the arm and said...

""Don't look now your momma's got her boobs out showing everybody in town.""
Faces turnin' red we were wishin we were dead,
There where people standing all around
When momma gets to drinking there ain't much thinkin',
And there's nothing anybody can do,
Just hope and pray there never comes a day when my momma's out drinkin' with you

Well, we got her in the truck
And we started drivin' home
When momma said she had to go,
Daddy pulled it over,
We were standing on the shoulder while momma's puttin' on a show
Then he started up the truck and momma stood up with her pants still around her knees,
When we heard momma holler
If ya give me a dollar well I'll let you take a peek at these.

""Don't look now, your momma's got her boobs out.""
Showin' everybody in town
Faces turnin' red, we were wishing we were dead
There were people standing all around
When momma gets to drinkin', there ain't much thinkin'
And there's nothing anybody can do
Won't you hope and pray, there never comes a day when my momma's out drinking with you.
Oh, won't you hope and pray there never comes a day, when my momma's out drinking with you.



",Don't Look Now
Rodney Carrington,"I got home and the door was locked so I tried to ring the bell,I found a little bitty note that she had wrote telling me to go to hell.
I crawed in the window got inside she kicked me in the balls and then I cried,Called me a name said I'd lied kicked me again and I thought I died.
She took my clothes set them on fire, hit me with her curling iron.I tried to block it with my watch, then she kicked me in the crotch again.
Yea today's the day my wife met my girlfriend.

Well I tried to tell her but she didn't care thing's weren't what they seemed, She had a pan on the stove of full of boiling water and my nat's would soon be steamed. I tried to run, scream for for help, she hit me in the nurts with a rinestone belt. It was like nothing that I'd ever felt, I thank god I wasn't wearing a kilt. She grabed the bat from beneath the bed swung it once and missed my head, She rared back, swung it again, Then she hit me in the twin's again.
Yea today's the day my wife met my girlfriend.Yea today's that awful day,And my boys won't be the same. Yea today's the day my wife met my girlfriend.



",That Awful Day
Rodney Carrington,"

We were young when we first met,

And I won?t ever forget the way you made me feel that night back then,

Little did I know my life had change forever

inside of you my angel had appeared

All at once the baby came along,

everything was moving fast

but nothing seemed wrong


Chorus

Thank god for that

Things we didn?t know

Thank God for that

If we did we might turn back

Thank God for that

He must have known that we weren?t through

God gave me all I need

He gave me you


We struggled the first few years

There was laughter

There were tears

Through it all somehow we made it work,

Our babies brought us joy

Held us close together,

what we didn?t have we made with love,

Sacrifice you gave when I was gone

Dreams you let me follow

always brought me home


Chorus

Thank god for that

Things we didn?t know

Thank God for that

If we did we might turn back

Thank God for that

He must have known that we weren?t through

God gave me all I need

He gave me you


Everything we have been through

Will bind our love forever

Not a day will ever pass

that we won?t be together

here we are much stronger than we've ever been before

Our souls are sown together and our hearts forever more

I look forward to our future

And what our days shall be

Our kids our life our love are all we?ll ever need

The mother that you are is made me proud

And the wife that you have been

I am so glad I found


Chorus

Thank god for that

Things we didn?t know

Thank God for that

If we did we might turn back

Thank God for that

He must have known that we weren?t through

God gave me all I need

when he gave me you


God gave me all I need cause he gave

He gave me you

You know I love to spend my morningtime
Like sunlight dancing on your skin

As for telling lies to you
What you see is what I've been
There is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I can
Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
'Til I can gain control again
And like a lighthouse
You must stand alone
Landmark the sailor's journey's end
No matter what sea
I've been sailing on
I'll always pass this way again

There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now

How could you stop on a dime

The trouble waiting at the end of your ride

You kept your feelings hidden safely from view

Rodney Crowell,"I've got an old blue shirt, and it suits me just fine.
I like the way it feels, so I wear it all the time.
I've got an old guitar that won't ever stay in tune,
But I like the way it sounds in a dark and empty room.
I've got an old pair of boots that fit my feet just right.
I can work all day, and go out and dance all night.
I've got a new used car that runs just like a top;
Yeah, I get the feeling it ain't ever gonna stop.
Stuff that works; stuff that holds up
Is the kind of stuff you don't hang on the wall.
Stuff that's real; that stuff you feel
Is the stuff you always reach for when you fall.

I've got a pretty good friend who's seen me at my worst.
He don't care if I'm a blessing or a curse,
But he always shows up when the chips are down.
That's the kind of friend I like to be around.
Stuff that works...

There's a woman I love; she's crazy, and she paints like God.
She's got a playground sense of justice; she don't give odds.
I've got a tattoo with her name right through my soul,
And I think everything she touches turns to gold.

Rodney Crowell,"We moved into a house in Tennessee
From the California desert where we did not wanna be
Where the grass was high and the rivers green the sky was always blue
It was 1982 the world was still brand new
Oh the front door to that house was very strong
As long as we were living there I knew nothing could go wrong
So we had our kids we made our lives work out the best we could
Behind that ol' piece of wood in a world we understood

That ol' door was always open that ol' door was never closed
That ol' door was our protection when the need arose
That ol' door was ever faithful that ol' door was ever strong
That ol' door was there to open up and welcome me back home
Welcome me back home

We never knew how good we get it there
So we went right on living like we didn't have a care
And when the only thing that mattered didn't matter after all
And the writin' on the wall said we're headed for a fall

That ol' door was always open that ol' door was standing guard
That ol' door was there to witness when the times were hard
That ol' door was ever faithful that ol' door was in our bones
That ol' door was there to open up and welcome me back home
Welcome me back home

Sometimes when the leaves blow down the track
Something deep inside of me bring all those memories back
And that door comes round to haunt me with those chiseled marks that show

I'm gonna pull a load of wool off of my own two eyes
And sharpen my senses countin' railroad ties

When the mile long trestle makes a clickity-clack

And the nights run cold and clear
Down here.

We'll take each new day to give what we need to do our part
While were learning how to live
With a lifelong broken heart.

And we never will forget.
It's a privilege to remember.
The sound of days gone past will last.
We can see you in the stars
Come some vivid night in November
And with the last few leaves that fall,
Recal.l

Surely, each new day will give
What we need to do our part
To keep learning how to live
With a lifelong broken heart.

Oh, you beautiful one,
So clearly a gift.
Life had designs of its own
To set you adrift.

So go lightly where you must,
Travel soft upon new wings.
You will never be alone.
Go on.
When we cannot understand,
When we cannot find new meaning,
We'll seek out the ones you loved
And love.

Taking each new day to give
What we need to do our part.
We'll keep learning how to live
With a lifelong broken heart.
We're just learning how to live
With a lifelong broken heart.",Adam's Song

In a science fiction world where walkin' wounded leave their mark

Make's you stop and smell the roses if your smart
Get this freakin' anvil off my heart

It's not like I'm not blessed with something special in my world
Just around the next dark corner there's a blue eyed dancing girl
Who loves me like tomorrow comes with everything I need
I just have to pay attention where this road I'm on might lead
I'm singing come on funny feeling

The funny feeling knows the truth the eye for eye & tooth for tooth
It's something way back in your youth you should not second guess
The funny feeling never lies it's there to open up your eyes
Make you stop and realize you're blessed
So get this friggin' anvil off my chest

Rodney Crowell,"I could shed my skin and in the blink of an eye,
I could fly, fly, fly.
Tie my dreams up in a sack and lay my head down on the track,
And die, die, die.
My life's been so sweet I just can't stand it.
I must admit I've made out like a bandit.

Drinkin' wine, wine, wine.
Said fifty years of livin' and your worst mistakes forgiven,
Just take time, time, time.

And the next guy can't get two feet off the ground.

Earthbound; summer sun nearly ninety degrees.
Earthbound; big 'ol moon sinkin' down, think I might stick around.
I'm Earthbound.

I knew love once way back when--she had almond eyes and olive skin,
And long black hair.
She was Irish-Spanish mix-breed, I was southeast Texas hayseed,
We were almost there.
Her daddy did not like my kind around.
The true love took the next train out of town.
Earthbound.

Earthbound; where there's fathers and daughters in pain.
Earthbound; mama's boy walkin' home in the rain.
Earthbound; like a ship run aground, think I might stick around.
I'm Earthbound.

With each new day that passes I'm in need of thicker glasses,
But it's all okay.
Some day I'll be leavin', but I just can't help believin'
That it's not today. (hey)
Every golden moment I have found I've done my best to run right in the ground.
Earthbound.

Earthbound; see the sky big and beautiful blue.
Earthbound; fallen angels come calling for you.
Earthbound; keepin' close to the ground, think I might stick around.
Earthbound; Tom Waits, Aretha Franklin, Mary Karr
Earthbound; Walter Cronkite, Seamus Heaney, Ringo Starr
Earthbound; the Dalai Lama and Charlie Brown make me wanna stick around.

Drowning in fear
And he keeps it all locked in his heart

This man is a tyrant, a fault finding hack
You can't tell him nothing
There's no turning back
He leaves blood on the highway
And scattered debris
He crawls from the wreckage
But he still doesn't see
He's alive
The man is jive

There's a man in the mirror
I don't like his looks
His teeth they are crooked
His hands are like hooks
He speaks 4 letter language
Because his mind is so small
His voice is like venom

I aim for heaven but I wake up on the floor
I'd take up with rattlesnakes to get my point across
I'd argue with a parking brake to show em who's the boss
It's my intention to inspire
Instead I'm preachin to the choir

I had some money but I blew it living high
My wine and women were the best that you could buy
I tried to prove myself a man of certain taste
But all I've got to show you now is written on my face
I'm not someone you'd admire but I'm still preachin' to the choir

I'm born a lion but I don't believe it fits
I'm no king of the jungle out there livin by my wits
This morning's paper called for romance on a whim
I reckon I'd believe em' if they told me sink or swim
I'm under water not on fire but I'm still preachin to the choir

Baytown Texas there's a fisherman I knew
He read the bible and he spit tobacco too
He said that crap about the rod you spare to spoil the child
Is only propaganda meant to keep you in denial
Go on and follow your desire but he was preachin to the choir

Time is of the essence when you're hanging by a thread
And the answer to your questions won't unravel in your head
When you're staring at forever from the edge of life's abyss
No one's gonna tell you how it all came down to this
If you say different you're a liar
I'm just preachin' to the choir

When I'm standing at the St. Peter's gate a trying to slip on in
I might as well plead guilty to the worst of who I've been
I used to like to think I had a special way with words
But right now I'm convinced I've more in common with the birds
I'm not ready to retire I'll keep on preachin to the choir

Rodney Crowell,"Ridin' Out The Storm Lyrics
The New York City winter comes in cold grey sheets of steel
The numbness in his hands and feet is all that he can feel
Alcohol and sterno turns a doorway to a bed

And the ghost of who he might have been lives on inside his head
In a canyon made of brownstone on a sidewalk icy black
He wanders nearly barefoot with his righteousness in tact
A man of many mansions in a cardboard box replete

He lies sleeping with an angel while his heart pretends to beat
The wind blows down on Lonely Street like an ice pick through the air
Midst the Sunday times and coffee grinds and wino's in Times Square
Five flights up on Easy Street you know she's safe and warm

Way down low neath a foot of snow he's riding out the storm
I offered him my winter coat politely he refused
Like an educated man he spoke with words I seldom use
He said I don't need pity for these choices are my own

He bowed his head just slightly and quietly moved along
Its not like he's a victim of the homeless life he stalks
Nor helpless to get back across the fine line that he walks
Riding out the storm means yesterday's already spent

Tomorrow don't mean nothing it won't even make a dent",Ridin' Out the Storm

My ragged old heart's been blessed

When there's so much at stake
I'm halfway to heaven, halfway to hell
But I might roll a seven
You never can tell

The same old rules need not apply
I've got a past full of sticks and stones
And a good feeling in my bones

I want to go faster
I don't want to slow down
I don't want to get off of this merrygoround
I want to be reckless
I want to be vain
I want to make love like a runaway train

When the winds of change hit hard and knock you off your guard
And you find out there's a serpent in the grass
Though forked tongues might speak if truth is what you seek

This too will pass
When your all tied up in knots and your friends are taking shots
And the sun comes up and kicks you in the ass
When your stumbling down the aisle and you feel like you're on trial

This too will pass
Sometimes you've gotta go down the middle of the road
Where compromise puts speed bumps in your path
If you know what you won't let no one say you don't

This too will pass
Sometimes you gotta crawl through the middle of it all
But don't compromise your heart for something crass
When everything you do just feels like nothing new

This too will pass
When your all locked up in pain be careful who you blame
This too will pass",This Too Will Pass
Rodney Crowell,"It's time to go inward, take a look at myself
Time to make the most of the time that I've got left
Prison bars imagined are no less solid steel

Time to go inward would you believe that I'm afraid
To stare down the barrel of the choices that I've have made
The ghost of bad decisions
Make mountains out of everything I feel

Outside my window the wind weaves a path through the trees
The moon takes a shine to the shadows that fall on the leaves

It's time to go inward, hmm
I don't know if I can do it after all that I've become
I've been a fool for money
But it's vanity that always leaves me flat

It's time to go inward, man I hope I have the nerve
To take an inventory of the causes that I serve
They say a man without a conscience
Is like a man without a country or somethin' like that

It's time to go inward, time to be still
If I don't do it now I don't believe I ever will
My mind is like a chatterbox
Whose noise pollutes the pathways to my soul

Time to go inward, time to get a grip
Time to put an end to one long bad acid trip
I'm all out of excuses now
For the way I've let my choices take a toll

Jesus and Buddha and Krishna and Minnie Pearl knew
To do unto others the things you want done unto you

It's time to go inward and take a look at me
Try to make some sense of life's illusions that I see
And try to solve the riddle
Of what it is I have to offer to this world

When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrist and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

And the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount
Nothing really matters much, doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Now there's a wall between us, something else been lost
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn'
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make her mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born

Forgive me all my vanity
Forgive me my conceit
Forgive me when I'm crawling
Like a beggar at Your feet

Ignorance is the enemy
And it wields a mighty sword
It can cut you down in a blaze of glory
It can nail you to a board

It's like everything you've dread

I'd wanna be a woman

Until my heart got broke
Maybe then I could find out if I'm a half decent man
Or if I'm just a joke

If I could be the first woman president
I'd take on air pollution
I'd walk the streets of Baghdad at dawn

It's no excuse to be deaf dumb and blind

It likes to call itself intelligent design

It's a mans world I've heard it since birth
I'm out of touch with my gender

I wanna stifle the causes of sufferin' and hate
I wanna know my enemy by the look in his eyes
I wanna stop all this madness before it's to late

Messianic delusion's a back breaking grind
I've got a dog and a gold and a friend in the navy
Don't know nothing about intelligent design

It's no excuse to be vile
It's no excuse to wanna die for religion

Who'd have thought that peace of mind would find me in the end
Nearly ten years on the mend and no getting over you
For now I'm resolute, I've seen evidence of change

Let's set the record straight, I came around too late
Though I got there in the end, I never was your friend

Some ninja on a dirt bike nearly ran him down for good

The floorboards creak and faucets leak, but it's the emptiness that sings
The wind grows chill and then lies still
Forty miles from nowhere
At the bottom of the world

November sky's a diamond-studded dome
A hundred billion points of light to guide my way back home
When the moon is hanging fat and full and all those jangly stars recede
A fold out couch on a midnight porch is where my footsteps lead
You always said I made my bed
Forty miles from nowhere

Friends don't call like they used to for reasons not unkind
If there's anything that we can do rings hollow down a telephone line

A few gravestones, a pre-civil war fence and the random arrowhead
Where the beehive swarmed three summers ago too wet the old men said
So it's me your, little lap dog and that old brindle cat trying to keep this place in line

Make the girls believe that I'm the last one of my kind
Silver toe tips on my boots and a mullet head of hair
All designed to walk into a room and make somebody stare
I don't care anymore if I don't stand out in a crowd
I was better off before I tried to make my mother proud

I came to town a dreaming I could make my mark in spades
Forty odd years later all my best cards have been played
It's a hard knock situation when the accolades bestowed
On your every last creation cries out middle of the road
I don't care anymore about the fortune and the fame
I was better off before I tried to make myself a name

All the money that I blew through like some boot black off the farm
Could not have vanished quicker if I'd shot it in my arm
Some so and so says don't you know the limit is the sky
Next thing I remember I'm unlearning how to fly
I don't care anymore

All those party dolls and favors that I savored from day one
Add up to next to nothing after all is said and done
A real friend tried to tell me man with all respect it's true
The time to put away these things is long since overdue

If indeed I do get lonesome in my mansion on the hill
There's this neighbor's wife I covet for her beauty and her skill
The way she puts herself together sleek in vagabond couture
Makes each mailbox conversation one more heartache to endure
I don't care anymore who does what and why
I was better off before when I was just another guy

I've been lied on, spied on, cried on, tried on, taken for a ride you bet
Fracked, cracked, smacked jack, what you see is what you get

Rodney Crowell,"Life without Susanna started when Townes Van Zandt died
From that day on she hid out undercover
Her Percocet and cigarette along for the ride

She made the bed inside her head a shelter
Each new day a sliver through the blinds
I tried tough love, tenderness and anger
But nothing pierced the fortress inside her mind

The first time I saw her she threw me that smile
Pure angel of mercy east Texas style
A poet in gingham, an assassin in jeans
The most near perfect woman I'd ever seen
She was hardly routine

Life without Susanna troubles me in ways hard to express
As she withdrew I grew distant and judgmental
A self-sure bastard and a stubborn bitch
Locked in a deadly game of chess
The upside of my status as a cut above the rest

The last time I saw her was close to the end
I cried like a baby for the shape I was in
No lipstick, no powder to soften the tone
The most worthy opponent that I've ever known
Was already gone

Life without Susanna is something we all have to face
So welcome to the world as we don't know it

I was drinking in a hotel bar

But what can I tell you

Judging by the evidence
I’m feeling reckless

I don’t know why I would go there 
All to make a fuss over what
I’ve got a woman like you and what do I do,
Pretend I might be something I’m not

I know you know it’s not your fault, it’s just something inside me

Would that I were worth my salt
But I’m feeling reckless

You give me more than I give back
It’s more than a social skill I lack
So slay me with your tender mercy
And comfort me with words of steel

You can catch me in a lie 
When I cast a roving eye 
But you’ll never know the way I feel

I know you know you’re smarter than me
Tell me something I don’t know

Rodney Dangerfield,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way

Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love

Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever

He took up fiddle playing just for fun, that's the last work Ebo Walker done. 

Well Ebo Walker left Kentucky 
cause Ebo's daddy said durn your hide,
You won't plant corn, and you won't make hay, 
you sit on the porch and play that thing all day. 

Well Ebo Walker, he walked and he fiddled and he walked and he fiddled and he drank till he died,

You can hear old Ebo Walker all around.

Rodney Franklin,"Lately love keeps keeping up at night 
Tossing and turning, my love 
Wanna kiss you, wanna hold you real tight 
Ooo but I wonder love whether you know or not 
You just hurry away, leaving me laying there in shock 

I just wanna be the one that you wanna see 
I just wanna have you near me 
But you fly away almost everyday 
You work a lot but you never stop to love 

Stop, I love you so stop 
Come home from the road 
Gotta stop to love 
And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop 
Say you're coming home 

You say my love has always been on your mind 
But how can I ever love you, when you keep working overtime? 
Too many empty nights, can make almost any guy roam 
to look for the love he don't get whenever he's at home alone. 

Awaiting the day that you're coming to stay 
I hate to see you go away, but you couldn't rest 
Had to do your best to reach the top 
But you did not stop to love 

Stop, I love you so stop 
Come home from the road 
Gotta stop to love 
And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop 
Say you're coming home

And one day you'll discover I'm the one who love ya 
Gotta stop to love 
No one loves you better 
Can't you stay forever? 
Stop to love 
I can hardly stand the loneliness 
Come on home, that's what it's all about 
You really turn me out 

Stop, I love you so stop 
Come home from the road

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

The bass that's in your face, sho' nuff shrugs your face
Just like you got sprayed by a can of mace
You see your speaker is movin, everybody is groovin
My song moves along as it starts improvin
The highs will get no higher, the bass will go no lower
'cause everlasting bass, sho' nuff moves a flower
Some people can't take it, they try to plead the case
But you can't get enough of everlasting bass

Joe's as fast as Carl Lewis
He's black, not Jewish
And when he's on stage, he can (scratching) do it
And I'm good to go, yes Rodney O
Leader of the show, make the ladies say ""Oh!""
King of my castle, causin much pain
You dumb shrimp wimps, it's you I tame
So to the are, to the O, to the D-N-E-why
Now what's that spell? Rodney, that's right

Me and Joe are on the go, movin fast, not slow
Sportin Filas and Adidas and some are Kangols
We ride on 747's, not DC-10's
We'll take a 3-day vacation and we'll do it again
Check in the hotel the day of the show
No time to play around because we got to go
You see we're on a flight, to rock the mic

Clap your hands this evening, come on
(Scratching), this is for the homies(4x)

I'm Rodney O and I'm back, on a track that's not wack
And my DJ, Joe Cooley's still on top of the stack
So you can say he's like wine, he's getting better with time
And General Jeff is by my side, to support my rhymes
We clock dollars, not dimes, we rock bells and chimes
And I'm a be	-boy 100%, like Moonshine
So listen up everybody 'cause you should not miss
""As we go a little something like this"" --> Slick Rick
Well I'm a true blue MC with plenty of pizzazz
Plantin and scratchin is Joe's favorite task
Is he the best? Well there's no need to ask
Take a look at him as he moves fast
As lightnin, and you know what's so damn frightenin?
You others are soft, and you still haven't ripened 
Yet, I'm not knockin you, I'm just rockin to
A funky beat that is just cold sockin you
I'n the face, we got pounds of bass
And check it out everybody, Joe Cooley's in the place

[Chorus 1]
(Rodney O)
I brought the microphone, Joe Cooley brought the mixer
I drink Coca-Cola, not hardcore liquor
'cause I'm playin it straight, the homies like the 8
""It's the power!"" that makes it taste so great
I'm kickin back in the hood, this beat is kickin real good
If you was kickin it like me, you wouldn't have to ask, would
This bass reflect, the maximum effect
This jam is for the homies, and it's comin direct
Straight from the heart, and I will do my part
This groove has been groovin straight from the start
This is for the homies, and the homegirls too
Joe Cooley, tell them what you want 'em to do

[Chorus 2:]
Say yeah, yeah, yeah(this is for the homies)(4x)

I'm gettin straight to the point
Hold a mic, not a joint
Like the end is lit up, so it's Joe and he cuts
Newmark is is brand, all gummies get canned
""This is for the homies!"" is the name of this jam
We rock it like an earthquake, we're conquerin states
Rodney O and Joe Cooley doing many tour dates
Dedicating this song, to the homies at home

He dissed my record cause he didn't like my vocals
Now I'm showin him the meaning of loco

There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.

To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.

Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal

El día que me quieras
Endulzara sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor
Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor

La noche que me quieras",El DĂ­a Que Me Quieras
Rodolfo Mederos,"Si arrastré por estemundo
la vergüenza de habersido
y el dolor de ya no ser...
Bajo el ala del sombrero,
cuántas veces embozada
una lágrima asomada
yo no pude contener...
Si crucé por los caminos
como un paria que el Destino
se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,
sólo quiero que comprendan
el valor que representa
el coraje de querer.

Era para mí la vida entera,
como un sol de primavera,
mi esperanza y mí pasión.
Sabía
que en el mundo no cabía
toda la humilde alegría
de mi pobre corazón.
Ahora, 
cuesta abajo en mi rodada,
las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

¡Si aquella boca mentía
el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos
yo habría dado siempre más!

If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure

Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west,

Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold.

The tune will come to you at last.

While kogi hit secrets into seashells

And the rest was sure to come
Leaves, caught in winter's ice

Abandoned circus grounds of flower captains
Prisms in a palm one way it happens
The air was silver calm
The softly met were slowly moving on

Then all things in common suddenly grew strange
Now the wurs were chasing other rainbows
Trying to find where the wind blows
To empty corners past dusty memories

Now in the third millennium the crowded madness came
Crooked shadows roamed through the nights
The wizards overplayed their names
And after that the wurs never bothered to have

Rodriguez,"Just a song we shared, I'll hear
Brings memories back when you were here
Of your smile, your easy laughter
Of your kiss, those moments after
I think of you,
And think of you
And think of you.

Of the dreams, we dreamt together
Of the love we vowed would never
Melt like snowflakes in the sun
My days now end as they begun
With thoughts of you,
And I think of you
And think of you.

Down the streets I walked with you
Seeing others doing things we do
Now these thoughts are haunting me
Of how complete I used to be
And in these times that we're apart
I'll hear this song that breaks my heart

Rodriguez,"I've played every kind of gig there is to play now
I've played faggot bars, hooker bars, motorcycle funerals
In opera houses, concert halls, halfway houses.

Well I found that in all these places that I've played
All the people that I've played for are the same people
So if you'll listen, maybe you'll see someone you know in this song.

A most disgusting song.

The local diddy bop pimp comes in
Acting limp he sits down with a grin
Next to a girl that has never been chaste
The bartender wipes a smile off his face
The delegates cross the floor,
Curtsy and promenade through the doors,
And slowly the evening begins.

And there's Jimmy ""Bad Luck"" Butts
Who's just crazy about them East Lafayette weekend sluts
Talking is the lawyer in crumpled up shirt
And everyone's drinking the detergents
That cannot remove their hurts

While the Mafia provides your drugs,
Your government will provide the shrugs,
And your national guard will supply the slugs,
So they sit all satisfied.

And there's old playboy Ralph
Who's always been shorter than himself,
And there's a man with his chin in his hand,
Who knows more than he'll ever understand.

Yeah, every night it's the same old thing
Getting high, getting drunk, getting horny
At the Inn-Between, again.

And there's the bearded schoolboy with the wooden eyes
Who at every scented skirt whispers up and sighs
And there's a teacher that will kiss you in French
Who could never give love, could only fearfully clench

Yeah, people every night it's the same old thing
Getting pacified, ossified, affectionate at Mr. Flood's party, again

And there's the militant with his store-bought soul
There's someone here who's almost a virgin I've been told
And there's Linda glass-made who speaks of the past
Who genuflects, salutes, signs the cross and stands at half mast

Yeah, they're all here, the Tiny Tims and the Uncle Toms,
Redheads, brunettes, brownettes and the dyed haired blondes,
Who talk to dogs, chase broads and have hopes of being mobbed,
Who mislay their dreams and later claim that they were robbed

And every night it's going to be the same old thing
Getting high, getting drunk, getting horny
Lost, even, at Martha's Vineyard, again",A Most Disgusting Song

And I make sixteen solid half hour friendships every evening

And likes to laugh alone is always threatening you with leaving

And give a medal to replace the son of Mrs. Annie Johnson

And I explained that I had overpaid them

And the clerk there said that they had just been invaded
So I set sail in a teardrop and escaped beneath the doorsill

Se venho sendo egoísta com você
Estou tentando reverter

Se você sente falta
Eu também sinto
Se você quer mudar, eu 'to contigo
Vamos achar a solução

Eu sei que me acomodei, não minto
Entrar no nosso quarto é um desafio
Por mais que você diga não
Perdemos o controle da situação

Preste atenção
O mais difícil já foi feito 
Assumir os meus defeitos
Existe um desejo de recomeçar
Me diz o que pode ser feito
Pra gente então se acertar

No fim das contas, sei que tudo se ajeita
Uma noite perfeita, sem ninguém pra incomodar
Até porque nós dois já temos a receita
Química perfeita pra amar

Roesy,"I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""
I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby

Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, ""If you're going somewhere can I come along?""
I said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

I'm not sure of the words yet;
Huh, I'm not sure of anything!

Life is very rough and tumble for a humble siseuse;
One can betray one's troubles never, whatever occurs!
Night after night,
Have to be bright,
Whether you're well or ill;
The people have to laugh their fill,
You mustn't sleep till dawn comes creeping.

Though I never really grumble,
Life's a jumble indeed!
And in my efforts to succeed
I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.
Heigh ho!
If love were all I should be lonely!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,
Heigh ho!
If love were all!

Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""

Said ""You're in love""

Said when the next one arrives

I left there in a hurry

Ist sie schön, hat sie n' Freund
Ist er schön meistens auch
Das ist Murphys Gesetz

Danach wächst Po und Bauch
Das ist Murphys Gesetz
Wenn's nur Spaß war wird sie schwanger
Und wenn du's ernst meinst ja dann stell dich hinten an
Da ist längst schon ein anderer dran

Und wenn wir mal nur rot seh'n
Es ist ihm völlig gleich
Es lässt nicht mit sich streiten
Wenn es and'rer Meinung war
Auch wenn es uns im regen steh'n lässt
Es ist immer für uns da

Das Leben ist auch nur ein Mensch

Bringt dich zum lachen und zum Weißglut
Wenn's dir auf der Nase tanzt
Du kriegst es nur zu packen,
Wenn du es nicht fassen kannst
Das Leben ist auch nur ein Mensch

Es ist was wir draus machen
Ist Weg oder auch Ziel
Es handelt kompromisslos
Ganz ohne Kalkül
Man kann es nicht beherrschen
Aber halten wie man mag
Auch wenn wir nicht damit rechnen:
Es ist immer für uns da

Das Leben ist auch nur ein Mensch

Bringt dich zum lachen und zum Weißglut
Wenn's dir auf der Nase tanzt
Du kriegst es nur zu packen,
Wenn du es nicht fassen kannst
Das Leben ist auch nur ein Mensch

Und wenn du denkst dass du's verstanden hast
Lässt es dich fall'n, fämgt dich auf und lacht
Einfach weil es ist

Das Leben ist auch nur ein Mensch

Bringt dich zum lachen und zum Weißglut
Wenn's dir auf der Nase tanzt
Du kriegst es nur zu packen,
Wenn du es nicht fassen kannst

Roger Cicero,"Seit Tagen schon ist der Himmel bedeckt

Die Straßen grau, die Wolken auch 
Doch ich steh' mit 'nem Lächeln auf

Seit Wochen ham' hier alle nasse Schuhe 
Die Stimmung ist im Keller wie die Temperatur 
Ein Sturm naht, gefühlt drei Grad 
Doch ich merk's nicht mal

Der Wetterbericht 
Interessiert mich nicht 
Scheiß auf die Blitze 
Scheiß auf'n Donner

Du bist mein Sommer 
Du bist mein Sommer

Während alle anderen das ganze Jahr sparen 
Um dann endlich in den Süden zu fahren 
Bleib ich hier - wegen dir 
Hab' ich kein Fernweh mehr

Und wir erzählen uns nächtelang unser Leben 
Die kleinen und großen Dinge die uns bewegen 
So wie im Rausch - wir hören nicht auf 
Bis zum Morgengrauen

Und soll's Gewitter geben 
Bleiben wir halt liegen
Blind für die Blitze 
Und taub für'n Donner

Weil was wir teilen so viel mehr ist

Du lässt mich die Welt durch deine Augen sehen

Im Hier und Jetzt stehst du am Strand
Als Architekt von deiner Welt
vergisst die Zeit und den Raum
Erschaffst du alles wie's dir gefällt
Du hast die Neugier im Gepäck
Und malst dein Leben auf Papier
Aus meinem schwarz und weiß
Machst du auf einmal wieder bunt

Schreib soviel Lieder wie noch nie,
6 Stunden täglich am Klavier,
Hab alle Hände voll zu tun, kein Zeitverlust.
Bin unterwegs rund um die Uhr,
Ganz egal was ich auch tu,
Ich schmeiße mich dem Leben an die Brust.

Ich bin wieder obenauf,
Und ich sag es in den Spiegel,
Solang bis ich´s mir selber glaub.

Ich hab die Wohnung renoviert,
Und alle Sachen aussortiert,
Die Bilder hängen wieder an ihrem alten Platz,
All unsre Freunde waren da
Und ich sag ich komm schon klar
Frag ich nach dir, dann nur in einem Nebensatz.
Und aus meinem Portemonnaie muss ich das Foto noch rausnehm´
Am Ende ist auch das nur ein Stück Papier.
Zwar mit Erinnerung besetzt,
Doch ich leb ja hier und jetzt,
Und wenn es doch mal schlimmer wird, dann sag ich mir

Ich wollt die Welt für dich zu einem Spielplatz machen 
Jetzt liegst du da in Mitten tausend bunter Sachen 
Doch tief da drin ertrinkt ein Plüschtier mehr an Lachen 
Ich kenn's nur zu genau.

Ich verspreche dir, das Licht bleibt an,

Und später schleich' ich leise raus, 
und ich hoff so sehr, du wachst nicht auf. 
Ich start noch ne CD für dich, 
nur bitte stell die Frage nicht,

Seh' mich im Zimmer um, 
hier liegt ne halbe Kindheit rum. 
Ein stummes Meer aus Spielzeug klagt mich an.

Deine Augen fragen still, 
warum ich hier nicht bleiben will. 
Oh Gott nein, du bist ganz bestimmt nicht Schuld daran!

Ich wollt so sehr, dass alles hier zusammenpasst, 
wie auf dem Bild, dass du heut von uns dreien gemalt hast. 
Du lächelst mit, doch du reißt dich nur zusammen, ich weiß das. 
Erinnere mich genau. 
Oh, ich erinnere mich genau.

Die erste laue Frühlingsabendluft
Ein unverhoffter freier Tag
Der langersehnte Regen im August

Der Abschied auf dem Bahnsteig
Und das Wiedersehen danach
Ein missglücktes Kompliment
Und wenn sie trotzdem drüber lacht
Glück ist leicht

Deiner heimlich großen Liebe
Nach all den Jahren zur Hochzeit gratulieren
Glück ist leicht
Der Moment in dem du siehst
Um zu wachsen musst du manchmal auch verlieren
Glück ist leicht

Wenn dich jemand zu gut kennt
Ein ernst gemeintes „tut mir leid“
„My Funny Valentine“ von Miles
Und ein Tanz allein zu zweit
Glück ist leicht

Du kannst es anschreien und verfluchen
Und verzweifelt nach ihm suchen
Wenn du's erzwingen willst, dann bleibt es unerreicht
Kannst dich in deiner Suche baden
Und es mit Tiefsinn überladen
Es löst sich einfach auf, sobald du nach ihm greifst

Die Straße deiner Kindheit
Eine Melodie, die sich von selber singt
Glück ist leicht
Wenn du mit den Tränen kämpfst
Und dich ein guter Freund zum Lachen bringt
Glück ist leicht

Deine alte Lieblingsjacke,
Die dein Sohn auf einmal trägt
Der Moment, in dem er dich zum ersten Mal beim Fußball schlägt
Glück ist leicht

Du kannst es anschreien und verfluchen
Und verzweifelt nach ihm suchen
Wenn du's erzwingen willst, dann bleibt es unerreicht

Kannst dich in deiner Suche baden
Und es mit Tiefsinn überladen
Es löst sich einfach auf sobald du nach ihm greifst
Glück ist leicht
Glück ist leicht

Wenn du ganz alleine bist
Und der nächste Mensch ist meilenweit entfernt
Wenn dein großer nicht Plan aufgeht
Und du merkst wie du grad' loszulassen lernst

Eine lange Nacht zu Ende
Und ein neuer Tag fängt an
Das Gefühl es gibt da Dinge,
Die man nicht erklären kann
Glück ist leicht

Du kannst es anschreien und verfluchen
Und verzweifelt nach ihm suchen
Wenn du's erzwingen willst, dann bleibt es unerreicht
Kannst dich in deiner Suche baden
Und es mit Tiefsinn überladen

Roger Cicero,"Als ich dich damals traf
Hattest du mich beim ""Hallo""
Für mich war'n wir ein Traumpaar,
Wie im Kino oder so.
Wir zwei gegen den Rest.
Fast wie Bonnie und Clyde.
Doch wenn man nicht zurückspulen kann, hat alles seine Zeit.
Und ich weiß nicht, warum wir zwei nicht mehr die gleichen sind.
Ich weiß nur für uns gibt's wohl kein Happy-End.

Und zum Abschied fällt kein Regen,
Es gibt keinen letzten Kuss.
Nur ein „Mach's gut“ und „Bis dann mal“
Das hier ist nicht Hollywood.
Kein Orchester zum Finale
Und die Welt geht nicht kaputt.
Komm wir machen keine Szene,
Das hier ist nicht Hollywood.

Wir dachten unser Drehbuch steht,
Das diese Story niemals endet.
Aber wenn man mittendrin ist,
Merkt man kaum wie es sich ändert.
Und dann war es wohl zu spät,
Um nochmal in den Kampf zu siehen.
Wir hatten lange durchgehalten,
Doch dafür wird kein Preis verliehen.

Und zum Abschied fällt kein Regen,
Es gibt keinen letzten Kuss.
Nur ein „Mach's gut“ und „Bis dann mal“
Das hier ist nicht Hollywood.
Kein Orchester zum Finale
Und die Welt geht nicht kaputt.
Komm wir machen keine Szene,
Das hier ist nicht Hollywood.

Und jetzt steh'n wir, voreinander.
Auf einem Supermarkt-Parkplatz
Und ein Kind schreit und ein Hund bellt und es ist Dienstagnachmittag
Und keiner sagt uns was wir sagen sollen.
Keine Pointe, kein „Fortsetzung folgt“

Und zum Abschied fällt kein Regen,
Es gibt keinen letzten Kuss.

My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do, Isaw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

And yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
But now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught

Leave the key in that old front lock

There must be somethin we have forgot

Chorus",L.A. Freeway
Roger Creager,"Roger Creager

You packed up your things and then you said goodbye.
You'd think after all we shared, you could tell me why.
The flames were burning hot baby, too hot to hold.
Bu, now I see your love was burning cold.
But don't you worry about me.
I'm feeling sorry for you, and when I sleep tonight,
At least I'll know my love is true.
Baby I'm better than you.
I'm moving on to a place where love is strong.
I'm moving on.
Does this sound like a sad country song?
I dusted myself off and I'm back in the saddle again.
I lost in love with you bit now I'm ready to win and I'm moving on.
No more trying to win you back.
No more crying over what I thought we had.
When I said, ""I need you"" and that I was all alone,
Good old compassionate you slammed down the phone.
But don't you worry about me.
I'm feeling sorry for you, and when I sleep tonight,
At least I'll know my love is true.
Baby I'm better than you.
I'm moving on to a place where love is strong.
I'm moving on.
Does this sound like a sad country song?
I dusted myself off and I'm back in the saddle again.
I lost in love with you but now I'm ready to win and I'm moving on.
So save your money and save your time.
Save your ragged little mind.
You turned your love off like switch.
Just think of all this love you missed.
I'm moving on to a place where love is strong.
I'm moving on.
Does this sound like sad country song?
You probably thought I'd write a sad country song.
Does this sound like a sad country song?



",Moving On
Roger Creager,"Roger Creager

Tonight I don't feel much like writing a song
But I guess I needed something to sing along
Something that I could sing and I could cry to
A song to help me say goodbye to you

Love says we'll always have forever
Life knew we'd have just awhile
Greener pastures lie ahead of you out there somewhere
I look into your heart and give a smile

Chorus
Goodbye, goodbye

My answer for pain, she lies sleeping
Your remedy lies deep inside of you
I've always admitted the way you take things head on
Maybe someday I'll be strong like that too
I can't say that I blame you
I cannot say you were wrong
I never found the way to say this
So to you I sing this song

Chorus

Repeat first verse

This song helped me say goodbye to you
I guess I finally said goodbye to you

Roger Creager,"Her name was Stella
And she was old and gray
She had her rusty strings and keys
And the tuner, it took a pair of pliers 
And lots of elbow grease
She awakened me to the melody 
Like the light from a brand new dawn
And from that moment on
It was all for the sake of the song
Her name was Maggie
She had eyes like fire
That burned for me in the dark
And all she wanted was my very soul 
And all she could take from my heart
But to her dismay a choice was made
And when the deed was done
She turned and I was gone
It was all for the sake of the song
And for the sake of the song
I walk my own road
For the sake of the song
Not for silver and gold
Some may think that I am wrong
But in my heart I know
And I've known all along
It was all for the sake of the song
Her name was Laura
She was pure like crystal
Shining alone on the shelf
And from the moment that her eyes met mine
I knew there could be nobody else
Kindred souls singing free in perfect harmony
Two hearts now beat as one
The road goes on and on
And it's all for the sake of the song
For the sake of the song
I walk my own road
For the sake of the song
Not for silver and gold
Some may think that I am wrong
But in my heart I know
And I've known all along
It was all for the sake of the song
Her name's Stella",All for the Sake of the Song
Roger Creager,"She gave it away on good faith when she was 15 years old. 
He was 16 and did not appreciate the delicacy of a rose. 
A long string of lovers helped blur the line 
Between true love and lust. 
A teenage girl who's been sold short, 
Whose she got left to trust? 
The cycle of sin she found herself in once the word got out. 
It broke her heart to realize what they were all about. 
After she gave all she had 
They didn't treat her so well. 
Each time she went their way, 
Another petal fell. 

[Chorus]
Sometimes life leads you down a road 
That you don't choose. 
You try so hard to win but you still lose. 
Bottle it all up inside where nothing ever grows. 
She built a ten-foot wall around what's left of a rose. 
I have always been there when she's cried a million tears. 
I know why she can't see that I've loved her for years. 
In the fertile soil of my hands I know real love can bloom. 
I would give up everything to bathe in her perfume. 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
She's been loved a time or two 
But I don't think she could tell. 
She's always been called easy. 
But friend she's hard as hell.

Roger Creager, John Evans



I've heard stories about the 1950's.
Rock'n'roll music all the way to the 60's.
Everybody says it ain't ever gonna be the same.

But way down South the music got the mojo.
It's all homegrown.
You won't hear it on the radio.
Call it what you want but to me it's the good old days.

God knows I can't stop burning up the blacktop
Chug a cup of coffee from the honey at the truck stop.
Our blood starts pumping
When we're out on a three-day run.
Johnny's got his guitar hanging out the trunk.
Billy's on the floorboard, I
Think he's still drunk; long road ahead, but already having fun.

Chorus: Living here in the Good Old days
While they're going on around us
Thinking we've got it made
When the music has found us.
Ain't no need to back track I don't want to look back.
Now we've really got it made.
Think I'll just stay right here in the good old days.

I know all about a hard day's labor.
This ain't work
It's like picking out a flavor at the ice cream shop,
The brunette or the redhead. I'm here singing on the local motion. I ain't getting rich
But I'm down by the ocean doing what I want
And right now it's the good old days.

Chorus

When we get old we're gonna talk about the good times;
Fat and happy, spreading rumors through the grapevines. With any luck, we'll still be up to our old ways.
But, we're still living where the music got the mojo.
I know one day you're gonna hear it on the radio.
Call it what you want
But to me it's the good old days.




",Good Old Days
Roger Creager,"I left a note on her pillow, 
kissed her check and slipped off into the wind. 
All she wanted to know last night was when she'd see me again. 
If I only knew myself then maybe I could say, 
But my empty promises would only fade away into 

[Chorus]
Gypsyland, 
Where the wheels never stop turning. 
Gypsyland, 

Where the fires never stop burning. 
Though it's hard to understand, 
and girl though I'd love to be your man, 
I'm lost out here in Gypsyland. 
Once I held a woman or should I say she once held me. 
Before I knew I could only live a life that's wild and free. 
These days I search the Texas sky
for one bright star to tell me if there's still a chance 
Or if I've gone too far into

It's OK to lose control now and then.

Always has been. 
Make you laugh and cry and stay up all night.

The neighbor's patience is wearing thin.
'Cause we live our lives too loud.

I was waiting on someone who would love me 
The way you do; holding on for dear life. 
You loved me and didn't think twice 

About the rough and rocky road that I've been through. 
I was waiting on you. 
When you're just a boy, love's a simple thing. 
It's not supposed to hurt. 

It's a push on a playground swing. 
I'm just a man trying to figure out 
What the hell you see in me 
With all this hurt I'm carrying around.

I was waiting on someone who would love me

Oh you might think your small
With your back to a wall
Oh you might think your sad
When you've been hurt so bad.

But when somebody cares for you
Someone who shares
Your not near to surrender anymore.

So near, So near to surrender
Your futures, your futures unknown
But don't you surrender.

You fought, you fought for long
Theirs always a face
Waiting to take your place.

Theirs always a clown
Working on your lonely frown

But they don't believe,
But it's me who's standing there.

Proud, that it makes me proud.

Years don't mean a thing
In fact it fills my mind with pride

To find someone who knows
And understands my mind

You can try to better me

And the avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to her name
The avenger she became. 

Well they call her avenging Annie

He was the best thing she ever did seen
She was to be his wife for the rest of her life,
But she was so blind she could never had seen.
No! 

So she joined up with her outlaw
And headed for California. 

He treated her worse than she'd ever imagined
He didn't say he didn't want her around
He kept it up so long, she couldn't be strong
He run her right into the ground. 

After five long years,
He picked her up and slapped her down. 

Then she told her friends about him
They all were on her side
But she could see through the haze he looked so pale
She put her head right down and she cried. 

For her poor lover
She cried like a mother for her poor lover. 

And now she lives on a mountain top
And she's almost thirty-five
And she's found her peace and found her release
Happy  just to be alive.

Can't you see, I'm willing to try to Love it is, oh so near enough
It's all for sale, I'm willing to cry

All of you, But how can I get enough
More I need, To satisfy Furthermore, never could mean a lot
Just tell me now, I wanna know why

More or less, To do or die Well there it is, Strange but true or not

Can you hear that sound
It's all around you and me
There's a voice
It searched and found you
What can it be?
It's like thunder and lightning
Speaking your name
And this man of fire
Could be burnt in the flame
You know what you do
What you do-

Chorus
You're breaking down paradise
And I'm the one who pays the price
Any way I play or lose
Any way that I throw the dice
You're breaking down paradise
You're breaking down paradise

You walk away
And turned the day
Into night
The cold and lonely night
Out of the silence
There's a hurricane
And all around me
It's burning again
It's burning again and again

It's like thunder and lightning
Speaking your name
And this man of fire
Could be burnt in the flame
You know what you do

Roger Daltrey,"My time is wasting, feel I'm moving too slow
Can't get my pedal to the metal but I'm ready to go
Life in the fast lane, there's trouble ahead
I better move over, you're a long time dead

I'm chasing rainbows in the cold light of day
It feels like I'm wasting my lifetime away
Breaking the limits, bending the rules
Can't stand standing still, but speed is for fools

But I move better in the night
I won't stop until the day light
It makes me feel right
I move better in the night

Out on the freeway, everybody pays
I throw in my money or I'm waiting for days

Roger Daltrey,"I made my way back to the old town
And everything looked the same
The shops and the schools and the factories were there
But somehow the faces had changed
So I went for a walk in the high streets
Took my coat off and rolled up my sleeves
I thought of my father and his father before him
And how I was the first one to leave

Well I didn't come here for forgiveness
There isn't a lot I can say
'cause I remember the reasons I first ran away

I'm a rebel

Don't ever look back - don't surrender

Oh they drink their beer and they talk about friends
Who didn't come back from the war

Don't say I'm too young to remember
Don't tell me what's wrong or what's right
Just give me a chance to go out there and fight

Just a rebel
Got my back to the wall
Gonna fight 'til I fall

Roger Daltrey,"In the searchlights
You could see us as you circled round
Down below us you were screaming
I could hear the sound
I could see your arms reaching up to me
Like a demon, I could feel the madness
Running through the crowd
We were freedom
From the moment that we hit the ground
And the wild man, he laid the thunder down.

Do you remember me, like I remember you
In a sea of hands you came shining through
In the mist of time I can see it now
All my life I will remember this (under a raging moon)
For this moment I was born for it (under a raging moon)
Under a raging moon, we were flying there
Under a raging moon, we saw Zion there
It ended all too soon, under a raging moon

We were out there
When they handed us the rebel's crown
All the headlines
All they tried to do was tear us down
But the wild man, he didn't fool around

Do you remember me, cause I remember you
Yeah you won my love, when the dream came true
When my blood ran high, I can hear it now
All my life I will remember it (under a raging moon)
For this moment I was born for it (under a raging moon)
Under a raging moon, we were flying boy
Under a raging moon, it's worth dying for
It ended all too soon, under a raging moon

Taking me back to better times
We never read the danger signs
Why are the young, why are the young so blind?

Roger Daltrey,"When the lights are down and there's no one there
You can hear the sound of the rockin' chair
Rocking in the dark, feel it in the air
Searching for the spark of love affair
The world keeps on turning, every night and every day
The fire keeps on burning calling to say

I'm alone in the night, the silence in the shadows, alone in the night
A heart where no one goes, alone in the night
A sprint that the wind blows, alone in the night
The face sitting in the window, I'm alone in the night

When the lights go down on another day
Darkness all around as the angels play
Watch the falling stars as they cross the sky
They're so near, so far, they're the tears I cry
I hear the voices calling of lovers in the night
I feel the rain is falling blinded by light

I'm alone in the night, the silence in the shadows, alone in the night

Roger Daltrey,"It isn't easy to stay when your friends tell you go
When your heart tells you 'yes' but your head tells you no
And though we searched for a compromise
Looked in each other's eyes for answers
The die had been cast we were all out
Of last second chances

And the heart has its reasons, I know
A time and a season an ebb and a flow
You were waving goodbye I was saying hello
I don't understand it
But the heart has its reasons, I know

And who knows why it went wrong between you and me
Suddenly we weren't the people that we used to be
I was building a bridge between as
You were building a wall
And the whole thing crumbled and tumbled
In the eye of the storm

And the heart has its reasons, I know
A time and a season an ebb and a flow
You were waving goodbye I was saying hello

Roger Daltrey,"It was the summer of sixty-four
We ran the streets on to the shore
And in every game we played we knew we had it made
Like no other time before.
I was just a man
You were still a child
Two hearts that were running wild
There was no need to pretend
You became more than a friend
They were days without an end.
We laughed where we played
We made love where we laid
In the light again we'd run.
When the night called the tune
We'd shoot at the moon
And laugh at what we'd done.
We were hearts of fire
Do you remember it
My friend
We didn't think that it would end.
Together then we ran
This boy became a man.
They burn on those hearts of fire
They burn on those hearts of fire
Hearts of fire!
And by seventy-two I was running free
It was just the way I wanted to be
I thought I'd left our love for dead
But my heart it ruled my head
And I fell in love instead!
We fought where we played
We made love where we laid
Just like the time before.
And if the battle should start to tear us apart
We won't go to war no more.
We were hearts of fire
Do you remember it
My friend
We didn't think that it would end.
Together then we ran
Turn a boy into a man.

They burn on those hearts of fire
They burn on those hearts of fire

Although you're far away from me, I feel you still
Down a dark and dusty road miles away from home
Can you hear me calling you, you're not alone
Then your voice rings in my ear just like a vision
Suddenly your face appears

I feel the miracle of love
Lifting me up each and every day
Like a beacon in the night
Your guiding light shows me the way

Through the best and worst of times you've stood right by me
My comfort and protection in adversity
And I don't know how to thank you for these
Golden days we've known
I guess I'll just have to love you more than I've ever done

And out of the darkness
Suddenly your face appears

I feel the miracle of love
Lifting me up each and every day

And it keeps on getting better
As we walk these steps in time together

Then off in the distance

Roger Daltrey,"I've been thinking about the time that we're spending here
Refuges in a world gone cold
The voice of reason can't seem to find a listening ear
The vote is out, the bell still tolls
I can't shake this feeling, we're crawling closer to the edge

Yet we still go out, walk about, chit and chatter
Let the problems of the world go by
I don't really want to wake up to the pitter patter
Of little bombs falling from the sky

Tell me I'm not right
Tell me that there isn't any danger
Tell me in the dark of the night

When the thunder comes
From distant drums
The winds will blow
The dreams of man into the indigo

There's got to be a way to stop it, stop it
'Cause there's no turning back once we cross that line
And all your money in the right pocket can't buy you any time
A chilling wind feels so near, will I live to meet my darkest fears'

When the thunder comes
From distant drums
The winds will blow

And the fall of mighty lands

Before I get my share, before I walk alone
Before they take away my last temptation
Before my heart's deprived, before they call my name

On the back fences of my dream line

To get away with the whole damn big bang
For the right reasons, for what you can't take back

Until the drums stop beating
Until the crossroads burn out

And even if I can't get justice

Beyond the empty eyes, beyond the wasted land

Oh I can't take too much more

Is it just an illusion

And it's more than just pain
I can't help myself

And just forget about tomorrow
No one listens to what I am saying
I'm just a sad man another sad man
They say I'm no bad man
But I'm no bad man

Wasted - wasted
All my life's been wasted
Sitting here in this room
I can never feel warm
I can get no release
It's all war and no peace

If I could see you through the wire
And just forget about tomorrow
Someone listen to what I am saying
I'm just a sad man another sad man.

And then the sound of a breaking window and the scream of a tire
And then the sound of a distant gun and the cry of a hungry child
The night is hot
But nothing's gonna stop
This gang going wild

After the fire the fire still burns
The heart grows older but never ever learns
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns
After the fire the fire still burns

I saw Matt Dillon in black and white there ain't no colour in memories
He rode his brother's Harley across the TV while I was laughing at Dom deLuise.
Now I'm cycling all my video tapes, I'm crying and I'm joking
I've gotta stop drinking
I've gotta stop thinking
I've gotta stop smoking

After the fire the fire still burns
The heart grows older but never ever learns
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns
After the fire the fire still burns

The fire still burns, raging through the pain
Blackening the promises the tears and the rain
The fire will burn
'Til the wind begins to turn
And it all begins again

After the fire the fire still burns
The heart grows older but never ever learns
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns
After the fire the fire still burns",After the Fire
Roger Daltrey,"Imagine a man
Not a child in any remote
But a plain man tied up in lies

Imagine the son
Running out as he struts
Parading and fading ignoring his wife

Imagine a road
So long looking back 
But you can't really see where it began to run out

Imagine a love
So large and so smooth
With against it all manners of that

And you will see the end
You will see the end
Oh lord

Imagine events
That occur everyday
Like a shooting or raping
Or a simple act of deceit

Imagine a fence
Around you as high as prudential
Cast two shadow's who can't see or feel

Imagine a girl
With long flowing hair
And her body all trouble, perfection and truth

Imagine a past
That you wish you had lived
Full of heroes and villain's and fools
And you will see the end
You will see the end

You will see the end

Not a child of any remote
But a man of today

So old and its broken

Roger Daltrey,"Can you see the real me, can ya, can ya,
I went back to the doctor
To get another shrink
I sit and tell him 'bout my weekend
But he never betrays what he thinks

Can you see the real me doctor?

I went back to my mother
I said I'm crazy ma help me
She said I know how it feels son
'cause it runs in the family
Can you see the real me mother?

The cracks between the paving stones
Like rivers of flowing veins
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane
The girl I used to love
Lives in this yellow house
Yesterday she passed me by
She doesn't want to know me now
Can you see the real me, can you?

I ended up with the preacher
Full of lies and hate
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate
Can you see the real me, preacher?

Can you see the real me, me, me, me",The Real Me
Roger Daltrey,"I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""

I staggered back to the underground
You know the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

Who are you?
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I said
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really wanna know
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

Took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rollin' Pin
Feel a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin

I stretched back and I hiccupped
Looked back on my busy day
I was Eleven hours in the Tin Can
There's got to be better way

(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
You know I really need to know
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

Let me tell you who I am, I am the man
That is scared of concrete for you I have a plan
I put my money in the bank, I don't keep it in my hand
And sometimes it all goes wrong I make a stand

Whenever, I walk down the street I feel afraid
People want there money cause they want to get paid
All I want is a little love and to live my life
And all I want for return is my very own wife

Why do people in red? Who are you who do you fear?
When I take this knife and in your eyes I sneer
When I look at the people who came from the sixties
Up through the nineties now we reach this pentacle

Understand that the reason to exist
Is that life is something that you live have to persist
Who could just forget the place where we came
My name is Pete Townshend we want you just the same

Who are you? Who who who who are you?
Who are you?

I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
You know I only feel right on my knees

I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really wanna know?
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I can just remember about who I am

Roger Daltrey,"Well I saw you on the avenue
And as usual you're with someone new
I guess there's nothing left for me to do but turn away
I'm growing tired of all your alibis
There ain't one you can justify
I ain't gonna take it anymore and I'll tell you why

You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time you got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy

We've been going through some changes
And I'm well aware of all the dangers
Sometimes you look at me and it leaves me cold
But now you've gone and blown your covers
I know all about your temporary lovers
I ain't taking it another day and that's for sure

You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time you got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy

Oh when I look at you now
I can't believe you're leaving
All those years and you've got nothing to say
Turn around and walk away

You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time you got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy

Roger Daltrey,"The silence is saying there's trouble ahead
The pressure speaks louder than words
It feels like we're hanging on by a thread day to day
The closer we get seems we're further apart

Let's back off before it's too late
Since we know each other's lives by heart anyway
We've come so damn far and been through it all
It's hard to turn 'round with your back to the wall
And the tears rain down

It's a lover's storm
When the lightning strikes and the pain is born
Feels like another lover's storm
When the heat of the night keeps our emotions warm
It's a lover's storm

We've got to give in, try to work it out
This whole thing's dragged on for so long
But I forgot what we're fighting about anymore
Now I just don't know how much I can take
I'm bending so far, feels like I'm gonna break
And the tears rain down",Lover's Storm
Roger Daltrey,"I came through today
At the back of a street parade
And their I am, right side of your TV screen
Slightly out of focus
But unmistakably serene
Never made the big time
But I was in that scene.

Oh I was thinking about in films
How in no time so it seems
The hero meet his princess
The king found his queen
But in real life
There's only in between
I've never been a hero
But I was in that scene.

Hollywood exist still
Cause there's a sign upon the hill
We buy the maps, and make the tours
To touch the world of, motion, pictures.

So here I am
Until the good time end to be
I've never made the big time

To touch the world of, motion, pictures.

A star died today
And they had a little street parade
And all the other stars turned out
To say how nice he'd been
Someone at the back
Flowing with the stream
Never made the headlines
But I was in that scene.

Roger Daltrey,"I'm not the kind of guy to let jealousy
Break me up inside
I've got no time for sympathy
That girl she's just a memory
Over which I'll glide 

Some say that I shouldn't care
That I should celebrate now she's out of my hair
But Lord knows, the pride you hide
Hanging around the same old parts
And driving in the same old cars
With the same old friends
Those weekends I spent on my own
At first I found it hard alone
Now I'm on the mend
A voice tells me that I was such a fool
to throw away everything I had with you
but Lord knows, the pride you hide 
When you're breaking up inside
Lord knows, the pride you hide 

Chorus 

The pride you hide, when you're breaking up inside
Every single day sees this man break down and cry
Try and find the strength to make it through the day
Try and find the strength to say come back and stay
And all my emotions lying in the snow
We're walking down the streets where the two of used to go
Somewhere over there from the door of a street cafe
I hear that old blues guitar play 

I found some things of yours today
An old guitar you used to play
Threw 'em all away
They took me to another place
I smelt your perfume saw your face
With your hair that way
All that happened was a stupid mistake
I acted like a fool now it's too late
I'm another lonely guy with no heart for forgiving
Without you around, I find it so hard living.

Roger Daltrey,"In the searchlights
You could see us as you circled round
Down below us you were screaming
I could hear the sound
I could see your arms reaching up to me
Like a demon, I could feel the madness
Running through the crowd
We were freedom
From the moment that we hit the ground
And the wild man, he laid the thunder down.

Do you remember me, like I remember you
In a sea of hands you came shining through
In the mist of time I can see it now
All my life I will remember this (under a raging moon)
For this moment I was born for it (under a raging moon)
Under a raging moon, we were flying there
Under a raging moon, we saw Zion there
It ended all too soon, under a raging moon

We were out there
When they handed us the rebel's crown
All the headlines
All they tried to do was tear us down
But the wild man, he didn't fool around

Do you remember me, cause I remember you
Yeah you won my love, when the dream came true
When my blood ran high, I can hear it now
All my life I will remember it (under a raging moon)
For this moment I was born for it (under a raging moon)
Under a raging moon, we were flying boy
Under a raging moon, it's worth dying for
It ended all too soon, under a raging moon

We never read the danger signs

Roger Daltrey,"Lookin' 'round at all the faces
I can see they're all the same
Drifting shadows on the sidewalk Slowly walking in the rain
The moon     shines down     she sees       she knows
And I            follow             Through rain         and sun
But you see I'm walking in my sleep
And I don't know how I got here
And when I try to keep the beat, you see I'm walking in my sleep
Didn't know that I was dreaming
Sunny days come out of midnight
In the darkness of the evening Running softly from the light
The moon Shines down She sees she knows
The star  the end  The tide  the flow
The night  so black it looks  so real
Am I   awake   Or am I dreaming still
But you see I'm walking in my sleep
And I don't know how I got here
And though I try to keep the beat, you see I'm walking in my sleep
And through this nightmare  The dream  unfolds
I'm by  a window  The night so cold
My mind  my body  My room  this heat
A drain   is pouring  Into the street",Walking in My Sleep
Roger Daltrey,"No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man behind blue eyes
No one knows what it's like
To be hated, to be fated to telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings like I do and I blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

Roger Daltrey,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

I thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
To him!
To him!",Pinball Wizard

All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye (Pops)
Roger Girke,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September

Say a prayer for the lost and the broken down
It don't matter where you come from
You will end up being from the wrong town

Just to have me a drink and look around
I went back with Deacon's daughter
She was looking for a way to get out of town

Everything gonna be alright
And the sun's gonna shine tonight
Everybody gonna come my way
And we'll understand it all one day

He was drinking red liquor from the floorboard
Said he used to have a daughter
Now he don't want to think about it any more

We went flying down a two lane
God knows why we didn't see the bridge out
She went down in yellow water
Now it's all in the world I can think about

I had a dream
It didn't make no sense

Mary, can you hear me
Can you tell me what it's all supposed to mean
Holding out a photograph of all that I have seen
I wish I could hold you
I wish I could hold you

Had a dream it was time
To be a witness at the scene of the crime
Well, That is something you can analyse
Something you can criticise, who knows
So we wait, hesitate
And we're making such a mistake
Oh whatever can the matter be

In jeopardy, in jeopardy - it's getting so out of hand
In jeopardy, in jeopardy - I wish I could understand

Who's in your mind, who's in your conscience?
Part of the crime, part of the nonsense

Roger Hodgson,"Time is always on the run
We've only just begun
Lovers in the wind

Life is all we have to share
You know we must take care
Lovers in the wind

There was a time when it was hard to know
Reaching out, reaching out for somewhere to go
There was a light born on the darkest day
But no one wants to know
And no one wants to try

Love is all I have to give
It's all I need to live
Lovers in the wind

There was a time when it was hard to know
Reaching out, reaching out for somewhere to go
There was a light born on the darkest day
But no one wants to know
And no one wants to cry

Time is always on the run
We've only just begun
Lovers in the wind",Lovers in the Wind
Roger Hodgson,"And so we sail towards the dawn, joining those who gently mourn for you
It's only because of you
Friends may come and friends may go, the only friend I need to know is you
It's only because of you
Mighty castles, lonely kings, hear the ragged children sing it's you
It's only because of you
He who smiles at lofty schemes, stems the tide of broken dreams is you
It's only because of you

And when the storms have died away, only truth will live to say it's you
It's only because of you
And when the darkness flies away, only love will shine to say it's true
It's only because of you",Only Because of You
Roger Hodgson,"It's feeling like it's time to ring the changes
It's feeling like it's time to be reborn
'Cause here we go again, proclaiming it's the end
We're reaching out for something to bring it back again
We're living on good fortune, we're cheating all our friends
So tell me, oh tell me, now where's it going to end
I hope it's not too late to see the danger
I'd really like to wake and see the dawn
'Cause here we go again, we're trying to pretend
We're blaming one another for what is ours to mend
We're fighting for the future, we're ringin' out the past
It feels good, it feels good but is it going to last

[Chorus]
Give me love, give me love, give me joy, give me pain
Give me light, give me starting again
Give me hope, give me hope, give me sun, give me rain
Get me up, get me dancing again
Give me life, give me life, give me high, give me low
Give me truth give me something to know
Give me time, give me time, give me room, give me rope
Give me sign, give me reason to hope

'Cause everything is a turn up, turnaround
And everything is upside, upside-down
Well everything's not like you'd like it to be
Everything is a two-bit, two-bit town
And everybody's just out to drag you down
Well nothing is as you'd like it, like it to be

Well everything is a turn up, turnaround
And everything is upside, upside-down
Well everything's not like you'd like it to be
Everything is a two-bit, two-bit town
And everybody's just out to drag you down
Well nothing is as you'd like it, like it to be

I may not love you, but I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Things just ain't what they used to","Give Me Love, Give Me Life"
Roger Hodgson,"Had a dream
I was born
Took me naked in the eye of the storm
And now it's standing right in front of me
What's it gonna do to me?
Who knows?

Had a dream 
It was time
To be taken to the front of a line
Well, that is not a place you want to be

I don't care
What the future brings
Give a damn 
About anything
I'd be fine
If they'd only leave me alone

But it's time
Gotta take a stance 
'Cause I won't
Get a second chance
And I know
Now I have to make it alone

Had a dream
It was war
And they couldn't tell me what it was for
But it was something they could lie about
Something we could die about
You know

Anytime
Anyplace
When you look that man in the face
Well, it is not a face you want to see
Sleeping with the enemy
You know

Mary, can you hear me?
Can you tell me what it's all supposed to mean?
Holding out a photograph of all that I have seen
I wish I could hold you
I wish I could hold you

Had a dream 
It was time
To be a witness at the scene of the crime
Well, that is something you can analyze
Something you can criticize
Who knows?

So we wait
Hesitate
And we're making such a mistake
Oh, whatever can the matter be?
Sleeping with the enemy
You know

I don't care
What the future brings
Give a damn 
About anything

Roger Hodgson,"Did I tell you I need your love a little more each day
Did I tell you I'm feeling old since you went away
Did I tell you my love was cold like the desert night
Did I tell you my heart was dry like the desert sky

Oh, will you love me again, won't you help out a friend
Will you love me again

Did I tell you my lips were cold like the desert night

Roger Hodgson,"The sun goes up, the son goes down, and still my life is just spinning around
It builds me up, it drags me down, and keeps me looking for some solid ground

The game is up, the die is cast, this roller-coaster may well be your last

Won't you love me like no body ever did before

The road is long, the climb is steep, and ghosts and goblins never seem to sleep
The storm has gone, the sky is clear
But there ain't no courage when there ain't no fear
So get away, oh get away

The sun goes up, the sun goes down, and this old world is still spinning around
It fills me up, it drags me down, and keeps me looking for some solid ground

Roger Hodgson,"There's a house on the corner, lives a man who went to war
And it tries to give him shelter from the pain of what he saw
There's a child out the window painting faces in the snow
And they smile a sad reminder of a life he used to know

There's a house on the corner, lives a man with empty eyes
For his heart has been broken for he was sold a pack of lies

Hold me closer (you know I can't)
Hold me closer (but you don't understand)
Hold me closer, open your heart
Hold me closer (I'm so alone)
Hold me closer (Oh you'll never know)
Hold me closer, open your heart

For he fought for his country, now he fights to clear his name
For the dead are always heroes and the living live in shame

And he said
Hold me closer (you know I can't)
Hold me closer (but you don't understand)
Hold me closer, open your heart
Hold me closer (I'm so alone)
Hold me closer (Oh you'll never know)

Roger Hodgson,"Please don't turn me away, please don't leave me alone

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh I gotta find some shelter from the cold
Land-ho, will I be searching forever
Oh-oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul

Well you may think I'm a fool, and think I'm running away
But I've had enough of the city lights, oh I've got no reason to stay

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh I need some wind to help me to my goal
Land-ho, will I be searching forever
Oh-oh, I gotta find an anchor for my soul

When you're alone there's not a sail in sight
Oh it's cold and dark and there's no one there to see you through the night
There once was a lady made me feel alright
But she couldn't stay so one lonely day, she just sailed away
And took away my life

Maybe I'll always be sad, and maybe there'll always be strife
Drifting alone with a saddened tone, afloat on the ocean of life

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh sometimes I feel my ship is getting old
Land-ho, will I be dreaming forever
Oh-oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul

You're never gonna see, you're never gonna see me crying

What I would give just to hear you laugh, but all I have left is just a photograph

Does it feel that your life's
Become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be for you to grow, boy

And when you look through the years
And see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been

Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy

Why is each new task a trifle to do?

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Roger McGuinn,"Seventeen feet across 
Of the hardest oak to be found
Cut to the shape of the Sun and the Moon
Shine the color of ale
And the knights of the Living Cross 
Gathered all around
Raise their goblets and drink a toast
To the search for the Holy Grail
 
There was one well known for charity
And whose voice was gruff
And one who wielded a deadly sword
With the finest lace on his cuff
There was talk about a fearful ghost
The bastard son if a King
Who died at the knee of his lordly host
You could hear his armor ring
Still hear his armor ring
 
Pure in heart and mind, 
The key to all you seek
Those were the words of the Mighty King
As he looked deep into their eyes
The best of you have wined and dined
You're treacherous when you speak
You look for a way to seal your faith
But you find a compromise
 
You have raised your voice in vanity
You have turned your back on the poor
You have closed your heart to the written word
You defend the evil-doer
Now the time is come to clean your minds
If the good is to prevail
I offer this emerald to the one who finds
Our Saviour's Holy Grail
Our Saviour's Holy Grail
 
Banners in the sky, armor gleaming in the sun
The sounds of the horses, trumpets and drums
As they marched for the countryside
And the villagers they rode 
Be were silent everyone
Frightened mothers closed their shades
And they made their daughters hide
 
And then they came upon a community
On a quiet Summer's day
But these travelers to Jerusalem
Saw nothing in their way
And before the night fell on that town
They had crucified the Priest
They robbed and pillaged and burned it down
And kept headin' toward the East
They kept headin' toward the East
 
Came to Israel stood shimmering in the sand
Thirsty men could close their eyes 
And see the milk and honey flow
The blood of the Infidel 
Still fresh upon their hands
They knocked the ancient doorway down
Like the walls of a Jericho
And they thanked their Christianity
For the Temple they had seized
And though no one found the Holy Grail
The Mighty King was pleased
For he had changed the face of history
And a legend had begun
And little children were taught to see how
The Good Lord's work is done
And little children were taught to see how
The Good Lord's work is done

It's a long way from bow chains

Black babies covered in baking flour
The cook's got a carnival song
Lay down someplace shady
With Dreamland coming on

Dreamland, dream on Dreamland

Walter Raleigh, Chris Columbus
Come a-marchin' out of the waves
And they claim the beach and concessions
In the name of the sun-tan slaves
I wrapped their flag around me
Like an Errol Flynn sarong
And I laid down thinking national
With Dreamland coming on

Goodtime Mary and the lady soldiers
Talking over a glass of rum
Burning on the inside
With a knowledge of things to come
There's gambling out on the terrace
Midnight rambling on the lawn
As they lean towards temptation
With Dreamland coming on

In a plane flying back to winter
With shoes full of tropic sand
There comes a lady in a foreign flag
On the arm of her Marlboro man
The hawk howls in New York City
Six-foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn
As they push the recline buttons down
With Dreamland coming on

On the sun on the Amazon

Roger McGuinn,"Stone love, she kneels before the grave
A brave son, who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love, a boy and girl they talking
New words, that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep, through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing, sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love, and how my God on high is
All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

Love is careless in its choosing, sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

Roger McGuinn,"Smoky autumn night, 
Stars up in the sky,
I see the sailin' boats 
Across the bay go by.
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And then I turn my head, 
For you're approachin' me.
Moonlight on the water, 
Fisherman's daughter, 
Floatin' in to my room
With a golden loom.

First we wash our feet 
Near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet 
And then we drink the wine.
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, 
What a bitter taste.
And then you drift away 
On a summer's day where 
The wildflowers bloom 
With your golden loom.

I walk across the bridge 
In the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped 
Between the gates of night.
I see the trembling lion 
With the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips 
As I lift your veil.
But you're gone and then 
All I seem to recall 
Is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom.",Golden Loom

Draggin' draggin' cross the U.S.A.
Draggin' draggin' from New York to L.A.

It's tougher on the people riding back in coach
But I've got to beat my buddy to the final approach
Now we're both into the pattern and we're cleared to land
If I touch her down before him I'll collect a grand
The flaps are all secured and now we're homing in
And my 747 baby's gonna win

Roger McGuinn,"It's a long long way to Canada
It's a long way from bow chains
Donkey venders slicing coconut
No parkas to their name
Black babies covered in baking flour
The cook's got a carnival song
Lay down someplace shady
With Dreamland coming on

Dreamland, dream on Dreamland

Walter Raleigh, Chris Columbus
Come a-marchin' out of the waves
And they claim the beach and concessions
In the name of the sun-tan slaves
I wrapped their flag around me
Like an Errol Flynn sarong
And I laid down thinking national
With Dreamland coming on

Goodtime Mary and the lady soldiers
Talking over a glass of rum
Burning on the inside
With a knowledge of things to come
There's gambling out on the terrace
Midnight rambling on the lawn
As they lean towards temptation
With Dreamland coming on

In a plane flying back to winter
With shoes full of tropic sand
There comes a lady in a foreign flag
On the arm of her Marlboro man
The hawk howls in New York City
Six-foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn
As they push the recline buttons down
With Dreamland coming on

African sand on the Trade Winds
On the sun on the Amazon
As they lean towards temptation
With Dreamland coming on",Dreamland
Roger McGuinn,"Goin' to the Gate of Horn
In my memory
Red light flickerin' on the tablecloth
Big, dark beer in front of me

How I wish that I was there
Standin' at the bar
Listenin' to Mr. Gibson play
On his fine guitar

It's a big old twelve-string
And it went like this
Gate of Horn, Gate of Horn
Glad I was Chicago born
Gate of Horn
Meant everythin' to me

I was barely seventeen
Little salty and a little green
Gate of Horn meant everythin' to me

Once in a while they'd play a jig
There was Judy and Peter and Josh and
Odetta
The Clancies and Mary and Paul made it better
Grossman and Tommy and Dickie and Lou
And when one was looking
McGuinn was there too

Then they came and tore it down
Songbirds scattered and we all left town

A farmer, a cowhand, an old country boy
To get up in the a.m. and tend to the chore
And leave all my troubles behind a locked door
Layin' with my lady and strummin' on my toy
Oh I know what you mean and it sounds good to me
But oh Mr.D. I'm so restless

Hey Mr.L. so you want me to yell
To howl at the moon when I'm losin' my grip
Without no possesions and findin' myself

But I'm still payin' dues for that Indian trip
And I know what you mean and it sure rings a bell
But oh Mr.L. I'm so restless

Hey Mr.J. you want me to stray
To be a bad boy a mean boy and ready to kill
Wrigglin' and slinkin' in snakeskin and black
Holdin' my thumb on some chick in the sack
And never say no if it gives me a thrill

Our homeland far behind us
Being junted by the King's Navy
It's sure he'd never find us

We brought her into the looward wind
And made for the Caribbean
For thoughts of what it might have been
Destroys a human bein'

But thoughts about the Spaniards' gold
And learnin' to desire it
Can make a man so brash and bold
He'll soon become a pirate
Pull away, me lads o' the Cardiff Rose
And hoist the Jolly Roger

Now a gleam came into the Captain's eyes
As he spied an English clipper
""She looks the perfect shape and size
Let's all aboard and strip her""

We fired a shot across her bow
And eased ourselves beside her
With our keels as close as she'd allow
We swung from the deck to ride her
Pull away, me lads o' the Cardiff Rose
And hoist the Jolly Roger

Up she stumbles and starts to pitch
And signals for assistance
We tightened our hold another hitch
And ended her resistance

Now there's many a day on the Spanish sea
I served aboard that raider
But we never did nothing more beautifully
Than the way that we belayed her
Pull away, me lads o' the Cardiff Rose
And hoist the Jolly Roger

Her hold was hot as St.Elmo's fire
Her chests were filled with treasure
We took as much as we'd require
Then took more for our pleasure

I started thinkin' 'bout Russian Hill
And Ferlinghetti with his Coney Island mind
And you and me with some time to fill

We ate in Chinatown, we rode the cable car
We did what tourists always do
But in the dream you were a movie star
And I was someone too

Was that the two of us in love
Why did it end so soon
I don't believe in fallin' out of love
I never met the man in the moon
If it's so hard to find the key
It's not the singer, it's the tune

We walked the beach around Monterey
True Confessions in a Sausalito bar
The windows shinin' across the bay

The age of innocence and searchin' 
In the dark for what we'd never seen
And we could taste the sweetness 
Of our lives in bitter mescaline

Was that the two of us in love

The time was right for the music to begin
You shoulda been there when

There were ladies ridin' bareback 
And the mystery man
All painted like a clown

Like I never felt before
Flashin up New England skies  
Like the fires of the revoluntionary war
You shoulda heard the music comin' down 
Like the hardest rain that ever fell

Roger McGuinn,"Everythin' went from bad to worse, 
Money never changed a thing,
Death kept followin', trackin' us down, 
At least I heard your bluebird sing.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, 
Time is an enemy,
I know you're long gone,
I guess it must be up to me.

If I'd thought about it 
I never would've done it, 
I guess I would've let it slide,
If I'd lived my life 
By what others were thinkin', 
The heart inside me would've died.
I was just too stubborn 
To ever be governed 
By enforced insanity,
Someone had to reach 
For the risin' star,
I guess it was up to me.

Oh, the Union Central is pullin' out 
And the orchids are in bloom,
I've only got me 
One good shirt left 
And it smells of stale perfume.
In fourteen months 
I've only smiled once 
And I didn't do it consciously,
Somebody's got to find your trail,
I guess it must be up to me.

It was like a revelation 
When you betrayed me with your touch,
I'd just about convinced myself 
That nothin' had changed that much.
The old Rounder in the iron mask 
Slipped me the master key,
Somebody had to unlock your heart,
He said it was up to me.

Well, I watched you slowly disappear 
Down into the officers' club,
I would've followed you in the door 
But I didn't have a ticket stub.
So I waited all night 
'Til the break of day, 
Hopin' one of us could get free,
When the dawn came over the river bridge,
I knew it was up to me.

Oh, the only decent thing I did 
When I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall 
Near the cage where I used to work.
Was I a fool or not 
To try to protect your identity?
You looked a little 
Burned out, my friend,
I thought it might be up to me.

Well, I met somebody face to face 
And I had to remove my hat,
She's everything I need and love 
But I can't be swayed by that.
It frightens me, 
The awful truth of 
How sweet life can be,
But she ain't a-gonna make me move,
I guess it must be up to me.

We heard the Sermon on the Mount 
And I knew it was too complex,
It didn't amount to anything more 
Than what the broken glass reflects.
When you bite off more 
Than you can chew 
You pay the penalty,
Somebody's got to tell the tale,
I guess it must be up to me.

Well, Dupree came in pimpin' tonight 
To the Thunderbird Cafe,
Crystal wanted to talk to him, 
I had to look the other way.
Well, I just can't rest 
Without you, love, 
I need your company,
But you ain't a-gonna cross the line,
I guess it must be up to me.

There's a note left in the bottle, 
You can give it to Estelle,
She's the one 
You been wond'rin' about, 
But there's really 
Nothin' much to tell.
We both heard voices for a while, 
Now the rest is history,
Somebody's got to cry some tears,
I guess it must be up to me.

So go on, boys, and play your hands, 
Life is a pantomime,
The ringleaders 
From the county seat 
Say you don't have all that much time.
And the girl with me 
Behind the shades, 
She ain't my property,
One of us has got to hit the road,
I guess it must be up to me.

And if we never meet again, 
Baby, remember me,
How my lone guitar 
Played sweet for you 
That old-time melody.
And the harmonica around my neck, 
I blew it for you, free,
No one else could play that tune,
You know it was up to me.",Up to Me

And neither have I wings to fly 
Build me a boat that can carry two 
And both shall roam my love and I 

A ship there is and she sails the sea 
Sailing as deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I am in 
I know not how I sink or swim 

I leaned my back against some young oak  
Thinking that he was a trusty tree 
But first he bent and then he broke 
And thus did my false love and me

Roger McGuinn,"Always alone
Never with a herd
Prettiest mare I've ever seen
You'll have to take my word

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand

Well I was up on Stony Ridge
After this chestnut mare, been chasing her for weeks
Oh I'd catch a glimpse of her every once in a while
Taking her meal, bathing, fine lady
This one day I happen to be real close to her 
And I saw her standing over there
So I snuck up on her nice and easy
Got my rope out
And I flung it in the air!

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

And I got her and I'm pulling on her
And she's pulling back like this mule going up a ladder
And I take a choice and I jump right up on her
Damned if I don't land right on top of her
And she takes off, running up onto the ridge 
Higher than I've ever been before
She's running along just fine
'Til she stops and something spooked her
It's a sidewinder, all coiled and ready to strike
She doesn't know what to do for a second
But then, she jumps off the edge, me holding on

Above the hills, higher than eagles were gliding
Suspended in the sky
Over the hill
Straight for the sun we were riding
My eyes were filled with light
Behind those black walls
Below was a bottomless canyon
Floating with no sound
Ghosts far below 
Seemed to be suddenly rising
Exploding all around

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

We were falling 
Down this crevice 
About about a mile down it seem
And I looked down 
And I see this red thing below us coming up real fast
And it's our reflection that's 
This little pool of water about six feet wide and one foot deep
And we're falling down right through it
We hit, we splashed it dry
That's when I lost my hold 
And she got away
But I'm gonna try and get her again some day

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife

Roger McGuinn,"Eight miles high and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own

Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town known for it's sound
In places small faces unbound

Round the squares huddled in storms
Some laughing some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes and black limousines
Some living some standing alone",Eight Miles High (Intro)

The night air is cold - the freeway is clear.
In a green Gucci bag - are you prized possessions
The jewels of your mind - to hold back the fear. 

And when Monday comes round - there's a high lonesome sound
And she follows you down for the kill.
And a while blinding light - makes it all seem so right
And you feel like the king of the hill. 

The driveway is long - your princess is lovely
Your servants all wait - for your knock on the door.
How many years - will you crawl through this castle
So satisfied - and still wanting more.
And when Monday comes... 

The guests have arrived - with all the right faces
But you miss the ball - in that room down the hall.
It's sunrise again - the driveway is empty
The crystal is cracked - there's blood on the wall.

Roger McGuinn,"A fair young maid was in her garden
Strange young man came riding by
He said fair maid, will you marry me?
And this answer was her reply

Oh no kind sir I cannot marry thee
For I've a love and he sails the sea
And though he's been gone for seven years
Still he will return to me

Well, what if he's in some battle slain
Or if he's been drowned in the deep salt sea
Or if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be

If he's in some battle slain
Then I shall die when the moon doth wane
And if he's drowned in the deep salt sea
Still I'm true to his memory

And if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be
I wish them health and happiness
Where they live across the sea

And kisses he gave her one two three

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming

Roger McGuinn,"Willie Moore was a young man, his age 21 and he courted a damsel fair
Oh, her eyes were as white as a diamond after night and a wavy jet black wore her hair
He courted her by night and day until marriage they did agree
Oh, but when he came to get her parents' consent they said it could never be

She threw herself in Willie Moore's hands as often they've done before
Oh, but little did he think as he left her that night, sweet Annie he would see no more
It was about the 10th of may, a time i remember it well
That very same night little Annie disappeared in a way no tongue can tell

Sweet Annie was loved both far and near, she had friends almost all around
And near a little brook not far from her home the body of sweet Annie were found
Her parents now are left alone, one mourns while the other'n weeps
And near a grassy mound outside the cottage door the body of sweet Annie sleeps

Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say from the moment they both did part
And his last day was spent near his true lover's grave where he died of a broken heart",Willie Moore

So cheer up my lads let your hearts never fail
While the Bonnie Ship the Diamond goes fishin' for the whale

Along the quay at Peterhead, the lassies stand around

For there's not a rose on Greenland's ice to make you change your mind

Here's a health to the Resolution likewise the Eliza Swan
A health to the Battler of Montrose and the Diamond ship of fame
They wear the trousers of the white the jackets of the blue
When they return to Peterhead they'll find that we've been true

It'll be bright both day and night when the Greenland lads come home
With a ship that's full of oil my lads and money to their name

She was sitting in my kitchen with a face I can't forget
She was looking my direction and calling with her eyes
I was trying to do an interview and telling them all lies
Last year in the summer with a Tiffany lamp over her head

They were asking what I thought about the 50's rock n roll
Then they got into their limousine and fell into a hole
I moved into the kitchen and I quickly fell in love
The warden came along and asked me what I was thinking of
Last year in the summer with a Tiffany lamp over her head

Well I grabbed her by the hand and with a few things I could
The warden said ""You're leaving, well, you better leave for good!""
I made it to Tasmania to buy a devil dog
We were met by a young handsome prince, who turned into a frog

A number between 20 and 22
I?ll show you, what I mean, 21
That's very good, first time, 21

Well, 21 take away 9
12 little children standing in a line
From that take 2 that leaves you 10
Take away 8 and you got 2 again

Yeah, you got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now you got 2 again
You got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again

Now see how easy that was
For the second verse
I need someone to give me a number
Between 12 and 14, I'll make a verse, 13

13, ah, 13, well, 13 multiplied by 1
You still got 13 but wasn't that fun
Now, take that same 13 multiply by 2
26 hours the train's overdue

Yeah, you got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now you got 2 again
You got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
Happy people divided by 1
Leave nothing, nothing, none

You got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again
You got 2 again, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again

You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again
You used to love me once and now, you got 2 again",Got Two Again
Roger Miller,"Engine, engine number nine,
Comin' down the railroad line,
How much farther back did she get off?
Old brown suitcase that she carried,

I've looked for it everywhere, it
Just ain't here among the rest, and
I'm a little upset, yes, tell me
Engine, engine number nine,

Comin' down the railroad line,
I know she got on in Baltimore.
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance,
But it sure do make a difference 

I don't think she loves me anymore.
I warned her of the dangers 
Don't speak to strangers.
If by chance she finds new romance,

Warmer lips to kiss her,
Arms to hold her tighter,
Stirring new fires inside her 
How I wish that it was me, instead of he

That stands beside her.
Engine, engine number nine,
Comin' down the railroad line,
I know she got on in Baltimore.

A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance,
But it sure do make a difference 
I don't think she loves me anymore.
No, I don't think she loves me any more",Engine Engine #9
Roger Miller,"Well, I think I finally found me a sure-fire way to forget
It's so simple, I'm surprised I hadn't done thought of it before yet
It's foolproof, well, it's foolhardy, maybe, but who knows?
Anyway, here I am, walkin' down toward where the cold dark water flows
All it takes is

One dyin' and a buryin', one dyin' and a buryin'
Some cryin', six carryin' me
I wanna be free
Oh-ho, I want to be free

Free from all this heartache and regret
And free from pinin' for the love I can't forget
The love that once was warm and then just somehow turned to hate
Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape
That's

One dyin' and a buryin', one dyin' and a buryin'
Some cryin', six carryin' me, I wanna be free
One dyin' and a buryin', one dyin' and a buryin'
Some cryin', six carryin' me, I wanna be free",One Dyin' and a Buryin'
Roger Miller,"Well I fell in love in Texas when a little girl said to me
Come on back down here you all and let's grow a little honey tree
Well I bought myself a ticket and the train leaves by quarter to four
I can see her now with the great big eyes waitin' at the station door
Ain't that fine ain't that fine ain't that fine fine fine she's all mine
Well she took me home to mama and that didn't impress me much
Till she wrote down a great big welcome mat and that picked me with a magic touch
When she walks down the sidewalk all the cowboys step aside
Cause they all know she's a one man woman and she'll soon be roped and tied
Let me tell you ain't that fine ain't that fine ain't that fine fine fine she's all mine
Well now her daddy owns a oilwell in the Lone Star Texas State
And it shoot much gold to the clear blue sky and brother ain't that great
Well now I just can see me highball with a big long fine cigar
A big success watchin' things progress a schauffer with a long black car
Come on ain't that fine ain't that fine ain't that fine fine fine she's all mine
Yeah ain't that fine fine fine she's all mine",Ain't That Fine
