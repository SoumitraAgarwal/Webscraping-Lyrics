Melvins,"Freedom's all lies different walk away 
You gotta hold your tongue you gotta hit it with the right of way 
Maybe I blocked you from your intellectual scene 
In a way insane in a way it's gotta be. 
Red Sister might be choking but I ain't about that kind 
Answer me with the rhythm of a body that was born to lose two times. 
Hey big motor
He says that I'm a true fortune lie
Hang my shoulder 
Big broken love, big broken knives 

They might try to hide they have to answer mordant sins 
You might be right like a hole in the wind 
Poison daggers for the road mix broke down cross 
Takes your head off the line
The flavor might be missing he has to cross that anyway 
You can bet you can riddle with the brothers to the power of another day. 

Hey big motor
He says the Night Patrol 49 
Hang my shoulder 
Big broken love, big broken knives 

Doing it say I'm meat

Just realize keep the dog away from me

It's not nice to feel alone inside
This little goat won't mind
All my fear are just vanishing
And the blood will let me find a way

Wicked!

And now your pretty face 
Things that give me grins

Melvins,"Well, I knocked down on your door, baby,
To see if you were at home.
Your shade was down, there wasn't even a sound
But something told me you weren't alone.
What in the world can a nasty dog do
But try to get next to you?
Don't laugh 'cause it ain't funny.
Look how it happened to me.
It could happen to you, you could be a fool too
And it'd leave you in misery.
I guess there's nothin' more funky king can do
But to try to get next to you.",Nasty Dogs and Funky Kings
Melvins,"The partisans not the artisans
Are doing their dirty show
But I ripped my pants
Doing some dance
That I learned in France
And they think there ain't
Nothin' to know

Used, abused
Locked up, beaten and fined
But I got free
Copped a plea
And I can see
That there ain't no freedom
Bell gonna chime
This time

Truth and love
Are my law and worship
Form and conscience

My manifestation and guide
Nature and peace are
My shelter and companion
Order is my attitude
Beauty and perfection
Are my attack

False faces
Fast company
A night of thrills
With no jealousy, no poison

Nobody's tool
Will be a public fool
To manipulate the masses
Who lie and cheat
And eat their meat
And think it's sweet
While the rest all clean their glasses
In status classes",Poison
Melvins,"By the time you're natural
By the time you die
I'll take my head and spin it for you
I'll just look around

And I call you liar
And I call you dead
You come and poisoned all the things that I once set up on
Everybody's hungry

Everybody's high
We'll sit around and ask ourself if it was all a lie
And I already told you
And I already say

But you have got to know yourself and so I let it slide
Can you get together
Can you hold my hand

And I already love you
And I already want
But will we all just sore",Amazon

the night is so black darkness cooks 
you come on creepin' around making me do things i don't want to do 
i can't believe that you need my love so bad 
comes in and around trying to drive me mad 
how'd you know my dreams? 
making me see things i don't want to see

leave me here just to try to keep from following you",The Green Manalishi (With the Two Pronged Crown)

Melvins,"My mama done tol' me, 
When I was in knee pants,
My mama done tol' me, 
Son! A woman'll sweet talk
And give ya the big eye;
But when the sweet talkin's done,
A woman's a two face
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing 
The blues in the night

Now the rain's a fallin',
Hear the train a collin'
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
Hear dat lonesome whistle
Blowin' cross the trestle,
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
A whoo-ee-duh-whoo-ee, ol' clickety clack's
A echoin' back th' blues in the night

The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide its light
When you get the blues in the night

Take my word, the mockin' bird'll
Sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong and he's right 
From Natchez to Mobile,
From Memphis to St. Joe,
Wherever the four winds blow,
I been in some big towns, 
An' heard me some big talk,
But there is one thing I know 
A woman's a two face,
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing the blues in the night
My mama was right, there's blues in the night",Horn Bearer (Continued)
Melvins,"We mate to be relieved
Sick animal, come on and eat me 
We seize to be released 
But we don't want to lay 
A lesson died, a lesson done 
We played and that's my secret 
I've burned to keep them down 
But that sick keeps coming around 
I gotta crawl to be, to buy 
This sick just makes me stronger 
Stomp the sick or stomp the lies 
And I will kill them all 
I hate days all at once 
I hate misery and it's no wonder 
I've burned to keep them down 
But that sick keeps coming around",Manky

Locked down when you die",We All Love Judy
Melvins,"I could settle down
And be doin' just fine
Till I hear that old freight
Comin' down the line
Then I hurry straight
Home and pack and if I didn't go
I'd be 'bout lose my stack
I love you, baby, but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Some folks might say that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open road starts callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I got to see
Sometimes it's hard, but you gotta understand
When the lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Let me travel this land
From the mountains to the sea
'Cause that's the life I believe
He meant for me
And when I'm gone, and at my grave you stand
Just say God's called home your ramblin' man",Ramblin' Man

I listen to the radio, its better than a stereo
We listen to the radio, radio stereo

Telephone is ringing, but, I can hardly hear
Though the man on the end of the line is speaking loud and clear

I'd like to take her home that's understood
She plays hard to get, she smiles from time to time
It only takes a camera to change her mind

She's going out tonight but drinking just champagne
And she has been checking nearly all the men
She's playing her game and you can hear them say
She is looking good, for beauty we will pay

Members Only,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know

Will find

Sand is just a broken stone
Love it changes with the seasons
In the dark I read the lines upon your hand
Junkies, intellects and preachers
All addicted to your clans
Caged by ribs sits the believer
With less friends than fingers on one hand

When silence speaks free
When no ones home
When cold and lucid
When bruised and torn
Look into your abyss
Nothing tastes like this
Look into....

Is what you see here what you wanted?
No soft lens, no violins
Like the gray eyes of a dead man
The mirror always stares

I've got a little riddle in my head

Look into your abyss

Yes I'm talking to you
Your only son
The one you dressed in nails
I know how hard it is for you to show

Show your love
For your love I take
The nails and thorns
That will never be enough
Still I beg and crawl
For your God-damned love

I've just begun
To understand your ways
You need blood
So no one goes away
I know how hard it is for you to show

Turn the other cheek again
Will I?
Maybe let me in this time

Show your love
For your love I take
The nails and thorns
That will never be enough
Still I beg and crawl
For father and son
I'm your son
For your God-damned love

Memento,"In this gray harbour of tears we are capsizing
Still waters belie the current that drags us down
Without a sun shallow waters can only be black
As cold and as weathered as the leaves
That clog your dead mouth
What the f*** is wrong with us people?
What the f*** is wrong with you people?

Looking down your nose judging me f*****
Looking down your nose from the same mother
Looking down your nose, judge, judge f*****
As we sink below

Could you have walked on water with two led feet?
This epiphany reached whilst breathing through a straw
Conscience is the only weak link in my ball and chain
I've been making excuses for things I've done to myself
What the f*** is wrong with us people?
What the f*** is wrong with you people?

Down, down, down down down

Can I be?
Can I be all of these people at once?
Can I please all of you parasites at once?
Can I be all of these people at once?
Can I be?
I cannot be.

Like mud it flows
Eyes burning brightly
The creaking of the door

Does he sit at your right hand?
Was it the jealous touch of the devil?

Every father is a war

Any road that gets you home

Memento,"He's coming, he's coming, he's coming

Counting on some one on one with you
Connecting all the dots, guess who
Invisible but with you in the room
Just know that he's coming for you

There is no me and you
You are still dead to me

Coming out of hibernation

The shivers and the tingles in your spine
The dirty pins and needles in your eyes
Look into the keyhole of your mind
Just know that I'm coming for you

I forgot to forgive
I'm forgetting to live
I forgot to forgive you

Memento,"Beginning at the end of the beginning of the end
Twisting and turning between one and ten
The puzzle never ends make your demons your friends
It's the beginning of a road that leads right back to the
Beginning of the end.....

Living in my machine
Pulses beneath gray skin
Torso deep in unanswered whys
Let your habit anesthetise
Letting the insects in
Beggars that breed within
Swing from your chain, enjoy your ride
Just a blind man swimming against the tide
Two circles, one cycle, a figure of 8
Where loves becomes hate

Beginning at the end of the beginning of the end
Twisting and turning inside you
Denial becomes you
Make your demons your friends
Flying with your noxious wings
Crying through your toxic lens
Denial betrayed you
Make your demons your friends

Inner anomaly
Where self slaughter is peace
Mutating into a silver whale
Beaching yourself to spite the grail
Turning from fish to frog
Come sleep with my dead God
Calluses bloom on the hand of grace
The snake is sleeping, dreaming of Eve's face
Two circles, one cycle, a figure of 8
Where the trap is the escape

Cognition is prison, cognition is prison
Birth, life, death, rust
Feed this cruel lust
Cognition is prison, cognition is prison

Goodbye, I hope to see you in another life
Goodnight, I know I'll see you from a clearer sky
No pain, no blame
Just a naked and a loving eye
Goodbye

Love goes on
I hope you all enjoyed your ride
Love goes on
I hope we find ourselves in time

I don't need your mantra
I don't need your crosses
I don't need to hold on
I don't need to let go
If my eyes are black
You'll just have to find me
Careful where you look
You'll end up where I am

The end of the beginning, the beginning of the end
Twisting and turning between one and ten
The puzzle never ends, make your demons your friends
It's the end of a road that leads right back to
The beginning....

Memento,"Since water of the womb
I knew I'd have to face you
The colour of my bites
Yes they remind me of you

In your blood I write
I am not afraid
This is who I am
And I will never be like you
I do not kneel
All I'm asking
Is nothing sacred anymore?

Sailing through the flood
Why did he keep two of you
Splinter in your mind's eye
My Phoenix rises to swoop

Still floating in the gray water of your womb

Take the edge of my thumbs
Bury the nails deep into your eyes
Maybe then you'll see my light
I'd rather crawl, drooling with the beggars

We tried so hard to pretend you were dead
I walked the earth just to escape you
Now I walk the earth just to touch you again

To save myself I betrayed you
These swollen lips whisper only for revenge
To spite myself I betrayed you

If I stop the lies, will I see you in the end?

Nothing up ahead
I cannot buy a friend
I just came here to tell you
I miss you

Crawl away, I watched you crawl away
Not one set of footprints in this burning sand

How does it feel your asking
I cant heal, I cant feel you anymore
I'll never kneel
Never kneel before you
How can I heal
When there's blood still on the floor?

In a vacuum screaming
Hope was not in season
Please hear me, someone hear me

Am I right am I wrong
Give one reason to go on
I wish I was your perfect ten
I wish I could transcend

Would you take my hand?
Do you just stare?
Please take my hand

Memphis,"A camera captures images of a person on a bridge
He is only standing there but something doesn't seem quite right
He paces back and forth awhile as if deciding what to do
He takes his backpack and his jacket off and climbs over the railing

And then he falls into the sea
He falls into the ocean
He falls into the deep
He falls into the deep

The photographer is spellbound, he can't believe what he has seen
He rewinds the tape and plays again the moment of the fall
He wants to look away but it seems strangely beautiful
The man was only young, could he have saved him if he tried

Or was he meant to fall into the sea
Just fall into the ocean
Just fall into the deep
Just fall into the deep

The person takes some photographs of the person on a bridge
He is only standing there for a moment or two more
He is remembering what he looked like or maybe who he was
And when it finally comes, he knows exactly what to do

He's meant to fall into the sea
Be dragged down by the current
Be dragged down deep beneath
Be dragged down deep beneath
Just fall into the sea
Just fall into the ocean
Just fall into the deep
Just fall into the deep
Just fall into the sea
Be dragged down by the current
Be dragged down deep beneath
Be dragged down deep beneath

Yo I grew up like a Regular Cat

My gunz, my credentials, I'm geased up
Hate a nigga that don't know me and swear that Bleek front
cause I'm a little nigga, so what, I did my thang
Now I came up, fuck a nigga gon tell me?
Before this Bleek shit, a nigga couldn't eat and shit
I sold drugs, fascinated by this sneaker shit
On hot days I found ways to clock pay
Had yellow tops now my topz is gray
Cause one these lame niggaz got the color of mine
But one problem, niggaz work ain't as butter as mine
And you got to believe, yo I'm dope in the drawers form, poppy seed
And you got to be weed, I got a ounce of D and no clientele
But when the sun goes down I hit the strips for sales
Clock mel, half of my dogz ain't rottweil
We bout to work wholesale, and flip the price the retail
Wha......

I got the hood in me, so I guess I'm no good, nigga
I stay strapped Cause I know a nigga could, nigga
I chop grams in the crib wit my man
We blew L's and politiced on how to expand
We supplied the Vein
Promised to go out in a blaze
Before them pigz lock the game
We gotta maintain in this world of cold blood
It's no love, niggaz will back out heat and let you hold slugz
We took re-up money
Rollin dice, and I neva thought a game of Cee-Lo
Could take my man life, Over 3 cdnt, My son was a little bit
A nigga flash heat, he flipped and seen the end of it
A cool cat, and novody seemed to like him
Dat was my dog so nobody had to like I'm
I closed the vein down, I couldnt hustle no mo
But still I hold heat ready to ride to war
Cause I could die by this game
Spit in the Mic and my life ain't no different
Just a Regular Cat

Tight, the whole heat, you niggaz don't know me
Where the fuck niggaz know me from? (Marcy, son)
You niggaz frontin you ain't have heart to come
Besides you niggaz mad cause yo bitch ride shotty
Round town, malibu mixed wit Bicardi
She relaxed in da drop, Fendi shades matchin the watch
Accent osets, the bitch kinda prop
But her man think he untouchable
Put his ass where he ain't comfortable, Lay him up for a few
He'll realize, Bleek ain't the one to fuck wit
Provoke me to spit, consider it dealt wit
I'm not the type to hit shotz and miss you
The type to play you close to kiss you
nigga describe the pistol, you hit wit
When they fillin yo body wit liquid
Now I'm on the low cause you told em it was Memphis
Who blazed you up, yeah, laid you up
Yo mouth got you like that, and that's plain as fuck

Live are Die
Marcy
Do what you do

Check it out now
Yo I'm here to put my thing down
Set up shot with cocaine now
Pick off niggas who ain't down
I'm in the game now
Brought a couple of cats from the way down
Who know how to slang thows
And grimmy niggas who aim wild
Who juss want to rep
And wet niggas who think foul
Ran into Jay while I'm clappin this math
This crab show me some slab
Now I'm tryna get back
We played the out skerch
Nigga smoother then my shirt
Spit a couple of words, a pound, then he merked
Shit he left skid marks
I let the clip spark
When off in the hood
Played the bench till its dark
I'm profouned to the drug game
A thin line between love and hate
Some niggas I love to hate
I thought my connect respect me
This nigga got bad words since some haters wet me

Chorus 4x's
To stay alive in New York City
To stay alive realize that you got to be a soilder

Check it
Yo I'ma soldier to the heart
Through my blood line
One way to catch a crab is always on his front time
I keep a chicken on a bench flippin
Grippin
I smoke weed but this shit got a nigga slippin
A herb seed burn me, drop the L
Spot it through my per-if-you
This nigga tryna murder me
Shorty wop jumped in front of me
Caught one
Blaze back empty empty the roots
Through the bitch niggas, take that
Niggaz killed my down bitch
Bust around bitch
I don't know who clapped
So I don't hang around 
Shit
Lame beat me on the ounce of raw
Dominican nigga
Look innocent nigga
Fuck it I'ma finish this nigga
Back the coop out the lot
Cock one in the drop
Put the burner in the dash fee dipped in black
Got Bleek on alert
For the cat who beat me on the stack

Chorus 4x's
To stay alive in New York City
To stay alive realize that you got to be a soilder

Yo, Yo
Slow money, broke niggas,  no weed
One gun
And my down bitch gone
Got a nigga on the run
Strip hot
Niggas came through
Bang shots
Have me sleeping in my wheels
To the real get got
Now I play the cut
On some nigga what shit
Flip fo-in-dicals
For real now who wants it
Two blocks from the Jay's this nigga lay
He pump trays
Try'n to get the Memph man put away
His next option
Pack up get out of dodge
When he caught I'ma let the fifth give his face a massage
Too much dro got my eyes low
On the creep triple black down
'cause I'ma cripple that clown
Spotted him by WoodHall
Niggas think the fe-in took off
Like he ran track or he played football
Hot day and everybody outside
I'ma catch him on that block
Where the hot wips ride
Ride slow this nigga out burning trees
Wit a bad bitch
I'ma put his brain on her sleeve
I'ts already cocked
I move slow up the block
Jumped out
Made him tongue kiss the glock
I Squeeze two
And niggas seen this nigga drop
Cold of the street and forever stay hot
Motherfucker

You bitches been dropping D's (dimes)
Since 86 striped Lees
Dial 9-1 tips
When I spit one clip
Supposed to be killing niggaz but ain't really done shit
I'm loco
Tote the 4-4
Smoke L's with duck doors
Drow flow 
Blow the smoke slow 
And holler fuck hoes
It's cash and money
Nines grab the green weed exactly
One shot lives and daiquiris
My gat be stashed in the dash
Mixed herbs and hash
On a cruise for cash
I might bruise some cats
Spit 2 at you dudes that act
Like you can't be touched
Front and lose your cap
I incinerate guns after bodies I caught son
Never on the run stack mail by the tons son

Chorus 2x:

Niggaz hate bleek cause I live through this shit
You niggaz keep hating cause I could deal with this shit

Sold it all criminal
Weed just a minimum

Rock syndicate and flips in the block
You call it I lick a shot

Head back to the honeycomb to break down figures

Throw in the bank, trucks the size of tanks now nigga

She brought the Yukon 2000 black
Through a screen and a DVD
Twenites on the truck that'll piss you off
In return I sent her on a tour thru Sacks
With tengrand shoping spree to get back
I brought her a five that look nice when she drive
Put a glock on the dash

Violate me, get beat with shotguns
I can fight, I know I'm a boxer
See Bleek in the hardtop Boxer
Down in 'Frisco poppin' my collars
Smoke champelly, all black Impalla
3 Wheelin', Hennesey spillin'
Fuck the world, that's how Bleek feelin'
Cherry red M3, that's me
When you be like damn you killin' 'em, that's me
You know me, eye-cocked, twin buggy eyes
Blue as the watch face
The watch stay faced - nigga

I'm just trying to make it, whoa, yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna do what's right
Though the devil tries to tempt me, oh no, oh no, oh no...",Everyday
Memphis Bleek,"Yeah
Whats up with these lame-ass niggas, man?
I'm tellin' you
Niggas keep runnin' to this rap shit
You know mean?
Like why y'all built like that
Y'all niggas better pick up a basketball, or somethin'
Y'all niggas ain't ready for this shit

[Memphis Bleek]
If a nigga know the Memph
I ain't the type to front
I'll put any gun to you
What type you want?
Supply any drug for you
What high you want?
Bag any chick for you
Nicer slut
Yeah, I push hot fees
My niggas got cheese
You run around frontin' 
Like you niggas got keys
You never flipped burgers
Your krew, I ain't heard of
Matter of fact, I'll murder ya
I heard you niggas spit shit
But it's indirect
Say my name
And see where I end this tech
I got a lot of love for this
But dog, I'm real
When it's beef, it's beef
When it's rap, it's real
Nothin' between
A lot of frontin' I seen
I done analyzed this game
It's nothin' but schemes
New ways to sell records
I aim for it
Put it out if it's hot
Not, Just ignore it

[Chorus: x2]
We them hustlers
And that's who y'all know
We get low, get dough
Flip gold for sure
We them gangstas
That's who we be
We got cheese
Pop three for R-O-C

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo, yo

This is my ghetto
I eat, sleep, breathe here
To tell the truth, dog
None of us goin' leave here
We die young, go to jail for murder 1
On a come-up, nigga
And that's where I'm from
I done learned from that Puff and that Lopez shit
I ain't runnin' in no club on some loco shit
I'ma catch you when you sit
Put 4 in yo whip
Catch your girl in the club
Put nut in your bitch
Niggas want to see the Memph go and lose his cool
Go and use his tool
Nigga, use the fool
You could bootleg my shit
I want me a chunk, deuce
I'm not a chump, I'll leave you slumped in the trunk
What part of that you don't understand?
Or ain't hear?
Misinterpret?
Dog, I put work in
I got a name, and my shit sound phenomenal
Still keep them things
Next to the abdominal

[Chorus: x2]

[Bienie Sigel]
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah

Before these rhymes
I was bustin' these nines
Before these raps
I was bustin' my gat
Before the vocal groups
I spoke with the truth
Why do cats want to muffle my speech?
Imagine my raps 
If I wasn't in touch with the street
On the block, deep
Wit my peeps touchin' the heat
I'm used to crack, now I'm slingin' raps 
Hustler with beats
You niggas is lame
You cats can't touch what I reach
And quiet as kept
You niggas can't hush what I speech
My story's too deep
Life real, clear as the streets
See my iced grill, hear my voice clear when you sleep
You niggas know me
The cat who be tearin' these streets
Ain't nothing changed
But my name when I appeared on these beats
It's Bien Mac
Sigel was the name that they gave me
The streets that is
I'm tryin' to teach that, kids
Cause some niggas don't know that they be clowns
Hey yo, the sun don't go down
We go around

[Verse 1]
I put this key in the ignition
Start my V
Take the clip out the ashtray
Spark my trees
You know that haze weed
Backwood roll tight
Belvedere cranberry juice mix light
Under 30% tint ridin' bent
Doin' a quarter
Smokin' on what grow under water
My life in order
You know I got a pocket fulla sticky
The whole BK, light a blunt up for Biggie
And smokeout
I gives a fuck if you got a skateboard
Or that new XO out
You blow the row out
And holla
I'mma survive or die
I'mma ride 'cause they never take a nigga alive
I gets high
Rollin' down the I95
Starrin' through the rearview
From all the shit I survived
And as I ride by
I just tilt my hat
Put the car on cruise and roll up another sack

[Chorus]
[Repeat]

[Verse 2]
You catch Bleek rollin' hay
When I'm down in the Bay
Hey it don't stop
I light a blunt up for 'Pac
Pop my colla
Take another sip of that vodka
Hit three wheel motion
Locin' in the Impala
On them fifty spoke
With two pounds to smoke
And the weed come clean
No sticks no seed
Straight bud
And keep the car weed scented
Mami be like Bleek
We can't, breathe in it
Mami keep cool
Let me remove the roof
Take a sip of that Bel've
And remove your shoes
But ch'ya
Recline baby
Smoke good lime baby
This the real green
Out the High Times baby
We sittin' on dubs
Know what that like?
Twist enough bud
Mami get your mind right

[Chorus]
[Repeat]
I gets high
Holla at the I95
Holla at the bar
Yeah, uh huh
I can't lie (lie)
Holla at the bar
I puff lye (lye)

Gradually I'm taking over your bitch
Coming over your shit
Got my feet up on you sofas, man
I mean a hostess for my open hand
You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch up in my Rover man
I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
I'mma pimp her, it's over man
When I twist her in the Gold sedan
Like I'm Goldie man, you're bitch chose man

Damn Bleek, can't speak
Uh-huh, okay, what's up, shut UP
And close the door
Act like you been in the drop top
On the open road before

Ever seen a pair of kicks this crispy
How you love how the white wife beater fit me
M-dot, him hot, them not

Why you acting so funny?

Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain

Sweatin' till no fluid is left
When I come in the party with J we gonna do it to death
You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her
Can't help it if she yellin' with a ridah

Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?

Something to hold on to, for the rest of my life
And I can show you what it's like to be in Trini for a night 'cause (I want to love you)
It's been a long way here, from plan to hallway
To bring us all way here
To the sweets in L.A. or beach M-i-a or chill out pool
Shout out to crib where I lay 'cause I (love you)
And everyday that pass we gotta live it to it's limit like we live in our last
And we been broke before

Memphis Bleek,"[Intro - Memphis Bleek (w/ ab-libs in background)]
Yeah, yanahmean?
Just something for all my niggas in the hood
They always ask me, what I got to say to the youths and
Yanahmean when I do these interviews
Just wanna let em know (we ballin)
You gotta strap up cause niggas'll test you
Whenever you feel that pressure
You let em know everyday of your life is, check it

[Verse 1 - Memphis Bleek]
For real we still killin 'em and, each one of 'em
You know the flow like caine, look it's numbin 'em
Look what I done to them, they want run wit 'em
I let 'em stay few nights but then I'm done wit 'em
Mami you rollin, get your clothin
You know one sight of the mansion will get 'em open
I back out my garage wit, new Ferrari
Cause I been pimpin this game since Atari
You hardly, ever see me loving a hoe
I tell a bitch, I'm in love wit my doe
Cause I'm pimping and, niggas is bitchin and
We was the pharmacy now you want prescriptions
Think I'm slippin, like I don't grip again
Go 'head trip it ain't nothing to drop a clip again
Got my dawgs to catch me when I'm fallin
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin

[Chorus - Young Chris (2x)]
Nigga we ballin - ready for war and
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin
We ballin - ready for war and
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin

[Verse 2 - Proof]
Yeah, I take a sip of that henny I load that tec up
I hit the block wit the medicine give 'em check ups
You see I'm vest up, I'm ballin at war
These niggas wanna see me off, they don't wanna see me on but
Proof I'm ballin; I put a eighth
Of that white down in my hood, I can finish it by the mornin
Re-up by noon, re-kick at night
Half these dudes doing bids couldn't live my life
And you youngn's in the hood wanna be like P
Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P
Like, P-89 you niggas' P-92 shit
You know how dudes ""This Proof ain't for that bullshit""
And these hoes wanna roll wit a G
But once I hit 'em wit that G, I have totin the P, cause!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Memphis Bleek]
Yo I hear 'em callin, and every city I travel
Hoes get at 'em when they see a nigga ballin
Keep the steel wit me, couple of killas from the hood
Who blew bail, but still they keep it real wit me
We ride out (and?) we find out (where?)
Your little address (and?) blow out your hideout (yeah)
Who want war? hoes they tellin me ""E's you ain't right""
Like this year I'm gon go South Pole
This for them haters think I'm slippin, I ain't
When I find 'em hiding I tie 'em, they be missin like weight
But wait, lil nigga don't be missin my point
I don't miss when I point, niggas get killed off point
And you see, I school a little you, forfeit the game
I was young, just like 'em, Jay taught me the same
But I see he hard headed, told em stay in his lane
Cause them OG's home and they layin wit K's cause

Memphis Bleek,"I would change a thing, if I have to live my life all over
Oh, baby, oh girl, I do it all again
If I have to live my life, live my life I would

I would do it all again, all again, yeah
If I have to live my life all over, nope, oh, baby, yeah
I do it all again
(Yo everyday)
If I have to live my life all over
(Every hour you know, yeah)

Yo, yo, same hustle man, same struggle man
Yeah, I do it again, if I have to
Still the same way, still the game paid
Still the young nigga, still slang, yeah

I wouldn't change a thing and my mama did it all by herself
She sayin' the same pray, listen
You hear when she whisper
I get the chance I fix her, days that I slipped her

And my man the past, I tell him I love him
And I hug him before he pass
Raised his daughter as if she was mine
Still meet the same girl, still have mine, uh

I thank God the Melik meet Shawn
I throw the diamond up higher in every song
And only drama could do it again
Da hood don't love me, still I walk through it again hear me

I wouldn't change one fact if I have to come back
And I couldn't live black, got me
But mama love me, I'm from da ghetto
And only God could judge me

I would do it all again, I would do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh baby, yeah
I do it all again
(Aha, uh, yeah, what)
I do it all again, if I have to live my life all over
(I do it over, for real, same way)

Oh, I wouldn't change a thang, same shit the basic
Same house, same spouse, same pop's I came with
Same gun, same case, same niggaz I bang with
I be big right now before I change shit

Just roll me up an L and live life and just do what I do
It's all lovely when it's right
But when it's wrong, I just play along
Get hit bounce back like it's really nothin' wrong

And I still struggle, still bubble
No matter if I'm broke or rich I still hustle
Still get niggaz to test you is my life
And I do it all again,I do it twice

And I won't change a thang, maybe two
I bring Big and Pop back put them in the same room
Then I apolotic and make peace in da same room
Once a game dead then you know we all dead too, true

And then we back on the block
With the crack in da sack
I take it how it come from the bottom to the top
I signed wit Bleek and I'm ridin' wit The Roc and I

Would do it all again, do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh baby, yeah
I do it all again, for the love as it gain
If I have to live my life all over
(And I do it again, yeah, holla)
Oh, I would

Yo, I talk to my fam I lost and let them know
How I feel from my heart without them here no mo'
And is no lies, I do it all again from the start of my life
Till the night my mama die

I would it told her, I love and it all kept looses and close
Let her know I always be here for you
Apologize to grandma that for da stress I put her through
And to my dad I ain't mad at you

Even thought you wasn't there without you
I won't be here so I gotta be fair
Still don't love lost over here I swear
To my restin' road dawgz, yeah
(I do it all again)

Why changin' my resurrection
I be back and the style same strip
Back with the same click
Hustle in the game chips, explain this
If I have to live all over I do it
Let Barbara have his kidz all over watch me

Get it quick, servin' the pump liquor
Spend a little mo' time with my big brother Leek
Still be fam with Cease, Proof, Cali and Bleek
Holla and get low, probably when my life repeat, nigga

I would do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh, baby, yeah

If I have to live my life all over, oh I would

Get Low in the building, why'know, nigga
Let's do it, c'mon, yo

[Memphis Bleek]
It's gettin hot so the shorts is on
Gotta tote the snub it's too warm for the long, nigga
You could pass me to baby's zoo
One shot'll turn a nigga face into baby food; BLAAH!
Get it clear, now why they lookin for Saddam
Weapons of mass destruction is here
I got a few in my hood
In case a nigga ever get the feelin and he think that he could
Or would, pull sket on me
I could show you first hand what's a felony
And a hobby and the process of gettin money is nothing
I'm not Sosa, but the dogs is coming
This is not not, no, no, motherfucking game
Entertain you motherfuckers is not why I came
It's R.O.C. and M.O.P.
I wipe floors wit little niggas for fuckin wit my team

[Fame]
My nigga think so god that ounce and mo ice and the nicest MC
But yo big, tell god I said naah, 'cause he throw like a bitch
When he threw it he missed, the niceset MCs is right here
Why the fuck you throw it over there
The whole rap game turned into a 2-Pac-a-don
Gangsta boy boppin, with his nuts and cock in your palm
Playa pass the baton, got a few jack tools and bullet scars
Now you got your 2-Pac costume on (THUG LIFE!!)
First of all, y'all niggas gon' need more songs
This M.O.P. nigga we put it down (put it down!!)
Motherfuckers trying to figure me out
Wanna see what a nigga be bout
But if I told ya, I predicted the death of my oldest brother was last
And the death of my mother you'd probably think I'm crazy as fuck
Rumor has it that I' m half past the seventh hour
Naw nigga I'm a quarter to eight, M.O.P.!

Now let me clear this up for you youngun, Bill still comin
The Ville still gunnnin (St- tuh tuh tuh tuh tuh!!!)
Runnin I come from the Browns where niggas don't play fair

Put me in a position to blast
I'll pop you and drop you, where they be fishin for bass
So once you ramblin, take you, drape you, and break you to small pieces
And FedEx your fingers to one of your nieces
We hold fort, we don't give a fuck about you
Ask them bouncers we'll stomp the shit out you

'cause every step along the line I'ma take mine, nigga

Memphis Bleek,"(Beanie Sigel)
Roll a ""L"" and burn a incent
It's like magic when I invent
This shit that I present
Yo turn my levels up a izinch
And drop the trebble down the pizinch
And let the bass commence
To relax your nerves
It's like a paintin with no color it's-why I attach the words
My mind the brush, my life the canvas, the world, the easel
Combines a perfect picture for people
My words is colorful like autumn
The way they fall on the track like leaves when I record em'
There's nothin like it when I write
And I don't print, I invent it and predict it like a psychic
Pull down the shades on the windows of your soul
And gaze into your mind and watch the wisdom unfold
I was taught when your vision's impaired
The wisdom is there
A message from Big Homey couldn't-have sent it no clear
I know the flow is like hypnotic
And tightest tip when I drop it with no particular topic
Type shit that can't be bitten so stop it
Type shit that can't be re-written on copy
By kinko, kodak, fuji films
Kin-folk know that groovy hymns
Spit by him'll put the gospel to you
Catch some little higher learning from a sermon once I drop it to you
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
The flow is like hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
(Memphis Bleek)
So roll a ""L"" and light a incent
It's like magic when I event
This shit that I present
It's not a secret when I speak it
I know that hatin' isn't physical but dawg I could peep it
It's like a preacher preachin' his scripts or psychic readin' a palm
Lines give me what I write in-this song
The book is now open so let the story be told
I enter through your mind and exit the back of your soul
That could push you to some insight
A shine like a headlight
Pickeny diamond watch me get right
I'm that nice
Words is a cure that help me heal up a heart
Words can become that evil game that help me get what I want..uh
You start where you end, you end where you start
I am the light of the situation I overshine dark
Give you the pen, the book, the word, the truth, the sight, the mind
I put it down, you call it a rhyme, I call it a sign
I predict the unpredictable
Heaven is invisible, but hell isn't physical
Let me stop with the spiritual.. whoa
Let me spit at you, show you how to move with no vehicle
Come through your speakers
Into/enter your ear, end up in paragraphs
Tellin' your man of what you hear
'cause, spit it I often roll it tighter than chronic
Styles versatile meanwhile it's hypnotic
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
(Jay-Z)
Pass the dutchie if you was ill
Take one to the grizzill
Tell me what you fizzill
It's like a complicated puzzle unravelin', mind travelin', with no particular flight patterin
Speak the language of the lizand
Desert feeds worm, worm feeds falcon, falcon feeds man ..uh
Only the strong survive, so if you along for the ride strap your boots and leave your thongs inside..uh
We experience turbulence in urban environments daily, rarely it's aqcuired
We riot like Israelis
Why am I here that question overwhelms me
I am a gangsta, Dr. Melfi couldn't help me
I am a thinker, my mind fixes all that L's/ills me the perfect elixir
I trust mines will never fail me
I let my speech unfold, I reach deep inside the seed of my soul and I got it
Hypnotic...hypnotic....
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...

[Memphis Bleek talking]
Yeah...I mean, M.A.D.E, no mob shit
Money, Attitude, Direction, and Education...some real
shit
Think about my hood one time, my hood...it's trippin'
Thinkin I've changed, crossed niggaz
Where we go wrong

[Verse 1]
I'm from that two-bedroom apartment, Marcy
5-3-4, that middle building...yeah, they say it started me
I'm new to it but consider me young
Seen it all happen, ain't understand what was done
But, all I wanted was the fly kicks fly shit
Little nigga but still kept a fly bitch
And back then it was love in the hood
Knuckle up with ya dog and fuck it, it's all good
Now, I'm in the crib rippin up to go to war with 'em
Same little niggaz I used to steal from the store with 'em
I go and get 'em from school
Used to take the same bus, same train back then we was cool
I broke bread at lunch with 'em
And if mom's left me with two singles, then you know
I'm splittin one with 'em
We cut school in the building I lived in, one floor higher
Smokin and gettin higher
Damn, think of age, now we locked up north
It was like yesterday we was practicin sports
Went from flippin on mats now he flippin in the box
Locked twenty-three hours up a day, he in the max
ain't no lookin back because this life goes on
We was kids didn't care about the rights and wrongs
But, nobody judged us the ghetto loved us
Streets, the only thing that ever took something from us
I lost a couple friends
But I promised and prayed that if I make it, I'm'a see 'em again
I admit, I was wild as a child
And my mom's ain't like none of my friends who use to call me Ismhael
My brother stayed on punishment, mama found out he hustle and
Found couple jacks, her plan she thought of flushin it
Me, I'm in the streets I swore, never change
My brother caught a cause, I came up to do the same

[Hook - Latif singing] (2X)
It's all about my days, this is all about my nights
This is all about my pain, this is all about my life

[Verse 2]
I got my first work, about the age of fourteen
My brother fighting a case his bail was fourteen
Me, still hustlin, school not going
My clothes started changin, the money started showin
My right hand was owing every hoe we know
She represent us through the ghetto every hood we know
He put me on on that traffic, though the money was average
I ain't care I learned how to handle that package
Then, a body dropped, O locked for minute
The squad it never died, I was left to represent it
Took a nigga out his crib his name I ain't gon' mention it
Know this hit home, I know this nigga listenin
Cause we was tighter than brothers where did the love go
I called your mother my mom's dog, I let the love show
This was supposed to be us
You was supposed to have the next verse dog, this was supposed to be us
And, you know I taught you the streets, taught you to pitch in
I gave you that gear got you all the bitches
I never thought you ever cross me dog
If they back me down in the corner, get 'em off me dog
Now I see exactly where we went wrong
When I spin through the hood and I see him, I keep it goin
Now the ghetto lookin at me like I changed
But, I'm still that regular nigga I'm still the same

But most girl, disrespectful when they try to speak, as if
They don't understand, Let me live, Ma

Try to be nice about being disrespectful

Because I've been through every ghetto, but home I can't forget
Wish I could take em all, on this ride with me

I only fucked with a few, and If you real you know
Soon you go, but if not, you don't yeah.
We still family right, that's what you leave me to believe
But ya don't understand my life
I took Dre down to South Beach, just to show him what A few ones to do
When you amongst your crew, we living
I never picture I could ever loose him
But I found myself with the thoughts that I'ma loose him
I put the stash up, I'm just trying to save his life
Just moved moms, had to moved her twice... down to Miami
I thank God everyday of my life, that I could provide for my family

I wish I could do the same, but I can't theirs work to do
Rent due, there's more work to do
I copped bikes let my niggas ride them
I copped coupes, let my niggas drive them
I'm proud to see my niggas wilding, cause I remember them days
They still vivid of me, huggin' the block, young soul committed
When I wrote rhymes daily
To get my flow up pray one day They whole world could hear me
I love it when the crowd recited every word of it
When they bounce, Let me know that they all a part of it
That two things make me proud of my life
I thought I had it all, but the best give was life
The third ?? I'm a brand new father
Of a Healthy baby boy and its making me work harder

If you violate man then you die by hand
And it should be fine, behanded that man
That man I am and you don't understand

It's unfortunate I'm in beef again huh
Niggaz is rappin and clappin I'm still laughin
Sat back in my hood and tried to live average
But - you still want me to bang at em
Stack lil paper, send a lil gang at em
But I see you want to stop my chill
Trips to oddy earth, meetings wit McNeil
Or - round table meeting wit Hov
You want me in the hood still over that stove

It ain't nothing to a boss we'll go in your clothes nigga

Only for real niggaz that can feel what I'm saying
If it's - too blatant then it's not for you
You do a hit, throw up later, it's not for you
So - just quit you bitch, making me sick
You never pimped you only friendly wit chicks and
I've been away for a minute
Jay beat up the drum now they whinin like women
I'm right back nicca, where you at nicca?
Keep the mac nigga, spit it like that nigga
And I tried to chill, even though
I got to spit everyday like I ain't signed a deal nigga!

Got a delivery like Sunday's paper

Now this tape better then your album sales, lookin' hurt
I'm tryna take it back in the day, when it was 20 time
Industry is fucked up, the back to sellin' niggas dimes
Singles is nickles, lotta albums done flopped
Lotta labels done dropped, you was signed, now you not

Who lie about sellin' drugs? Album ain't sell shit

Memphis Bleek,"I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts
In the brain, on the train, on his way to work
A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

So it's whatever with me, I walk through the mind
Feel whatever could hit me
My mind filled with anger hope the angels is with me
Change could be dangerous

Goin' legit could be signing your death certificate
Calling it quits could be the worst thing you do
I mean consider your enemy
He ain't gonna quit 'coz you quit now, is he?
Think about it

So what's on infinitely with me
I'm gonna turn to finity for the tough times I pour Hennessey
In memory of that one thing that meant one thing to me
I'm on, somethin' in me wishin' I wan't born

Come on, a gangsta say quttin' the game
Man, you lookin' at a dead man talkin'
He's always a brother or cousin to somebody you fought
Who might forgive but that don't happen too often

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts
In the brain, on the train, on his way to work

There's no such thing as the straight path

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
I said there's no such thing as the straight path

When the gun burn everythin'
You been taught you must unlearn
With one turn of the world, one fatal stroke I'd have lost all hope now I'm goin' for broke

So my new motto is smoke clear, kiss smoke
When you lose everything you love it's time to grip the snob
The time for talking is done, listen for one
If you got that weight on you I'll be liftin' you up
Hope you got that aid on you, I ain't givin' a fuck

If God love me, why I'm missin' my bro?
Is God ugly? If ya'll love me, nigga, wish me love
Appetite for destruction, I'm back popping [Incomprehensible] again
Drinkin' 'nac heavy until I'm happy again

Although I get comfort from friends
I won't be truly happy till I see him I again
So until that day I'm goin' out in the blaze
Hope the world forgive me 'coz I lost my way

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts

A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

Disappointedly, the craziest things happen
I mean, never knew I'd lose so many people, you know
Such a short time, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm only twenty five, know what I mean?

Lord, it was not even like I was fifteen know what I'm sayin'?
Lost all hopes by fourteen, know what I mean?
[Incomprehensible]
Lot of stress, man, right now

So much [Incomprehensible], yo, it's time, hold your head up [Incomprehensible]
And to my man Lou who just passed, know what I mean?
All this nonsense goin' on in the street
It's just that life we lead know what I'm sayin'

We caught up in it man, but just when you do dirt
Just know you can never clean it up man
There's no such thing as a straight path

I said there's no such thing as a straight path
Unless you come out the womb on a straight path
And if you live, way I live, dog, how long can that last?
When everyday of our life we live more like a task

I said there's no such thing as a straight path
I said there's no such thing as a straight path
",All About Me
Memphis Bleek,"Ayo we can't stop, won't stop never intend to
They feel the style inside em call it jujitsu
Back to new York all the shit that I've been through
Some niggas say they dogs but to me they jus shitzu's
I've been too, down through all the thoughts and the issues
All the principals had to keep it official
'Cause you don't want no nigga have to  grip that pistol 
I bought the pistol turn dudes to fish food
These dudes want me lookin all miserable
Don't want me getting paper, go to Jacobs , or spend a few
But I be in them interviews
Takin bout how I been in coups
And how tech will sprig a nigga like a innerlube 
Fuck round give you flats like an innertube
Poke you up just some of the shit I'm into
So fall back and maybe get a clear view
Of all my life and how I stare through the rear view

[Chorus]
You got me back on the block again
Back with the rock again
Watching for cops again
All about the profit and
They got me back in this game again 
But I swear we all gon be alright
(x2)

Yo they say it can't be done no one can do it
I'm straight off promo, right back to it
Back to the booth where I got a spit fluid
There's money in the streets, I gotta go pursue it
I'm the truest you know who, you know that ? produce it
As soon as Guru moved in the flow get stupid
I'm sort of a ?? cause I'm sound is acoustic
Ain't biting the style their wearing    hurdles to boost it
But, they say I'm slipping, ain't no new shit
The numbers never lie so you can't refute it
And don't confuse M with none of the bullshit
To the street I'm tied, like my mommas shoes is
I couldnt fathom the sight of me losing
Any Malcolm X Boulevard I'm bout movement
Im getting money I don't need ya two cents
The structures been build way before the blue print
   
[Chorus] 

Yeah it's M to the E,M heading to the top wit this
Say it's niggas on the rock that don't wanna rock wit this
Damn! Thats the thanks I get
When you know I'm the one that started all this fuckin gangster shit
Riding out with the peeps, smoking that refer with Jena 
'Cause me and Jena tag team and beatin the beat up
Rockin the Caesar, pushin the two seater with Jesus 
Niggas didn't believe us, now they hate when they see us
 In the crib got multiple features
Anybody gotta thought or none of them lease
This is a gift from God, I don't go to the preacher
I've flossed for years you watch me I'll teach ya
I just dropped M.A.D.E. I admit it was a sleeper
Anybody  without pocket, now I'm beatin the streets up
Put it in my hood, in two weeks it heats up
We've don stacked up but Jay will never leave us

[Chorus]",Alright
Memphis Bleek,"Dear summer I know you're gonna miss me
For we been together like Nike Airs and crisp tees
S dots with polo fleeces
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme couple years, shit I might just sneak in
A couple words and like peaches and herb
We'll be reunited and it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying ""How you still so good?""
Well I do this in my slumber summer
I ain't none of these half-assed newcomers, you know how I do summer
I drop heat, when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggas act up, I pick the gun up
Niggas back up; they know I'm not no frontier
I don't talk shit, I just flip it un' ya
Sorry Lance, I'm just trying to advance my quotes
I ain't making you the butt of my jokes
But let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, think we need some time away
They say if you love it, you should let it out its cage
And fuck it, if it comes back you know it's there to stay
It's tugging, at my heart, but this time apart is needed
From the public, who should've gave me the pulits'
Instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird, some queer, I still want them to share
And all the success I received, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in your family
You know they lame, you feel ashamed, but you love 'em the same
It's like when niggas make subliminal records
If it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it
You don't really want it with Hov, for the record
I put a couple careers on hold, you could be next kid
Keep entering the danger sone
You gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame, motherfucker come on
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note, 'bout to take another vaca'
On another boat, goddamn a motherfucker rode
His way out the hood, and I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could
Try and play like he Suge, then I gotta play like Dutch Schults
You pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove
And I ain't trying to fuck my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Now I'm Pulp Fiction, Colt four-fifth and
Young niggag that blast for me (blasphemy), no religion

Listen here summer baby, I just believe it's the right thing to do
I got a brand new bitch, corporate America
She showing me a lot of action right now
And I know you put me on my feet and all, but
I mean, it's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go baby, you gotta let me go

I'm done for now, so one for now
Possibly forever, we had fun together
But like all good things, we must come to an end
Please show the same love to my friends
Dear summer",Dear Summer

","First, Last and Only"
Memphis Bleek,"I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Your number, I'll call, and maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

My design one of a kind, yeah I'm on my grind 
Got a shorty that still trip, but I ain't lost my mind 
I just party and bullshit, my attitude, I'm good ma 
They say I'm hood rich because I drive big cars 
Getting guac 
Middle finger to cops 
They say when you meet the one, all the thug should stop 
I met this shorty the other morning, on my way in y'all 
She was bad, I didn't call, I'm a day in y'all 
But, that's the rules, we don't make em, we don't break em 
I don't sweat em, I forget em and find a way to shack em 
But, I put a holla to her, I spit some lava at her 
She from the burbs, I'm from the jecks, trust that don't matter 
She into books too, I'm off the books for the things I do 
But that's between me and you 
And I don't really full tag it a lot, I'm in the wagon a lot 
With different dimes on the passenger side 
I'm like

I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Your number, I'll call, and maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

Everyday I'm on my mind, but my minds on you (on you) 
All the time (all the time) 
And I scoop you like a solja' would 
I'm in the woods, top down, like I don't got a hood 
They say opposites attract, and it's true 
Cause girl I'm from the gutter, where the bundles will move 
And you, is from where its cool and quiet at night 
And ain't no young'ns supplying the white, right 
But that's a different story, lets get back to the night 
And you've got a body, I can handle it right?, right 
And I know you heard about me, beyond the rumors about me 
I'm the fliest a little youngin' could be, be 
And you'll see with us together, its money, diamonds, whatever 
Little momma is you riding with me?, me 
And I love the thing you do, so baby girl never change 
And forever we can do that thing 
Cause

I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Give me your number I'm gonna call you lady 
And maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

Now you know my stees' 
Cause I ain't gotta smooth that to do that thing 
And it only took a night to get it right, grip it right, hit it right 
Figure out that you a rider for life, down for whatever 
We go through it together 
You know the boys style, way beyond all the regular 
I need a switch, like a fein need a fix 
Every g, need a down ass chick, to click 
That's sick

I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Your number, I'll call, and maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Your number, I'll call, and maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster",Infatuated

Memphis Bleek,"Yo, I ain't the type that'll move from stress
No seeds, no sticks, that's all I twist
I twist backwoods up, that's what's up
When I come to your town better have some bud

I graduated grads, got my diploma
I could tell by your aroma you smokin' on Arizona
But you ain't got no Cali Kush
You're smoking on that backyard bush

Quiet it's kept like hush, plus
You ain't never had no Florida Crip
Beat that'd have you tripping
Room start spinning, you beginning to get paranoid, start hearing noises

Can't forget about the Chitown 'dro
That's why they say it's the windy city
Ladies could blow
Got a connect everywhere I go, never catch me with less than an O, you know

[Chorus]
You got stress in your life then we smoking tonight
My ladies gimme a light 
My ladies gimme a light
My ladies gimme a light
Niggas twist something up if you don't give a fuck if the Cali Kush
Got you stuck
My niggas gimme a light
My niggas gimme a light

You got your baby's momma beefing with you, better have that reefer with you
When she finish let the leaf remove you
I inhale it deep like the chief of voodoo
Handcuffing these beats like police will do you, that's how it works for me

Puffing on the purple, hit the booth with my eyes burgundy
I spit the truth on how the earth be
And all the bullshit I go through like dirt weed
And how I always come through like birth, be

Ten pounds, eight ounces of herb, be
I take two to the chest for all my niggaz that left
I blow it out, let them live through my breath

And everybody got a way to relax like everybody gotta pay their tax
If you live where I live everybody gotta blaze their gat
So everybody blaze up a sack, let's go

[Chorus]

It's been heavy on my mind, now I gotta leave it all behind
Smoke the pain away, chase the rain away
See the sun is gonna shine 'till the night
Smoke the pain away, chase the rain away

The president, he gotta legalize it
The governor, he gotta legalize it
Mayor, mayor gotta legalize it
Let all my niggas lead their lives as they see fit, 
That's how I see it
God damn, I'm a genius when I'm lit

Man fuck this shit man, Gu, twist something up
I'm gonna come out there, let the bridge ride on 'em

It's been heavy on my mind, now I gotta leave it all behind
Smoke the pain away, chase the rain away
See the sun is gonna shine 'till the night
Smoke the pain away, chase the rain away

Memphis Bleek,"I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts
In the brain, on the train, on his way to work
A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

So it's whatever with me, I walk through the mind
Feel whatever could hit me
My mind filled with anger hope the angels is with me
Change could be dangerous

Goin' legit could be signing your death certificate
Calling it quits could be the worst thing you do
I mean consider your enemy
He ain't gonna quit 'coz you quit now, is he?
Think about it

So what's on infinitely with me
I'm gonna turn to finity for the tough times I pour Hennessey
In memory of that one thing that meant one thing to me
I'm on, somethin' in me wishin' I wan't born

Come on, a gangsta say quttin' the game
Man, you lookin' at a dead man talkin'
He's always a brother or cousin to somebody you fought
Who might forgive but that don't happen too often

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts
In the brain, on the train, on his way to work
A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
I said there's no such thing as the straight path

When the gun burn everythin'
You been taught you must unlearn
With one turn of the world, one fatal stroke I'd have lost all hope now I'm goin' for broke

So my new motto is smoke clear, kiss smoke
When you lose everything you love it's time to grip the snob
The time for talking is done, listen for one
If you got that weight on you I'll be liftin' you up
Hope you got that aid on you, I ain't givin' a fuck

If God love me, why I'm missin' my bro?
Is God ugly? If ya'll love me, nigga, wish me love
Appetite for destruction, I'm back popping [Incomprehensible] again
Drinkin' 'nac heavy until I'm happy again

Although I get comfort from friends
I won't be truly happy till I see him I again
So until that day I'm goin' out in the blaze
Hope the world forgive me 'coz I lost my way

I said there's no such thing as the straight path
My brother got hit the other day by straight blasts
In the brain, on the train, on his way to work
A guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt

But as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5
Why would God decide to take his life?
There's no such thing as the straight path

Disappointedly, the craziest things happen
I mean, never knew I'd lose so many people, you know
Such a short time, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm only twenty five, know what I mean?

Lord, it was not even like I was fifteen know what I'm sayin'?
Lost all hopes by fourteen, know what I mean?
[Incomprehensible]
Lot of stress, man, right now

So much [Incomprehensible], yo, it's time, hold your head up [Incomprehensible]
And to my man Lou who just passed, know what I mean?
All this nonsense goin' on in the street
It's just that life we lead know what I'm sayin'

We caught up in it man, but just when you do dirt
Just know you can never clean it up man
There's no such thing as a straight path

I said there's no such thing as a straight path
Unless you come out the womb on a straight path
And if you live, way I live, dog, how long can that last?
When everyday of our life we live more like a task

I said there's no such thing as a straight path
I said there's no such thing as a straight path

I embraced it, but you didn't.
Your normal life, nine to five,
It's just not for me.
I need to feel alive!

I won't fall like the rest of them,
They've come and gone with the wind.
I hear the doubt in the back of your mind
But still I'll see this through to the end.

Maybe if you paid more attention,
Asked more questions and actually listened
You would see this is not just a dream,
But a path I've chosen that means everything to me.

Don't you see the minds that have changed?
Don't you see the lives that have been saved?
Don't you care to see the difference I've made?

Listen closely, the highways call my name.
Don't you see this is my everything?
It may not seem right to you
And you might not approve but it's real.
This is the only thing that makes me feel.

What more do I have to do
To finally prove myself to you?
What is it that you need to see
To finally believe this is who I'm supposed to be?

Most days I feel like your punching bag,
But I would never let it hold me back.
I just wish for once you knew
How it felt to be brought down lower than everything else.

Don't you care to see the difference I've made?
Listen closely, the highways call my name.
Don't you see this is my everything?

I come alive in the lights!
I come alive in the lights.

What will be written on your tombstone?
You sat behind a desk.
You had no backbone.
What will be written on your tombstone?
You sold your soul, grew old alone.
Would you prefer that I become a lifeless,
Hollow shell such as yourself?
Would you prefer that I give up my dreams
And lose all hope just like everyone else?

Don't you see the lives that have been saved?

Too much cheesecake too soon 
And don't let this happen to you 

Sometimes you find you're yearning for the quiet life 
The country air and all of its joys 
But badgers couldn't compensate at twice the price 
For just another night with the boys 

And boys will be boys will be boys 
They say love's a gamble hard to win easy to lose 
And while sun shines you'd better make hay 
So if life is your table and fate is the wheel 

Then let the chips fall where they may 
In modern times the modern way 
And as I was drifting past the lorelei 
I heard those slinky sirens wail (ooo) 

So look out sailor when you hear them croon 
You'll never be the same again oh no 
Their crazy music drives you insane this way 
So love me leave me do what you will

An' there's nothin' else to do

I heard someone behind me fightin'
So I turned to look and find out

One brother was a dopefiend
And the other was a dopeman
And the dopeman had a AK
Said he'll spray an' he's not jokin'

I wanted to go see the outcome

Or would she live her life without one?

And if they did they didn't care

Had come to get their interviews

And they can't see the tragedy
To them it doesn't matter
'Cause hey, it wasn't their family

I don't think I'll be back
'Cause it'll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
And leave the scene the way I came here

Judgment calls to reclaim the day, judgment calls like a silent executioner, 
Judgment calls for the fallen souls. 

Despite you we could be the saviours of our time, 
This our righteous crusade, healing those who suffer 
There is nothing left for you to take here. 
This is ours, the second life, we've come back to stop you.
 
How more must die for us to see 
That reason is spilling from the lips of a liar. 
No more genocide. 
Weeping for a million devastation's, 
Burning nations, annihilation's, and children lost.

Kiss goodbye to dreams of unity, 
Embrace the oath to destroy our brothers and our sisters. 

Slaughter their beliefs if they don't share our faith, 
If they are not our race, if their skin isn't ours and they don't share our tongue. 
What have we become? 
These racist wars of hate on streets and battlefields. 
It's our time to make a stand against the rule of the skeleton crown.

We are the victims of a war we did not want to see, 
It's our blood that stains the streets and the battlefields.

Nowhere to hide.

Arise against temptation, 
I will rise as the morning aftermath attacks, 
I am no victim, Arise.

I will not be the victim of another chemical war.

Mendoza Dance Parti,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

I've seen this room and I've walked this floor

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Le discours que me tins la femme qui me servait de mère
Je me souviens de mes frères, de l'expression de mes frères
Je suis parti, en silence ils me regardèrent
Le soleil brille à nouveau dans ma vie j'y vois plus clair
Aveuglé par les néons, comme Icare je perds
Donne-moi la main, maintes fois par toi j'ai voulu être choyé
Je me suis dévoyé pourquoi n'as-tu jamais su m'écouter
Je me souviens des discours qui enflammaient nos liens
Tout allait si bien mais il fallait recoller au quotidien
Ne dors pas car la mort se sert du somme comme appât
Je pars, pardonne-moi pour la paix que tu ne connais pas

Je me souviens

Je me souviens de toi m'écartant de ce monde malsain
Consciente d'aider celui à qui tu donnas le sein
Je me souviens de la tristesse des larmes dont tu t'armes
Si souvent pour toucher le coeur de ton enfant qui fout le camp
Je me souviens, c'est la pire torture, le meilleur remède
Aide-moi l'abandon gagne du terrain peu à peu je cède
Vos inquiétudes de me voir manipulé par les autres
Je me souviens à présent mon amour affleure le vôtre
Je me souviens, j'aimerais tant passer le bonjour à mes frères
Compagnons de galère et par dessus tout solidaires
Je me souviens toutes les fois où tu te moquais de moi
Je me souviens hélas le souvenir ne vous remplace pas

Je me souviens

Je me souviens mais désormais c'est loin bien trop loin
Le regret s'installe, je n'ai vu ma chance que quand elle passait au loin
C'est drôle j'ai peur, tout ces souvenirs mes fragilisent
Peur de vous perdre pourtant je n'ai agi qu'à ma guise
Le vent me grise, j'imagine le gris de mise
Le rituel respecté chacun lâche une poignée de poussière grise
De plus il pleut un petit peu, le ciel s'en mêle
Je me sens léger, je n'ai jamais autant souhaité avoir des ailes
J'ai froid frère même si les gens ici corps et âme se dévouent
Dans mes pensées, je me retrouve parmi vous
Je ne dors pas car la mort se sert du somme comme appât
Je pars, pardonne-moi pour la paix que tu ne connais pas

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

I can't shake loose from its teeth
Oh my god, set me free
I have no ability to cut my leash and walk away

To put my laws to rest till I'm done filling these holes

I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls

While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

He says it is their Waterloo
Vikings shouldn't mix their work and play

All that blonde hair for them to share

You could call it a fight
It's such a shame I never thought we would,
Wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't so good
I've had enough of that,
Other loves in days gone by.
It wasn't much I know,
Just enough, enough to make me cry

If you leave me, can I come too?
We can always stay
But if you leave me, can I come too?

Brillará la luna 
Ser el viento 
Con el que borra la bruma 
Y vivir mis sueños 
Junto a ti 
Dime que sí

Olvidar toda pena 
Que te enpaña tu sonrisa

Ven junto a mí
Quiero ver brillar 
Tus ojos que dan luz

Dijiste que vendrías
Que ni un día podrías 
Vivir sin mi amor

Dentro de un momento partiremos
Este será el peor de mis viajes
No sé si podré recuperarme
Y actuar en esa gran ciudad

Acariciar mi piel
Y siento tu perfume
Que me quema y me quema

Si tú no estás junto a mí
No puedo cantar no soy feliz
Y poco a poco, me vuelvo loco

And in a little while, he'll take my hand

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

Merauder,"Crossfire killing the innocent, another victim will fall
Who said their time has come, is it our lord, the one who we bow
Down before

Casket bears a child of our future, another victim from the realms

Of cities' crimes
Caught in the crossfire
Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
Wrong us and face our revenge

Silence will be our tool of trade, 'til our 9 shouts out

When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me nights of cheer

Con tu mirada recordando el litoral
Tu suerte quiso estar partida, mitad verdad, mitad mentira
Como esperanza de los pobres prometida

Andando solo bajo la llovizna gris
Fingiendo duro que tu vida fue de aquí
¿Porque cambiaste un mar de gente por donde gobierna la flor?
Mira que al río nunca le falto el color

Carito suelta tu pena
Se haga diamante tu lagrima entre mis cuerdas
Carito suelta tu piedra
Para volar como el zorzal en primavera

En Buenos Aires los zapatos son modernos
Pero no lucen como en la plaza de un pueblo
Deja que tu luz, chiquitita, le hable en secreto a la canción
Para que te ilumine un poco mas el sol

Cualquier semilla cuando es planta quiere ver la
Misma estrella de aquel atardecer
Que la salvo del pico agudo, refugiándola en lo oscuro
De la gaviota arrasadora de los surcos

Carito yo soy tu amigo
Me ofrezco árbol para tu nido
Carito suelta tu canto que el abanico
En mi acordeón lo esta esperando

Se van perdiendo

Porque años atrás
Tomar tú mano

Robarte un beso
Sin forzar el momento
Hacía parte de una verdad

Porque el tiempo pasa

A nada digo que no

María va pisando penas, la arena ardiente
María va calcina el monte un sol de fuego
María va temor pombero, palmar estero
María va

Quiso la siesta ponerle un niño a su soledad
De trigo y luna y de su mano
María va por el tabacal, tu paso
María va y se bebe el sol que huele a duende
María va

Andando el verano de sol y chicharra
A flores del monte, María, olía tu pueblo
Un tren perezoso, resuello y resuello

A calle regada, María, olía tu pueblo
A pura inocencia de niño pueblero
A calle regada, a flores del monte

Ayer se me perdió
Pastando lo dejé
Y desapareció

Cualquier información
Bien la voy a pagar
Las flores que dejó
No me han querido hablar

Mi unicornio azul
Ayer se me perdió
No sé si se me fue
No sé si extravió

Pero no tengo más
Que un unicornio azul

Si alguien sabe de él
Le ruego información
Cien mil o un millón
Yo pagaré

Mi unicornio azul
Se me ha perdido ayer
Se fue

Mi unicornio y yo
Hicimos amistad
Un poco con amor
Un poco con verdad

Con su cuerno de añil
Pescaba una canción
Saberla compartir
Era su vocación

Mi unicornio azul
Ayer se me perdió
Y puede parecer
Acaso una obsesión

Pero no tengo más
Que un unicornio azul

Y aunque tuviera dos
Yo sólo quiero aquel
Cualquier información
La pagaré

Se me ha perdido ayer
Se fue

Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente

Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo

Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volover a los 17

¡Caserón de tejas!
Te acordas, hermana
De las tibias noches
¿Sobre la vereda?

Cuando un tren cercano
Nos dejaba viejas
Raras añoranzas
Bajo la templanza
¿Suave del rosal?

¡Todo fue tan simple!
¡Claro como el cielo!
Bueno como el cuento
Que en las dulces siestas

¡Nos conto el abuelo!
Cuando en el pianito
De la sala oscura
Sangraba la pura
Ternura de un vals

¡Revivió, revivió!
En las voces dormidas del piano
Y al conjuro sutil de tu mano
El faldón del abuelo vendrá

¡Llámalo, llámalo!
Viviremos el cuento lejano
Que en aquel caserón de Belgrano
Venciendo al arcano nos llama mama

¡Barrio de Belgrano!
¡Caserón de tejas!
Donde está el aljibe
Donde están tus patios
¿Donde están tus rejas?

Volverás al piano
Mi hermanita vieja
Y en las melodías
Vivirán los días
Claros del hogar

Tu sonrisa, hermana
Cobijo mi duelo
Y como en el cuento
Que en las dulces siestas

Nos conto el abuelo
Tornara el pianito
De la sala oscura
A sangrar la pura
Ternura de un vals

¡Revivió, revivió!
En las voces dormidas del piano
Y al conjuro sutil de tu mano

Y el miedo enorme de morir lejos de ti
Que ganas tuve de llorar
Sintiendo junto a mí
La burla de la realidad

Y el corazón me suplico que te buscara
Y que le diera su querer
Me lo pedía el corazón
Y entonces te busque
Creyéndote mi salvación

Y ahora que estoy frente a ti
Parecemos, ya ves dos extraños
Lección que por fin aprendí
Como cambian las cosas los años

Al escucharte fríamente conversar
Fue tan distinto nuestro amor
Y duele comprobar que todo
Todo termino

Qué gran error volverte a ver
Para llevarme destrozado el corazón
Son mil fantasmas al volver
Burlándose de mí
Las horas de ese muerto ayer

Y ahora que estoy frente a ti
Parecemos, ya ves dos extraños
Lección que por fin aprendí
Como cambian las cosas los años

Angustia de saber muerta ya
La ilusión y la fe
Perdón si me ves lagrimear
Los recuerdos me han hecho mal

Que siga contento y nada más
Déjenlo que cante alegre
No quiero que tenga algún pesar

Hermano será del carnaval
Con un grito bien salvaje
Que tiemble en los montes el supay

Que vea salir el sol
Maduro y caliente en el tunal
Y a los pájaros que trinan
Dan ganas de echar un achalay

Alegrate corazón
Esto te lo puedo asegurar
Mientras quede un santiagueño
La chacarera no morirá

Todo es fiesta para mí
Después de la lluvia contemplar
El color del horizonte
No sé qué pintor podrá pintar

La primavera traerá
La flor amarilla del chañar
Y el zumbar de las abejas
Que van trabajando su panal

Sombra del algarrobal
Comienza la tierra a florecer
Tata Dios ha de regarla
Cerquita ya del amanecer

Mientras quede un santiagueño
La chacarera no morirá

Una luz que alumbra
Como un himno nuevo
El alma de todos
Los que se fueron
Y ya no están

Ellos nos dieron algo
Que es imposible no recordar
Madre ya descubrimos
Que bella cosa es la libertad

Es una canción
Bajo un día de sol
Libre, libre como ese amor

Es un corazón
Que late su son
Libre, libre como ese amor

Es una canción
Bajo un día de sol
Libre, libre como ese amor

Que si faltaran almas seguro Dios proveerá

Suerte que estoy acá y no me arrepiento
Suerte que un alma habrá en cualquier lugar
En cualquier momento

Donde te iré a escribir el comienzo de una mañana
Agitado existir yo no se porque no te calmas
No sabré que pedir si me entero que no me quieres
Ya van a ser las diez y a la luz del sol nadie hiere

Toda la magia, todo el dolor, todo es milagro.
Todas las noches que uno lloro no son en vano
Jamás imagine que estuvieras tan cerca mío
Y un solo beso, un solo color, marcaron mis labios

Canta por el que no esta
Se oye un ladrido muy lejos de aquí
Y alguien que llora por mí

Que la tierra me haga un hueco
Y me acune el dolor
Y que me llene la boca
De un canto mayor

Sin querer llore

Te amo y te ame
Nunca un secreto tan hondo
Se llega a saber

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto 
Me dio el corazón que agita su marco 
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano 
Cuando miro el bueno tan lejos del malo 
Cuando miro el fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto 
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto 
Así yo distingo dicha de quebranto 
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto 
Y el canto de ustedes que es el mismo canto 
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto

Gracias a la vida",Gracias a la Vida
Mercedes Sosa,"Aquí voy con mi canasto 
De tristezas a lavar 
A la corriente del río
Dejen, déjenme pasar

Que nos abrigó a los dos
Lo manchaste una mañana 
Cuando ni dijiste adiós

Lunita, luna
No me dejes de alumbrar

En la corriente del río 
He de lavar con ardor 
La mancha de tu partida 
Que en mi pañuelo quedó

Pero el río está tan lejos
Tan cerrado el matorral
Tan pesado mi canasto
Tanta mancha que lavar

Lunita, luna
No me dejes de alumbrar

Soy la triste lavandera 
Que va a lavar su ilusión 
Con la escobilla de espinas

Que no sale con jabón

En su cunita de tierra
Lo arrullará una campana
Mientras la lluvia le limpia
Su carita en la mañana

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca su diana
En el misterio del mundo
Que le ha abierto su ventana

Las mariposas alegres
De ver el bello angelito
Alrededor de su cuna
Le caminan despacito

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma va derechito
A saludar a la luna
Y de paso al lucerito

Adónde se fué su gracia
Adónde se fué su dulzura
Por qué se cae su cuerpo
Como una fruta madura

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca en la altura
La explicación de su vida
Cortada con tal premura
La explicación de su muerte
Prisionera en una tumba
Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma se queda oscura",Rin del Angelito

Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

Lo que puede el sentimiento no lo ha podido el saber
Ni el mas claro proceder ni el mas ancho pensamiento 
Todo lo cambia el momento colmado condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente de rencores y violencias 
Solo el amor con su ciencia nos vuelve tan inocentes 

Se va enredando, enredando, como en el muro la hiedra 
Y va brotando, brotando como el mus guito en la piedra 
Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

El amor es torbellino de pureza original 
Hasta el feroz animal susurra su dulce trino
Retiene a los peregrinos, libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros, al viejo lo vuelve nino 
Y al malo solo el canino lo vuelve puro y sincero 

Se va enredando, enredando, como en el muro la hiedra 
Y va brotando, brotando como el mus guito en la piedra 
Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

De par en par la ventana se abrio como por encanto 
Entro el amor con su manto como una tibia mañana 
Y al son de su bella diana hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín al cielo le puso a retes 
Y mis anos en diecisiete los combirtio el querubín 

Se va enredando, enredando, como en el muro la hiedra

Mercedes Sosa,"Calle angosta, calle angosta
La de una vereda sola
Yo te canto porque siempre
Estarás en mi memoria

SOS la calle más humilde
De mi tierra Mercedita
En los álamos comienzas
Y en el molino terminas

Calle angosta, calle angosta
Si me habrán ladrau los chocos
¿Un tun, tun quién es? Ya estaba
A dos picos la tonada
Calle angosta calle angosta
La de una vereda sola

Tradicionales boliches
Don Manuel y las miradas
Frente cruzando las vías
Don Calixto casi nada

Cantores de aquel entonces
Allí en rueda se juntaban
Y en homenaje de criollos
Siempre lo nuestro cantaban

",Calle Angosta
Mercedes Sosa,"Será porque me dueles
Será porque te quiero
Será que estoy segura que puedes
Llenarme de palomas el cielo
Sera porque quisiera que vueles
Que sigue siendo tuyo mi vuelo

Será que estas en celo
Velando la alborada
O acaso acumulando desvelos
Por dudas largamente acunadas
Tan solo se levanta del suelo
El que del todo extiende sus alas

Amada mía
Querida mía
¡Ay patria mía!
De tumbo en tumbo
Se pierde el rumbo

De la alegría
¡Vamos arriba!
Que no se diga
Que estas llorando

Que tus heridas
Mal avenidas
Se irán curando
Defiende tu derecho a la vida
Y juntas seguiremos andando

Sera que ya no quieres
Sufrir más desengaños
Que vives levantando paredes
Por miedo a que la luz te haga daño
Si ya no vienen llenas tus redes
Tampoco hay mal que dure cien años

Quizás en apariencias
Te alejas o me alejo
El caso es que sufrimos de ausencia
Con un dolor ambiguo y parejo
Amor no significa querencia
También se puede amar desde lejos

Amada mía
Querida mía
¡Ay patria mía!
De tumbo en tumbo
Se pierde el rumbo

De la alegría
¡Vamos arriba!

Que estas llorando

Un pan dulce y un poco de vino
Ya que no puedes comprar

Toma Luis llevalo a tu casa
Y podras junto con tu padre
La navidad festejar

Mañana no vengas a trabajar
Que el pueblo estara de fiesta
Y no habra tristezas

Señora gracias por lo que me da
Pero yo no puedo esto llevar
Porque mi vida no es de Navidad

Señora cree que mi pobreza
Llegara al final comiendo pan
En el dia de Navidad

Mi padre me dara algo mejor
Me dira que Jesus es como yo
Y entonces asi podre seguir

Viviendo, viviendo
Viviendo, viviendo

Mercedes Sosa,"Para cantar he nacido
Soy copla que el viento lleva
A veces canto en el árbol

Que se deshoja de pena
A veces bebo del fuego
Palabras de primavera

Mi sangre canta por dentro
Como la lluvia por fuera
La noche canta y convierte

Sus pájaros en estrellas
Pero cuando canta el pueblo
Musicaliza mis venas

Yo nunca miro a la rosa
Por su color de quimera
La miro porque ella tiene

A sangre de los que sueñan
Porque en sus gajos florecens
Las manos del que la siembra

Si el canto no se levanta
Como la hoguera del fuego
Si no libera las penas

De los que están en la tierra
De nada sirve que suene
La voz de la chacarera

Así como canta el río
Cuando la noche lo ciega
Y sin mirar su camino

Sigue su rumbo de piedra
Yo le canto a los que vienen
Caminando por la tierra

Mi copla es azul y estrellas
Y una guitarra encendida
En su corazón de pueblo

La vida sufre y agita
Con el perfil de sus bombos
Las esperanzas marchitas

Po eso canto a las cosas
Que me va dando la vida
A los changuitos de barro

Hondeando lunas perdidas
Al tallo con sus espinas
Y al hombre con sus heridas

",Para Cantar He Nacido
Mercedes Sosa,"Regreso a cantar tonadas
De sol a sol por la sangre
Como cantaba la vida

En la raíz de mi padre
Cogollo de vida nueva
La vida es una tonada

No quiero cantar olvidos
Ni recordar lo que amaba
Porque son como dos muertes

El olvido y la distancia
De lejos me queda cerca
Volver cantando tonadas

Una ronda de torcazas
Le hace ronda a los sauzales
Y soy niño de nuevo
Magia en la tarde, pájaro y canto

Cueca en el polvaderal
A Mendoza enamorada
Mi canto regresara

Voy de paisaje en el alba
Y me parezco al paisaje
Por fuera, el verde del clima

Por dentro, el sol de la sangre
El paisaje va conmigo
Y es un hermoso habitante

El viejo viento de otoño
Compadre de los nogales
Me trae, cuando regresa

La dulce voz de mi madre
De tanto cantar tonadas
Ya soy pariente del aire

Canta un rio de sangre calchaquí

Sueño con cantar en paz
Pero ya no puedo más
Solo pienso en liberar

Estas piedras son del viento
Estos muertos son del sol

Galopan tormentas en mi corazón

Mercedes Sosa,"Hay en este lugar mucho para dar
No te puedo mentir
Porque sos tan fiel me viste crecer
Me viste nacer y yo te vi reír

Cuando el cristal
Se apague en el mar, verás
Que toda esta canción es alegría

Hoy , hoy tal como ayer desaparecer
Es como sonreír

De tanto darte amor te hice feliz
Cortando el aire solo hasta sentir
Que no había perdón, que no había razón
Ya no puedo morir

Esa navaja gris, me corto la voz
Se hizo cuchillo al fin",Cuchillos
Mercedes Sosa,"Cuando estés mal
Cuando estés solo
Cuando ya estés cansado de llorar
No te olvides de mí
Porque sé que te puedo estimular

Cuando me mires a los ojos
Y mí mirada este en otro lugar
No te acerques a mí
Porque sé que te puedo lastimar

No pienses que estoy loco
Es sólo una manera de actuar
No pienses que estoy solo
Estoy comunicado con todo lo demás

Por eso
Cuando estés mal
Cuando estés sola
Cuando ya estés cansada de llorar
No te olvides de mí
Porque sé que te puedo estimular

Con tanta gente hablando a tu alrededor

Necesitas a alguien que te acompañe
Le estoy hablando, hablando, hablando a tu corazón

Oh no, puedes ser feliz

Ni las fronteras que separan a nuestro amor

Por favor
Sigue la sombra de mi bebe
Por favor

No bebas mas, no llores
Por favor, yo te prometo
Te escribiré
Si es que para de llover

Porque me tratas tan bien
Me tratas tan mal
Sabes que no aprendí a vivir

Estoy tan down

Bajo mi bufanda azul
Por las calles como Cristo

Una flecha en el aire
Es amor combatiendo

Quiero dártela ahora

Que es la hora del grito
Que es la hora del pueblo

Que nos una amorosa
Que nos pegue en el pecho
Que si vamos cantando
No podrán detenernos

Que tu voz la levante
Que la suelte en el viento
Y que suene a victoria
Cuando rompa el silencio

Que tu voz la levante
Que la suelte en el viento
Y que suene a victoria
Cuando rompa el silencio

La canción es simiente
Es de barro y de cielo
Es semilla y espiga
Es futuro y recuerdo

La canción es urgente
Va y viene compartiendo
Con dolor y alegría
El mismísimo sueño

Quiero dártela ahora
Con las ganas que tengo
Con el nombre de todos
Los que no se rindieron

Que tu voz la levante
Que la suelte en el viento
Y que suene a victoria
Cuando rompa el silencio

Que tu voz la levante
Que la suelte en el viento
Y que suene a victoria
Cuando rompa el silencio

Y que suene a victoria

Alegres porque él les canta
Se ríen de a pedacito
Igual que brasa soplada

Cuando Juan Ponce
Larga en el monte, su voz pastosa
El hacha de la luna se derrama
Hoja por hoja

Sus zambas floridas
Y sus ojos se le empañan
Cuando recuerda mujeres
Se le endulzan las distancias

Borracho en las madrugadas
La guitarra con su sombra
Lo llevan crucificado.

Acompáñame despacio
No hay pa' que darnos prisa
Que en las brasas del infierno
Yo también seré ceniza

Caricias a fuego lento
En to' el trigo de tu pan
Cuando ya no quede nadie
Solito te apagarás

Fueguito que vas bailando
Canciones y melodías
Desde el horizonte llamas
Llegan las traen del día

Con quebracho o algarrobo
Con ciprés o palo santo
Entibiando vas la noche
Y vas crujiendo en el llanto

Fueguito que vas quemando

Y embriagarme de tu magia

Solito te apagarás

No te entregues corazón libre, no te entregues

Y recuerda corazón, la infancia sin fronteras
El tacto de la vida corazón, carne de primaveras
Se equivocan corazón, con frágiles cadenas
Más viento que raíces, corazón, destrózalas y vuela

No los oigas corazón, que sus voces no te aturdan
Serás cómplice y esclavo corazón, si es que los escuchas

Duerme un niño y la piedad
Arma lejos un pesebre
Y juega a la navidad

Arma lejos un pesebre
Y juega a la navidad
Y juega a la navidad
Y juega, y juega, y juega

Pide limosna en un bar
Y lava tu parabrisas
Por un peso, por un pan

Si las flores del futuro
Crecen con tanto dolor
Seguramente mañana
Será un mañana sin sol

Duerme un niño y la piedad
Arma lejos un pesebre
Y juega a la navidad

Bajo el sol del mediodía
Se abrió tu boca en un beso
Como un damasco lleno de miel

Herida la de tu boca
Que lástima sin dolor
No tengo miedo al invierno
Con tu recuerdo lleno de sol

Quisiera volverte a ver
Sonreír frente a la espuma
Tu pelo suelto en el viento

Que entra el otoño en el corazón

No desensille
No vaya que, andando el vino

Mercenary 6,"I've tried to wrap my mind around the thought of you
I stretched myself so far I nearly come unglued
You hold the universe inside your hands
Still you thought of me

I can't believe
Is there no limit to your love for me
As shallow as this selfish heart can be
You are the maker of reality

And I stand in awe
You are God

[Chorus]
Who am I
To understand your ways
Who am I
To give you anything but praise
Who am I
To try and solve the mystery
Behind the heart and soul of all that I believe
Who am I

You're every reason for my heart to hope
Creator of the things I've yet to know
You are the river for my thirsty soul
You are my desire
You are God

I am your child
I will follow, who am I?
You gave your life
For my tomorrow

I realized it was all a lie
The guitars were ringing out
Last year's punk

No I couldn't bear the burden
So I threw it all away
I left my home and all my friends behind

Oh make me young again
And find some way to mend this broken heart
But it don't want me there singing about love anymore
It just wants to sleep out in the park

But it don't really matter what I say
You're just going to twist it anyway
Do you even listen to my words?
You just want to memorize the chords

I'm alone again because
All I really want's the truth
It's so rare to find that anywhere these days

An honest arrow caught my shoulder
In a sea of New York curves
I'll try to play the part of celebrity

Oh it's a headache
To walk that way
I was dressed up in all the wrong clothes
Oh do you remember what you were last year?
Do you remember your former roles?

But it don't seem to matter who I am
No one seems to want to understand that
I'm my mother's son
I'm a rolling stone

Tell me father, where you've been?

I would have nightmares in the day
While the adults were busy sleeping
And pretend to be awake

So I took a lover, oh yeah
Just to kill some time
She always loves to leave me hanging out to dry
If you're feeling lonesome baby I'll be your best friend
But don't expect to call me
If you need a hand

Oh I fell in love again
The kind that's like quicksand
I guess I didn't understand
I just like to lose my head

Oh I guess I made the same mistake
By opening my heart
I'm really just an animal
Made with human parts

Float over... float over
Now I've been in jail for a million years
Got all these people holding me back

I must be honest I hate this stone street
I park all ready to be robbed by people
I know, I know
And I'm growing tried

Just shoot a pigeon-holed pigeon
You're waiting to be sheave

Queen bee shields my eyes
From the force inside of my mind
And the force they may you blind

On the imaginary side
Even bored it is exciting
Being a drone is better than being alone
Bees may not be reasons to believe in love

I've finally found
I've finally found
Something to plug up this snorry mouth
Since the day ['cause today?] she said to me (she saw slee smore)
This house moves more than you (show so snow)
So I tell her I sleep (so so still snore)
To keep from thinking it through (bless me)
Now it's all I can do (___shovel snow ___)
When you pull the sheets up overhead (sometimes so you know)
And she sends me out
To shove snow drifts in my bed (she sings sun she snore)
You'll reach for the door
Arms feel weak
You'll make a mistake
And fly fly ahead
And it's all I can do
When you pull the sheets up overhead
And send me out
To shove snow drifts in my bed
Today she said to me (sneer snore seer soar)
Wanna get even with you more (sneer snore seer soar)
So I tell her she can (so show sea shore)
Even more than before (full mouth sneer roar)
You'll reach for the door
And your arms feel weak
You'll make a mistake
And fly fly ahead
And it's all I can do
When you pull the sheets up overhead
And send me out
To shove snow drifts in my bed
I've finally found
I've finally found
Something to plug up this snorry mouth
-?- see the sight
Posts [puffs?] around my bed
You thrust up and down
Arms around my head
Pressures not mine
Both in spirit and time
Whisper wine
I've finally found
I've finally found
Something to plug up this snorry mouth
So I bet she says to me (so show sneer snore)
Need to see [to my side?] (seal the sown shear stone)
But by the time I made the bed (sneer snore sheer shore)
Till you made up your mind (so so so so)
You'll reach for the door
Arms feel weak
You'll make a mistake
And fly fly ahead
And it's all I can do
When you pull the sheets up overhead
And send me out
To shove snow drifts in my bed

When out of the blue a rainbow rockets through
A kiss from an old flame A trip to the moon
Endlessly falling my way downtown someone to throw both arms around

Resting on our hands

It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy
That swept that afternoon
To paint that love
Upon a white balloon

And fly it from
The top-est top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something
Just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard
But the Captain shook his head

And away they soared
Climbing through
The ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

Mercury Rev,"The first hint of morning, someone's snoring
The cat upstairs is yawning and calling her name
She's in a playful way and a venomous mood
When she bites my ear, it's just for fun

And I believe her when she says, ""I'm glad we never wed""
Better off with the butter than the bread
Then quick, before she breathes, so gently I'm seized
My ear to her belly, whoa, nelly

It's just like she said
Better off with the butter than the bread
Now take it as a warning, the first hint of morning
There's good times ahead

Open the dawning, cars are crawling
Their rides outside are snoring, and it's pouring with rain
And in the strangest way the night behaves
In patterns and shapes that suggest that I escaped

And I believe her when she says, ""I'm glad you never left""
Better off with a lover than a friend
Than quick before she speaks
So quickly I ease my lips to her cheek and thank Jesus

It's just like she said
Better off with the butter than the bread
Now take it as a warning, the first hint of morning

Of the curse that you bear""

I'm a ghost in the night
I'm a coffin shaker
This graveyard site is mine
Take a look at the sky, see that evil eye
Tonight the moon is cold as ice
Oh yeah...cold as ice...oh yeah
There's a black horse waiting
Will HE be on time?
The graveyard's shaking
Should I turn my eyes and walk away
Take a look at the sky, see that evil eye
Tonight the Headless Rider rides
Midnight...let the churchbell ring
It's midnight, All Hallows Eve
It's midnight, All Hallows Eve
I see him rising from his grave
I see him rising from his grave.......
""The Chase""
On All Hallows Eve, Never to forget
He rides the open field
In search of his head
My GOD, he's so grotesque
Should I stay?
My GOD, a scythe in his hand
NO WAY

He's coming...I'm running
Deep inside I know I'm the one
He's coming...I'm running
Deep inside I know this is wrong
Help me, I'm falling down

I can smell that he's near
Will I ever never make it
Will I shed a tear
Oh it's strange how everything's
Changing
Now my life is fading away
In this hollow grave
I see a bony hand
Don't you ever never take it

Now my life is fading away

The mind in my headless body
Seems to be chained to the inside
I cannot move towards the light...
And as he rides away
Leaving me with this curse
I hear his laughter in the distance
Actually it's my laughter, he stole my head
Does this mean I'll be The One next year???

Mercyful Fate,"When the darkness eats away the day
And the moon bears witness to the graves

In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, The Light

Can you see the ghosts above our heads?
We are all in there with the dead

In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, The Light

In the darkness there is no holding back
There is no gold in black
Deep in the night
Everything is clear
Clearer than daylight

In the land of mystery we share
You can come along if you dare

In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, The Light

We are hiding in the shadows on your wall
We are watching as you kiss your little doll
When the darkness leaves the night
We cannot see The Light no more
No more
We are always in the shadows by your door
But when the darkness leaves the night
We cannot see The Light no more
No more

Mercyful Fate,"The mansion was right on the shore
Down by the lake
Nobody had lived here before
But the Devil himself

Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
They would all arrive in time

They gathered around the mansion
Thirteen in all
They had the same intention
Never to fall

Sent out through the night

Promising eternal life

So you want to be alive forevermore
I will turn the wheel of time
None of you will ever have to die
I will turn the wheel of time
Turning the wheel
Turning the wheel of time

But first we must play a game
The game of souls
Sit down! Don't move around!
Deal those cards!

They played all night 'till the morning light
And the Devil, he smiled on his own
They played all night for eternal life
Or the chance of losing their souls

High will win, low is the sin

They played all night in the burning light
The thirteen were sharing a nine

High will win, low is the sin

The final card was in the Devil's hand
The King of Diamonds would win

They could never leave the mansion
Forever inside
They had lost their souls of creation
But they were alive

Mercyful Fate,"Back in Tennessee, I saw a
Family haunted by an entity
It was a tragedy in another
Century
Oh...they never would know the
Evil one that came
Little Betsy, the age of 12
Living in a dream
The first one to scream
Invisible hands leaving their
Mark in the dark
Night after night
The bell witch attacked and
Attacked
Torturing Betsy, until a circle
Was held in candle light
Tell us who you are
Please tell us who you are
I am the air you breathe
I am the bell witch
I am a million years
I am the bell witch'
The bell witch decided
It was the time for the father to
Scream
Soon taken ill, never again to
Leave his bed alive
Tell us who you are
Please tell us who you are
I am the air you breathe
I am the bell witch
I am a million years
I am the bell witch'
'Goodnight John, see you in hell
Say bye bye to daddy, Betsy'
Call the doctor!!! 'I made sure'
Call the doctor!!! 'There ain't no cure'
That night john he died
And the bell witch never came again
Soon they realized, the witch had
Given John bad medicine",Bell Witch

She had betrayed, so they said
Some folk had seen her flying on a broom
All Hallows Eve, under the moon

The Inquisitor had left her behind
Gone for a bite, food on his mind
The sun was slowly trying to hide
Behind a town so full of pride
A sight Anna would never see again

Torture in the name of Christ, confess, oh you witch
Torture in the name of Christ, you witch you, confess

Sitting naked on the wooden horse
Weights to her legs, what a holy cross
Her bloody hands tied to her back
Her golden hair burned to black

Thumbscrews they had used
To crush each tip of her fingers to a pulp
In the torture chamber, she couldn't feel much more
Of anything, anymore

Torture in the name of Christ, confess, oh you witch
Torture in the name of Christ, you witch you, confess

Satan's mark, had slipped away
They already searched her body twice today
And it was all in vain

Oh Anna here they come again
Off the horse, strapado for a friend
Up she goes, higher and higher
Anna's crying, screaming: ""Liars""

Confess, confess witch
Confess, before you die

""Yes, yes, I am a witch, may Satan take you all""

Why did I go insane? Oh doctor kill the pain

My brain is burning up, Insanity...
When I look in the mirror, my mind is, Dead
Is it me on the other side?

Not a tear, not a trace, just stood there waving goodbye
Dead roses in my room, a love that died too soon

Listening to my breathing getting weaker all the time

MercyMe,"Why do we do the things we do
How can we sing when there seems no reason to
How do we smile when there's not much to smile about
When the world is down who are we to stand and shout
They wonder why we do the things we do

[Chorus:]
It's all because of this
It's all because of this
We've tasted love, tasted hope, tasted holiness
(Repeat)

And they wonder why, we do the things we do",All Because of This
MercyMe,"Stuck in a day
Like a runner with no race
Are you afraid
Your joy has been misplaced
It's been a while
Since I've seen you smile
How easy you forget 
So roll back the time
And there you will find
What never left

[Chorus]
The day heaven found you
The day the angels sang
Praises to the Father
Who called you by name
The moment you surrendered
The moment you were saved
Life as you knew it forever was changed
And all the above rejoiced

Remember the day
When God forgot your sin
Remember the way
That joy came tumbling in
There will be times

When you cannot find
A reason to stand and sing
But let this remind 
You time after time
You're a child of the King

[Chorus]

See them dancing
See them singing
All of heaven is rejoicing over you

[Chorus: x 2]",All of the Above
MercyMe,"Pardon me
If I've been acting strange
I haven't been myself lately
What you see
Is a person rearranged
Someone affected me greatly
And I've got so much to say
Ever since Jesus looked my way

[Chorus]
Gonna raise my voice like thunder
And leave the world in wonder of the change
The change inside of me
And I will never stop believing
That you are the reason for this change
The change inside of me

Everyday 
I'm taking in the view
Of His glory around me
I'm awake
And I have been made new
By the One who has found me
Words just can't say enough
When all I can feel is love

Your life You gave for mine to save
Its nothing less than a miracle
Your name I praise, because the change 
Inside of me is so beautiful

Come one, come all
To the presence of our God
This is where all hope and peace and joy are found

MercyMe,"Why I would I spend my life longing for the day that it would end
Why would I spend my time pointing to another man
Isn't that crazy

How can I find hope in dying, with promises unseen
How can I learn your way is better
In everything I'm taught to be
Isn't that crazy

[Chorus]
I have not been called to the wisdom of this world
But to a God who's calling out to me
And even though the world may think 
I'm losing touch with reality
It would be crazy 
To choose this world over eternity

And if I boast let me boast
Of filthy rags made clean
And if I glory let me glory
In my Savior's suffering
Isn't that crazy

And as I live this daily life
I trust you for everything
And I will only take a step
When I feel You leading me
Isn't that crazy

By a hope that never moves
And yet it moves me still

So I can take Your fame and glory
For all to see
No matter where Your hand may lead me

[Chorus]
I will go 
I will go
To make You known 
I will go

I can't keep You to myself
My heart is just too small
There's so many left to tell
That You came for one and all

Use me
So I can take Your fame and Glory
For all to see
No matter where Your hand may lead me

For the hungry and the weak
For the sinner scared to speak

MercyMe,"The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell
It goes beyond the highest star
And reaches to the lowest hell
The guilty pair, bowed down with care
God gave His Son to win
His erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin

Could we with ink the ocean fill
And were the skies of parchment made
Were every stalk on earth a quill
And every man a scribe by trade

To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry 
Nor could the scroll contain the whole
Though stretched from sky to sky

Hallelujah 
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

O love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure

MercyMe,"Now's the time
Let the redeemed celebrate
If you know what I know
You can't wipe the smile off your face
Oh people, stand up and praise

There's a reason to dance
There's a reason to sing
Of the sacred romance
With our Savior and King
We lift up our hands
We fall on our knees
To the Son of Man
The reason we are free

There's a reason
All glory to 
The King of Kings, Lord if Lords
Oh the value of Your worth 
No worldly treasures can afford

And we praise You forevermore

[Chorus:]

There's a reason to stand
There's a reason to shout, to shout Your name on high
So we take up our cross, there's a reason to die
Because Jesus is alive

There's a reason

You are the reason

To be still and know
That you're in this place
Please let me stay and rest
In your holiness

Beyond the music, beyond the noise
All that I need is to be with You

Whose glory goes on for eternity

MercyMe,"God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father a blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name

Joy to the world
For Christ our Lord has finally come
Let every heart receive its new born King",God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen
MercyMe,"[henry wadsworth longfellow]

I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on Earth, good will to men

And thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on Earth, good will to men
I can hear them
I can hear them
I can hear them

And in despair I bowed my head
“There is no peace on Earth” I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on Earth, good will to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor does He sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on Earth, good will to men

I can hear You
I can hear You
I can hear You
I could still hear You
The world can hear You",I Heard the Bells
MercyMe,"Go to sleep my Son
This manger for your bed
You have a long road before You
Rest Your little head

Can You feel the weight of Your glory?
Do You understand the price?
Or does the Father guard Your heart for now
So You can sleep tonight?

Go to sleep my Son
Go and chase Your dreams
This world can wait for one more moment
Go and sleep in peace

I believe the glory of Heaven
Is lying in my arms tonight
But Lord, I ask that He for just this moment
Simply be my child

Go to sleep my Son
Baby, close Your eyes
Soon enough You'll save the day
But for now, dear Child of mine
Oh my Jesus, Sleep tight",Joseph's Lullaby
MercyMe,"Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, loves pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

MercyMe,"I can count a million times
People asking me how I
Can praise You with all that I've gone through
The question just amazes me
Can circumstances possibly
Change who I forever am in You
Maybe since my life was changed
Long before these rainy days
It's never really ever crossed my mind
To turn my back on you, oh Lord
My only shelter from the storm
But instead I draw closer through these times
So I pray

Bring me joy, bring me peace
Bring the chance to be free
Bring me anything that brings You glory
And I know there'll be days
When this life brings me pain
But if that's what it takes to praise You
Jesus, bring the rain

I am Yours regardless of
The dark clouds that may loom above
Because You are much greater than my pain
You who made a way for me
By suffering Your destiny
So tell me what's a little rain
So I pray

Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty",Bring the Rain
MercyMe,"To everyone who's hurting
To those who've had enough
To all the undeserving

Help is on the way

What I've learned in my life
One thing greater than my strife
Is His grasp
So hold fast

Will this season ever pass?
Can we stop this ride?
Will we see the sun at last?
Or could this be our lot in life?
Please do not let go
I promise you there's hope

Hold fast
Help is on the way
Hold fast
He's come to save the day
What I've learned in my life
One thing greater than my strife

You may think you're all alone
And there's no way that anyone could know
What you're going through
But if you only hear one thing
Just understand that we are all the same
Searching for the truth
The truth of what we're soon to face
Unless someone comes to take our place
Is there anyone?
All we want is to be free
Free from our captivity, Lord
Here He comes

Hold fast
Help is on the way

What I've learned in my life
One thing stronger than my strife

When out of the weakness we must bow
And hear You say it’s over now

All I’m saying is it feels like a minute ago
Was summertime
Now has a chance for snow
So embrace every moment, every second my friend
I can’t believe it’s Christmastime again

You may wonder where I’m going
One day for sure, I know
Stop, enjoy the moment
Or kiss it goodbye under the mistletoe
Santa please if you’re listening
Since you’re taking requests
There’s only one thing that I’m wishing
Can I have a minute just to catch my breath

Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face, from a chapter in my past
Talked for a while, I smiled and then
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shed a couple laughs, shed some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts, walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once

No time to fight, we pretend love is so sweet
When all we're missin' is what's between the sheets
We used to find an hour between the stop and go

Whatever happened to staying up all night
When the bed became an island, it was just you and I
Our troubles would slip away, when you'd say

Ooh, stop what you're doin' and love me now
Ooh, I'm makin' my move, come on and love me now

Time, time
Time, time, time
All we need a little time
Just you and I
Magic ride

Ooh, stop what you're doin' and love me now
Ooh, I'm makin' my move, come on and love me now

Meredith Brooks,"Wash my hands, of crimes
Pour the water over, my skin, my spine
Cleanse my soul and ease my mind
I've been fixed on all the damage done
Why do I always forget how far I've come
I'm done dying for the past
I'm done dyin' for the past

Say all's forgiven now
Let's call it even, shall we
Can't you judge me for my love and not mistakes I've made
I swear by who I am and not by yesterday

I'm done dying for the past
I'm done dyin' for the past

In between black and white I disappear
Circle round the stone until I landed here

I'm done dying for the past
I'm done dyin' for the past

Meredith Brooks,"You were my wild companion
We were forever high, high, high
We burned the night around us
Sleeping could wait until we died
You wear the scars of passion
And since the crashing came
You've broken every promise
I walked away

I watched you fall
I was blind to ya
Was lying to ya
Like everybody else who watched you fall
Say they love you but they're laughing
When you crawl

It's such a weary feeling
When you've been stealing from yourself
Wishing the world away
Blaming someone else

No one can do this for you
Straighten your head, fix your faith
Take all the pain inside you
Wash it away

I watched you fall
I was blind to ya
Was lying to ya
Like everybody else who watched you fall
Say they love you but they're laughing
When you crawl

Did I hear you, did I try
Can I forgive myself for not standing by

I watched you fall
I was blind to ya
Was lying to ya
Like everybody else who watched you fall
Say they love you but they're laughing
When you crawl

Was lying to you
Said I love you but I'm laughing

Meredith Brooks,"Electricity, eye to eye
Hey don't I know you
I can't speak
Stripped my senses
On the spot
I've never been defenseless
I can't even make sense of this
You speak and I don't hear a word

What would happen if we kissed
Would your tongue slip past my lips
Would you run away, would you stay
Or would I melt into you
Mouth to mouth, lust to lust
Spontaneously combust

The room is spinning out of control
Act like you didn't notice
Brushed my hand

Forbidden fruit
Ring on my finger
You're such a moral, moral man
You throw it away, no question
Will I pretend I'm innocent

What would happen if we kissed
Would your tongue slip past my lips
Would you run away, would you stay
Or would I melt into you
Mouth to mouth, lust to lust
Spontaneously combust

I struggle with myself again
Quickly the walls are crumbling
Don't know if I can turn away

What would happen if we kissed

Would you run away, would you stay
Or would I melt into you

Are you slummin' around
You're looking for some action
On the west side of town
Your Nassau tan and your skintight pants

And the sky is gray
I watch the rain fallin' on LA

But I know I'll never be the same
Hey, I'm thinkin' of you
I don't know if I've lost or gained
Yeah, just a little like
Thunder and lightning
Chorus:

Thunder and lightning
Striking my heart again
Thunder and lightning

Steamy midnights on the phone
You're telling me you're all alone
Then you say
""I'd like to see you""
I don't care if it's truth or lies
I hear your voice and I'm hypnotized
Hey, it's a little like
Yeah, just a little like

Oh, is it pleasure or pain
(Chorus)

Is the thunder just frightening
When you're kissing me
Is this the way love begins
It's like thunder and lightning

(Chorus)
Thunder and lightning

Striking my heart
Burning my soul

Meredith Brooks,"I was walking down the street doing nothing
When she ran right into me and I was wondering
If it could be that she didn't see
But she spit that hatred at my face
I felt like I wanted to fight
When I saw her hungry eyes and broken heart
And recognized her pain
I saw it I know it and I walked away
Only love could save her anyway

I can't believe all the times that we bleed
That it's all for nothing
I will deny all the tears that we cry
That it's all for nothing

Sometimes I feel so confused when I look at us
And all we went through
After eight years of sharing every dream together
We don't even talk
Is that all there is
What we stood up for
Now we stand behind a million locked doors
And we can't even say that we'll be friends
Sometimes things just change and we don't know why
I don't think I'll swallow that kind of lie

I can't believe all the times that we bleed
That it's all for nothing
I will deny all the tears that we cry
That it's all for nothing

Do we all want to believe there's more to this
Than the lights just turning out

Now we gotta have a real conversation even if we don't
Know each other's situation
Who says we're powerless just because of all the injustice
There's still time to fight
You just gotta go you just gotta try
You're the only one that's standing in your way
Sometimes things keep changin' we don't know why
Don't think I'll swallow that kind of lie

I can't believe all the times that we bleed
That it's all for nothing
I will deny all the tears that we cry

Won't you make me weak

Hey now take me back to Eden
I'll fly when you call my name
Give me Heaven while I'm sleepin'
Back to Eden hey hey now now

I surrender tear my house down
Shame will lose its hold on me
A thousand nights I invite you
Crash through me

Hey now take me back to Eden
I'll fly when you call my name
Just like it was in the beginning
Back to Eden hey hey now now
Hey hey now now
Hey hey now now
Hey hey now now

I tremble when you pass through me
I burn like a rose on fire
This secret storm in me is humbled by your desire
I swallow your kisses deep
A million voices rise up
They cry they cry they cry out to me

Meredith Brooks,"If you could have told me
I wouldn't find my way back home
Never would have closed the door
I never would have left the phone unplugged all night
Waiting for the sunrise to take me out of here
Back to nowhere

Wish you could have told me
Who knows if I could have heard
Love don't make the reasons why
Some people just don't find the words to convey the truth
Of the passion that they're feeling
Why do I keep falling back?
Back to nowhere

Wishing you could hold me
Like you used to in the dark
Lay your body next to mine
But does it anywhere, does your star?
Are you sure you're fine?
But in case it's me you're missing
You should know I'd gladly go
Back to somewhere
Back to anywhere
I go
With you",Back to Nowhere
Meredith Brooks,"I'm just a little defensive
But I'll be okay tomorrow
This happens once in awhile
Till I'm back on my feet
Once I get out of bed
I'll come to my senses

A pair of shades can change it all
Maybe Superman will jump the wall
Whatever it takes to get on with the world

'Cause I'm bored with myself
So very bored with myself
More and more everyday
And I wonder if Marilyn ever felt this way

We're moving so fast
Why do I feel so empty?
There's clothes in my closet
But nothing to wear
It's a mysterious thing
The more that I acquired, the less hungry
I am but not more satisfied
There's India where I can chant
Therapy to rave and rant
Whatever it takes to distract me from being so

Bored with myself
So scary bored with myself
More and more everyday
And I wonder if Jacqueline ever felt this way

I'm a little uninspired
It happens to the best of us
I know I shouldn't take it hard
But I'm so afraid this time I'll never change
Won't shake it off, I'll just go insane

And I wonder if Loretta Lynn ever felt this way

Meredith Brooks,"Spirituality is a henna tattoo
That you wash off when you find something new to get into
Standing in the field with your flashlight blinking
'Cuz somebody told you the aliens were thinking they'd want you

So you think Big G gives a - how you get there
Buddhism, Communism, Hinduism,
Health Foodism, Lennonism, Sexism
What about your own ism
Just get real
Don't be a cosmic woo woo
Be who you are let everybody deal
Speak with your own voice just get real
Just get real like this

When I was fifteen I made my mother rant
'Cuz I joined a cult gave me words to chant to reach Heaven
So I used them for the lotto and won big money
They shouted you're in don't worry honey
This ain't 7-11 get in and out
Pop psychology words don't mean anything
When you throw them around to be cool
What goes around comes around
That's what they say
Catholicism, Footballism, Judaism, Racism, Manism, Womanism
What about Humanism

All I need is this bed
And this guitar what more, what more?

I have everything, I have everything
I have everything but you

I hang around the place you do laundry
And I don't even wash a thing

But not the kind I want to kiss

I have everything, I have everything

Maybe it's simple
But what else is there but love?
You can have all the money in the world
But it doesn't matter if I climb another dome alone

We bled inside each others' wounds
We all had caught the same disease
And we all sang the songs of peace

Callous, murderous, malignant, belligerent, ignorant?
Would you believe me, would you like that
Or would you prove me wrong and fight back?

And let it shine on you through my eyes
You see, we're all in the same boat trying to float
So everybody grab a oar, we can make it to shore

Another slap on her face

Mother's always working
Slinging beer on the side
Her dad's watching TV
And he's still getting high
She knows he'll be waiting
Tryin' to get her alone
She hangs out on the corner

Hanging on by a thread
She can't stop the screaming

As I walk away
One thing's for sure last thing you're 
Ever gonna hear from me
Are my footsteps as I walk away

But I'm good to go I gotta toe the line

Is like a kick in the head
Don't count me out just yet
Place your money here instead

Dear God I need a change
I can't keep hiding
Wishing the mirror was lying

Show me where do I look
I know there must be a plan
Though I can't see one
I go through the motions anyway

Here I go again
Walking down a road I've never known

[Chorus:]
I want to go where lovers meet
I want to breathe the air they breathe
I want to touch the dreams they dream
When I find someone to love
I want to go where lovers
Where lovers meet

I know my faith is blind
I'll take my chances
I'm tired of just surviving
I 'm not wasting any time

Just like tears in the rain
No one can see
Inside my heart is crying
Telling me I can't lie any more

Here I go again
Walking down a road I've never known

I want to go where lovers meet
I want to breathe the air they breathe
I want to touch the dreams they dream
When I find someone to love
I want to go where lovers meet
Feel the wind beneath my feet
Oh, I want to feel that complete
When I find someone

I spent half my life
Wasting my time
I don't want to hear my heart beating alone
Oh

[Chorus]

I want to go
I want to go where lovers meet",Where Lovers Meet
Meredith Brooks,"I was wrong this was my mistake
I resolve to save what's mine again
I've always wanted to believe in things
And I pity you for taking that from me

You tried to erase the guilt that's on your face
But you're just hiding out behind your cool
Like a hurricane you changed
And because you took the blame
You thought that would be enough 
And then I'd be on my way

[Chorus]
Did you think that I would let you forget me? 
Did you think that I would just lie on the floor? 
As you walked into you future did you think I 
would give you control?
Well, you don't know me
Did you think that I would simply forgive you? 
Maybe you think I'd just lay down and die
As you walked away, didn't you think I'd survive? 
Well, you don't know me

My world changed like a thought replaced
I was faithful to the promises you made
When you say my name
Will it sound the same
As when you used to talk to me so cool ?
You want me to pretend
So you'll have your happy end
To wash away your guilt
And make it easier for you, oh

[Chorus]",You Don't Know Me
Meredith Brooks,"You're everywhere I walk
I don't remember if I smiled
I don't think we talked
But you always hung around a while
And I don't know your name
Yeah, I think that you were tall
I don't remember if I was ever nice to you at all

[Chorus:]
Suddenly you come undone
You tell me I'm the only one
You hold my head up with a gun
And tell me that we are in love
You touch me, and you want the same
I close my eyes and start to pray
And tell you I will be the way you want 
If you will only say your name

You wrote me everyday
I never knew that it was you
I just threw it all away
I didn't know what else to do
Jesus told you to find me
And never ever let me go
And we would be so happy
He promised you that I would know

[Chorus]

I am sorry, so sorry, oh
I am sorry Jesus forgot to tell me

I see that you are crying
I know you only meant to be with me
Maybe I was hasty
I should have listened more carefully
Please, tell me it's not too late
Your decision has been made
Before you pull the trigger
Please, won't you tell me your name?

[Chorus]",Your Name
Meredith Colby,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Meredith d'Ambrosio,"I live my life, one after the other

It never lasted long enough
You come to me when something gets broken
But I won't let it get me down

Blame it on my youth
Put it to the circumstances

I'm an accident waiting to happen

Meredith d'Ambrosio,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Over the shadows and the rain

Meredith d'Ambrosio,"Spring in Manhattan
Starts after dark
After a lazy afternoon
In Central Park

Washington Square may be where
You'll feel her first warm touch
Down in the village, you'll find
She may be much, too much

Still if you fall in love
She'll bless you with a song

And if you'll listen to every word
The song she'll sing will bring

To stay all winter long

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Waving a briefcase a hollerin'
There's mailman stumbling to his truck
With a dog on his leg that sure could use a collar and

Wish you had my point of view

I can see two skin-kneed boys down at the creek
Smoking daddy's cigarette butts
Down there's a man cussing me
'cause he got his car all washed and waxed up

But I ain't done nothing wrong
I'm just a bird singing my song

Looking down on the world below
Here they come and there they go

And I might go out on a limb
Just to get a better look at them
Oh no, I'm a little too close
Better fly away

There's a See Rock City birdhouse
Where I like to hang out with but Johnny Shoots BBs
And Mrs. Cole's got a cement bowl
Where I'd like to take a bath but the cat might eat me

So I'll just stay up here
At least until the coast is clear

Lookin' down at the world below

Some of them I keep to myself
Just remember no matter what you do

And everything you dreamed of
Just suddenly appears
The future can unfold an instant miracle
In any given moment

Why does time move slowly
When you're lonely
The races wildly once you find someone
I have found no rules apply
I'm waking up the dead of night
To say that I've been brought back to life
I am living proof

In any given moment
The world can spin around
The lonely heart can feel love
And lift it off the ground
And everything you dreamed of
Just suddenly appears
The future can unfold an instant miracle
In any given moment

I wasn't even looking for you
I wasn't hoping for the moon
I guess it only goes to show you
Never underestimate
The power of the hands of fate
To show you what is true
From right out of the blue

In any given moment
The world can spin around
The lonely heart can feel love
And lift it off the ground
And everything you dreamed of
Suddenly appears
The future can unfold an instant miracle
In any given moment

Yeah, the future can unfold an instant miracle
In any given moment",In Any Given Moment
Meredith Edwards,"You play a good game
You seem so secure
I knew when we met I'd never forget
Those twinkling eyes of yours
Behind your sweet smile
The confident words
I saw room for me
And I wanted to say
Things that you've never heard

[Chorus:]
There are places in your heart
That have never been touched
Waiting for someone to show you true love
And I wouldn't have to reach very far
To touch those places in your heart

Whatever it takes
To make you believe
From the depths of my soul, I want you to know
I would do anything
I will be here
Just a whisper away
When you're ready to fly, I will be by your side
Forever and always

[Chorus]

Only a love that is true
Could ever reveal to you

Meredith Edwards,"You might say she started out 
Without what folks round here 
Call a fair shake 
A little girl with no shoes on her feet 
Tangled hair 
Not a nickel to her name 
And not a care 

But no matter what 
Her smile came shining through 

[Chorus]
Cause a rose is a rose is a rose 
And everybody knows a little 
Sunlight and room to grow was all she needed 
And seeing her face in town was like 
Spring time coming around well 
I guess it just goes to show 
A rose is a rose is a rose 

Tommy lee always knew 
What he would do 
Cause she moved him deep down in his heart 
And everybody smiled at such a pair 
Could they last 
With two different worlds 
And sides of the tracks 

But no matter what 
Their love came shining through 

[Chorus]

A rose is a rose 
It always finds a way to shine

you don't love back

there's no denying 

That I'm a slow learner 
can't seem to get it through my head
must be a slow learner 
I still ain't got it yet 
I drew a blank on the first time 
a little fuzzy on the second time 
I got a clue on the third time 
now I'm slowly learning
you ain't ever gonna love me 

Never any good in chemisty 
that's why it's hard for me
to see we ain't got none 
you don't want me I'm a crying mess
and I'd listening to my common sense if I had some

Just look at him laughing out loud
The life of the party
And look at me trying to be strong
Fightin' the tears
How can he stand there acting like we never even happened

So this is the heartache I've heard about
The part of love I could live without
Giving it all, loving in vain
This is the heartache I've heard about
A great future behind me now
As the memories run down my face
This is the heartache

It's not like me to become
A wall decoration
But here in the corner at least
All eyes aren't on me
So that's the new girl that he's seein'
I think it's time I should be leavin'

So this is the heartache I've heard about
The part of love I could live without
Givin' it all, lovin in vain
This is the heartache I've heard about
A great future behind me now
As the memories run down my face
This is the heartache

Is love only a trick of the night
An illusion done mirrors, smoke and light

Hoah, so this is the heartache I've heard about
The part of love I could live without
Giving it all, lovin' in vain

Meredith Edwards,"If all my good fortune ended
If my whole world came tumbling down
If suddenly everything I'm sure of
Came crashing to the ground
If all my worse fears came true
If I lost every dream I ever knew

You, you would be the faith that carries me
You would show me the grace to make me see
The truth, whatever storm I fly into
All I really need to get me through
Is you

So I can take my chances
I can swing from the trapeze
I'm not afriad of falling
I know that you'll catch me
And when my sky is running out of blue
When I just don't know what to do

You, you would be the faith that carries me
You would show me the grace to make me see
The truth, whatever storm I fly into
All I really need to get me through
Is you

When I don't believe anything
When I'm spinning in a hurricane
When the world is full of strangers
I've got you

Oh you, you will be the fate that carries me
You would show me the grace to make me see
The truth, whatever storm I fly into
All I really need to get me through

Whenever I'm down
Whenever all my dreams come crashing to the ground

Meredith Edwards,"I am as guarded as Alcatraz when I want to be
Never been disarmed by boyish charm
So darlin' you tell me
Why do I throw down my weapons
When you smile so harmlessly

I stay as calm as Mona Lisa
Keep my cool, come what may
The perfect picture of composure
So it bothers me to say
That I go wild as a Picasso
When you look at me that way

[Chorus]
I'm helpless
I'm breathless
I can't guess
Why you get to me
I'm fallin'
So hopelessly
You get-you get to me

I am as valiant as Galahad
In the face of fear
Never one to run from danger
So to me it isn't clear
Why I tremble like a coward
When you whisper in my ear

[Chorus]

I stand solid as Gilbraltar
Against life's rain and wind
A will of granite that nobody yet
Has made a blemish in
But I liquefy like quicksand
When your fingers touch my skin

[Chorus]

Your sweetness
My weakness
Can't fight this
You get to me
You thrill me
You kill me
I will be

I'm helpless
I'm breathless
I can't guess why

Detours, fences...I get defensive

I know you've heard it all before
So I don't say it anymore
I just stand by and let you
Fight your secret war
And though I used to wonder why
I used to cry till I was dry
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside
Oh, Joey, if you're hurting so am I

Joey, honey - I got some money
All is forgiven.  Listen, listen

But if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you
And when you said I scared you
Well I guess you scared me too
But we got lucky once before
And I don't want to close the door
And if you're somewhere out there
Passed out on the floor
Oh Joey, I'm not angry anymore

And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you
And when you said I scared you
Well I guess you scared me too
But if it's love you're looking for
Then I can give a little more
And if you're somewhere drunk and
Passed out on the floor

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
