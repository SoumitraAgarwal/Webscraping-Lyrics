Cristian Castro,"Lloran las rosas el rocío ya se a convertido en Lágrimas
Te me has ido te eh perdido lloran las rosas
Y llora mi alma va gimiendo con las alas recortadas
Te me has ido te eh perdido llora mi alma

Lágrimas que ahogan mi corazón
Lágrimas palabras del alma
Lágrimas mi mudo lenguaje de amor

Lloran las rosas porque no puedo estar sin ti y
Lloran celosas de que no quieras ya venir
Y entre otras cosas
Yo lloro por ti

Falta el perfume de tu piel por donde anduve
La silueta que veía cuando tu dormías

Lágrimas que ahogan mi corazón
Lágrimas palabras del alma
Lágrimas mi mudo lenguaje de amor

Lloran las rosas porque no puedo estar sin ti y
Lloran celosas de que no quieras ya venir
Y entre otras cosas
Yo lloro por ti

Lloran las rosas porque no puedo estar sin ti y
Lloran celosas de que no quieras ya venir
Y entre otras cosas
Yo lloro por ti",Lloran las Rosas
Cristian Castro,"Si, he vuelto a sonreír
He vuelto a respirar
No me preguntes, porque no lo se
Acaso sobreviví a tanto dolor?

Hoy no volverá a ocurrir
No volverá a pasarme nada
Hasta que quiera yo
Y llegue otra y me enamore
Y me perfume en sus palabras
Como algún día hiciste tu

Y lloraré, y moriré
Y volveré a nacer de nuevo
Aunque alguien mas sera tu cielo
Y reiré, y viviré
Recordando cada beso
Que se quedo en mis labios preso
Lloraré

Si, he vuelto a sonreír
He vuelto a respirar
No me preguntes porque no lo se
Acaso sobreviví a tanto dolor?

Ya estas en libertad
Puesto querías volar
Y siempre lo hiciste
Aunque regresaras
No era yo quien te obligaba
Eras tu y nadie mas

Lloraré, y moriré
Y volveré a nacer de nuevo
Aunque alguien mas sera mi cielo
Y reiré, uh, y viviré
Recordando cada beso
Encarnando en tus caricias
Mi deseo

Lloraré, y moriré
Y volveré a nacer de nuevo
Aunque alguien mas sera mi cielo
Y reiré, uh, y viviré
Recordando cada beso
Que se quedo en mis labios preso

Lloraré, moriré
Y volveré a nacer de nuevo",Llorare
Cristian Castro,"Quizá yo nunca pude darte
Lo que otros ya te han dado
Tal vez no supe amarte
Del modo que soñaste
Como tu cuerpo estaba acostumbrado

Será que te han querido tanto
Que yo jamás pude igualarlo
Explícame el motivo
Tan sólo eso te pido
Porque este adiós no está justificado

Si yo siempre te di
Lo mejor de mí
Y hoy vuelas de mi vida
Haciéndome una herida
Que no merecí

Si yo siempre te di
Lo mejor de mí
Tal vez no fue suficiente
Y aunque tú nunca lo aceptes
Sabes que siempre fue así

No sé, no quiero ni pensarlo
Que tú fingías al besarnos
Que cuando yo te amaba
Tú no sentías nada
Y que este tiempo nuestro

Ha sido en vano
Ya sé que dices ser de nadie
Y estar conmigo no te obligo
Si ya estás decidida
Y es hoy la despedida
Dime mi amor que error he cometido

Si yo siempre te di
Lo mejor de mí
Y hoy vuelas de mi vida
Haciéndome una herida
Que no merecí

Si yo siempre te di
Lo mejor de mí
Tal vez no fue suficiente
Y aunque tú nunca lo aceptes
Sabes que siempre fue así",Lo Mejor de Mi
Cristian Castro,"Tu y esa boca sensual
Siempre tan natural
Me gritan quiero
Yo te voy a besar
Y te voy a llevar al mismo cielo
No me animo a decirte que no
Mientras sigo emborrachándome
Con tu perfume  mujer
Me rindo entero a tus pies
Y otra vez

Me tomas , me sueltas
Te esfumas
Y siempre le pregunto a la luna
Que tienes en el corazón
Si cuando vas si vienes
Me tomas, me sueltas
Me apuras
Ya no se que receta me cura
Este ataque de amor

Tu me juras ser fiel
Y yo vuelvo a caer
En tu veneno
Yo no puedo entender
Tu forma de ser
Pero aun te quiero
No me animo a decir que no
Mientras sigo emborrachándome
Con tu perfume mujer
Y otra vez

Me tomas , me sueltas
Te esfumas
Y siempre le pregunto a la luna
Que tienes en el corazón
Si cuando vas si vienes
Me tomas, me sueltas

Por que te me esfumas
Si es mio tu corazón
No se que receta me cura

Cristian Castro,"El tiempo paso
Y nunca volvió
Ya no le hago falta
Ya tiene otro amor
Aquí me dejo
Y no me quedo
Ninguna esperanza
En el corazón

Que pesar,
Que dolor
Volverá,
Me engañó

Por favor,
Que sufras y que pagues
Que sufras y que pagues

Por favor,
Que sufras y que pagues
Que sufras y que pagues

Nadie,
Nadie como yo para cuidarte
Nadie como yo para besarte
Un amor que nunca imaginaste
Como yo
No hay nadie
Ahora me veras
Por todas partes
Yo se que algún día volverás
No te salvarás
De mi

Yo te di mi amor sincero
Pero tu no tienes corazón
Algún día sabrás
Que no hubo nadie como yo
Y pagarás

Que pesar,
Que dolor
Volverá,
Me engañó",Nadie
Cristian Castro,"Toma ya todas tus cosas
Y después te vas
Fuera de mi cama, de mi vida
No te aguanto mas

Esta vez seré valiente
Y no me tirare a sufrir
En los brazos de una tonta
Que me miente sin sentir

Vete ya
No cambiaras
Te hace falta
Aprender a llorar

Y yo no me quedaré
Como una estúpido
Y hoy me marcho y se
Que así te olvidare

Necesitas amor
Tú mas que yo
Le falta color
A tu corazón

Necesitas amor
Para olvidar
El mal que me has hecho
Y así volver a empezar

Ahora que lo pienso
No se que sucederá
Si me dejas solo contra el viento
Quien me ayudara

Tengo ganas de abrazarte fuerte
Y no dejarte ir
Tengo ganas de quererte
Pero tu me haces sufrir

Vete ya

Pues sin ti sera difícil
Esta vida pide mas
De lo que da, ah

Y tal vez esto se vuelva, insoportable
Pero es mas insoportable la verdad

Necesitas amor

Esperar
Yo necesito tu amor",Necesitas Amor
Cristian Castro,"Puede separarme la distancia de tu abrazo, 
Puede distanciarme el mar de tu retrato; 
Puede que una opción sea el resignarme, 
A rogar al tiempo eterno a que pase
Pero al menos nadie puede arrebatarme
El mirar el cielo y recordarte; 
Oh, nadie

Ni tampoco pueden evitar, 
Que hasta sienta ganas de llorar
Oh, nadie oh, no!

Quisiera estar en el aire, 
Para llegar hasta ti mi amor
Quisiera estar en el aire, 
Para sentir que me respiras
Y yo quisiera estar en el aire,
Para soplarte y besarte toda
No te olvides de soplarme tú también
Y ser mi aire; ser mi aire

Me hace tanta falta verte y sentirte, 
Para que negar, lo obvio es imposible 
Pero al menos nadie puede arrebatarme
El mirar el cielo y recordarte; 
Oh, nadie

Ni tampoco pueden evitar,
Que hasta sienta ganas de llorar
Oh, nadie; oh, no!

Quisiera estar en el aire, 
Para llegar hasta ti mi amor
Quisiera estar en el aire, 
Para sentir que me respiras

Cristian Castro,"Una noche de pasión tu inocencia y mi pudor
Se encuentran yo de paso y tu soñando iglesia
No te quiero herir tengo que partir
No me detengas

Cuanto quisiera
Ser el príncipe azul
Que tu esperas
Soy tan solo tu huella

Seré para ti una noche fugas
El agua del rio que no vuelve a pasar
Seré para ti un sueño sin terminar
Ámame hoy mañana empiézame a olvidar

Se que te cuesta comprender que no me ancle a tu querer muñeca
Mi alma de quijote no me deja yo nací para volar no te quiero
Engañar no tengo tregua cuanto quisiera ser el príncipe
Azul que tu esperas soy tan solo tu huella

Seré para ti una noche fugas
El agua del rio que no vuelve a pasar
Seré para ti un sueño sin terminar

Cristian Castro,"Solo porque
Lo nuestro ha terminado
No significa que
No fue hermoso aun en
Tiempos malos

Fue real
Con dicha y con dolor
Hasta el final

Fue por amor
Evitando hacernos daño
Que nos dijimos adiós
No somos de vivir atados

Tú y yo
Logramos escapar
De una traición, a tiempo
y no sumarle otro fracaso
Al corazón

El amor, si acaba
Bien no acaba
Se niega a morir
y vuelve siempre a casa
El amor si acaba

Bien no acaba
Insiste en luchar
No acepta el final
Se logra salvar

El amor, si acaba
Bien no acaba

Lo hicimos bien
No vale reprocharlo
Lo que pudo ser
Jamas estuvo a
Nuestro lado

Tú y yo
El amor si acaba
Bien no acaba",Si Acaba Bien
Cristian Castro,"Si tú me amaras volvería
De nuevo a nacer,
Descubriría mi alma
Un nuevo amanecer,
Mi corazón cansado
Por fin tendría un hogar,
Habría mil motivos para despertar,
Para continuar

Si tú me amaras mi pasado
Estaría de mas,
Mi vida empezaría
Al verte llegar,
Renunciaría a todo
Sin culpabilidad,
Por ti yo mataría
Por ti me moriría

Si tú me amaras te haría sentir
Que yo soy digno de ti
Que eres lo único,
Que importa para mi
Si tú me amaras detendría el tiempo
Para darte amor eterno con afán,
Si tú me amaras

Si tú me amaras no me haría falta
Nada mas,
Reflejarías en tus ojos
Mi seguridad,
Contigo lo imposible
Sería realidad,
Por ti yo mataría
Por ti me moriría

Si tú me amaras te haría sentir
Que yo soy digno de ti
Que eres lo único,
Que importa para mi
Si tú me amaras detendría el tiempo
Para darte amor eterno con afán,
Si tú me amaras

Si tú me amaras detendría el tiempo
Para darte amor eterno con afán,
Con toda el alma
Revelarías mis anhelos

Cómplices serían tus brazos
De mis logros y fracasos
Toda mi vida
Te adoraría
Si tú
Me amaras",Si Tu Me Amaras
Cristian Castro,"Como sueño ver tu cuerpo desmayado junto a mi 
Sobre mi almohada y tu pelo gris de cielo en penumbras despeinar

De madrugada si consigo ser tu dueño 
Agua nueva va naciendo de mi cuerpo en mis sueños te poseo 
Y recorro tus rincones mas secretos
Pero despierto y no te tengo 

Ven a quedarte junto a mi 
A salvarme de morir 
Ven conmigo a refrescarte de agua nueva y ser feliz

Ven a mis ganas de vivir 
A quedarte junto a mi 
Que aquí tengo para ti 
Agua nueva que hay en mi

Cristian Castro,"Amor como el cielo
Se fue poniendo negro amor
Como siento
Haber perdido tu calor
Y con el viento
Se va a pagando la ilusión
Que llevo dentro
Y ahora es el momento
Por eso me lamento

Solo me encuentro
Y hoy,
Hoy he vuelto a recordar
Todo lo que pude amar
Y si puedes esperar, escucha
Te he venido a suplicar
A pedirte una vez más
Que me des otra oportunidad;
He venido desde allá
A decirte la verdad
Que sin ti ya no puedo colar
Ay amor
Ay, amor, amor

Ya no puedo
Me falta fe y consuelo amor

Solo espero un corazón sincero

Cristian Castro,"Sin saber siquiera adonde ir
La lluvia me vistió el día gris
Y el tiempo se burlo de mi
Marginado sin tu amo

Sin tu amor se va
La ilusión de mi vida
Sin tu amor
No hay mas y el dolor
Me quema las heridas

Tuve que rezar mas de una vez
Tuve que aprender lo que no se
Pasar todo en vez y sentir
El pacto que hubo entre los dos
Lo has quebrado solo tú

Sin tu amor
No hay mas y el dolor

Lloro y rio, es tu locura que corre en mi
He perdido la conciencia, la razón por ti
Perdiciosa me hace daño, tan solo pensar en ti

Pero no puedo olvidarte,
No puedo arrancarte de mi
No puedo olvidarte no
No puedo arrancarte de mi

Te amo, te odio
Son tantas cosas que siento por ti
Vivo y muero, al mismo tiempo en ti

Cristian Castro,"Nubes que antes fueron rosas
Que hoy se miran casi rotas

Cada amanecer de un niño
Que no sabe su destino

Hey, el universo es para ti
No lo castigues mas así
Ayúdame hazme sonreír
Dame la mano

No dejes a un ave sin volar
No dejes ríos sin cantar
Una canción de amor

Hojas de arboles naciendo
Otras que ya casi han muerto

Hasta el murmullo del viento
Se ha tornado ya violento
Se perderá, se perderá

De cada uno de tu y yo
Lloran así desconsolada

Ven vamos a darnos la ilusión
A darnos un lugar mejor

Cristian Castro,"Tantas veces la hice mía 
Bebí su amor
Fue solo para mi 
Se ha llevado mis caricias
Toda ilusión 
Mis ganas de vivir
Fue su cuerpo mi guarida
Su sonrisa mi alegría
Su alma mi salvación
Fue su entrega mi delirio
Su vientre mi camino
Su piel mi adoración

Tal vez la encuentre alguna vez
Bajo el cielo junto al mar
Sera la estrella que se fue 
Para no volver jamas
Tal vez la tuve que perder
Para así poder soñar
Con el pasado en que la ame
Y que nunca morirá
Y que nunca morirá

Hoy la noche esta vacía 
Por un adiós quizás de soledad
Me dejo su despedida
Que mi balcón parece suspirar
Tras la sombra miro el cielo
Que llora mi silencio
Por que no volverá
Luna dile que la quiero 
Que sin su amor 
Me muero
Dime donde estará

Tal vez la encuentre alguna vez
Bajo el cielo junto al mar 
Sera la estrella que se fue 
Para no volver jamas 
Tal vez la tuve que perder 
Para así poder soñar 
Con el pasado en que la ame 
Y que nunca morirá

Inquieto como mar en calma siempre tan lejana como el horizonte

Solo queda el eco de mi desengaño
Sigo aquí en mis sueños de seguirte amando

Será,  será como tu quieras pero así será
Si aun tengo que esperarte siete vidas mas
Me quedare colgado de este sentimiento

Por amarte así es esa mi fortuna es ese mi castigo
Será que tanto amor acaso esta prohibido
Yo sigo aquí muriendo por estar contigo

Por amarte así a un paso de tu boca y sin poder besarla
Tan cerca de ti piel y sin poder tocarla
Ardiendo de deseos con cada mirada
Por amarte así por amarte así por amarte

Así voy caminando en esta cuerda floja
Por ir tras de tu huella convertida en sombra
Precio del amor que me negaste un día
Contando los segundos que pasan por verte
Haciéndote culpable de mi propia suerte
Su mundo esta despierto con hacerte mía

Será,  será como tu quieras pero así será
Si aun tengo que esperarte siete vidas mas

Por amarte así es esa mi fortuna es ese mi castigo
Será que tanto amor acaso esta prohibido

Vivir sin ti, sin tu amor, soñando que mañana volverás junto a mi
Será que el destino no volverte jamás

Sentir que estoy muriendo por tener tu amor

Soledad, tan solo y tan vacío, ahora que no estás, te necesito
Y estoy muriendo porque se que ya no puedo más

De mis errores y mis fracasos
Tras las heridas del pasado
Y los amores ya olvidados

Tras la inocencia que hubo un día
Tras la ironía de aquellos años
Sólo ha quedado un frío inmenso
La espina cruel del desengaño

Llegas a mi vida como un sol
Como la suave transparencia del amor
Como el aroma de la brisa en la mañana
Borrando para siempre mi dolor

Volver a amar una vez más
Nacer de nuevo en ti
En tu mirar
Llenando con tu luz
Las sombras de mi soledad

Tras la inocencia que hubo un día
Tras la ironía de aquellos años
Sólo ha quedado un frío inmenso

Como el aroma de la brisa en la mañana
Borrando para siempre mi dolor

Volver a amar una vez más
Nacer de nuevo en ti

Volver a amar sentir que ya
Te quedas junto a mí
Que no me dejas
Y así podré vivir

Nacer de nuevo en ti

La estrella que siempre soñé

Azul, como de tu mirada nació mi ilusión
Azul como una lagrima cuando hay perdón
Tan puro y tan azul que me han vuelto el corazón

Es que este amor es azul como el mar
Azul, como el azul del cielo nació entre los dos
Azul, como el lucero de nuestra pasión
Un manantial azul que me llena de amor

Como el milagro que tanto espere
Eres la niña que siempre busque
Azul, es tu inocencia que quiero entender
Tu príncipe azul yo seré

Cristian Castro,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Cristian Castro,"Traté de controlar mis impulsos para no llamar
Pero me venció el deseo de oír tu voz 
Mil veces yo colgué antes que atendieras y esta vez
Ya me traicionó el deseo de oír tu voz 

Se que me vas a comprender
Quise saber si estabas bien
Fue demasiado para mi pasar la noche tan lejos de ti 

Pero me venció el deseo de oír tu voz
Yo se muy bien que prometí 
Ser fuerte y se también que no cumplí
Que me traicionó el deseo de oír tu voz 

Se que me vas a comprender
Quise saber si estabas bien
Necesitaba oír tu voz amor
Saber si tú me extrañas como yo

Tal vez pudimos evitar esta situación que me hace mal 
Y aunque se que ha sido lo mejor 
No he podido soportar el deseo de oír tu voz

Atrévete a probar de lo prohibido
Atrévete a aceptar lo que no has sido

Cristian Castro,"Hoy quiero soñar con lo inolvidable
Con esa luna que fue de los dos
Con su belleza incomparable
Con sus ojos y sus lágrimas de amor
Hoy quiero soñar cuando fui su dueño
El héroe de una fábula de ayer
Y hoy siento que me agobia aquel tormento
De haber roto el amor de esa mujer

Soy barco a la deriva sin su amor
Perdido en este infierno de dolor
En qué estaría pensando aquella noche
En que otros labios me entregaron su calor
Soy barco a la deriva sin su amor
Un náufrago en el mar de su querer
Y hoy bebo gota a gota mi condena
Por no haber sabido amar a esa mujer

Hoy quiero soñar con lo inalcanzable
Pues para mi pecado no hay perdón
Ella me amaba como nadie
Y yo le di el puñal de mi traición
De qué me sirve hoy este llanto
Por el amor que un día se fue
Yo sólo sé vivir por ella
Cómo arrancarla de mi ser

Soy barco a la deriva sin su amor
Perdido en este infierno de dolor
En qué estaría pensando aquella noche

Que fueron otros labios la miel de mi deseo

Que tengo que decirte lo que tal vez no entiendas

Aquello fue un momento que nunca volverá

Porque hay cosas de hombres y hay cosas de mujeres

Pero pasan de largo como el viento en la llanura
Mas quiero que te quede clarito y para siempre

Tu vida con la mía nunca se cruzó,

Quisiera borrar el tiempo y poder retroceder

Y fundir tu vida con la mía

Y que nunca te entregué

Y perderme por los valles de tu piel,

Donde viva siempre nuestro amor

En tu mirada veo un pasado triste, 
En donde estaba yo para hacerlo feliz?

Y olvida todo que este encuentro nunca fue casualidad, 
Siempre lo había soñado y hoy se vuelve realidad

Siempre juntos los dos

Porque todo es feliz
Cuando estas a mi lado
La tristeza se vuelve un reflejo
Que no me puede alcanzar
Pero cuando te vas
Ya no me desespero
Y aunque te sienta muy lejos
Se que al final el camino
Nos vuelve a encontrar

Si pudiera viajar en el tiempo
Volvería a vivir igual
Volvería a elegirte otra vez
Si pudiera viajar en el tiempo
Viviría mil veces mas
Los mejores momentos
Siempre juntos los dos

Porque es muy posible  
Que tengan razón  
Puedo arrancarte las venas  
Lo mismo que darte  
Por siempre mi amor  
 
Reconozco que llego al extremo  
Cuando algunos me causan dolor  
Pero soy tan sencillo y tan bueno  
Cuando alguien me quiere  
Y me brinda calor  
 
Reconozco que llego al extremo  
Cuando siento en mi pecho rencor

Que ahora un abismo nos separa

Te lleno de besos y caricias mustias
Pero estas dormida no sientes caricias
Te abrazo a mi pecho me duermo contigo
Mas luego despierto tu no estas conmigo
Solo esta mi almohada

A veces te miro callada y ausente
Y sufro en silencio como tanta gente
Quisiera gritarte que vuelvas conmigo
Que si aun estoy vivo solo es para amarte

Tan profundo como el viento,
Tan lejano como el tiempo,
Y tan cierto como el sol

Amor, amor,
Si me escuchas si me puedes ver,
No me cierres tu guarida,
Llena un poco de mi vida,
Llena un poco de mi ser

Dónde puede estar,
El amor que un día me negó la paz,
Cuando volverá?
Puede que no vuelva nunca más, quizás,
Puede estar herido,
Puede estar desfallecido,
Quizás esté sentado,
A la puerta del pasado

Amor, amor,
Que te pintas de cualquier color,
Tan profundo como el viento,
Tan lejano como el tiempo,

Esa noche entre tus brazos caí en la trampa
Cazaste al aprendiz de seductor
Y me diste de comer sobre tu palma,
Haciéndome tu humilde servidor

Amiga, hay que ver como es el amor
Que vuela a quien lo toma,
Gavilán o paloma
Pobre tonto, ingenuo charlatán
Que fui paloma por querer ser gavilán

Que vuela a quien lo toma,

Fui bajando lentamente tu vestido
Y tu no me dejaste ni hablar
Solamente suspirabas te necesito
Abrázame mas fuerte, mas

Al mirarte me sentí desengañado
Solo me dio frió tu calor
Lentamente te solté de entre mis brazos
Y dije estate quieta por favor

Cristian Castro,"En tus manos yo aprendí
A beber agua
Fui gorrión que se quedo preso
En tu jaula

Y el alpiste que me dabas
Fue tanto poco y sin embargo

Fue mi canto para ti
Siempre completo
Sin ti no pude volar
En otro cielo

Pero me dejaste solo
Confundido y olvidado
Y otra mano me ofreció
El fruto anhelado

Lo que un día fue, no sera
Ya no vuelvas a buscarme
No tengo nada que darte
De tu alpiste me canse

Y deja abierta tu jaula
Tal vez otro gorrión caiga
Pero dale de beber

Confundí tus ojos verdes con agua clara,
Tu cabello con la noche,

La sorpresa abrió tus ojos y se hizo el día,
Y cerré un beso en tus labios,
Por si acaso me reñías,
Y cubrí tu cuerpo pues el alba nos veía.

Que ha perdido el color, amor amor,

En mis brazos te atrapo y te amarro estamos enamorados
Y aunque la gente no lo entienda es en vano
Porque no hay nada que pudiera dejarnos
Nos amamos porque somos dos almas gemelas
Que se han encontrado, enamorados

No es necesario que me digas ni una sola palabra mas
Desde el primer momento en que te vi
Sabia que algo había cambiado en el cielo, en el alma
El regalo que me haría feliz
Y lloraste una rosa al cielo
Y los ángeles gritaron te quiero
Y nos amamos contra todos los vientos
Y lloramos enamorados, enamorados, enamorados
Enamorados, enamorados, enamorados

Enamorados como dos tontos que se han encontrado
Como si siempre te hubiera buscado y esperado
En mis brazos te atrapo y te amarro estamos enamorados
Aunque la gente no lo entiende es en vano
Porque no hay nada que pudiera dejarnos
Nos amamos porque somos dos almas gemelas
Que se han encontrado, enamorados
Enamorados, enamorados, enamorados",Enamorados
Cristian Castro,"Te esperé a que otra vez me rechazaras 
Para tomar valor y repetirte estas palabras 
Ya se cansó mi corazón de esperarte 
Quiere descansar

Una vez luché por ti sin lograr nada 
Varios intentos tus excusas no cambiaban 
Pero entendí que lo mejor que puedo darte 
Es tu libertad 

Ahora sé que en tus labios me ahogaba 
Y hundido en tu cárcel perdí la esperanza 
No puedo seguirte buscando 
Soñando que seas mejor

Quítate el disfraz de niña buena 
Porque no vale la pena que te lleve de condena 
Si en verdad tu me quisieras 
Buscarías una manera de salvar nuestro amor... 
Basta ya de tus pretextos y desprecios 
Basta ya de esperar esa miseria de tus besos 
Esta vez mi corazón está completamente 
Abierto y a tu disposición, pero 
Para que te vayas 

No hace falta que esta vez me digas nada 
En cuestiones de amor está que sobran tus palabras 
Sé que mañana encontrarás sin dudar 
Algún idiota mejor
Una vez luché por ti no me arrepiento 
Todo lo que sentí yo ayer por ti dalo por muerto 
Sigue jugando a la muñeca especial 
Que no tiene aparador  

Ahora sé que en tus labios me ahogaba 
Y hundido en tu cárcel perdí la esperanza

Cristian Castro,"Si fuera por ti, me harías sufrir
Casi sin pensarlo podrías mentir
Si yo nunca fui, tu historia de amor
No juegues conmigo, es mejor tu adiós

Tal vez esto es lo mejor
Que sufrir de amor
No lo hago por ti, no quiero seguir

Ya no quiero de ti nada
No puedo creerte nada
Vete y busca quien te quiera
Quien te aguante a tu manera
Por mi parte está perdido
Te he dejado en el olvido
Tan cansado estoy de ti 
Es mejor así, es mejor así

No puedes luchar contra la verdad
Por mucho que llores
No voy a cambiar

Tal vez esto es lo mejor

Más vale vivir solo

Te cuesta hacerte a un lado

Si es cierto que me adoras
No tardes en dejarme
Jugaste en la impostora
Diciendo ser un ángel
Tarde muy tarde es ya
Para seguirte amando
No puedo seguir respirando, no
El mismo aire que tu
Aun huele a ingratitud

Y déjame déjame conmigo flaca
Entiende que mi vida todavía sangra
Nada, puedes hacer por mi
Solo irte y déjame aquí
Y déjame déjame tranquilo entiende
Prefiero estar conmigo que con quien me miente
Nada, nada, hoy no me dejaste nada
Cuando viste esa madrugada

Vete, y déjame solito
Tu tiempo esta contado
Pues hay alguien que te esta esperando
Si es cierto que me quieres salúdame a tu amigo
Dile que te quiera mucho
Para que le hagas lo mismmito que hiciste conmigo
Para que le hagas lo mismmito que hiciste conmigo

Tarde muy tarde es ya

No quiero continuar hablando
No quiero que se rompa mi voz

Buscando tu luz
Naufragado en 20 mares

Porque usado nadie quiere un corazón

Puesta en venta para siempre sin guardar rencor

O vazio que você deixou em mim

Mas será o melhor pra mim

Não importa o que me faça
Não tem paixão quando me abraça

Irei em busca de um novo amor

Não irá me encontrar
Quem sabe aí meu bem
Talvez você consiga entender
Que a minha vida não pertence a você

Na verdade nunca se amou
Siga o seu caminho que eu vou
Em busca do meu

Acho que você não entendeu

Cristy Lane,"It was Christmas Eve in a little Texas town
The snow was falling softly to the ground
Outside a little chapel stood a man
With sightless eyes, a candle in his hand

Oh Lord, if you're there, help me in
I need to light a candle for a friend
Who came from a land across the sea
They called him the Man From Galilee

No one seemed to hear his lonely cry
They laughed in Christmas cheer and walked on by
Inside they watched a clock upon the wall
Put silver in the box and left the hall

Oh Lord, if you're there, help me in
I need to light a candle for a friend
Who came from a land across the sea
They called him The Man From Galilee

Soon the church was quiet in the night
And one-by-one the candles lost their light
In darkness now, the old man knelt to pray
Forgive them, Lord, they must have lost their way

Oh Lord, if you're there, hear my prayer
Let the message of your Birthday fill the air
Let the lesson of your love help us to see
That Christmas is The Man From Galilee

Yeah, I've heard that many times before

And just because I don't know your pain
Doesn't mean I can't relate
It's just a suggestion
You don't have to take it to heart

Now I can see, you raised the stakes
I call you out, I call you out

And spoke for themselves

I show you my precious things
We don't have to talk, it doesn't matter.
Don't resurrect the same ideas
Cause all we are is what we've lived

Maintain a frame of mind
To see the big picture
Cause if there's nothing above
Then there's nothing in our souls

It is not safe to be alone, individual
It's a standard you must confront on your own.

Worked on it enough, I should have known

It's a big principle, you'll have to grow

Critika y Saik,"Todo lo que quería decirte y no pude susurrarte
Son solo sueños de un cobarde
Todas las palabras que escribí sobre tu espalda
Ya no son escalofríos, ya no significan nada, nada, nada

¿Qué pasa con los sueños que hicimos en mi cama?
¿Qué serán de las historias que se quedaron en ganas?
¿Qué sera de todo, si mi voz no habla?
Te debo los besos que no te he dado
Se nos quedo en el aire
Rozándonos los labios
Y no sé por qué, tanto callé

Lo que nunca te dije es como un avión de papel
Que se rompió al llover
Mojando sus alas con miedo a caer
Lo que nunca te dije es como un barco de papel
Que el mar pudo romper
Navegando sin rumbo sin saber volver

Fue inevitable no perderme en tu sonrisa al mirarte
Y hoy no logro encontrarme
Pase lo que pase sentiré
Que me faltaron dos o tres eternidades
Para decírtelo todo, todo, todo

Los te quiero que aún ni siquiera has escuchado
Los te extraño que aún no he pronunciado
Los mi vida no te vayas, los quédate a mi lado

Te debo promesas que no he cumplido
Y hoy más que nunca, son problema mio
Y no sé porqué, tanto callé

Lo que nunca te dije es como un avión de papel
Que se rompió al llover
Mojando sus alas con miedo a caer
Lo que nunca te dije es como un barco de papel

Navegando sin rumbo sin saber volver

Que de nada me arrepiento
No nacimos para ser perfectos
Equivocarse contigo es tan bonito
Que nunca voy a decir lo siento
Y más de lo que tu me dabas no tendré
Y aunque nunca más te vuelva a ver
Quisiera equivocarme otra vez

Y lo sé, si fueras un fallo te volvería a cometer
Tropezaría mil veces contigo
Hoy que el viento ya sopla a mi favor
Y aunque este mucho mejor, tu fuiste mi error
Y no sé por que no no tenemos solución
Si el que se arrepiente no soy yo, mi mejor error
No hay nada que me haga más feliz que estar contigo, contigo

Fuiste la piedra del camino que yo quise conmigo
Fuiste el viento que se llevó este frío
Fuiste mi error ¿verdad? Y no te miento
Estar contigo nunca fue perder el tiempo
Y no habrá nadie por la que merezca más luchar
Sufriría una y mil veces más,
Por ti no tengo miedo a caer

Denn ein Klapps auf den Po ist doch die beste Anmache
Keine Ahnung, wieso deine Homes mich anlachen,
Sieht so aus als würde ich ihnen nicht so große Angst machen
Und so langsam wird es Zeit, dass ich meine Gun packe

Erzähl'n Geschichten, werfen ständig unser'n Plan um

Denn wir kiffen, saufen, rauchen, doch hör'n morgen damit auf

Ja genau, sie ist scharf wie ein Mex-
Ikaner, Lieblingsfilm, sie will mich wiederseh'n
Doch ich brauch nicht viel im Leben außer das ""Supreme-Emblem""
Auf meinen Snapbacks, Decks oder Backpacks
Jede Zeile ist fett und relaxt so wie Jack Black
Ich denk zurück als das Rap-Ding begann
Damals waren meine Helden Max, Sam und Jan
Heute zieh ich selber mit den Tracks übers Land
Bin egal, wohin ich komm', schon bekannt - Sing es!

Meine Zeit is' jetzt
Egal was kommt, man, ich bleib' relaxt
Ich lehn' mich zurück, schreib 'n Text

Sollte alles klappen, bin ich bald Milliardär
Haha, war'n Witz, ich mein Millionär
Und was ich damit meine? Meine Taschen sind - leer

Brauch keine Villa am Meer und auch kein Benz
Brauch keine eigene Band, brauch keine Brand

Nimm dir 2 Minuten Zeit, atme kurz tief ein

Guck, es war 2006 doch kommt mir vor, als ob es gestern war

Und gibt mir dafür Strafarbeiten
Total in Rage sagt die Frau
Dass solche naseweisen Bengel auf der Straße bleiben
Jeden Tag Eintrag, Nachsitzen Freitags
Gibt mir 30 Seiten und begibt sich auf die Heimfahrt
Vielen Dank für diese wunderschöne Zeit
Nein, ich werd' sie nich' vergessen, doch so langsam bin ich reif

Weit entfernt von Liebe, doch bereit für den Geschlechtsverkehr
Ich guck' sie an und sag „ich hab es nie gemacht!“
Sie nimmt meine Hand und sagt „es tut nicht weh
Also lehn dich zurück“ und hat gelacht
Und plötzlich spür' ich das beste Gefühl meines Lebens
Und fühl' mich, als würde ich über ihr schweben
Das Licht wurde heller, sie sieht, mir gefällt es
Dann nahm sie die Zügel und wurde noch schneller und
Jetzt bin ich ein richtiger Mann
Ich seh', sie grinst und hört, wie meine Unschuld singt

Nie mehr, komm' ich wieder zurück
Nie mehr (nie mehr)

Würd' ich alles nochmal tun und zwar genauso
Schick' mich zurück in die Zeit in der niemand mich kennt
Und ich würd alles dafür tun, dass du mich wieder erkennst
Wär ich auf einmal wieder 16
Dann würd im Matheheft ein Text steh'n
Scheiß auf Schule, ich würd weggeh'n
Nicht weil ich wüsste, ich bin irgendwann reich
Nein, weil ich weiß, diese Zeit ist so rasend vorbei
Wär ich auf einmal wieder jung (wieder jung)
Dann wäre Dad noch am Start
Und ich schwör ich wär mehr für ihn da
Und Oma wär nie mehr alleine mit dem Pärchen im Park
Denn sie kann Opa wieder lieben wie am allerersten Tag
Ich schließe meine Augen es ist 2006
Doch weit vor den Raps und dem Nightliner-Bett
Wir fühlten uns erwachsen, hatten heimlichen Sex
Und ich würd' ihn wieder trinken, auch wenn Wein noch nicht schmeckt
Wäre 2006 (2006)
Dann hätt' ich sicherlich kein Streit mit der Ex
Wäre weit von der weg, diese Zeit ist perfekt
Also scheiß auf den Rest
Doch was man damals hatte das begreift man erst jetzt

Und in der Schule war das Zeugnis eher schlimm
Und nach dem zweiten Läuten war der Neue noch nicht drin
Ich soll mich bitte ändern, doch ich träumte vom Gewinnen
Hätt' ich nicht auf mich gehört, dann wär' ich heut nicht wer ich bin
Also schick mich ruhig zurück, ich würd' genau die selben Lieder schreiben
Jedes Wort, jede Zeile, ich würde sie wieder schreiben
Jede Nacht, bis um 8, durchgemacht, dann gefragt
Bleib ich wach oder soll ich heute einfach liegen bleiben?
Schnappte mir die Bleistiftmine, schreibe wie ne Schreibmaschine
Schreibe über Hass und über Liebe, keine Zeit verlieren
Weiterschreiben, meine Linie, auch wenn ich kein' Preis verdiene
Schreib ich wie 'ne Reimmaschine, als wär das die zweite Bibel
Doch leider begreifen viele nicht, dass ich die Scheiße liebe
Meistens reale Motherfucker mit 'ner fiesen Neider-Mine

Immer nur gähnt, Immer nur fehlt
Ey Jungs, tut mir Leid war Zeit es zu erwähnen
Ich hab doch letzten Monat diese Frau besucht
Wir waren was essen, hatten ein Rendezvous
Auf jeden Fall sie ist jetzt meine Freundin
Doch immer wenn ich bei ihr penn mache ich kein Auge zu
Aber nicht wegen Sex, ich hab Schiss (vor ihr)
Denn sie zwingt mich und sagt du kommst mit (zu mir)
Und dann erzählt sie von irgendeiner Clique
Und dass ich nicht mehr rauskomm denn alle wären informiert
Sie sagt lass uns ein Pärchen sein
Ich würde gerne rennen, doch sie sperrt mich ein
Und ich wäre ihr Ken in dem Märchenteil

Nein, ruf' nicht an denn es ist gesperrt
Und den Mac hat sie obendrein mit versteigert
Ich denke mal, dass ihr mich deshalb nicht erreicht habt
Und ja ich hab meinen Flug verpasst
Doch ich steh mittlerweile mehr als mit 'nem Fuß im Knast
Und neulich häng' ich so allein in ihrer Bude ab
Da kommen die Cops durch die Tür und sagen „Wir suchen was“
Ich sag superkrass, ich bin hier eingesperrt
Ich glaub ihr Name ist Janine und ich weiß nicht mehr
Und alles was sich hier befindet, das gehört mir nicht

Es ist wieder mal 'ne Samstag-Nacht doch ich cruise durch die City
Hab nur 'ne Schrottkarre, denn der Bruce hat den Caddy
Im Tapedeck steckt noch Tune von P. Diddy
Ich dreh auf, mach es laut, fühl mich cool so wie Biggy
Und während ich so mit 8 km/h, unantastbar wie Gas
Durch die Nacht fahr, blas'
Ich den Rauch raus, dampf wie 'n Rasta im Park
Währenddessen hängen sich motherfucking Cops an mein' Arsch
Ah, sie fragt was machen sie beruflich
Ich sag Music, wenn ich Zeit habe produce ich
Sie sagt „Ey ich dachte mir von Anfang an, dass du's bist“
Sie kennt jedes Lied und meint, dass meine Platte gut ist
Das wär genau ihr Ding
So 'n Mädchen sieht man eigentlich nur in Fashion-Magazinen
Sie zieht mich aus der Karre, sagt „Das war's für dich jetzt
Ich muss dich leider hier verhaften wegen Paragraph 6“
Und sie packte ihre Handschellen aus
Und behandelt mich als wär das hier ein Tankstellenraub
Ich sag ""Baby du bist eine von den ganz schnellen Frauen""
Sie holt Panzertape raus und sagt „Mann, halt dein Maul“
Hat mich ohne Kommentare danach an sich gedrückt
Die Wangen abgeküsst, behandelt wie 'n Stück
Auf einmal wurd es stürmisch und sie langsam verrückt
Denn sie reißt an meinem Shirt und wirft mich dann auf die Rück-
Bank, yeah die Blicke sind so heiß
Denn langsam wird sie geil, wie nach 'nem Whisky oder zwei
Sie setzt sich auf mich drauf und zieht den Slip bis zu den Beinen
Ich mach einen auf Al Capone, denn ich fick die Polizei
Yeah, wir sind allein und tun's,
Sie macht es nice und smooth, sie hat den Scheiß im Blut
Ich würd sie gern für immer haben aber nein bleib cool
Baby krieg ich deine Nummer? „sie sagt 1-1-0
Doch nur im Notfall du weißt
Ich hab ziemlich viel zu tun und nur an Montagen frei
Doch vielleicht teilen wir uns mal mein Sofa zu zweit
Tut mir leid, ich muss leider wieder losfahren, bye“
Dann war sie einfach so weg
Ich bin einsam im Bett, keiner weiß wo sie steckt
Und seitdem knack ich täglich Maserati's, Ferrari's
Setz' mich rein, warte bis sie kommt, doch sie kam nie
Verdammt was tut sie mir an
Vielleicht ist sie grad bei 'nem Mann
Hat die Bluse nicht an, sie schmusen und dann, verdammt
Diese Wut macht mich krank
Du hast doch ihre Nummer, ey ich glaub ich ruf sie mal an",Cop Love

Reich und beliebt, doch weißt du noch wie alles eigentlich verlief
Ich mein weit vor dem Hype, vor den Rhymes und den Suites
Acker jeden Tag und hab 'nen Scheißdreck verdient
Großstadt, jap ich war allein ohne Ziel
Mach' die Nacht zum Tag, der geistige Krieg
Zwischen Rhymes die ich schrieb und bin eigentlich verliebt
Lag im Grunde nur die Hoffnung, dass die eine es sieht
Also scheiß auf Musik, ich muss Kohle verdienen
Ich würd ja auch viel lieber chillen wenn es ohne das ging
Doch leider bezahlt man 'ne Wohnung plus Strom und Benzin
Nicht vom Erwarten irgendwann das große Los mal zu ziehen
Sie sagen du musst los nach Berlin
Ich hab nie erwartet, dass bei mir was Großes geschieht
Bei manchen war es Koks oder Weed
Ich dagegen nahm in Krisen halt die Droge Musik

immer noch broke, keine Kohle am Start
Häng bei Psaiko auf der Couch, denn dort wohne ich grad
Drehen die Scheiße auf, wussten nicht wieso es so war
Doch bauten dicke Dinger wie 'n Silikonimplantat
Noch immer ohne Vertrag, noch immer ohne die Charts
Noch immer weit entfernt von irgend 'nem Millionenbetrag
Eher so Dosen im Park, eher so Hosen am Arsch
Das erste Mal wie sie sagt, dass sie mich ohne Witz mag
Warte, wo ist meine Karte?
wieder mal verpennt im Büro außer Atem, ähm
ja, äh ich wohn eigentlich grade
Nicht bei mir Zuhause doch ist bloß so eine Phase
Klingt nicht schön wie die Mondscheinsonate
Eher so Blamage, im Schoß eine Gabel
Ich lege los, schreibe Flows, Bloß eine Frage
Der Zeit, bis die Scheiße sich lohnt zähl ich Tage

Und immer dann wenn es nach oben geht
Schreib ich es hin denn so bleibt's in Erinnerung

Ey
das große Jahr und sie bemerken ich hab Hits gemacht
Sagten das ist richtig krass und was ich alles richtig mach
Komm' doch mal vorbei und wir trinken was
Zack, unterschrieben und der Scheiß wurde fix gemacht
Ich wusste nicht genau was ich damit jetzt mach
Denn, dass es so wie heute wird, das hätt ich damals nicht gedacht
Und irgendwann ergibt sich was, Daddy fand es nicht so krass
Denn ich schmiss die Schule mit den Worten „I don't give a fuck“
Und von da an gab es Tankstellenfraß
Fahren durch das Land, waren gefangen im Spaß
Und Basti fragten, ob ich mich in' Schrank stellen mag
Ich sag klar, sag nur wann, ich bin ganz schnell am Start
Ey wir konnten es nicht ahnen, wie ein Brandmelder Gas
Doch die Hände gingen hoch wie ein Panzer im Irak
Und du merkst du bist oben wenn du ganz unten warst
Also scheiß auf den Rest, irgendwann kommt der Tag, let's go

Und immer dann wenn es nach oben geht
Schreib ich es hin denn so bleibt's in Erinnerung
Egal was passiert, ich greif nach Papier

Ey, die Zeit ist wie ne' Frau, denn du wärst froh wenn du sie hättest
Doch bemerkst, dass du sie hattest, jetzt wenn sie auf einmal weg ist
Und ich hätte große Lust dir noch mehr zu schreiben
Doch ich muss leider los, das Universum streichen

Lass uns die Gläser wieder füllen
Wir leben wie im Film
Und keiner mich stoppen, wenn ich irgendetwas will
Ich nehme mir deine Hand, denn die Welt ist perfekt
Und die gute alte Zeit ist jetzt, jetzt, jetzt, jetzt

Lass uns die Gläser wieder füllen
Wir leben wie im Film
Und keiner mich stoppen, wenn ich irgendetwas will
Ich nehme mir deine Hand, denn die Welt ist perfekt
Und die gute alte Zeit ist jetzt, jetzt, jetzt, jetzt",Jetzt

Ist übertrieben klar, doch gib mir noch ein Jahr
Und dieser Danju, Danju, Danju übernimmt die Charts, oh
Denn die Kiddies flippen aus
Und jeder echte G kommt aus dem Nicken nicht mehr raus
Boh, doch das' grad garnicht der Punkt
Denn ich brauch nicht mehr als nur 'ne Parkbank und die Jungs
Yeah, wir waren die Hälfte unserer Jugend breit
Seit Bambule high und trotzdem war's 'ne gute Zeit

Cro,"Ey yo, ich hab so das Gefühl dieser Tag könnte dope
Reiß alle Fenster raus und dann leg die Mucke auf
Leg die Fernbedienung weg, Leb den Film so wie ich
Denn mein Nachbar hört jetzt Rap ob er will oder nicht

Ja ich fühl mich so fly, so fly, so fly
Denn ich fühl mich so fly
Wenn ich rhyme bin ich weit, weit weg
Von jedem Streit, jedem Stress, ganz allein, bleib relaxt
Bin mein eigener Chef, dieses Life ist perfekt

Und immer wenn die Angst mich verfolgt
Und die Zweifel mich fast wieder killn'
Weil ich nicht weiß was passiert
Ich will schreien, aber bleib lieber still
Und wenn die Zeit nicht vergeht
Weil es einfach nicht läuft wie man will
Doch dann kommt diese Melodie, dieses Lied
Ich war nie so verliebt (war noch nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt)

Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen

Ist schon klar, manchmal ist es hart
Doch ich sitz nicht zuhaus' und denk' den ganzen Tag nur nach
Wenn Leute sagen, rapp' mal wieder so wie vor 'nem Jahr
Damals warst du noch mein Star, ist mir sowas von egal, ah

Black on Black, Versace-Dress
Der deutsche Kanye West
Nur nicht ganz so arrogant, bin eher so sympathisch nett
Große Bilder, Art Attack, der Typ der auf sich warten lässt
Doch komm ich auf die Party, dann halt besser deine Platin fest

Und immer wenn die Angst mich verfolgt
Und die Zweifel mich fast wieder killn'
Weil ich nicht weiß was passiert
Ich will schreien, aber bleib lieber still
Und wenn die Zeit nicht vergeht
Weil es einfach nicht läuft wie man will

Bleib forever young
Chimperator, keiner lebt wie ich (I'll never grow up)
Der Typ der immer noch Zuhause wohnt
Scheiß auf euer Rauchverbot wie damals auf dem Pausenhof
Hat sich nix verändert, nicht im letzten wie in diesem Jahr
Und Mama will immer noch, dass ich endlich auszieh' oder Miete zahl'
(I'll never grow up) Und seitdem ich jetzt ganz alleine wohn'
Kam die Putze einmal, aber wollte dafür zwei Millionen (I'll never grow up)
Ich sag „Okay, das kannste später haben“
Stürz mich aus dem achten Stock und schreie ich bin Peter Pan
Yea, sie sagen nach mir kommt die Sintflut
Ich sollt endlich mal erwachsen werden, ey yo spinnst du? (I'll never grow up)
Genau ich werf die Füße auf'n Tisch
Der Kinder-Schokoladenjunge ist genau wie ich (I'll never grow up)
Und Bier ist was für alte Männer
Hab ich keine Lust auf Arbeit, penn' ich heute einfach länger (I'll never grow up)

Doch ich hab keine Lust auf blöde Zahlen, gibt's hier Zuckerwatte? (I'll never grow up)
Nein? Egal ich mein nur, dass ich Lust drauf hatte
Und bin schlecht gelaunt, weil ich 'nen Tag lang nichts zu futtern hatte (I'll never grow up)
Und ich hab wieder Beef mit dem Boss
Denn ich hab wieder kein Bock auf so 'nen biederen Job (I'll never grow up)
Verpenn' Termine, stell' mein Album vor Release schon in' Blogs
Dauert nicht lange bis mein Labelboss es sieht und mich droppt
'Cause I (I'll never grow up)
Ich bin wie 'ne Katze bei Nacht
Und laufe super gut getarnt durch die platzende Stadt (I'll never grow up)
Und keiner von den Menschen ahnt oder dachte sich was
Weil mich mein Oberlippenbart ein Stück erwachsener macht
But I (I'll never grow up)
Genau, scheiß auf Erwachsensein und den ganzen Kackverein
Lass uns wieder Affe sein (I'll never grow up)
Yeah, spring in die Karre, leg die Platte ein

Ich komme nach Haus und werf' mich auf mein Bett
Mal wieder mal'n hektischer Tag
Doch bin immer ruhig und relaxt egal wie stressig es war
Bestelle mir Essen und dann
Verbring ich den restlichen Tag
Nur in meinem Bett und geh nicht mehr weg, egal wie gern ich es mag
Zu viele Anrufe warten in Abwesenheit und
Jeder will heutzutage in der Stadt leben weil
Sie haben Angst was zu verpassen
Jagen hunderttausend Sachen
Gestern Nacht war richtig krass
Wo hast du denn gesteckt du Lappen?
Ist mir egal, ich chille Zuhaus
Und male mir Fenster an die Wände
Der Mensch ist auf 'nem Festival doch rennt übers Gelände
So viele suchen jeden Tag nur Gänsehautmomente
Doch wenn sie es bemerken ist es längst wieder zuende
Doch wenn man ihn erwischt dann wird er fotografiert
Auf Instagram gepostet und sofort kommentiert
Das Leben zieht an dir vorbei auf der Jagd nach Likes
Und der Ghettoblaster spielt noch „It's A Hard Knock Life“

Yo chill
Wieso willst du weg von hier?
Denn der Moment ist perfekt
Leg dein Handy mal weg und relax mit mir

Chill
Wieso willst du weg von hier?
Denn der Moment ist perfekt
Leg dein Handy mal weg und relax mit mir

Und jeder da draußen hätte gerne viele Scheine
'N Haufen Frauen wie bei Blow?
Doch ich hab lieber diese eine statt die tausendste Hoe
Und eigentlich ist alles cool, also schau wieder auf
War vor der Mucke ganz genau wie du, pausenlos broke
Doch jeder hier rennt über die Welt und dabei vergessen so viele
Mal anzuhalten und den Moment zu genießen
Yeah, scheiß auf Ängste und Krisen
Und die Welt wird wieder bunt, wie wenn wir verliebt sind
Doch ist man ständig am Fliegen und jeden Monat verbucht
Verliert man Menschen um sich rum ganz ohne groß was zu tun
Sie sagte „Sohn hör mir zu, es geht Oma nicht gut“
Ich hab sie so lange schon nicht mehr einfach so mal besucht
Wir lassen viel zu viele Dinge einfach sausen auf der Reise
Doch posten jeden Tag 'nen riesengroßen Haufen Scheiße
Und wenn's uns nicht gefällt dann haut man pausenlos drauf ein ey
Ist unter diesem Lied bestimmt schon ganz genau das Gleiche

Chill
Wieso willst du weg von hier?
Denn der Moment ist perfekt
Leg dein Handy mal weg und relax mit mir

Chill
Wieso willst du weg von hier?
Denn der Moment ist perfekt
Leg dein Handy mal weg und relax mit mir",Rennen
Cro,"Vielleicht ist es gerade besser wie es ist
Kann sein, vielleicht aber auch nicht
Und vielleicht gibt es 'nen Besseren als mich
Doch vielleicht passt zu dir niemand besser als ich
Und vielleicht solltest du nicht schreien, wenn dich was stört
Vielleicht hätte ich dann besser zugehört
Vielleicht hätte ich verstanden was dich stresst
Vielleicht wärst du dann nicht weg

Doch vielleicht mach ich mir auch nur was vor
Vielleicht wär es zu Ende, vielleicht nicht verloren
Ah, und vielleicht ist nicht alles voller Dornen
Doch vielleicht beginnt dann alles nur von vorn
Und vielleicht bin ich irgendwann mal alt
Und denk' mir „Du Idiot, ließt sie einfach gehen“
Kann schon sein, dass ich's irgendwann versteh

Vielleicht sagst du „Nein“, vielleicht meinst du „Ja“
Vielleicht wirst du's irgendwann bereuen in einem Jahr

Vielleicht viel zu laut, vielleicht viel zu stumm
Vielleicht gibt es hin und wieder Streit ohne Grund
Doch vielleicht läuft es deshalb wieder rund

Cro,"Ich werd' alle Sorgen heute liegen lassen
Und höre nur noch Lieder die mich fliegen lassen
Ich checke ob mir noch die alten Sneakers passen
Alles was passiert ist, würd' ich ganz genau so wieder machen
Denn glaub mir jeder Tag war perfekt
Diese Bar, erstes Becks, Erstes Mal mit dir Sex
Schlichen uns heimlich nach 'ner Party ins Bett
Alles Fresh, denn wiedermal hat es Mum nicht gechekt

Huh, manchmal wünscht ich dieser eine Tag bleibt für immer
Und deshalb sind wir die ganze Nacht wach
Aus Angst uns zu verlieren
Doch wir werden irgendwann mal alt sein
Doch uns trotzdem genau erinnern
Denn, wir waren hier
Wir waren hier

Yeah! Und bei den Bullen rattern Schreibmaschinen los
Doch Mama bleibt relaxt, denn auch die Kleinen werden Groß
Jetzt bin ich hier und lass mich treiben in 'nem Boot
Alles cool, ist der Himmel grau, streiche ich ihn rot
Und es ist Sommer irgendwo, irgendwann
Bitte lass uns nicht mehr reden, gib mir bloß deine Hand
Ja ich weiß, vorbei, wird nicht wieder wie es war
Bitte lass uns nochmal sein wie an diesem einen Tag, denn

Manchmal wünscht ich dieser eine Tag bleibt für immer
Und deshalb sind wir die ganze Nacht wach

Ich wache auf und du bist nicht hier
Denn es war alles ein Traum
Doch ich weiß, du bist irgendwo da draußen
Und ohne dich fühle ich mich so allein

Sie isst 'n bisschen Kaviar, 'n bisschen Pizza
'N bisschen L.A. Ghetto, 'n bisschen Nizza
'N bisschen Hipster, 'n bisschen Glitzer-Glitzer
Doch scheiß mal auf Schampus ey sie will 'n Sixer
Sie ist VIP, doch pennt auf'm Rücksitz
Sie ist nett, aber kennt keine Rücksicht
Wenn du bedrückt bist, macht sie dich glücklich
Und schenkt dir ein Lächeln es macht baam! Und erdrückt dich
Gibt es Stress, ja dann boxt sie dich raus, sie hat
Alles im Griff, ist der Boss hier im Haus, doch
Sie weiß nicht, ob sie diesen Rock wirklich braucht
Ist nicht zufrieden, aber trotzdem gekauft. (Yeah!)
Und Baby nein, ich rede nicht von der Musik
Und ich muss sagen, ey, ich bin auch nicht verliebt (nein!)
Denn das ist mehr, das ist eher sowas wie
Und der glücklichste Mensch dieser Welt, weil es dich gibt, doch

Ich wache auf und du bist nicht hier
Denn es war alles ein Traum
Doch ich weiß, du bist irgendwo da draußen
Und ohne dich fühle ich mich so allein (allein)
Allein (allein) allein (allein)
Ohne dich fühle ich mich so allein (allein)
Allein (allein) allein
Ohne dich fühle ich mich so allein

Für diese Frau würd' ich sofort um die Erde segeln
Pferde stehlen, Sterne zählen, mit dir will ich mehr erleben
Ich denk da an ein Haus, mit ein paar Nervensägen
Doch ich bin raus, tja, denn leider ist ihr Herz vergeben
Denn sie hat 'n Freund, wahrscheinlich so'n Starken
Wunderschön gebräunt, mit breiten Oberarmen
Der sie dann, wenn sie heult
In seinen großen Arm nimmt, nein ich bin nicht enttäuscht
Ich werd wahnsinn! (Verdammt!)
Und das verrückte daran ist, Ich freu mich für dich!
Nein, im Ernst echt, ich freu mich für dich, denn ich
Muss damit leben, dein Freund bin ich nicht
Doch ich hoff, man, mit neunzig bereust du es nicht und
Wie lang das weitergeht? Ich kann's dir nicht sagen, doch ich
Geb mich sicherlich nicht kampflos geschlagen, also
Lass mich bitte nicht zu lang darauf warten
Und fang' an dich zu fragen, denn die Antwort ist klar, doch

Ich wache auf und du bist nicht hier
Denn es war alles ein Traum
Doch ich weiß, du bist irgendwo da draußen
Und ohne dich fühle ich mich so allein (allein)

Cro,"Yeah, es ist ein unglaublich schöner Tag
Und draußen ist es warm
Er ist auf dem Weg nach Hause mit der Bahn
Schaut aus dem Fenster lässt Gedanken freien lauf
Lehnt sich ganz entspannt zurück
Denn er muss lange noch nicht raus
Paar Menschen steigen ein andre wieder aus
Er wechselt grad das Lied und plötzlich stand da diese Frau
Und er dachte sich wow
Sagte klar der Platz ist frei
Sie lachte und er dachte sich nur bitte komm
Sprich sie an
Das ist das schönste was du je gesehen hast
Und sie hat sicherlich kein Mann
Stell dich nicht so an
Wenn nicht jetzt wann dann?
Doch alles was man hört ist mein Herzschlag

Was soll ich nur sagen irgendwas knockt mich aus
Ich bin ein Versager, weil ich mich doch nicht trau
Mein Kopf ist voller Wörter doch es kommt nichts raus
Und sie steht auf, steigt aus und sagt

Bye bye, bye bye meine Liebe des Lebens
Und ja wir beide werden uns nie wieder sehen
Kann schon sein, dass man sich im Leben zweimal begegnet
Doch es beim zweiten Mal dann einfach zu spät ist

Es ist ein unglaublich schöner Tag
Und draußen ist es warm
Sie hat bock auf Shopping also in die Stadt
Sie braucht so Sachen die Frauen halt eben brauchen
'N Bikini 'ne neue Tasche und außerdem will sie schauen, also los
Ab in die Bahn
Sie zieht sich 'n Ticket 470 für die Fahrt
Ist ja ganz schön hart
Doch dann sieht sie diesen Typ
Findet ihn süß
Setzt sich extra zu ihm hin
Und denkt sich bitte bitte bitte bitte

Komm, sprich mich an
Es ist ganz egal was du jetzt sagen würdest ich spring' darauf an
Also komm
Du bist mein Mann
Wir gehören zusammen
Und wenn nicht jetzt wann?
Ich hör' mein Herz

Was soll ich nur sagen irgendwas knockt mich aus
Ich bin ein Versager, weil ich mich doch nicht trau
Mein Kopf ist voller Wörter doch es kommt nichts raus

Bye bye, bye bye meine Liebe des Lebens

Das beim zweiten mal dann einfach zu spät ist yeah
Das beim zweiten mal dann einfach zu spät ist
Was soll ich tun wenn beim zweiten mal dann einfach zu spät ist
Yeah yeah yeah

Was soll ich nur sagen irgendwas knockt mich aus
Ich bin ein Versager, weil ich mich doch nicht trau

Ey
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Baby bitte komm und lass uns chillen
Ich will heute weder aufstehen, noch will ich hier raus gehen
Denn da draußen gibt es niemanden, der uns beide missen würde
Du und ich allein in deiner kleinen Bude immer noch im Bett und chillen
Also komm Baby geh nicht weg und bleib liegen
Wenn ich sage du bist immer noch das Allerbeste was mir je passiert ist
Na dann ist das untertrieben
Denn mit dir im Bett
Ist die Welt wieder wie perfekt
Und kein Plan wie das ohne dich ging
Denn so lange du hier bist will ich nie wieder weg
Ja und ich weiß du willst das nicht hören
Aber Baby du bist wunderschön
Und manchmal wünsch ich mir du würdest deine Zeit
In meinem Kopf verbringen und die Welt aus meinen Augen sehen
Du wärst das Schönste was du sehen würdest
Komm wir machen ein Paar Dinge die man Mama nicht erzählen würde
Siehst mich an, machst das Licht aus
Ziehst mich an und ich dich aus
Und ich bin so was von addicted
Denn jedes Mal wenn du mich mit ‘nem Blick triffst
Steht meine Welt kurz still
Wie im Film
Baby lass uns chillen

Ey, Baby mit dir bleibt die Zeit stehen
Es fühlt sich an als wär das hier für immer
Immer, immer, immer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby mit dir bleibt die Zeit stehen
Es fühlt sich an als wär das hier für immer
Immer, immer, immer, yeah, (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Immer wo wir liegen
Fühlt es sich so an, als wäre ich federleicht und könnte fliegen
(Fliegen) Yeah
Wir sind weit, weit weg über Wolke 7 (tausend)
Und wenn ich Bock hab könnte ich dir auf der Stelle
Sofort über hundert Dinge nennen wieso du das Allerbeste dieser Welt bist
Würdest du mir nicht immer den Mund verbieten
Und deshalb sag ich nichts
Blind verstehen
Doch das hat 'ne ganze Weile lang gedauert
Weißt du manche Dinge kann man halt als Kind nicht sehen
So wie Sterne am Tag
Und immer wieder merk ich, wie selten ich sag
Wie sehr ich dich mag, deine ehrliche Art
Und es wird immer mehr seit dem ersten Tag
Und ja ich weiß, es ist nicht immer leicht
Und wir beide haben leider hin und wieder Streit
Es tut mir Leid, bitte bleib, Baby
Denn dieser Moment ist so perfekt ich lass dich nie wieder alleine
Jeder von uns beiden weiß, das Leben ist so schnell vorbei und
Deshalb lass uns doch so tun als hätten wir für immer Zeit doch irgendwann ist alles wieder so

Yeah, Baby mit dir bleibt die Zeit stehen
Es fühlt sich an als wär das hier für immer

Hätten uns später erst gesehen
Doch ich will nur, dass du weißt

Du bist und bleibst

Es ist schon komisch wie das Leben so spielt
Bis eben noch hier, umgeben von dir
Ein Augenblick später heißt es: „Geh bitte! Wir
Sind nicht mehr wir.“ Du bist da, und ich bin jetzt hier
Und ich mache Jahrelang auf hart und sage: „Ist nichts passiert“
Doch innerlich bin ich dabei mit jedem Schritt zu krepieren
Ich wollte alles auf der Welt, außer dich zu verlieren
Ich dreh‘ mich jede Nacht im Bett und merk‘ du bist nicht mehr hier
Tipp ´ne Nachricht in mein Handy, doch ich schick‘ sie nicht ab
Deine Nummer, keinen Plan ob ich die richtige hab
Ich denk an dich und daran, dass es jemanden gibt der dich mag
Du hast wirklich keine Ahnung wie verrückt es mich macht
Ich stehe auf, leg mich hin, gehe raus, denk ich spinn‘
Reg mich auf wie’n Kind, schrei es laut in den Wind
Nein ich brauch' dich nicht mehr, doch ich brauch dich so sehr
Tut mir leid, ich habe gerade nur bemerkt
Ich habe dich lange nicht gesehen

Ich hatte nur gemerkt wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen

Lang, lang ist’s her, du erkennst mich sicher nicht
Ich schau hoch zu deinem Fenster, wo das Licht an ist
Geh auf und ab, als wenn ich wahnsinnig wär‘
Und mein Herz schlägt so laut, ich hör‘ die Straße nicht mehr
Ich bin wach vor deinem Revier, und ich lege mich an die Grenze
Es vergeht kein Abend, an dem ich nicht an dich denke
Dein Garten ist schön, er erinnert mich an dich
Und der Flieder blüht das ganze Jahr, wo immer du auch bist
Ich steck‘ ein Brief in dein Türschlitz, versteck‘ mich hinterm Zaun
Dann renn‘ ich fluchend wieder hin und hol ihn hektisch wieder raus
Kein Plan was mit mir los ist, ich habe dich nur so lange nicht gesehen
Und wollte fragen wie’s dir geht, und ob du froh bist
Ich mache mir keine Hoffnungen, oder so, ich wollte höflich sein
Ich hätt's früher getan, doch es ergab sich keine Möglichkeit
Es passierte so, wir haben uns leider nicht gewehrt
Und jeder lebt sein Leben weiter wie bisher

Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen

Es ist schön dich zu sehen, Love, hab dich vermisst
Hab' fast vergessen wie ich mag wie du bist
Kenn dich schon seitdem ich klein bin, wir hingen immer zusammen
Damals waren zwei Wochen Ferien ohne dich schon zu lang
Hab als Kind jeden Tag in deiner Straße gespielt
Jedesmal wenn meine Mami mich suchte, saß ich bei ihr
Wir wurden älter, ich lernte dich noch besser kennen
Erinner' mich wie wir am kleinen ? gesessen sind
Ich war zwölf und Rollerscater, ? breite Achsen unter ollen Trainer
Fuhr mit fünfzig Sachen down und mich hat's gebrettert
Hab meinen Arm geschreddert, fuhr es wieder Wochen später
Über dich lernte ich viele meiner Freunde kennen
Lachen über wie wir damals war'n, wenn wir uns heute sehen
Mit der Zeit ändert sich die Perspektive
Stucki, du bleibst meine erste Liebe

Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht

Half would kill you the other half would try
Hooked and baited lined and weighted
Thrown in with the shit and brine

And this Devil swallows you
When half a truth is half a lie

That we could both quit smoking
And kick the booze and blow
And one day go make something of ourselves

To shatter all that you believed
And let your lonesome heart be free

So shut your angry eyes cause there ain't nothing here to see
It's sad enough they called the bluff on all these lying dreams

And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

And keep alive your withering love

Why does everybody always act so tough, when all anybody wants is to find a friend?
Why is everybody always trying to hide the heart what hidden has no use?
Now you can fake it or you can break it, you can shake it down
And cut yourself loose from some daddy's leash
Or in the evening light you can keep that shadow out of sight
And sleep it off, hidden from view

Hey, hey, there you go now, baby
Dancing all alone in your room
Trading gossip with the twilight creeps
Killing the flowers that were planted for you

You say someday you gonna float away
Take yourself some kind of holiday
Hey, hey, ain't no use, no trying to make you stay, hey, hey, hey

Flower, don't dig so deep so you don't go anywhere
Cause when the sun is done and evening comes
The thieves will run to steal your pretty withering love
Flower, don't dig so deep you get in over your head
Cause if the morning comes you can breathe, you can run
And keep alive your withering love

To your window I stumbled by chance and I peeked in on you
Red roses, silk, you in your sleek summer dress
You were light revelation, oh, I love you the best, Valerie

I don't want to waste no time, I'm tired and I want something true
I don't need those peep show girls no more, no I only want you
Come on and give it to me, Valerie, Valerie

I seen you dancing alone in your room
By the moonlight to a violin the night I fell for you
And out of the darkness you took me by the hand
I went in just a boy and came out with you a man, Valerie

I don't want to be caught blinded thinking there ain't nothing new
I don't need those street kicks anymore, no I only want you
So come on and give it to me, Valerie, Valerie, alright

I don't want to waste no time, I'm tired and I want something new
I don't need those quick fix girls no more, no I only want you

You know those street kicks are such a bore cause I only want you

Old lovers, too
Don't you think for one second they've forgotten you

Crooked Fingers,"Reaching for your gun, you had none, so you stabbed a wounded arm
And you drank the blood of a bleeding friend
And quit your lying face of trust and love you once offered traces of
Knowing well you were never meaning them
And you laughed and you danced and it let you feel fine for a while
Hanging out with the kids who you knew soon would fall out of style

And took your mark at dawn down a line of destruction you had drawn
Through a town you were never welcome in
And dug your fingers good in the cracks in the mortar, steel, and wood
As you drank your cup of sweet revenge
And you plotted and planned and you counted the days til they came
Hiding up in your tower, tuning out every fool who complained
It's so long looking down what you're on
If your speech is so lame and just goes on and on

If it makes you feel good, you can make them feel bad
It's an easy call
So when nothing remains you can stand there and claim
You've destroyed them all
You've destroyed them all

Now all your love's a grave and every year disappears
I heard someone mark the season you went wasting in
So take your walk at dawn through the line of destruction you had drawn
Through to rear your head to sink again
It's a long way to walk when you're wrong
If you're sneaking through town with your wrecking ball on

If it makes you feel good, you can make them feel bad
It's an easy call
So when nothing remains you can stand proud and claim
You've destroyed them all
It's so easy

Tell me where are you love
I will wait for you another night
Cause I know you won't leave me behind
Oh, where are you love?

I had someone, a love I thought was true
But sometimes you just get tired
And you must try not to die
And give your love, though no one may receive
You must build a giant fire
For the whole wide world to see

Oh, where are you love?
Tell me where have you gone
I shall wait for you another night
And you know I won't leave you behind
Oh, where are you love?

You put hope into my heart
Shined a light so I could see
Those wicked things, the wicked things you do
Well, I pay them no mind

Come stumbling homeward
We all know you and how you're not ever coming back

I keep moving but I'm getting nowhere
The neighborhoods we used to roam have all been stolen
She was my homegirl but I feel no connection to her now

We take a little from the devil's coffer
They get you hooked then let you go and crossing over
You never know how far unless you take the chance

Don't get in the way of nutrition, my dude listen
The tool's hidden, yeah I keep that wig splitter under my gat like a beautician with a tooth missing
Green pieces of paper, weed trees from Jamaica
16 Bars, 16 keys and a scraper
These are the things that a street G see when he major
Tell the chef at Pappadeaux preseason my gator
I kick a flow off the loud, then I flow off the dome just to throw off the crowd
A nigga in his 30's ain't no Mohawks allowed
Catch a ho off my smile

Them snowbunnies smelling pheromones from a lane over
Ain't no I in team, but it's two ""i's"" in Wii
And when we go Black Ops nigga, game over
Kill em all until nothing is left homie
I do this while I'm chillin' with the cousin of death
Think I'm from Wu-Tang how I'm fuckin' with Meth
My crew slang, keep that under your breath, we move things
Moving top speed to the top we, you can not be serious nigga that you can stop me
I don't do what's popular, I overlook you like a good view does the city through some new binoculars
You gettin' money you can mob with us, I'm flashy like a shootout between 2 photographers
Still they call the security when Crook strolled in
I'm really just a deep thinker dressed in wolf's clothing
I got a pulse but my wrist looks frozen

Funny how a hater want to stop a nigga's shine
Make me wanna grab the Glock, cock it, and pop it in his mind
Instead I'mma pour a shot, top it with some lime
I'm sippin' on vodka strong as Chewbaca in his prime
Thinkin' God forgive, He's kind, so opposite of mine
So I'mma hit the grind til I'm the topic of the time
See I'm confident that competition's hoppin' into line to fall victim to apocalyptic rhymes
So poppin' shit is fine, not to my face, say it to my back
Cuz I'm ahead of you whack niggas, blame it on a fact
When your paper get jammed up, blame it on a fax
While I'm in Saks snatchin' everything hangin' on the racks
I used to reach out 'til my arm would get tired
I ain't reachin' out no more, that offer expired
Matter of fact, this entire song is coffin inspired
Draw then I fire, you fell off, you lost the desire
Caught Alzheimers, forgot the lost art of the raw rhymer
G-shot, niggas all kinda small timers
This tune is an open wound to a salt miner

That's why them hoes be on us when we with Mr. Porter

I valet in front of the zombies and tricks
The paint on the coup as white as Abercrombie and Fitch

Tried to find me a mommy that remind me of origami
If mommy bends and folds then mommy is the shit
Fuckin' her boobs, salami her tits
Nothin' to prove, you hard with this dick I nut and I move
Baby, I'm an apex predator
Half a million in cash in the bag and a bad credit score
The body is her temple, I need a better door
Couple of windows I work in on myself, that's the metaphor
Hit the cheddar boy, I'm on a gold mine

He winning in the fuck a bad bitch category
But he losing with the shallow ass women he choose

On little mommy, fo sho, you a hotty
Knew where I would stand so she waited in the lobby
She a predator, I'm her prey and she shot me

You there? You ask if I care? The answer is yeah
You ask me to swear, I know it ain't fair, I know I'm a player
You where? Why are you there?
How can I be mad if she flipped the script
Tired of lies and decide to hop dick-to-dick
Crying her eyes out in my house
Decide to find out how I feel if another nigga lick the uh
Some niggas won't admit it but I'm telling you that we don't give a fuck if we've been cheating
We don't want you getting even
We don't even want you leaving even though we been creeping and meeting people in the mother fucking hotel
We be like ""oh well"", wax that ho tail, then I make a song about it
I give the bitch some bars like no bail, Peace Prize Nobel
Feeling fucked up when it's all over the real shit begin
A guilt trip again, and she sick of going through thick and thin

Can anybody feel me? Can anybody feel me?
I'm talking bout the real me
And the real me is guilty of putting many women in the eye of the storm
Is it true sound Crooked I is on
Every song ain't gon' have a happy ending, the old lady said I would die alone
If I don't change all of my ways, I'mma live all of my days
In a daze under the haze of a cloud full of darkness
Can't swallow the pain and the pain's all in my brain
And I can't follow the maze, man I'm lost, I ain't heartless
I looked in the crystal ball and the only thing I saw
Was me standing all alone, me standing on my own
I looked in the crystal ball and the only thing I saw
Was me standing all alone, how did I end up all alone

I ain't Steve Nash, nobody get a pass
I found the nigga that made a top 50 hot MC list
And my Glock committed sodomy and shot him in the ass
Standin' over his body I probably shoulda asked
Why the greatest rappers gotta be somebody from the past
Compared to Slaughterhouse, a lot of niggas trash
Followin' a fad, what would I do if they follow the Slaughter
They prolly swallow this hollow and a mag
Tongue full of dung, it's shit talkin'
Niggas want me dead, fuck it I'm still walkin'
Enemies in the club, fuck it I'm still parkin' the coupe

When you see another human being who's being treated worse than a disease
On his knees, beggin' please, for egg and cheese
Or anything to eat do you see his test as a lesson for you
Or do you move on say ""fuck em"", ignore em
Can't do nothing for em, if this is true, let me count your blessings for ya
You could be fighting hunger, not the Gandhi type hunger strike fighting for something right
I mean fighting the type of hunger a little girl in the third world
Fights everyday 'til her stomach is nothing but something that her spine is hiding under
Only been alive 5 summers
Hunger pains, her heart beating like some live drummers
It's beating harder, then she drop, died

Growing up in the hood, a small error
In judgement can make your parents become some pallbearers

So them straight shots caught ??? for nothing, do you care what
Get involved, get out of your chair, stand the fuck up
Do something, don't lie down and do nothin
Five rounds, hit him in his side now
Blood paints the streets of the Chitown since the news [?]
When is the truce coming?
Violence hit a new summit
And the view from it allows us to see the youth plummet
Gotta be sad, colostomy bags, shots got teenagers rockin' a new stomach
And I ain't saying that this rap was perfect
But I'm strapped with purpose
Trying to get past the surgeons in that emergency room
But if I don't get past the casket service

You don't like us, so what, the freaks feel us
Onion booty and some yoga pants
She got that 'won't you come bend me over stance
I got paper and she over stamps
I got a message for the haters man

[Chorus]
Tell them muhfuckas we made it
(x4)
Live good, still hood
Grind hard like a real nigga should
1hunnid, stay true
Let 'em know, tell them muhfuckas we made it

Yeah, tell them muhfuckas we made it
Johnny Blue, tell them muhfuckas we faded
Middle finger you and them mothafuckas who hate it
Still sleeping on us, leave them suckas sedated
By the time they wake up, probably flying to Jamaica
On my birthday gettin' my cake up
You dudes Hollywood, say what?
I call you virtual sex, you fake fucks
I don't think you want a problem
I'm Andy Warhol and ??? on boardwalk
I'm awesome when I draw guns
Be somewhere in Boston when the law come
With a bad bitch and she know it's pimpin'
Her accent is like Lois Griffin
The Lord's prayer over roasted chicken
Some red wine, let's toast to livin'

[Chorus]

Breaking news, we making moves
You new niggas listen, pay your dues
Don't be a dive artist, or you play to lose
Kick you while you down, in my favorite shoes
Box me, you need a drug test
Box full of shells, let's have a slug fest
Then I tell your ho put on her fuck dress
Give me brains for fame, that's success
The best revenge and this is murder now
You talk behind my back and I ain't even turn around
Ants to a giant, I ain't even heard a sound
Attitude up, I ain't finna turn it down
VH1 bitch in a black Carerra
Gettin' Viacom pussy in this ratchet era
Fuck her weave up and her black mascara
Then pass by my haters blowin' Jack Herera

[Chorus]",Tell Them MF's We Made It
Crooked I,"Yeah, I'm feeling like Jay-Z Annotateon Reasonable Doubt
My first debut album probably be my last, it's all good though
Us COB boys we out here, niggas say: ""Are y'all some d-boys?""
Nigga, we d-boys, we weed-boys, pill-boys, syrup-boys
Whatever it take to get the money, ya no what I mean?
Ghostwrite y'all niggas some lyrics, whatever y'all niggas need, man
We out here (haha)
Y'all ma'fuckas never seen niggas like us
We the real deal, we the real movement
Hold on I gotta take this call, I holla at you in a minute

Niggas prolly in top of the Cosmopolitan
Olive in the dirty martini, we be the Parliament
The C.O.B conglomerate get the camera and document
The opposite of nonsense nigga, we building monuments
Power moves avoiding them shower shoes cause
Fuck a CON, fuck a P.O. man
You cowards lose, screw you in your county blues
See our views is to get money like Howard Hughes do
Limited liability corporations based in Vegas for less tax and wasted wages
Taste the Asian cuisine,
We conversate over a plate of that red [?], that's chopsticks and saki
Win like Steven the architect, believing in our connects
With all respect, the hot bitches watch me
Feel the mob vibe when the COB hits the lobby
We not with the cocky, we confident
Niggas walking across the casino floor like Sam Rothstein
Striding like Goliath and we ain't sweating the small things
We all kings, turn Vegas into New Orleans
Get cash money with no limit, man we talk green
Woman eavesdrop but sweaty you need not
You can join us, let me show you the way that G's rock
Never touch your purse, your chair or your door handle
Chivalry is dead for boys, I'm more man though
Love it when your Prada dress hotter than Orlando
Picture perfect portrait like you're posing for Van Gogh
The crap table, we sippin' on black label
I'm loyal, I die for my brothers, I'm raps Abel
I'm torn from the cloths of the Gods, defeating all the odds
You fake rap niggas y'all the facade
Y'all the miraged, meanwhile I'm talking to broads
Like after this awesome massage we can talk a ménage
Out in Vegas on business

[Chorus]
We out in Vegas on business
My briefcase full of big face Benjie's
We flyin' by you on the freeway
We spendin', we spendin'
Like all this money burning my pocket
(Conducting organized business, business)
Like all this money burning my pocket
(Conducting organized business, business)
Out in Vegas on business

Yeah, let's hit the strip and smash
Bright casino lights bouncing off the tinted glass
Pull up to the Caesars Palace, pour Louis in the glass
Bartender didn't ask, I'm a repeat customer
It's written on my face, I'm a elite hustler
If life is a bitch I'mma just keep fucking her
Raised in the gutta and I don't miss my home
Italian sports car, French cologne
Of African descent blackened by the sun, dark skin Capone
On capitalism, a rapper eatin' rappers so that's cannibalism
Yeah, you bastards shoud listen I'm on a Hannibal mission
A Carthaginian king burying gold
Bringing the troops to the 7 0 2 area code
Meet on the roof of that Bellagio
The helicopter's waiting on the helipad
Talking code when we in front of that pilot though
Keep our business on the quiet yo
It's hoes in the desert for whoever try to know
Ay yo, land this muhfucka on the Venetian
They got a decent Louis store, I need some shit for this evening
See they finally let the G's win, celebrate our achievements
Pussy niggas don't wanna see they better leave then
We here on business, we mixing it with pleasure
We some pussy pirates these bitches gettin' the hidden treasure
I bet your boyfriend he can tell you're getting fresher
Like, ""where did you get them shoes and that shit that's in your dresser?""
Your Vegas trip with your girls was so regular
Till you ran across me and my predators
We caught you slippin' and this ain't shit but a business trip
When you tell him use censorship
We in Vegas on business, conducting organized biz

Crooked I,"This is how it happens, somebody yell your name
You turn around and look, you see a barrel flame
You fall against the wall while the hammer nail your frame
Try to get up then you stumble, you sittin' there in pain
Thought you was a thug, all it got you was a slug
Crowd goes wild cause they shot you in the club
Killer comes closer, pop you in the mug
Gravity and the Grim Reaper both drop you in your blood
Wildin' on Instagram showing you pack heat
Trippin' on Twitter, they split you 'til ya black knee
People love a role player, so you act street
Til you in your homie car dying in the back seat
Livin' on the edge, now them killas on your head
Soon as you get it twisted they put a million on your dreads
ER is too far now you a corpse in the car
Before you left you heard death

You only die once my nigga, you only die once
You only die once my nigga, you only die once

Now you poppin' rubber bands talkin' bout you got it all
Flexin' for the strippers, one is sendin' out a call
Some niggas slide up on you, [...] pull it out and draw
Walk you into the bathroom, surround you by the stall
One watch the door, other goin' in your pocket
One snatchin' your jewels, ain't shit you can do to stop it
Thinkin' bout swingin' on the nigga, nigga stop it
You robbed by some pros, that stripper ho gon' get a profit
Your ego feel pathetic, tellin' you not to dead it
Expression on your face, them other niggas read it
You walkin' to your car, they knew where you was headed
They parked you in the parking lot before you can even set it
I seen it all unfold from a corner dimly lit
With a Worldstar bunny bouncin' on a nigga dick
See I got my Ruger, couple extended clips
And when I passed security, I hit 'em with some chips

1st Verse 
(J Da Groova) 

(If I want to free?) my mind 
I feel pain and stress 
accompanied by fear of falling  and war 
Gotta hold my breath 
and stay afloat 
What I wrote 
to complement what I feel 
But now my feelings turn to dust 
as I dictate what's real 
Now, all this shit people care about, 
that's made by man 
When all that shit's all gone 
There's nothing left in your hands 
I tried to crush pieces of coal into diamonds 
My timing 
was off, couldn't cope 
with what this life had brought 
But now I realize 
I have to let that bullshit cease 
If something good happens to me, 
it makes the bad increase 
Even unconsciously 
these frauds be hunting me 
in my dreams 
Teaching a lesson, 
that life ain't always what it seems 
Gotta keep these blessings 
At last, 
time is running out fast 
what the future holds 
always coincides with the past 
You never know the shit I'm feeling 
when I'm staring at the ceiling 
J Da Groova, Crooked Lettaz, 
doing mental cap peelings 

(chorus) 

I remember WHEN 
remember then 
remember WHAT? 
remember WOODS

deep in the cut

2nd Verse 

(Kamikaze) 

We the last line 
of defense 
That's why the South remain calm 
in all this nonsense 
They cloning sheep 
Next week, 
boi, they'll be cloning you 
Now while you steady claiming coasts 
with your silly crew 
I got stew 
and we be nuetral to your black and white 
So, we be ready 
when the folks come at us late at night 
To all you representing rappers 
up in low fatigues 
You keep it real 
but them woods 
keep it out your league 
They got a freeze on your money 
but you ain't gon' want it 
'cause there's a concentration camp 
with your name on it 
and, doggonit, 
they gonna get you with this devil tax 
They got your whole act on file at the (Equalfax???) 
I can't relax 
Mastercard say (they won't take cash?) 
I'm a ??????? 
A mad dash up the charts 
won't even get you straight 
A platinum plate 
and some cake 
and you still paying late 
Your royalties 
is just like spoiled cheese 
on a platter 
by the time you see a cent 
boy, it won't even matter 
There's fatter rhymes 
and fatter beats 
Congressmen in seats 
Your little raps won't even last 
in this world of cheats

3rd verse

The sun shines 
on the South 
I'm ready to take my clique 
on this deathbed 
and (do this thing?) y'all killing me with 
The (design?) 
pierces my brain 
with this bullet from hell 
(the damn ride?), '99 
killed my cousin Michelle 
One wrong turn, 
her body fell 
25 feet 
Her skull split 
up into bits 
on the cold concrete 
And in the streets, 
little kids getting shot in the face 
ever since being housed, 
y'all in the wrong place 
And I know (this Coca Cola boils to crack?) 
Now a child got AIDS from being fucked from the back 
y'all ask (if the?) struggle hit me 
If I'm here for the next verse, we all gon' see 
Put on ""Triggerman"" 
(death don't hurt?) 
Man, I got this gun from a smoker 
and the shit don't work

in the wind POOF, ain't no PROOF, a super sleuth 
couldn't find his shoes 
I wrap heads, like bad news 
And bust bass and blow a fuse 
Then I move to Baton Rouge like, Snoop on the move 
I'm like Megatron, an underground rap shit phenomenon 
I blow up in my Prime (and after that?) 
Then I move to Cybertron, with Omega Supreme 
But it seems that I gotta sit back and pray (back and pray) 
to God that these niggaz won't take me away (why?) 
I say it seems that I gotta sit back and pray 
to God that these niggaz won't take me away

While I'm standin here draped in diamonds

Survive enemies, Mississippi get paid niggas
They lay ya lup in ya lap, and let the pistol dome clap
And it ain't all about this rap shit bitch nigga
Handle the business with the muthafuckin chrome trigga

It's middle-finger for them pigs, tell em 'suck my dick!'
I never grew up in the ghetto but I spits that shit
And got a team that'll get you and you won't be missed
I don't drink Cris, you like it at the top of your list
But never figured how you did it 'cause it tastes like piss
I'd rather sip the two fingers till I make me a fist
And take a break from revolutions so I could hit you wit this
You took you first advance money, put it dead on yo' wrist
Or all them big-body strippers wit them big ol' tits
But man I see them same hookers and just blow em a kiss
'cause they the ones who used to dis before I made these hits
Before I had the turkey bacon wit mahamony grits
Before a nigga hit the pits and started rhymin for kicks

Right now they buildin houses wit computer chips in the flo'
So they know when you at home and when you ain't
And when you use that smart bank card, you in the paint
Let me break it down, they called it the New World Foundation
And when you use it, they know your exact location
And what you spit, and what you spit that ?own is your line?
That leave a mark, now they got that card in your mind
And in your skin, shit don't mean nuttin to them
And then power is the gold passion for us to defend
And when they get that money, yo' value ain't shit

Stand in line for twenty hours, application says denied
want to see a 9-to-5 but couldn't work it if I tried
Man you lied, didn't give me my forty acres and a mule
Now it's back to sellin crack to all your children after school

Ain't no chance to see my face, I'll make yo' memory erase

I'm hopin' to give the kids something back
Instead of wild-ass stories about sellin' vials of crack
Or bitches and cars, but my state left scars
On my man hood, while y'all be screamin' that it's all good
When it ain't never been, most kids move to Chicago
And those that didn't were left hollow
Wit low self-esteem but it seems that all my dreams got crushed
But y'all niggas kept it on the hush
So why y'all frontin' on the South, come and get some
Ask your scared-ass parents where you from, you crumb

[Chorus: x2]

My God, these lyrics hot, you're gonna need sunblock
My verbal's cocked wit ammunition
For you shiesty A&R's who be dissin'
You missin', the Southern fried cookin', who you lookin' at?
Bustin' lyrics from the soundproof straight to DAT
In fact, I'm sick of how you brothers react
My demo says Mississippi but I ain't speakin' 'bout no gats
But my raps, are laced wit homicidal tendencies
A Menace like Dennis be, bustin' rhymes from here to Tennessee

Cops rang, my man he done bled to death
And the ambulance done came and left
I'm by myself, with your traces 
And my yard you know it's hard, mentally-scarred
Brain-barred little cousin Joe, I done seen the whole thing
I can't seem to get my hands clean
Done washed em twelve times in a row, twelve rhymes is spoke
Twelve dimes but it doesn't ease the pain
Suggestion, (ah, excuse me Mr. Crump can we ask you some questions)
Don't ask me no questions

[Chorus: x2]

Now shortly, it be that portly MC from the M-G-T
North Jackson, Mississippi where them brainiacs be
Ain't no hustlers, no gangstas, no slangers an' thugs
The only test for your vest will be verbal slugs
And mean mugs get shrugged out quick, it ain't no fightin'
Just down home receitin', and some dope lyric writin'
Tighten your skills, before you cross the border into hell
It's that mack, know your state where them stow-aways dwell

Evil lurks in my mind, though I'm tryin to find peace
My mom is payin for a crib, a cracker's holdin the lease
These niggas holdin the piece, cock the hammer, heard it click
Gun held in my hand, but the glock it didn't spit
Niggas takin my shit, I ran my clothes and my shoes
??? robbin a nigga, kill his ass if he move
But y'all ain't killin Lavell, without a fight tonight

Savin souls we gone shine, watermelon to the rhine
Chicken wings and musket dimes
Ballin off the laker pines
Shake a nigga, to the nines
Swoop his ass up out his vines
Trans bitch, make you rich, pick a style then watch it switch
Maybe y'all can check it like this here, check it
Let me show y'all trill, can a brother get ill
What's the deal if I still feel 
like I won't kill 'cause I just can't pay my bills
And my got damn girl won't take her pills
Make a nigga want to play the field, pray for real
Hopin all my partners stay for real
Can you say boy Crooked Lettaz ain't for real?
'Cause we makin that shit that the playas feel
You done made a deal, 'cause ya tape don't hit
Talk that talk, and ya boy can't spit
Ain't no bigger than a small time
Lav, get my money, better find that trick
Stick, move, can't, lose, do them shows, pay them dues
Hip-hop, worldwide, Mississippi, play them blues
Choose life, through the strife
Take some kids, and a wife
Knife, edge, cut a wedge
Keep ya juice and know the ledge
Dead, still, run a mil, south niggas keep it trill for real

These demons searchin for my soul, they gettin closer and warm
Enemies in pale skin in my physical form
No, it's funny, 'cause I don't even mourn for the day
I can't get these white pictures of Jesus outta my head
The preacher's Bible said there's no depiction of Christ
But then they lie to a brother, now my mind ain't right
'Cause if God is white, and black folks ain't shit
But they know that he wasn't, but they couldn't run the risk
Of their town praisin one who looked more like ???
They rather play in my mind and send us all to hell
But I'm here to tell the truth, fuck the myths and the lies
But what's bad they can't even look me straight in my eyes

Crooked Pine Stringband,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise
Crooked Still,"When first I came to Louisville 
Some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington 
Was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks
Her ruby lips
Like arrows pierced my breast
The name she bore was Flora
The Lily of the West

I came to my love Flora
Some pleasure there to find
She turned in to another man
Which sort of stressed my mind
She robbed me of my loyalty
Deprived me of my rest
I loved my faithless Flora
The Lily of the West

Now down in yonder shady grove
The man who was to come
Conversing with my Flora there
It seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him
It sort of me oppressed
I was betrayed by Flora 
The Lily of the West

I stepped up to my rival 
My dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar
And I boldly made him stand
We met in desperation
I pierced him in the breast
I killed the man for Flora 
The Lily of the West

I had to stand my trial 
I had to make my plea
They placed me in a criminal box
And then commenced on me
Although she sold my life away
Deprived me of my rest
I loved my faithless Flora
The Lily of the West",Flora

No my dear, he isn't here for he is drowned in this ocean, dear

Answer me, oh give me joy for I love my soldier boy
Oh no, lady, he's not here. Dropped down dead in the gulf, my dear

Get me a chair to sit upon, and pen and ink, come write it down
On every line I will shed a tear: on every verse cry oh, my dear.

Crooked Still,"She went into the graveyard with trouble on her mind.
She was lookin' for the man who make her crazy. 
From her big brown coat she puller a silver knife.
As she held it in her hand, her heart was racing. 

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. 
If I stay I'll never find my way back home.

Its been nine long years since you took my hand. 
I'll never understand what made you do it,
And how you twisted up my soul, through me in a hole.
I didn't come this far to see you through it

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. 
If I stay I'll never find my way back home.

Babe, I'm sorry for you, but it's what I have to do. 
You died that night beneath the leaves have fallen, 
And the devil will stand by; smilin' bright, his pitchfork high.
A ghost from all these graves will come a callin'.

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. 
If I stay I'll never find my way back home.

So she stabbed him in the heart.
Her shinning blade it ripped apart 
His skin and pierced thought the center,
And I lay my body down, through me on the ground,
And cover me so I can hide from my dominator. 

You're low down and dirty, 
So low down.

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. (x3)

Fairer than the sweetest flower
Restless as the wildest way
Pored in with love deep as a ocean 
This is the girl that I did win

I left her there back in the mountain
To see the world riches to gain
Oh, when I returned no earthy treasure 
Could ease this heart so filled with pain

They saw high above the mountain 
Beneath that little mound of clay 
The girl that I returned to marry 
So stand a mound of flowers did lay

You wanna give up

There you go, diggin' your hole

I know there's gonna be better days,  better days

So brother, don't worry
You got a good thing goin' on
Even if it seems like
Every thing's been goin' wrong
It'll be alright

Be thankful for what you got
Even if it's not a lot

Don't worry your life away
I know there's gonna be better days

'Cause the sun's still shinin' behind the clouds

Don't let a good thing slip away

Don't worry your life away
I know there's gonna be better days

'Cause the sun's still shinin' behind the clouds
Like sleepin' in through the rain
I know there's gonna be better days

'Cause the world's still spinnin' around and round
Don't worry your life away
I know there's gonna be better days

Crosby Loggins,"I never run to
Anyone suitable to love me
Have never been one to
Follow the easy way around

I'm alright
Moving against my own direction
So good at fighting
The battle for my mind

When will I come home?
Am I really alone?

Heaven help me on my way
I'm my own worst enemy
Every choice that I make
Is a four letter mistake

I'm still trying to get free
So let your light come down on me
Before I waste another day
Heaven help me, help me on my way

The moment I met you
I started to see my imperfections
A rhapsody in blue
A prisoner of my own device

I never meant to
Hide from the one who really loves me
It's just that it's hard to
Outrun my own demise

Heaven help me on my way
I'm my own worst enemy
Every choice that I make
Is a four letter mistake

I'm still trying to get free
So let your light come down on me
Before I waste another day
Heaven help me

Help me to lessen my control
And to love the letting go
Keep me from feeling so
Divided when I know
That the love in front of me
Is exactly what I need

Heaven help me on my way
I'm my own worst enemy
Every choice that I make
Is a four letter mistake

I'm still trying to get free
So let your light come down on me

Told everyone I knew
I was gonna get you

I'm telling you

There's one thing I know
I'll never let you go, no

'Cause the world doesn't work like that
It's always changing
But she's sick of waiting

Her patience is over
'Cause she can see the other side tonight
Her head needs my shoulder
But I don't have the heart to tell her

She takes me way too serious
I'm just someone who's out of his league
She takes me way too seriously

You'd think by now she would know
That I'm hardly deserving
My kind of love doesn't always show
'Cause it's under the surface

Where everything tends to stay
I can never be lonely if nobody knows me
But I wish that it wasn't this way

"Crosby, Stills & Nash","Can I sing a song to the woman

I believe there is too much love to hide

And he played real good

Me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and about thirty-seven criminal
Escorting me to this halls

And I'll play if you have some money
Or if you're a friend to me
But that one-man band by the quick lunch stand
He was just playin' real good for free

Though he played so sweet and high
They knew they had never seen him on their TV screen

Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signals changed

While we're keeping both feet on the ground?

Come back, come back. I can put away the rages
Come back, come back. Can we turn the next page together?

When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,
To keep her from the howlin' winds.

If it rolls and flows all down her breast.

Maybe I miss your kiss just a little bit.
Maybe I miss your body lying right next to mine.

Sweet Home Alabama,
And how I miss the way she always smiled.

But the call block wouldn't let me through
And now I'm wishing for some drugs or a shrink to console me
But I'm never getting over Joely

Well I gathered up all my guns
And a pipe bomb just for fun
And I drove to her house and parked on the lawn
That's right I always was a crazy one.
Well her boyfriend was sure nice to me
Said calm down would you like a drink
And then I shot him full of holes
From his nose to his knees
And I polished off her little sweet pea

It's your best friend from high school who sees you and wishes you well
Yeah, you try to breakthrough but you run out of stories to tell
So you bid him goodbye and you step into space
So many questions that you cannot face

There's a lonely feeling taking his place
It's a lonely feeling that you just can't erase

Well, it's three men from Chile who are tired and they want to go home
Well, they run out of money, stuck up in east Oregon
So you give 'em the small bit of change from your hand
Try to speak Spanish but they don't understand

It's a lonely feeling, it gets to a man
It's a lonely feeling that runs through the land

Well, it's a statue of Jesus that your grandmother had when she died
It's all cracked and all yellow and know you should throw it aside
But you're growin' religious the older you get
Haven't been saved but it should happen yet

It's a lonely feeling full of regret
It's a lonely feeling, won't let you forget

Well, it's a bus stop, a street cop, an old dog, the new kid, a bum
It's fright and rejected, neglected and blind, deaf and dumb
Yeah, but you look in the mirror and you're still hanging in
It's there to remind you how lucky you've been

It's a lonely feeling, now and again
It's a lonely feeling that comes now and then",Lonely Feeling

My heart and soul are torn twisted thorn woven all around your crown

There's no need in me pretending

And tryin' to make a new batch of friends

Pawned everything that I could pawn
I guess I thought they'd be open-hearted
They never knew I was gone

Fresh brand new born baby on the planet
Almost aborted taken for granted
Sticky from the womb

After the scrub

Yo you gotta keep fishin' there's one who controls who you are and be
Which is a slight definition of the Almighty
But don't get it twisted, He's faithful and cares
And won't allow you to go through more than you can bear
But with all your temptation, He'll give you an escape
So whether you've been molested or whether you've been raped
Or born in the ghetto in a cold water flat
Blind, or deaf, handi- or capped
Hold on deliverance is nigh
Cause you can get your piece of the pie
In the twinkling of an eye
And God can't lie, it's a test, a plan
So will you still hold on when you can't understand?
Will you hold on so that God can get the glory?
You'll get the reward, He'll tell the story
About a person that had a hard life
The stress and the strife
And nothin' went right
And so much pain, didn't know what to do...
But still serve God despite the catch 22

Strung up for the lost
Ya'll know they slayed Him
He rose from the grave, came to save, though they played Him
Some hate Him, mocked Him, to the ground His blood spilled
To this day they be dockin' the things that got Him killed
Shrilled and screamed knowing He'd redeem half the planet
How could He stand in knowing He'd be taken for granted
Disadvantaged became dust just like you and me
Human beings just so He can put His deed at calvary
Now how do we say thanks, better yet check how could He take it
Despising all the shame being plain in sight-naked
Crowned with thorns scorned by the unrighteous judges
The King's arms expands shook hands with death's clutches
Seal the deal kill one for all called it grace
Meaning the Supreme Being would die in our place
He was rich and became poor so that we through His poverty
Could become rich hit the lottery

Cross Movement,"To the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. To my Lord, my God, to my
Father.
First of all I want to thank You. I gotta applaud You for the magnificent
Job You're doing as You sovereignly rule planet earth. I see Your divine
Signature on everything from creation, to people's lives. And You
Continually blow my mind with the way You do the things You do! After all
What You do, no one else can do. Word up! Gimmie strength to keep You the
Center of all that I say and do.

For the record, I do confess Jesus as Lord. And I realize that without Him
You wouldn't accept any of my letters, Lord, or hear any of my prayers.
It's my surroundings though-I'm part of that hip-hop culture. But who
Would've thought that when it started as just an urban way of expressing
Reality without disregarding all moral upbringing, that it would now be
Dominated by the most profane, anti-Christ, violent, vulgar, sacrilegious
Money hungry people! What's ""bad"" is called ""good,"" what's ""good"" is called ""bad.""
Man, things are getting illa and illa. To have a million and one good times
In a man's life, and none of them involve You. Thousands of parties thrown
Throughout the year, and none of them celebrate Your existence. Who do we
Think we are Lord?

I guess a better question is: ""Who do we think You are?"" Maybe what they
Say is true, ""outta sight, outta mind."" Since we can't see You we forget
About You. But how can we forget about You when all around us there's
Reminders of the fact that You are.

This life will never be right without You in the picture. We can pretend
All we want that things are fine without You. But then the sirens of a
Squad car, or an ambulance, or a fire engine will quickly remind us that
All isn't well--we do need You! And we need You just the way You are--not
The way we want You to be. Lord I'm a part of that group that's tore up
About the breakup between God and man. I won't try to pretend like I'm
Better off without You. I'd jump at the chance to get back with You! And
Even though it's our fault that we're separated, You didn't swing on us.
Instead You put our fault on Your Son, and swung on Him! What a dope play!
And what a dope Savior! Not many people understand how significant He is.
They're blind to His true essence, and they think they're smart by trusting
In human intelligence rather than Your Word. And all this talk about,
""We're God"", I won't even go there, that's ridiculous! Lord, I'll be Your
Representative. If no one else will, I'll represent. 'Cause after all, how
Can they call on the One they don't believe in? And how can they believe in
The One they haven't heard of? And how can they hear without someone
Proclaiming the message? And how will one proclaim unless he's sent? So
Like Isaiah, send me. Equip me to reach and change my circle of influence.
And Lord I won't front, I won't front.

No one has to stay a victim of the bad news when you're a Savior who brings
Good news. Oh I know it hurts that so many will refuse such a great
Salvation. But yo Lord, I'm praising You, praising You for the few that
Will believe.
Forever Yours Lord. Much, much love.",The Love Letter [*]

'Cause they can't handle the Light
They're still stuck in the mode

Of foreshadows 'n types
After the Dark Ages came illumination
Meaning the Son was made visible
Like the fourth day of creation

To expose the deeds of men
So we can see our sin then
See the need for Him to bleed for men

[Chorus]

I think it's sad how men try to grasp
The divine truth of God
When without Christ
God and man clash

Like pok-a-dots and plaid
They say our doctrine's bad
As if explainin' God is a drop in the bag
Divine truths are concealed

Unless God chooses to reveal
What we believe is by faith
There's no need to prove it's real
""The Bible's corrupt!""

Well, that's the phrase that's getting' old
Bottom line, you're blind
To the mysteries of the written code
Are you among those whom the Son knows?

Does your hope rest in the fact that the Son rose?
When it comes to trust
People are placin' bad bets
What can be proved

Requires no faith to accept
False teachers writin' bad checks
Don't be deceived
Many believe in God

But what about God do they believe?
Is he like the old man
With the long beard
You've seen in cartoons?

Did He board the mothership
And fly to the back of the moon?
In Revelations is He the A and the Z
Or is He gonna come back and say

He lied about who He claimed to be?
Did He suffer in hell for sin
Or was His death enough?
Trust solo Cristo minus the extra stuff

Cross Movement,"What is life, when you ain't living right
Sight when your blind as night
Low level living, trying to perpetrate height
With all your might, you scrape, and you thug, and you fight
And refuse every invitation to come into the light
What's it like, to have to maintain
Gain, life left lane, strife, death, pain, all in vain
This world will make a lot of promise to keep you high lit
If your an earthbound thug, than you've got what you get
And don't even expect no more
You might as well plunder in this war
But also expect the god of heaven to one day tally up the score
Who you playing for, does your coach know the game
Are you shooting with a ball that's engulfed in flame
Well if your tired of contract, you saw what it paid
Hold out right now, make your team force a trade
It ain't a easy move, in fact it's hard
But only real ball players play for this real rough squad
Coached by the god, the one and only jehovah
And the first dribbling skill he teaches is the cross over
In fact he did it to perfection, without (no) question
Refer to the holy play book for accurate recollection
He seeking no names rookies, in which he never met
And those in foul trouble who admit their game is suspect
He'll turn a freshman in to an upper classer
With joy and laughter, he'll take'em higher than nasa
He can turn a pimp into a sho'nuff pastor
Turn a pathetic amateur in to a perennial master
And he'll do more than these mere power displays
He'll teach you his way, and make it john blaze
Cause ain't nothing lacking in christ
And he loves to turn a thug to the love life

What's the right life
More rugged than thug life
It's the love life, it's the love life
Mo' better than drug life, mug life or the club life
It's the love life y'all

What's the right life
More rugged than thug life
It's the love life, it's the love life
Mo' better than drug life, mug life or the club life
It's the love life y'all

How is it that your gonna go all out

When you really don't know what life is all about
Your wile-ing out, your wile-ing out
Thug life ain't really what you hear them claim
Somebody always seems to have a better aim
Get out the game, get out the game
When Christ comes back to collect on dues
Watch how many thugs gonna sing the blues
You better choose, yo he can't lose

All now here we go again
New day and new flow again
Mission, prove and show again
Let my sis and dun's know again
Same stizzy and plan again
Proclaim the god-man again
To the dead mannequins
Want clothes and places to stand again
On the bully, everybody's high strung like a pulley
You don't survive unless understand the game fully
So as god's aliens and strangers in this place
The only way we make it is to stay up in his face
By prayer and grace as sheep among wolves
We duck the buck shot and keep it moving with the hooves
Tell me what's rugged
To dwells with the murders and the thugged
And have a four-pound and won't even lug it
You don't want to kill but you will to keep it real
You got a lot a heat some of these cold blooded cats need to feel
Like Davy Crocket, you'll loose the hand rockets
But there's a crown of thorns that won't let you cock it
There's the one who was hit with the three spike bullets
Who bleed all on your trigger and now you can't even pull it
The shots pierced through his wrist and feet into the wood
And he took it like a savior like thug never could
Like a god, like a king, like a soldier at war
Who knew the cost of dying, and all that it was for
All for us, who would never feel his pain
But now we say to live is Christ and to die is gain
So praise the true god in his wisdom and might
Who can turn a thug to the love life

What's the right life
More rugged than thug life
It's the love life, it's the love life
Mo' better than drug life, mug life or the club life
It's the love life y'all

What's the right life
More rugged than thug life

Where they're up in your face every time the trolly stops

For the last and evil, its gonna take more then stain glass and steeple
But a distinctive people, who only bow down to the Regal
The One who didnt count it robbery to be called equal
They the ones wit no fear, they the ones who stay clear

You wanna roll doubles, and stand in smoke huddles
And feel like the hubble, bein shot out the shuttle

And you fall back down to earth, and splash in a puddle
The cost of the trip was oh so pricey
You're mad at the world all hot and spicey
Then wit the quickness of a swoosh like Nike
Satan did his thing and dug up in your psyche
Cause all this life gives is temporary relief
And all you really had was temporary belief
You couldnt really see the amazin deciet

Thats why we say, get a Bible and read it in its entirety
And let God deal wit you and your propriety
Check out all the cats of noteriety the variety
Of ways they deal wit the ills of society
Let it bring sobriety, let it make you firey
Cause its gonna take more then a slice of apple piety

And there's lost souls, and things that tempt em
And to Jesus there's rest and redemption

Not to mention, you learned you lesson
No more vexin, no more stressin
No more guessin, no more Heaven, and hell questions
No more just livin for the blessins, no more dressin

Words whose sounds match that stimulate the mind
And what if you can write a verse?
How you paying homage to music's Maker with punchlines of curse?
And the stanza's that modern man does are full of vanity, vulgarity and
propaganda

We even stick God up and saying, ""Run the jewels!""

And put His hand behind His head and turn His back
He's the type to look right back down your pipe
And see the Cross in the crosshairs of your site
And be like, ""Oh you sticking me up? No you not
I'm loaning you my stuff, but you on the clock
And when that last tic-tocks, I'm coming to your block

No more sitting in this place

Of every day that I will spend
Wishing that I only had a choice
No more pushing you away

Never looking back on this anymore
Because what I'm looking for are the answers

Goodbye to yesterday
Nothing left in my way
Hey hey I've been saved
With sun shining on my pain
Getting me through this day
Hey hey watch me wave

Of the things I've wanted but I never could find 
I am a part of a world that I hate I wish the 
End would come faster my world's a disaster 
Can't you see that I;m down and I'm drowning

I gotta get you out of my blood 
I gotta get you out of my scene 
I gotta get you out of me 

What I'm really trying hard to get down to words 
Is the way I fit into this world 
Things I survived pushed me to the darkeer side 
Because of life as it was the life that was 
Yours should've never been mine 
But I never could take anymore of this 
Cause I'm always gonna get down to the floor 
It's a cold gun that I kiss 
'Cause I cannot break anymore

Maybe there's something beautiful hidden deep in my bones

And so I left the village green.

The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.

And now all the houses
Are rare antiquities.
American tourists flock to see the village green.
They snap their photographs and say ""gawd darn it,
Isn't it a pretty scene?""

And now he owns a grocery.

Crowded House,"You opened up your door
I couldn't believe my luck
You in your new blue dress
Taking away my breath
The cradle is soft and warm
Couldn't do me no harm
You're showing me how to give
Into temptation
Knowing full well the earth will rebel
Into temptation

A muddle of nervous words
Could never amount to betrayal
The sentence is all my own
The price is to watch it fail
As I turn to go
You looked at me for half a second
With an open invitation for me to go

Into temptation
Knowing full well the earth will rebel
Into temptation
Safe in the wide open arms of hell

We can go sailing in
Climb down, lose yourself when you linger long
Into temptation
Right where you belong

The guilty get no sleep
In the last slow hours of morning
Experience is cheap
I should've listened to the warning
But the cradle is soft and warm

Sit like a lap dog on a matron's knee
Wear the nails on your feet

Stumbled in sideways

But they could not see me

I will run for shelter

In our private universe

I have all I want, is that simple enough?
A whole lot more I'm thinking of
Every night about six o'clock
Birds come back to the pond to talk
They talk to me, birds to talk to me
If I go down on my knees

I will run for shelter

It feels like nothing matters

And it's a pleasure that I have known
And it's a treasure that I have gained
And it's a pleasure that I have known

Saw the barman wink as he poured his brandy

Aiyyo I'm fresh {DAMN!, why you say that yo?}
Cause I run up in your girl then I puff a stoge {How fresh?}
So fresh that I'm crisp and clean
And I stick to your ribs like Christ to Al Green
""I rocks rough and stuff"", nah, that ain't my line
Get the bitches more than niggas sip the wine
So act like, {ACT LIKE}, act like it rehearse it
Uka want to seven, New York is straight murder
Smoke a million and a half blunts on the roof
And every other winter vests are bulletproof, that truth
Had Boris all day, Gladys all night
Once I get it to the other side things will be aight, that's right
Get the munchies after the hemp
Got to Red Lobster get the crabs and shrimps
The E & J with the ginger ale never fail
Bicardi while I flips ghetto tales
Take a sick clique kid everywhere that I-go
Make appearances on Ricki Lake and Allado
You know who we are so, put you funky niggas to a test
{Survey says?}
Times up motha uh
Yo it's the Rhythm Blunt
Yo its like extra P cause I'm looking at the front
But if you move it all, kid your gonna fall
You'll be Ready to Die, rest in peace Biggie Smalls, baby baby
""Matter fact, I'm sick of talking""
About to wreck your body from L.A. to New York and
Back to L.A., I'm out like O.J.
Yet I'm ""F-are-E-S-H""

Aiyo I'm wild {What makes ya say that Chad?}
'cause yo I'd rather stick niggas then read off this pad {How wild?}
So wild, I run up on niggas blocks, sell some dummy rocks
And pot shots at cops
Chadeeo, yes the murderous assassin, comes through crashin
Make sure ya seat belts fastin
Blastin for the dome piece with the chrome piece
Niggas is runnin from my site 'cause I'm known beast
They flood red from they own blood shed
Verbal lead to the head, they dread shootin the dutch dead
So get smoked like 99 in Maxwell, or you get
Smoked and broked down clown, that's what the fax tell
And if you feel bigger, think youse a real nigga
I run up with my real gun up and pull the steel trigga
And go find a friend, sip up on a Heineken
And let them know how the title king is all mine again
If he start to fake jacks, he better make tracks
'cause there's no tape backs, when I begin to backs
No doubt I'm goin for mine, and mine is all that matters
What day is it dog? you don't know, you better scatter
Run and ask him what's the frequency, count it, I tell ya
Verbal wildness, societies menace
The one Chadeeo with the tauntin lyrics
And I shall keep comin back like hauntin spirits
One time for ya mind (4X)

Yo,
this joint right here
is dedicated
to the infamous, late great
Donald  Goines
word life, see-are-you, Cru representaion

""Black Girl Lost"" her pop is ""Daddy Cool""
Former ""Dopefiend"" now a pimp, damn fool
He's a ""Black Gangster"", ""Inner City Hoodlum""
Phat prankster, must admit a pretty good one
But little do he know he on a ""Death List"" and shit
This'll be ""Kenyatta's Escape"", ""Kenyatta's Last Hit""
""Crime Partners"" he and Ken' was
Till one day they spark that traum up and got a buzz
Said he heard Kenyatta had phoned his wife
So, he shot him over this rumor, tried to take his life
Promised Kenyatta would ""Never Die Alone""
So he went home, and shot his wife while she was on the phone
Shot her in the head and then she lay dead
Pimp jeted in his ""Eldorado Red""
Kenyatta didn't die he would ""Cry Revenge""
Wouldn't stop till he saw the pimp's dead end
Pimp went to whore house to see his ""Street Players""
Collect all the doe cause yo that's what the game is
Pimps called ""Swamp Man"" cause he's like a Munster
Violent in the street ever since he was a youngster
See you was a ""Whoreson"", son of a whore
And from this the violent mental scars we wore
Forgot about Kenyatta thought Kenyatta was ghost
While doin what he gotta tryin to make the most
And for those two shootins, he never got caught
Smart man ended up in the new house he bought
Ken' found out with the quickness where he lived
Written the address then went up the crib
Ooze and vest he ain't fest
Sprayed his rest, shit is best to put that pimp to the test
Six months later Ken' was back
Instead of an ooze this time he had a mack in his backpack
Yawnin, in the wee hours of the mornin
Pimps' known to leave his whorehouse at dawnin
There he is, suddenly appears
Nuthin in his hand except a six-pack of Heiniken beers
Steps out the bushes, the trigger he pushes
Hits up ""Swamp Man"" and mad blood gu-she's
Fills him with lead, puts the last in his head
Then slides, ""Swamp Man"" lay dead
Runs up a few blocks there go the cops
They must have heard the RAT-A-TAT-pops of the shots
His mind's racin wonderin what he should
Give up or say, ""Fuck It!"", and spray the cops too
Stops in his tracks and bends down to kneel
She been shot before yo he know how it feels
He drops his gun, and with it the beef
Now a ""White Mans Justice Black Mans Grief""",Goines Tale

Aiyo surprise nigga, I'm on the rise nigga
Loungin while you didn't catch up on my fries nigga
I keeps it real than ya ever, remember that brother
While him and stars talkin bout better

Check ya condition, I got ya prescriptions
I am the arrow and Chad is the crossbow
Say somethin now

[Chadeeo]
Thought so
Flows articulis, ridiculous
Roam the streets, inconspicuous
How many MC's gotta get wet, many more 'cause these
niggas don't seem to know yet
Blow you out the sky like a teeba
747 Street soldier, like Sleeba
Defiance, runnin with a how alliance
Jumps pop shit, but yo they know the science
Read they style like a final call
So they all fall like the Berlin Wall
Create a rivers, more complex then prisms
Got shit locked like prisons
Non faction, indicted no conviction
Beg description with a paper addiction

Rhythm Blunt, see are you whatever
All my ghetto dwellas boyakah together
Peace to the Gods, the G is the seven
Hittin harder then a ? eleven
And Y.O., you know
Comin through ya block like Hurricane Yugo

[Chadeeo]
You know, it's either rhymes or the straps
Make sure you want it 'cause there's no turn back
The gun ain't my God, but without one it's hard
To get ahead, see the lead, left the niggas scarred
Taught ya soul, in the street without a dime
Had to resort to the heat and petty crime
Then it got deep, some peeps laid to rest
Nine Millie short but partners got blessed
Force to the gun, some people got done
Now we try to channel thoughts into a pun

[Yogi]
Done, increase the peace
When my piece increase
Only act increase, when the gat release
Come play like Jeru, ya prophet resolves my shit
True, Rhythm Blunt comes through with the Illz

Uhh  Once upon a time  let's see if I remember 

Back in January 

Nah  chill.....it was December 

True...cuz that's when L started his bid 

Partied through the New Year 

January third he slid 

Up until then  yo  L had it swell 

Called him Sweet Pea like his name was Pernell 

He did the job  money came with ease 

Blowing outta town  moving bricks and ki's 

Him and his chick  in forty G rides 

Holding down fort like they Bonnie N Clyde 

Luxury cars of all makes and models 

New outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle 

Glass in the air (air)

Toast to my cream and the scotties that beam

What! My cash and he fucked her wit dat A 

Me and Mitch rollin' over there quick fast 

Rolled up on the spot, (It's that kid Uzi Ed) 

He took me for my paper so just call him Uzi Dead! 

Used to run epps wit him back in the day 

Mitch popped the trunk 

Passed the German AK 

You dirty rat! I'm bout to bless that ass 

Better take cover from the rat-tat-tat-tat 

Uzi Ed, ain't have a vest, three to the chest, Ed got blessed 

L got life, Ed got death 

Honey took the money and she slid to the left 

Back in the day I told L she was shady 

Now she in Cali about to have Ed's baby

Now this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh 

Just another case about the wrong path 

(Slick Rick) 

Yo, what's the word, kid?! 

Tell you bout a brother named Sid 

Got work release after doing a 3-to-life bid 

cause of drug logic 

Shouldn't touch it 

Now out to budget 

With a movie star chick from outta Edenwald Projects 

Nice job, took prison camp drives 

While he promised up and down to live a civilized lifestyle 

The seat off the brow was soon on garment 

Both worked 

Got themselves a two-bedroom apartment 

Great statement, without delayment, away and went 

Saved to get a house on one of them low down payments 

But an idea concocted his stock 

Why don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip 

So he gave his man a shriek and excitement 

Didn't know his peeps were under secret indictment 

Sick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck 

Sent him back up north to do a super long stretch again 

Black folk, you know the half, don't laugh, it's... 

Just another case about the wrong path

Shine meaning she's gone

""Hum-do-a-lah"", that means ""What up, Shah?""
It's the Mighty Ha drinkin' Mo' at the bar
Bakee after bakee, blunt after blunt
Smoke a bag of buhdah and became bitche's with the skunk
Nat ""King"" Cole was a merry old soul
Made you move that ab, drop shit from your whole
Grab a budjock and lick shot from the glock
You were told to swing off a tree from a jump
Run up in attics and Elvis, now I'm gone
Back on the streets in the heart of P Long
Man oh man lick shots if I have to
Submit to me as your lord and master
It's the Mighty Ha, I'm a street Bronx, I
Deliver the real like Walter Chronkite
God I'm a destiny, black man
Devil's in the rain receive the backhand

Yesterday, my trouble seems so far away
So help me Wanda, help, help, me Wanda

Be a none beast known and the why-O-G
Make your moon walk, spin walk grab your ti-ty
Hit you in the head with the broom to the back
Sport a pair of Balley's and a Mighty Ha hat
Comin from the Bronx like KRS-One
Electrify the crowd like they shooting stone guns

Known for tricken lyrics and smackin mad hands
Ahh, don't give a uh
Caught for the cause 17 to the shot
It's the Mighty Ha with the mic and the glock

Type of situation pops from uptown
You can lick balls cause I front to be down
Til I lie rep a dollar kickin the Willies to the Hiedy

Ponies never ran before
Rain never fell
Til I met you
And I can't get enough of your love, babe

What!?
Chim, chim, chiminie chim, chim, che-ree
Comin from the top, ah, it's the Migh-ty
Hit you with the felony and a misdemeanor
Hit a hundred push-ups and I got the spray Alenor
Got mad buttocks, ass cheeks, yo stop
Got more charges than a Nicachew pac
I'm the maker, owner, cream of the crop
Felicha you erection to the top
I can't seem to get rid of these fuckin chickenheads
Word to the mother drop dead brest fed
You better duck down when I draw my 8 luger
Scoop that ass quickie, better skin bag of booty

Warm my lap, a head with no hair
Beats freestylin, but all we can talk
Rhymin with force, till the jokes get corpsed
Tools on my waist, and a frown on my face
Just in case the enemy tries to bring a base
The kid to be a waste, after a taste
Of the hot lid, which is mercury laced
In the neighborhood, so far, so good
Somebody gotta be up to no good
Shots fired on Watson Avenue
Where they won't hesitate, shoot me, stabbin you (True)
That's aight, every night they be blowin
Keep their glock hot while we keep the cash flowin

Hey good looking? What you got cookin?, nuthin
But you got my baby in the oven
You bring the knowledge to my brain, sooth my pain
Make me the man that I am, keep me sane
I travel through my mind, through time and found you
Right at the very essence, there was your presence
Came out your womb, made you my wife
Then came around to complete the cipha, I gave you life
I heard you was the mother of the earth, (TRUE)
And I respect that for what it's worth, boo
This is how we do, you scratch my back I scratch yours
Wipe your blood and sweat when they drip out your pores

Often imitated and simulated but never duplicated

That's small, cool, and hurt make me go bezerk
And if you got it she's yours, and yours only
Never leavin a man ever lonely, she keeps it to the grave

Well lyrical gats, at the smalls of my back
In facts, I pack extras up in my nap sacks
Greenbacks, let me layin' back and relax
Gainin' riches, bitches just by kickin' the mere fact

Nigga I can make ya speaker shake
Make ya break, now ya upstate gettin' raped
While I'm home makin' hits
That smokin' so much weed that I start hearin' shit

Jack call Yopes, so I stay to bring the metal
To my job on 34th, I got some beef with these devils
Automatic weapons, fuck askin' niggas questions
Leave them torn, as the justice cypher born then we steppin'

All rise, parental discretion is advised
And be wise, 'cause one who fronts is one who dies
Smoke buddah by the mic, just like a barracuda
Flush the Cru to the ground like Roto Rooter

A fight, a fight, a nigga and a white
If a nigga don't win, we all jump in
Wanna be me, but you can't see me
'cause I don't rap like Michael Jackson those little wee-wees

Uck it, bottom line, top of the page
Loves to fuck a big body bitch like Rage
Runnin' through uptown like I don't got no sense
And Frederick K. Price couldn't find no evidence

Yo I make the grade, now I'm crazy paid
Niggas watch me close like muslims in the
World Trade Center, represent the click in the city
Blowin' up the spot, like silicone titties

Try to defeat beat, nigga ya dead wrong
Too head strong and got a 38 leg long
So fuck around, lay around on the wet ground
By the tray pound and these sick niggas from uptown

Let me clear my throat now

So chill, and bring ya corny act to the flow
And shake ya money maker for the big Y.O.
With the Mighty Ha and the one Chadeeo
It's time to set it open, bum rush ya radio

[Chadeeo]
Aiyo get a little closer, the A plus material
Lords imperial carryin gills with no serials
For protection when I'm in foreign sections
Wrong directions can have me locked in corrections
With constant erections and affections
Visions of different females in my reflections
Roll in silence, how the real one's move
Commando, that's Marlon Brando's move

Yo it's the Y.O.G.I. uptown's big digga
Hit ya with the rhythm that make that back quiver
Comin with that hit upnorth doin one
Playas want me to feel, but yo it's just begon
Yo Berra, uptown serra
Get a little closer, just to hear a little clearer
Cla clack, now back ya stuff up, that's what I told ya
Run the ghetto unions, the official car holda

It goes one for the uhhs, two for the ahhs
Three for those up in luxurious cars

Spittin butter with the force gun spit bullets
One third of the see are you what ya want?
On the head hunt, the first of every month
Placin emphasys on the butter flow
Rippin microphones, yo you know how we go

Chorus: Anthony Hamilton
Pay attention, are you listenin
Cru is in the house
And live in New York City all the way down south
Sippin Baci, countin money
Honeys everywhere
So meet me on the dance floor
The pictures just been recleared
So everybody on the floor
And don't disturb this Cru
It's the way to show that I'm so into Cru
And the feelin so don't disturb this Cru

We goin uptown, we goin uptown

Aiyo I'm mannin my position, I declare war
And when the battle's done, tally up the score
So bear ya arms, grab ya Lucky Charms
Or get direct hits from Napalm Bombs

We was makin moves, now we doin fine
My peoples on the Isle want to press rewind
Check us in the day room if ya doin time

Everybody's battlin to see who's the nicest
Really doesn't matter, 'cause sounds we splatter

Zunga zung, zunga zunga zeng (ZUNGA ZUNG, ZUNGA ZUNGA ZENG)
And my favorite jams Method Man by Wu-Tang
Comin funkadelik cuz I grooves thats my nation
When I grabs the mic I gets the sennn-sation
Flip the script like a angry actor shake or poke ya
I'll wet ya with my supa-soaka
Cuz when I display my strong flow
I gotcha in the sleeper like Chief Jay Strongbow

HEYYA, HEYYA, HEYYA HO

Pass the peice of steel to the one Chadio
And let me crush it
With a new style few pile peices and bits
Into hits
Like this here shit
So calm down clown
When I come around
I'm not happy slappy, walkin town with a frown
Get down, get down with the rhythm in your ear
And peep out the sound from here
To Zaire
If this don't work, things get steep and deep
I'm runnin in the streets
And I'm playin for keeps
For now I crack heads, but don't mistake me for a white rock
Keep my jail ceasar, instead of a nasty tight lock
Dread get me fed
End up dead
Cuz I'm phsyco
Choppin you down is the route that I might go
And that goes
For all my enemies and my foes
Pronto, pronto

Buff my nut while I beep on my Khalid Muhammad tapes

Cuz when I knock da boots, the horror, the horror

I'm behind the wheel, so Cha's the designated roller
Cha pass to chad pass to the Y-O-G

To make you dance ya ass off like Fred ""Rerun"" Berry
Very much a love bug like Herbie
I got crazy game, kerbie, kerbie

You got crazy game and I got crazy gats
And we slam like a batterin ram (so brotha step back)
It's the one and only, only one
That leaves niggas strung
By the flip of a lip, by the flung
Of a tongue
Couldn't care less if the world blew up
But I wanna blow up before it blows
Thru flows
Of persistance
Which make a difference
In my everyday existence
Causin me to go the long distance
But back to a simple style and type format
As I stomp on comp just like a doormat
This type stuff's under lock and key (key)
Chad is a ruff as ruff can be (be)
Now how ruff can that be, well let's go figa
Ruffa than son of sam with a slam trigga
Ruffa than a criminal takin a liquor swigga
Ruffa than the voice on that kid Lord Digga

To make you stifle.
Got a rifle with a scope,
You can't cope when the Conflict's on the creep.
You came to closed to the style partner
Can't fuck with the rodeo.
Here we go, wild westside,
Gitty up, move em out,
Head for the hills
I'ma let it ride.
The trick didn't know about the gangbang boogie
'til it fell on the floor wit a ass full of lead.
No need for calling out your momma name now
Son-of-a-bitch you dead.
On your mark,
Get ready,
Set trip,
I'm comin' wit a nine millimeter motherfucker
Block bam,
My shit never jam.
Like a hoe you fold
When I stuck you snipin
Off a building
Gangbangin' is an everyday thing.
Runnin' down on a hoe down,
Gotta low down,
It's a showdown,
Nigga bout to go down,
Slow down!

[Chorus]

I'm just a bogus nigga
Fuck that nigga next to me.
You get that ass dropped quick
Never had no love
Now you want to challenge me.
Fuck yo chief
We got some beef.
When I die, it's gonna be a gang fight
I'ma be the nigga that take your life
Pop your ass 
Say nighty-night.
Born to do some damage
I'll be damned if I let a motherfucker 
Even think he rough.
Blaze that bitch 
And bust him up.
Pussy motherfucker I'ma take your stuff.
Shit is out of pocket man,
But all this shit is finna change,
Cause when I come this time
I'ma show you a nine ain't no joke,
I'ma kill you some more,
And show them fools wild style ain't no hoe.
And if I die we all gotta go
Bad thing about it,
I don't give a fuck,
Wondering what I'm livin' for
Face to face with a nigga that I hate.
I'ma meet you on the hell ground,
Look you up in your eyes and spray,
Smoke you in the showdown.

[Chorus]

A motherfucker told me it was gonna be a showdown.
When I came around I was up for breakin' motherfuckers down.
Fuck it niggas wit it
Let's rock the town,
Flee on the scene,
Now what's up baby.
Car full of niggas straight lookin' shady
Came to loot
Better have what you gone shoot,
'Cause we straight actin' crazy.
C-O-N Flict nigga
That's what it is when you tote them triggers
Gangbangalistic father figure.
Daddy to the niggas that think they sucker,
Yeah.
It's a showdown,
Not just my hood, but town from town
Making motherfuckers recognize the flavor
Coming from Chi-Town.
Yee-Haw!
Be quick to draw 
Pick a nigga meat up out with a chainsaw.
Make a nigga see what he never saw.
Crucial Conflict comin' at you raw
For a showdown,
We don't play around.
Motherfuckers gone die
We gone kill 'em up pal.
Motherfuckers playing these damn games,
Kill 'em up in the showdown.

Cold Hard, WildStyle, Kilo & Neverless
You all are being charged with
Kidnapping, aggravated assault,
Armed robbery, money laundering,
Dope slanging and gang banging
And all that other type a shit
That I can't believe
Tell me, do you think you're guilty

Verse 1: WildStyle

Look here your honor
My life was full of broken dreams
I had to hustle on the corner
Selling crack to the fiends
Dope slanger, gang banger,
Shit, had to be it
Give the hoes a break up quick.
A PIMP I was born to be
The hoes was bringing me liquor
And the fiends was calling me God
My connection was the government
They gave me the job
I was slanging on the block
Two for ten, after dark
Pump blasted two springs dead
All you heard was BLOWS BARRED
We was slanging them automatics
Fuck them niggas that tried to jack
Rags to riches told the bitches
Motherfucker I'm a maniac
My case is a nowhere
Cause my lawyer's got a grudge
Fuck it, I'm guilty
Suck my dick judge

Verse 2: Cold Hard

Hey I'm sorry to become
What a motherfucker became
It was the way that I was raised
In this motherfucking game
Try to tame myself
But it wasn't no help
Hell yeah a nigga snapped
Had to keep my fucking rep
Making gosh darn niggas step
Always trying ta test me
Cause I'm a big old shorty
When I upped her thing
It weren't no game
Playing wid this shit's got me horny
When I was just a little boy
Played wid hoes instead of toys
Fuck what a motherfucker say
I'm going to drink my banging choice
Cause I wasn't one a them ones bitch
I grew up a lunatic
Had to have my snap so I jack
So I roll wid a big ol' ass clik
Know how WildStyle, Kilo, Never
Beat the system did it clever
All this shit that we endured
Tryin' to tell it to the judge

Hook 2x:

Coming up in this game
Was a bogus generation
Living life just to bang
Just to slang's my occupation
Tryin' to make it some way
And it don't matter cause my attitude
And visions the same
So you can tell it to the judge dude

Verse 3: Never

Now as a young buck in the hood
It was hard to get by hard to make it
Had to make a way anyway I could
So I had to take it
And it drove me to a point
That I had my mind on bustin'
Caught up in the lifestyle of a thug
Guess it was up in the blood
Niggas try to play me bogus shit
Nigga roll you know I'm slick
Rolling wid a bogus clik
So nigga just kill that shit
Ran up in the nigga's crib
Didn't think that he was gonna live
Pull the trig, heard him scream
But he didn't die cause he was a fiend
Strung on dope
And the nigga ran his mouth
And now I'm locked up
Looking up out the window
Ain't no window
And it's fucked up
Could it be that I had a grudge
Couldn't show him no fucking love
Caught a case, face to face
Had to tell it to the judge

Verse 4: Kilo

Yeah you caught me now
But I already went to hell and back
For my life as a gang banger
Standing out in the cold
And I can't slanga
Never thought I'd live this long
Went to sit in a room by myself
Having thoughts of all the things
That I've lost in the world
Thinking I'm getting close to death
But now I'm having flashbacks
And I can't get no freedom
Never had no pot to piss in
Nobody to help me out, so a nigga sin
Robbing bitches broke and dumb
Couldn't read and write to one
Gats you never trust
Snatching chains from the back of the bus
And it ain't no thing for me to pop a bitch
I broke my shit to the left and killed
Arms, legs, legs, arms, head
Forgive me for my damn sin
Now I'm facing double life
But life ain't long enough punk
Cause that's to the bodies in my trunk
Now I got to face the judge

Hook 2x

While I reach my verdict
You're all being sentenced
To life in prison
With no obligation of parole

Specially when I come to shoot

Should've broke it to the left man

Could it be that a nigga want to play game,
And the game done already been played,
Trying to get with this gangbangalistic shit

Had to think about murder but you couldn't go deep,
So get ready for tha street sweeper, going to be a cold creeper
When you told the playa pimp ill beat ya

'cause I kept my shit tight,niggas talkin bout we used to fight
Nigga used to get they ass (???), and its still the same up in the CHI

On the murder case, bring they bullet proofs wit mace,
And you we was all good, comin up, getting paid
Smokin on a fat sack, gat to the left

I want an answer won't take no
I'm asking stay here rock n' roll

Crumb,"Sometimes I stop myself from thinking and start to think away
Too much thinking we're finally drinking and leave the week away
Shut up, this is what you wanted
Go on, find out for yourself

Would it kill you to call
There's no consequence at all
Sometimes the bottles wake and opposites are same today
Now that who when where how and why you've gone away today

You're mine, this what you wanted

Crumb,"So we start talking, soon we're walking back to her place
She carries pepper spray on her keychain
She says, ""There's never a cop around when you need one.""
We climb the stairs to her apartment
She offers me a beer
She says, ""It's cold in here.""

She's never wrong but she was mistaken
Some words are better left unsaid
And it's time now that this was over 
Before we start to speak
She says, ""It's cold here in the heat.""

So we thumb through her record collection here at her place
Turn up the thermostat by the furnace
She says, ""My roommate is asleep.
Sit down next to me.""

We're in the dark in her apartment
She says that she don't care
You know it's cold out there

I never meant you harm
I took a smile, some random words
And turned them into charm
‘Cause I want your head to turn, your heart to break
Whenever I’m around
I took your heart, I turned it on
Then threw it on the ground

Should have told you what this all will lead too
How I’ll lead you on and then I’ll leave you
But I want you head to turn your heart to cave in
So I’m letting you stay until morning
And I will do you, too

With all my heart I swear to you
I never meant to lie
I almost had myself believe
I’d love you ‘til I die

Crüxshadows,"It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me

I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me

And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea

The angels, not half so happy in heaven
Went envying her and me
Yes, that was the reason
(As all men know in this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee

But our love, it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride
In the sepulcher there by the sea
In her tomb by the sounding sea

",Annabel Lee [Spoken]

Hear the silence between each word
Black and white divided grays that cut between us

Offered this for passion's crime

I see the tempest at the gates
I see storms on the horizon
And a citadel alone
Clinging brave defying fate

With Troy besieged by tyrants' greed - (tyranny)
In Hector's memory, God willing
We shall save this victory

It's written on the chart there at the foot end of the of the bed
  
They think I'm blind that I can't read it
I've read it every word and every word it says is death
So confession Is that the reason that you came
  

Get it off my chest before I check out of the game
Since you mention it well there's thirteen things I'll name
Thirteen crosses high above the cold Missouri waters
August 49 North Montana

The hottest day on record the forest tinder dry
  
Lightning strikes in the mountains
I was crew chief at the jump base
I prepared the boys to fly
         
Pick the drop zone C47 comes in low
Feel the tap upon your leg that tells you go
See the circle of the fire down below

Fifteen of us dropped above the cold Missouri waters

Gauged the fire I'd seen bigger

So I ordered them to side hill we'd fight it from below

We'd have our backs to the river
       
We'd have it licked by morning even if we took it slow
   
But the fire crowned jumped the valley just ahead
       
There was no way down headed for the ridge instead
   
Too big to fight it we'd have to fight that slope instead

Flames one step behind above the cold Missouri waters
Sky had turned red smoke was boiling

Two hundred yards to saftey
         
Death was fifty yards behind
    
I don't know why I just thought it

I struck a match to waist high grass running out of time
        
Tried to tell them step into this fire I've set
       
We can't make it this is the only chance you'll get
   
But they cursed me
    
Ran for the rocks above instead

I lay face down and prayed above the cold Missouri waters

Then when I rose like the phoenix

In that world reduced to ashes
     
There was none but two survived

I stayed that night and one day after

Carried bodies to the river

Wondering how I stayed alive   
Thirteen stations of the cross to mark their fall
                         
I've had my say I'll confess to nothing more

I'll join them now those that they left me long before

Cry Cry Cry,"There's a problem feathers iron
Bargain buildings weights and pullies
Feathers hit the ground before the weight can leave the air
Buy the sky and sell the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky
Don't fall on me 
Fall on me

There's the progress we have found 
A way to talk around the problem
Building towered foresight
Isn't anything at all

But then it wouldn't be sky anymore

Cry Cry Cry,"I'm the kid who ran away with the circus
Now I'm watering elephants
But sometimes I lie awake in the sawdust
Dreaming I'm in a suit of light
Late at night in the empty big top I'm 
All alone on the high wire
Look, he's working without a net this time
He's a real death-daffier
 
I'm the kid who always looked out the window
Failing tests in geography
But I've seen things far beyond just the schoolyard
Distant shores of exotic lands
They're the spires of the Turkish empire
It's six months since we made landfall
Riding love with the spice of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all
 
I'm the kid who thought we'd someday be lovers
Always held out that time would tell
Time was talking, I guess I just wasn't listening
No surprise if you know me well
And as we're walking toward the train station
There's a whispering rainfall
'Cross the boulevard you slip your hand in mine
In the distance the train calls
 
I'm the kid who has this habit of dreaming
Sometimes gets me in trouble too
But the truth is I could no more stop dreaming
Than I could make them all come true

Cry Cry Cry,"We made Oklahoma a little after three
Randy, his brother Bob, and my old GFC
We had some moonshine whiskey and some of Bob's homegrown
We were so messed up we didn't know if we were drunk or stoned

Randy was a sad sack - tall, kinda frail
Bob was a raving maniac, crazier than hell
We been kicked out of high school several years ago
For kicking over port-o-cans at the 4-H rodeo

Since they done the little dance right outside the law
Popped twice in Oklahoma and once in Arkansas
And I don't know what possessed me to want to tag along
'Cause I was raised a Christian, and I knew right from wrong

[Chorus]
Right or wrong, black or white
Cross the line, you're gonna pay
Into the dawn before the light
Live or die by shades of gray

We stole two Charolais heifers 
From Randy's sweetheart's pa
And sold them at the livestock sale outside of Wichita
We got nine hundred dollars and never did suspect
The world of hurt we'd be in once we cashed that check

Next day we heard the story on the local radio
And made our plans that very night to go to Mexico
And I swear we would've made it if it wasn't for the shine
I got sick about the time we crossed that Kansas line

[Chorus]

I was lying in the bar ditch, praying I would die
When a light came on above us
And a voice called from the sky
A half dozen unmarked cars came screeching to a halt

They grabbed Bob, he started screaming that it was my fault
There were men and dogs and helicopters flying all around
They had the brothers on the pickup hood
And me on the ground

Then Bob flew all to pieces, but Randy - he held tight
When a black man in a suit and tie stepped into the light

He told his men to turn us loose
And they put down their guns
He said these are just some sorry kids
They ain't the ones

[Chorus]

They left us by the roadside downhearted and alone
Randy got behind the wheel, said, ""Boys, I'm going home.""
So we turned 'round and faced our fate, hung over but alive
On that morning Oklahoma, late April ninety-five",Shades of Gray

Since I've seen the way the candles light your face

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
