Barry White,"The sun goes down
And the moon comes up
My heart is pumping for you
And a mad thing starts
Ooooohhh-oooooohhh

Never in you wildest dreams
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams

The night is hot outside your window
I hear people walking people talking
I smell your skin I feel you breathing
Don't let me go not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet

Never in your wildest dreams
Could you ever get this easy
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Did it ever get this easy
Never in your wildest dreams

And the world is slowly turning
As it turns I see your face
Touch your eyes, your lips. . .space

We've arrived at the place 
Where they open hearts
And fill them up with love
Filled with love filled with love
This on is pumping for you
As a mad thing starts

Never in your wildest dreams 
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams

Barry White,"Don't do that 
Baby, please don't do that 
What are you cryin' for 
Is it because you're sad or mad or 
Nothing's gonna go wrong 
Sometimes we feel inside of us that 
That everything we have is only here for today 
But every now and then two people get lucky 
And find that certain thing that make them want to 
Just keep it, just keep it that way 
I don't want you to feel that 
That you have to go through these changes when 
Knowin' no way 
I know that our love is different 
Our lives will be different 
Trust me, baby, trust me 

Now that I'm here no more tears 
Come here, come here 
And you won't find things that broke your heart 
And blew your mind 
Not here, no, not here 

And my, oh, my 
Girl, can't you see, can't you see that I 
I've got so much to give to you, my dear 
It's gonna take a lifetime, it's gonna take years 

To you my dear I've got so much to give 
It's gonna take my lifetime 
It's gonna take years and years and years and years 

And I'll fill you in your hopes and dreams 
Believe me, girl, you got everything 
Right here, right here 
No one could offer you more 
Than the love I have for you in store 
It's here, oh, oh, yeah

Honey, can't you see, can't you see that I 
I got so much to give to you my dear

It's gonna take my lifetime 
It's gonna take years and years and years and years

We found that certain thing 
That certain feeling 
That lets two people express themselves how they feel 
Let your love flow inside of you 
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, baby",I've Got So Much to Give [Instrumental]
Barry White,"Hey, you know I don't, I don't really give a damn
If it would have took forever, I would have waited, baby
And waited and waited and waited and waited and waited

I, oh yeah, um, baby love

I knew that everything will be alright
It had to work out sweet, my love at night
Ah, the two of us in love together
Henceforth, now and forever

We've only just begun to feel the fire grow
Our light of love will burn and let the people know
That we intend to make it, when trouble comes, we'll shake it
My love for you can no one take it, oh, lord, I just got to say it

Girl, well, we finally made it, my, oh, my

Nothing in this world could stop us now
We're going to make it, yeah, someway, somehow

Let's keep our love happy and free
Free from all the hurt and pain, oh, I gotta say it again

Barry White,"I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
Oh no, but I don't know about that
There's many times that we've loved

We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
There's just not enough of it
There's just not enough oh, oh, babe

My darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love babe
Oh, some things I can't get used to no matter how I try

Just like the more you give
The more I want
And baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe

Tell me, what can I say? What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know is every time you're here
I feel the change, somethin' moves
I scream your name
Do whatcha got to do [unverified]

Darling, I can't get enough of your love babe

Girl, if I could only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well, babe

How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much girl, you're so unreal
Still I keep loving you more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do because you blow my mind

I get the same old feelin' every time you're here
I feel the change somethin' moves
I scream your name
Do whatcha got to do [unverified]

Barry White,"Take it off, baby, take it all off
I wanna see you the way you came into the world
I don't wanna feel no clothes, I don't wanna see no panties
And take off that brassiere, my dear, everybody's gone
I'm taking the receiver off the phone because baby you and me
This night we're gonna get it on to love serenade

You know I get in these moods, well you know how it is
And I'm very glad to know that you feel the same way too
Baby we're gonna lay here and gonna make love
And we're gonna do it like it's supposed to be done
Heaven only knows what goes on behind closed doors
The very depths of our souls will reach out tonight
You and me, baby in love serenade, oh baby, oh baby

Make me want you, tempt me, tempt me, tempt me
Make me need you, let me long for you
You'll know what it's like when a man and woman becomes one
And the only real way you can do that baby
Is when we're makin' love to each other
When you reach that, that simple feeling
When you're makin' love it's, it's like you're in another world

Barry White,"September, when I first met you remember? 
Oh what a day it was 
Everything was so clear 
Oh there's something about that day
I could feel it in the air 
Suddenly I knew, why I felt that way 
The moment I laid eyes on you
Girl I just had to say 
please let me be the one you give your love to 
If we live with this
through all of this that's how we make everyday anew
September, when I first met you Remember? 
Ooh what a night it was, 
how I had it planned 
The things I would say and do; The way I'd hold your hand
But when you rushed into my arms there was nothing left to say
I'll never forget that night, 
I'll never forget that day

Barry White,"Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by (passed them by)
Now you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try (let me try)
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even have a song to sing
All I know is

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you
Oh, baby please now
Oh baby

That I needed in this world
You are the one for me (one for me)
Let me hold you in my arms
Girl, and thrill you with my charms
I'm sure you will see (you will see)
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Listen to me

Bend over against ya gurl
Got ya leg strapped around my neck,like a guitar hurtin' ya girl
Bumpin' in my car at the pod
You can get this music anywhere,
Even at Wal-Mart
In the parkin' lot, even the shoppin' cart
I do nasty things when we in the dark
We steadily bumpin', hittin' you with this percussion
Bout to make you have a concussion
Makin' music is really really something

Sweet music girl you tellin' me that you want some more
I make you seem like a choir higher and higher
I put my lips on any instrument that you desire
I wanna hold ya,
Just squeeze ya,
Don't wanna tease ya,
Just wanna please ya
We got the neighbors sayin' keep the music down
But we goin all night,
So enjoy the sound

Slick 'em hound,
Let me pump ya pump ya up louder louder like the stereo
I turn you on all night
Like my rode radio
I can be your violin I just want to stroke ya stroke ya
You tell me im your trumpet just lay back and let me row ya row ya
I wanna put you in my my arms, beat that thing how I play my drums
Ra-ta-tat-tat to the ta-tat-tat
Rum-a-bum-bum-bum
Body shakin in the bed like a tambourine
Phone in my ear 'til you fall asleep
The way we bumpin' and grindin' all night to the beat,
You remind me of my g

Barry White,"She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything

She's 'I want a piece of chocolate'
'Take me to a movie'
She's 'I can't find a thing to wear'
Now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing

She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me

She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word 'cause it's Monday

She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby, come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
Of my unborn children's mother

She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me

She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me

Every day that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah she's everything to me

Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me

All things in time

And all once you're there next to you
And you're burning with desire

Look her right into her eyes and tell her

Make your move, be careful what you chose
You gonna reap what you sow
Make no mistake, you've got what it takes
And all it's gonna take is you

Patience is key, it always sets you free
And you can make it if you try
Don't waste time makin' up your mind
It's your choice, it's your life
Listen to me, people

[Chorus]

They say that the mind
Is a terrible, terrible thing to waste
And so it's time, and it's time
That you made up your mind
About what you wanna do in life

Different strokes for different folks
We're all in this together
And what you have to realize is that
You can't always win and you can't always lose
Just sometimes, sometimes you do

Listen to me, people

[Chorus]

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose",Sometimes

Bart Millard,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, 
The emblem of suffering and shame; 
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, 
Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, 
Has a wondrous attraction for me; 
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above

To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, 
Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
And exchange it some day for a crown.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, 
Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
And exchange it some day for a crown.",The Old Rugged Cross
Bart Millard,"Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
Ye soldiers of the cross; 
Lift high his royal banner, 
It must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory
His army shall he lead, 
Till every foe is vanquished, 
And Christ is Lord indeed.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
Stand in his strength alone; 
The arm of flesh will fail you, 
Ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the gospel armor, 

Each piece put on with prayer; 
Where duty calls or danger, 
Be never wanting there.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
The strife will not be long; 
This day the noise of battle, 
The next the victor's song.
To those who vanquish evil
A crown of life shall be; 
They with the King of Glory
Shall reign eternally.","Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus"

Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though

When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry

Might never have another, so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber
See my nigga Ron, like L. Ron Hubbard, he be outta space
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say ""Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape?"", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?
I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me feelin' like procreating

Now comes the question of which intro do you use?
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that let's people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that

You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin'
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin' online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, uhm world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
'Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin', he made it rappin'
Now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin' ""It's lit, feel the buzz?""

We gone show 'em that Dreamville this year
We gone show 'em that when the people come together ain't no holding back

I been holding back tears for these young black souls lost in the past year
Some by the law, they ain't even flash steel
Some by they own dogs, most by their own fears

Let it go, let it all go

'cause you left me laying there
With a broken heart
Staring through a deep cold void
Alone in the dark
And I miss the warmth in the morning
And the laughter when I can't stop yawning
But the tears on the pillow have dried my dear
Gonna let it all go 'cause I have no fear

Just take it slowly boy, there's no need to rush it

Come on boy, don't play it tough

But he finished my plate and had four margaritas

To kiss my arms, my legs, my hips, my lips

Running around like a mouse in a cage for a thousand years

Collect them all for me

Well and nothing's ever happened no oh
What's a girl gotta do to have some fun with you
Shut your mouth put your lips on me

I feel guilty waiting for you to notice me
Should I write it on my forehead do you need it on TV
Can't you see I'm a freak for you as sweet as tea and lime
And it so clear to me you are empty as can be

Drinking wine to take away your pain
Collect all the tears you cry

Basia,"How well I know this feeling
Seems that you will never learn
It can't go on forever 

But very soon the tide will turn

When it won't go away
And no one else can cover you

Run for cover,got to run for cover
When danger is around
Run for cover,got to run for cover
I'll never let you down down down

You're gonna get your fingers burned

I'll always be around
Run for cover,got to run for cover

Everyday I'm getting stronger
On a wave of hope that's going round
There's another world inside my heart
It's not impossible to turn it inside out

When it won't go away
And no one else can cover you
I'll shelter you from thunder

Basia,"Sitting there and feeling lonely
Had my blue eyes for you only
Suddenly you turned around and smiled at me

It wasn't my imagination
Had no doubts no hesitation
When it comes to love I know where I want to be

Is it real am I dreaming
I've been waiting light years for someone like you
Can't believe you are here with me
I've got you and I can't hide it anymore
I want the world to know that

Baby you're mine
You are blowing my mind

There's more to be discovered
And Baby my good heart
Might improve your inner life

Listen I'm your friend
I don't try to be your mother
Strange as it may seem
I believe wrong can turn to right

Against the rule
I'm always here for you
On each other's side
There's so much that we can do

Because no matter where we are going there together
There's no doubt we will get there in the end

And if we have to stop
Gonna wait through stormy weather
If not lovers we still remain best friends",Best Friends
Basia,"Looking out of the window
Can't believe what I see
Where was all this beauty when I loved you
From now on this is my world
Yes we lost but I don't hurt any more
I knew there must be more to life than this

Now is the time for me
I'm grateful, you set me free
Baby one good turn deserves another
Now is the time for you
Pray our dreams come true
Could not see the world around me
You were my world
But now I keep inside my heart a Brave New Hope

There is no need to worry
I'll find my place in the sun
Better days are here to stay forever
Times are changing so am I
Not alone 'cause there's a heart needing love
I know that God will give me one more chance

Everything seems new
Have to get to know my friends again
I never realized that it could be like this
Time is a love continuum
And I've got so much love to give
I'm not afraid to start this journey again tomorrow",Brave New Hope
Basia,"This is a song about the place I come from
It's not on the moon at all
Where people's hearts are filled with passion
I miss it so, 'cause I'm here chasing love
In my land of great romantics
I'm the biggest dreamer of them all

No way to stop their desire to change
And to improve our world
One invented Esperanto
Ready to move and to try something new
I'm convinced that Chopin too
Would dig samba if he had a chance to groove

Though it's true
That I only know very few simple words of your language
I've cracked it I've decided
Because the only words we need to communicate
Are the ones that can help me say
""I do love you""
And that make me understand you love me too

Our love will take this globe by storm
If it's London, Warsaw or New York
Cause all around the world
People want to love and be loved

Open your eyes
There's so much we don't know
We don't even realize
So you might get a better picture
And if I say, that on this planet today
We all have the same hearts,
I don't claim I'm Curie or Copernicus",Copernicus
Basia,"Father I didn't really know you
Mother you are so very far away from me
Hopeless birthdays made me cry
My heart kept saying: It's all right
Obviously that's the way it was meant to be

Now I know
There was a reason for it all
And I am not lonely anymore
I got my reward
That's why I am loved

I have you
A lover and a friend
You are everything I need
You are the sun the air I breathe
Without you, life wouldn't be the same
Please never go away
And if you go then don't forget to take me with you

The love that I gave was used against me
Honesty seemed a foreign and old-fashioned word
Maybe I just don't understand
Cause I'm a stranger in this land
Even friends failed to make me feel at home

Now I know
There was a reason for it all

He wanted every luxury that money could bring
He fancied himself as a King of the castle
Impressing all the ladies with the size of his car
But none of them would have it
They left the morning after
As a giver of love he was a walking disaster

Who will ever know of this charade
Unless you tell us who you really are
How far will you go
Down a road that's paved with gold but takes away your soul

Come to masquerade
Keep your heart out of sight
You can be a winner
A master of disguise

Then one night he met a beautiful girl
She was a viable concern, he couldn't help thinking
But he ran out of small talk and started to panic
The comedy was turning into something tragic
Never mix business with pleasure
You can play them independently but never together

It's the rest of a stump, it's a little alone

It's a sliver of glass, it is life, it's the sun
It is night, it is death, it's a trap, it's a gun

The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush
The knot in the wood, the song of a thrush

The wood of the wind, a cliff, a fall
A scratch, a lump, it is nothing at all

It's the wind blowing free, it's the end of the slope
It's a beam, it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a hope

And the river bank talks of the waters of March
It's the end of the strain, It's the joy in your heart

The foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone
The beat of the road, a slingshot's stone

A truckload of bricks in the soft morning light
A shot of a gun in the dead of the night

A mile, a must, a thrust, a bump,
It's a girl, it's a rhyme, it's a cold, it's the mumps
.
The plan of the house, the body in bed
And the car that got stuck, it's the mud, it's the mud

A blink, a buzzard, a sudden stroke of night

A pin, a needle, a sting, a pain
A snail, a riddle, a wasp, a stain

A snake, a stick, it is John, it is Joe
A fish, a flash, a silvery glow

The bed of the well, the end of the line
The dismay on the face, it's a loss, it's a find

A spear, a spike, a point, a nail
A drip, drip, drip, drop, the end of the day

And the river bank talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life in your heart, in your heart (repeat)

,the end of the road,a little alone

A sliver of glass, a life, the sun
A knife, a death, the end of the run

It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart

And the river bank talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart

Basia,"I was dreaming when I jumped the lights
Busy scaling dizzy heights
Hummed a somewhat strangely familiar tune
My eyes as wide as open books
And from my ears upon two hooks
A big smile was hanging there like a crescent moon
 
It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the gods of love decide to knock
You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it you'll never know a better day
 
Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour stone cold sober
 
The officer who stopped me said: ""lucky you didn't wind up dead!""
And he guessed that I was over and above
I hoped he'd only caution me, and I made a plea for clemency
On the grounds that I was only drunk on love

Left while we were sleeping

We're praying come back love
Come back, all's forgiven
Come back love
We still burn more fire than flame
 
You're the stop that I came to
The good time station
With no regulation and no masquerade
All you have aroused in me is my suspicion
By your own admission your eyes have strayed
 
You have been good for me
I never said it
You deserve more credit
I still need you

Last night I lost my mind and came so close to losing you
So close to losing you
Misread your smile, misunderstood your tears,
Ignored the pleading voice and every sigh

It's a lesson I'll never forget

Tell me, who's to blame
 
What I really meant to tell you I panicked,

I'd die if something would
 
But I'm so spoilt by your patience and devotion
That only now I recognize some of my cruel ways
Some of my cruel ways
Maybe it's good, maybe it was meant to be
There was no other way you could get through
Now it's my turn to get through to you baby
 
It's a lesson I'll never forget
No communication gave rise to fear
Tell me, who's to blame
What I really meant to tell you, I need you
And I would die if something happened to you
I'd die if something would
What I really meant to tell you, I love you
And I would die if something happened to you

Basia,"One day, while in the south of France,
My good friend said I should hug an olive tree,
She claimed that dreams come true when you do, but
Can a plant be in any way that beneficial to me?
 
Though I'm a famous skeptic, feet on the ground,
This time I wanted this to be true
Now picture this
A silly polish girl in nice
Embracing trees
Wishing for you
 
Hug an olive tree
I take it things are looking good
Still--could be better,
There's always something to improve
And so you should

Still, could be better,

And you've got dreams,
Look for some magic gardens with olive trees

When your woes and sorrows leave you
Overwhelmed
For the state of endless sadness or
Uncompleted mourning
Take star of Bethlehem,
There's willow if bitter, when helpless
Wild rose,
Some sunshine wattle revives all lost hopes""
But for a simple case of longing
What are we to do when homeless in our
Hearts and souls
 
Some of us take daring chances following our
Lovers
The passion we can trust
Others just cannot sit still
They're driven by the power of mighty
Wanderlust
Wherever we go, god, we're trying so hard
To make every place feel like home left behind
But despite of all endeavours--nothing
Changed,
As ever--we're homeless in our hearts
 
But I'm yearning no more

And now it's where I belong

It often stares you in the face and yet, against
All reason,
Takes the longest time to find
You circle the globe, go native, go far
But it's not a country or a town, not a house
What's the use of distant travel if only to
Discover you're homeless in your heart

And now it's where I belong

Day by day and night by night 
Love?s a dream heaven sent
I am yours and you?re mine
What more can I pray for
But every minute, every hour
I play a waiting game
?Cause once again the spring is all around

I know so well your smiling face
That greets me every day
You stand by me I stand by you
All?s good and well, so
Day by day and night by night
I play a waiting game
?Cause my world will soon be turning upside down
In summer

CHORUS:
Blame it on the summer
I can?t help how summer makes me feel
Blame it on the summer
I don?t care if what I feel is real
Blame it on the summer
I can?t explain what summer makes me do
I want to break away and fly away
?Cause summer makes me run away from you

Years go by a playful time
Resign come what may
You keep on loving me
And I still keep on wishing
?Cause every hour here in silence
The game remains the same
And the summer makes my world turn upside down
Oh, summer

I want to break away and fly away
Summer makes me run away
Summer makes me run away
Summer makes me run away
Summer makes me run away from you

Is it love you're looking for

One special place that you came from

it's not good enough
The grass is greener over there

everybody's on the move

many different reasons
Make people leave it all behind
Some look for excitement
Others take risks to survive
Let's forget the cynics

No one but you knows what it feels right

if they send us back
We will get there anyway
To try for a better life

In spite of all the crazy tests that you had put me through

how else am I to show you that I forgive you
For countless indiscretions performed in style by you

how many times you hope that I would ignore it
When you commit another crime and kick my love to death

now I see that things will have to change, right now
Oh, things will have to change around here

how often do I have to say: not to worry
When you do something stupid, simply just because you're vain

how soon, you think, will come the time when you're sorry
And you'll be crying after someone who knew you well

I still believe although I'm losing my patience
Oh please don't shout 'cause if you mean it you can whisper too

No-one's that stupid and altruistic 
To love so deeply
And so completely
Oh no, you're crazy
You cannot help it
?cause without this torture life has no meaning
There is no reason to go on

waste away or die of disappointment
Those you love the most inflict the deepest cut
Waste away or die of disappointment
One you love the most will surely break your heart

again your love lies bleeding
But your heart's still breathing
And just one ""last time"" you're noble and forgiving
So your love lies bleeding

Though you can run

this could be a revolution
This could be love's resurrection

one door shuts, another opens

there is someone there for you who doesn't mind
One who knows - the past is better left behind 
Dreams enormous dreams 
And one who dares enough to live again

That every day I miss you so

Before it even had a chance to start

there's a tear in my eye
The other is dry
There'll never be a better time
Honey, this moment is your life

it all started with a dream
Then it seemed a hopeless scheme
Now I think what could have been
You took my panic for indifference
But how was I supposed to know
That one day I will miss you so
I would have fought for you to the end
I would have never let you slip away

now there's a tear in my eye
The other is dry
There'll never be a better time
Honey, this moment is your life

one day
Soon I pray
You'll look at me again
With new eyes
And maybe you will find someone to love
Something to die for

Farewell, our Motherland.

Basil Valdez,"Life is not all that bad, my friend, hmm 
If you believe in yourself 
If you believe there's Someone 
Who walks through life without you 
You'll never be alone 
Just learn to reach out, 
And open your heart 
Lift up hands to God, 
And He'll show you the way. 

And He said, ""Cast your burdens upon Me 
Those who are heavily laden, 
Come to Me, all of you who are tired 
Of carrying heavy loads, 
For the yoke I will give you is easy 
And My burden is light, 
Come to Me and I will give you rest."" 

When you feel the world 
Is tumblin' down on you, 
And you have no one 
That you can hold on to, 
Just face the rising sun 
And you'll see hope, 
And there's no need to run 
Lift up your hands to God, 
And He'll make you feel all right. 

And He said, ""Cast your burdens upon Me 
Those who are heavily laden, 
Come to Me, all of you who are tired 
Of carrying heavy loads, 
For the yoke I will give you is easy 
And My burden is light, 
Come to Me and I will give you rest.""",Lift up Your Hands
Basil Valdez,"My morning starts to shine with teardrops in my eyes
And here I am alone starting to realize,
That my days would be brighter if I could learn to hide
When feelings that I have for you keep hurting me inside

Then my day begins with simple thoughts of you
Hoping our tomorrows will be and you,
Sharing dreams with each other and making them come true
Holding one another saying, ""All I need is you.""

But will you say that you love me and show me that you care?
Say when I need you, you will always be there,
But if you go and leave me, this I swear is true
My love will always be with you

Now my nights would end with just one wish that's you
To hold me in the dark and help me make it through,
'Cause the pain that's inside me would simply melt away
If I had you here with me and promise me you'd stay

But will you say that you love me and show me that you care?
Say when I need you, you will always be there,
But if you go and leave me, this I swear is true
My love will always be with you

Cats sit on the window sill

Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free

Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of 
Sticking to the soul

Winter comes after fall

Anything at all

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)

Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)

Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Bass 305,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

Bass 305,"Faithless love like a river flows
Like raindrops fallin' on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes

Where the night grows in
Like a cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows

Faithless love, where did I go wrong?
Too many stories, too many heartbreak songs
Where nobody's right, nobody's wrong

Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you
Faithless love, where did I go wrong?

Well, I guess I'm standin' in a hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
And every new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feelin' comes and goes

Faithless love like a river flows

Jag tänker att på denna dag ska man ut på stranden och glida.
Jag öppnar min dörr, hör morgon trafiken
Som kör förbi på tylövägen.
Dom är på väg mot hav o bad o strand,
Blottade kroppar på tylösand.

Ska ni med på en fest en sån fest som varar hela natten lång,
Ska ni med till hav o sand,
Till den enda strand som heter strand tylösand
WoooOoo
Ska ni med.....SKA NI MEEEEED!
Vi ska till stranden och glida!

Kännslor som flödar, blickar som får mitt hjärta å banka,
Nu är sommarn här. Heta nätter med erotisk atmosfär,
Do o jag vi glider aldrig isär,
Vi kan somna I en dyna av sand o när vi
Vaknar så ser vi solen skina.
Vi ligger kvar en stund å kysser varann
Å sen jag viskar vi ska till stranden och glida.

Ska ni med på en fest en sån fest som varar hela natten lång,
Ska ni med till hav o sand,
Till den enda strand som heter strand tylösand
WoooOoo
Ska ni med.

Without anything that shines on the sky what would I rest on then?
Without the stars, say how would we manage then?
Without anything that brighten up our way
Whom would we rely on?

As we may not forget that all stars are life
(They are the) life as we (are), although they live in another world
The world of feelings, where all souls have their place
In heaven, in life's dream palaces,
Without the stars

Without the stars what would our hearts believe in?
Without that what helps us to see, how would then our love grow?
Without the stars could you love me then?
Would you then feel safe when I'm close to you?

What have I done? I should have known
If I hide something I'll be alone

But now I know how to be strong
I have to find a place where I belong
And take a plane, maybe to Spain
I will never be betrayed again

I'm falling down, I'm turned around
But everyone is coming back for more",Plane to Spain
Basshunter,"Why didn't we just try
To hold on one more time

You maybe think that I don't care
But the tears are falling down
I can hardly breathe in this rain of sorrow

Remember we walked the beach at night
Then we made love in the moon light
And you looked into my eyes

Why didn't we just try
To hold on one more time
Why, was it all a lie
Let's try it on one more time

Life goes on and time goes by
But every day I wonder why
Was it meant to be this way
Is this how you want it

I might not be the perfect guy
But baby, I'm worth one more try
Don't let me wait another day

Why didn't we just try
To hold on one more time
Why, was it all a lie
Let's try it on one more time",Why

You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side?

Your hair is dancing in the wind
Your eyes are burning up my skin
And I'm so happy when I see
That you are smiling back at me

You're leaving burn marks on the ground
Thank You, God, for what I've found
I don't know how, I don't know why
But you're my angel in the night

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now
Just like days before you start to cry

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side?

Prepare for lunch in three, two, one

I try my best to satisfy
But all you do is wave me goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I'm so crazy about you

Even if I don't know where to start
Even if my love is tearing me apart
I just know that you and me
We were always meant to be

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now
Just like days before you start to cry

You are my light in the dark

So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

On every block someones flippin like an acrobat

I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something

[Chorus: 2X]
Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game

Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame

Bastard Sons of Johnny Cash,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones",Long Black Veil

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there, just like a prayer",Blitzkrieg Bop/What a Party

Hearts on fire, wild romance
Wango tango so intense
So left for weeks without a trace
Then showed up with a smile on her face
A kind of magic in her eyes
Is she the devil in disguise
That night she was crying (she said)
I won't leave you anymore
Man I was dying
When she made her move on the floor
She wanted me to

Tell me that I still need more
To satisfy my soul
A sign of fatal attraction
A case of love and affection

Bastien Lallemant,"Le train qui file, qui file
Aussi vite que le temps
Me mènera-t-il à temps
Près de lui qui se meurt

Qui s’en va vers son trépas
A déjà fait le pas
Qui depuis si longtemps
Hésitait en mourant

Le souvenir demeure
De ce train qui se presse
Ramenant immobile
Mon reflet dans les champs

Qui plus figé que moi 
Que ce jour se levant
Qui plus triste que moi 
Le pays indifférent

Je revois qui s’allonge
Le soleil sur le quai
Qui s’allonge et qui grêle
Les ombres empressées

Je revois qui tombent en gouttes
Les larmes familières
Empêchant coûte que coûte

et moi je porte des babouches,
sur toi ça ne fait pas trop louche,
ça te donne une sacrée touche !
Ma mie qu’est vraiment très, très douce,
alors que je sors de ma douche,
Elle rigole, elle me pousse
à défiler en babouches.

Papa, toi tu mets des babouches,
elles te vont si bien tes babouches !
Sur toi, ça ne fait pas trop louche,
ça te donne une sacrée touche !

“Vas-y, mais fais-moi donc un pas.
Ah! vraiment ça ne te va pas, 
ces choses que tu portes là !”

“Non, non, non, ça ne te va pas,

Bastien Lallemant,"Ce matin-là
Le jour à peine était levé,
Nous avions pris
La route qui va vers je ne sais où...
J’ai oublié
Tout du chemin de la raison
Qui nous poussait, nous emmenait
Loin de chez nous

Qu’importe la destination,
Nous allions par le petit jour.
Je ne me rappelle plus l’occasion,
Vers quel lieu, quel faubourg

Pour quelle raison, quelle oraison ?
Allions-nous pêcher du poisson ? ou bien
Pour quelle cérémonie d’un jour ?
Étaient-ce des noces d’amour ? 

Le soleil me rappelle à toi
Dans sa clarté de petit jour,
Et moi encore accroché à
La lucarne de mes souvenirs...
Je crois reprendre encore une fois
Cette route qui ne menait
Nulle part ailleurs qu’avec toi
Nulle part ailleurs qu’avec toi

Ô ma mémoire qu’en as-tu fait !
J’ai oublié, j’ai oublié...
Pourquoi nous étions sur la route ?
Et partis pour quelle aventure ?

Étions-nous en deuil partant
Pour je ne sais quel enterrement ?
Ou bien partis en flânant
Chercher du suc et de l’encens ?

Et ma mère si tu avais pu
Voir dans le cœur de ces deux-là,
De ces deux hommes que tu aimais
Qui s’en allaient, qui s’en allaient
Qui s’en allaient cueillir au monde
Un presque rien d’éternité,
Qui renaissaient un jour au monde
En oubliant de t’emmener...

Ô ma mémoire qu’en as-tu fait !
Depuis tant et tant d’années de ça...
Mon cœur ne compte plus ces années,
Que ce qu’elles durent d’éternité...

Était-ce un jour sans pêche aucune,
Sans mariage, sans miel et sans lune ?
Était-ce un jour sans mort au ciel,
Sans firmament et sans missel ? (bis)

Ce matin-là,
Le jour à peine était levé,
Nous avions pris
La route qui va vers je ne sais où...
Ce qu’il m’en reste 
A de ce matin la clarté,
Un peu d’aurore et un soupçon d’éternité... 

Ô ma mémoire mon grand trou noir,
Mais cela n’a plus d’importance...
Ma nostalgie en habits noirs,
Me regarde en chien de faïence

Sans raison et en toute occasion, 
Dans les flots bleus de ma raison,
Ma mémoire en femme poisson,
Revient me chanter cette chanson.
Ma mémoire en femme poisson,
Revient me chanter cette chanson.

Celle d’une route un matin, à l’aurore...
Celle d’une route un matin, à l’aurore...",Ballade
Bastien Lallemant,"Qui fait donc la pluie, et qui fait le beau temps?
Qui fait dis-moi qu’autant en emporte le vent?
Qui fait que sur ton cœur un jour c’est le printemps
Et qu’à peine en un instant revient le mauvais temps?

C’est pas, c’est pas la faute à la lune non mais
C’est pas, c’est pas sa faute à la lune

Qui fait donc l’averse et sur ton coeur la tempête?
qui fait les saints de glace et ton réveil en trompette?
Qui fait qu’en un instant le plus charmant des sourires
Chez toi se transforme en grise mine en soupir?

C’est pas, c’est pas la faute, à la brise non mais
C’est pas, c’est pas sa faute à la brise

Et qui mène la danse, la girouette ou le vent?
Qui fait trois pas de danse, pirouette gaiement?
C’est ton humeur mon amour, bohème et vagabonde
Qui fait trois petits tours, un sourire et la ronde

Et bientôt se débine et devient grise mine
Et bientôt se débine et devient grise

Née d’un coquillage de toi
Un jour que tu ne regardais pas

Depuis je roule entre mes doigts

Un bracelet en souvenir 
De toi

Ce bijou qui ne brillait pas, non
Pour d’autres ne brillait que pour moi,
Ce bijou que tu n’osais pas, non

Tendaient tes boutons de chemise

D’une aiguille à tricoter est cause de mon malheur

Qui versait son poison dans ma tasse de café
Je suis tombé tout droit en pâmoison devant cette poupée
Cette poupée empoisonnée

Cette poupée grimaçante à l’allure de bergère
se montra bientôt méchante aussi vile que sorcière
L’onguent magique avait bien tout du philtre d’amour mais...
Toxique était la fleur poussant à son corset 
L’onguent magique avait bien tout du philtre d’amour mais...
Toxique était la fleur poussant à son corset 

La corde qui me retient maintenant loin du sol
est nouée tant et si bien que je reste comme en vol 
J’ai du pendu toutes les apparences, la moindre des raideurs
Et devinez qui reste à me picorer le cœur ?
J’ai du pendu toutes les apparences, la moindre des raideurs
Et cette poupée qui me picore le cœur

Une fois tout consommé le feu de mes ardeurs
Trépassant plus d’une fois, sonné dans mes vapeurs
Je l’ai vue qui répandait dans les airs, à peine refroidies
Les cendres de mon âme, récoltées chaque nuit
Je l’ai vue qui répandait dans les airs, à peine refroidies
Les cendres de mon cœur, récoltées à minuit

Elle a filé la poupée en emportant le plus beau
Et moi je me suis foulé en descendant au tombeau
Il ne me reste de l’aiguille, de cette fichue poupée
Que stigmates et béquilles, son cœur s’en est allé
Il ne me reste rien de cette fichue poupée
qu’un petit trou d’aiguille dans mon cœur épinglé

Une petite poupée avait la cruauté
D’un cannibale venu tout droit de Papeete
Elle a mordu, vampire, à pleines dents dans mon quart de jeunesse
Ne vous reste à présent  qu’à vous partager mes restes 
Elle a mordu, vampire, à pleines dents dans mon quart de jeunesse
Laquelle d’entre vous viendra manger mes restes",La Poupee

d’un amour naissant,
c’est bien enivrant
mais ça prend du temps
Si bien qu’après tant de temps perdu
de frôlements, de jeux charmants, de retenue

donner sa main, un jour, un jour à l’autre
Et puis s’enchaîner d’un jour sur l’autre
en oubliant
Le temps perdu à savoir pourquoi, 
perdre tout ce temps à tenter de s’aimer
pendant qu’on s’abîme
Quand vient le moment
de tout se promettre
et de tout se dire
sans plus se mentir
Tout ça prend du temps et tant de mots
De jeux de mots, de mots charmants et de rengaines,
Mais s’embrasser encore de temps en temps
et la fermer un peu de temps en temps
pour les très longs baisers du bon vieux temps
en oubliant
Le temps perdu à savoir pourquoi, 
perdre tout ce temps à tenter de s’aimer
pendant qu’on s’abîme
Quand c’est plus le moment,
c’est bien désolant,
ne plus rien se dire

Et qui prennent du plomb pour de l’or à leur doigt
à l’anneau l’hameçon du pêcheur est bien fiché

et à mettre leur cœur à mariner ou bien cuire en fricassée

L’amour ainsi sommeille, et la belle endormie
croit s’en remettre au temps dans sa robe de nuit
on dit de l’eau qui dort qu’elle est une ennemie
Nous savons de l’amour qu’il ne dort qu’à demi
Gare à celui qui passant là l’effleure à peine et le réveille
On ne pose sur un cœur pas longtemps de bâillon
pour en taire les ardeurs l’envoyer par le fond
On ne fait pas d’un cœur qu’il se taise à jamais
on le croit muselé on le voit bouillonner
on le croit apaisé il devient feu follet
gare à celui-là qui s‘en approche, gare à la moindre anicroche

Certaines même ne demandent pas mieux
Que de glisser lentement dans un écrin de peu
d’amour  car après tout c’est pas si mal

il se contente du peu qu’on lui donne

Deux, trois boucles seulement
Trois boucles qui sont comme en vol
Trois petits tours et puis s’en vont
C’est comme une farandole
Trois fois le tour de mon giron
Trois petits tours et dégringolent

Ana, les ogres qui rêvent de t’avaler tout rond
Font trois petits tours et puis s’en vont

On les voit qui frétillent d’un souffle à peine d’air
On les voit qui scintillent te donnant un peu l’air
D’une méduse gentille 
Une gorgone comme un ange
Trois battements d’ailes et dans les airs
Les voilà remontées tout là-haut
et pour faire trois fois du mystère
Le tour, on tourne autour du pot

Et quand vient le temps des batailles
Qu’il nous faut partir en campagne
explorer la jungle d’épis en dépit des boucles en bataille
On s’arme de patience et d’un peigne en attendant
que le vent
daigne bien ne plus souffler sur
tes cheveux l’espace d’un instant
et que repose ci-gît l’épis
tombé tout droit du firmament
Ana tes boucles qui s’affolent d’un trois rien, d’une once de vent
Ana tes boucles qui volent au vent font trois petits tours sur le dos du temps
trois petits tours sur le dos du temps

Le vent qui faisait valser tes boucles, a laissé
comme plûmes tomber trois boucles en gravité
descendant tombant du ciel un peu comme des anges 
des nues
Les voilà semant la pagaille
les voilà tombant en cascade
Et sur tes yeux et sur ton front
à la manière d’un éventail
Deux trois boucles tombées 
comme des hirondelles du ciel 
trois boucles qui font le printemps
Sont au nombre de tes printemps
Trois printemps pour nous rappeler
Trois fois le temps de nos baisers

Font trois petits tours et puis s’en vont",Les Boucles d'Ana
Bastien Lallemant,"C’est du cœur d’occasion 
que vous trouvez chez moi !
Offert avec ses options
garanties etc...

Et s’il connaît des ratés 
ne vous en inquiétez pas,
ce cœur a tant tourné
qu’il ne vous lâchera pas !

Il ne fait jamais défaut,
il marche du tonnerre,
il n’a comme seul défaut
qu’un petit peu de vert !

Du vert de gris dans les entrailles,
pour se rappeler
le souvenir de ses batailles,
mais ça c’est du passé.

C’est du cœur d’occasion
que vous trouverez chez moi !
Sans date de péremption,
il dure pendant des mois.

C’est mon cœur en morceau 
que vous ramasserez là,
il n’en est de plus beau
que cet article là.

Alors ne soyez pas trop sévère,
pensez un peu aussi,
combien de coups de tonnerre
votre cœur a-t-il pris.

Ça je le vois tout à votre air,
à votre air à moitié pris,
ce cœur n’est pas tout vert,
il a beaucoup servi.

Bastien Lallemant,"Votre innocence est d’une splendeur

qu’il n’est plus là sur vos genoux
savez-vous ce qu’il fait ailleurs
quel est son labeur ?

Un orpailleur de premier ordre
vous faisant miroiter le ciel
qu’on voit cueillir à d’autres cœurs 
des paillettes et puis s’en aller...  

Quand il déballe ses oriflammes
qu’il vous réclame tout près de lui
soupçonneriez-vous d’autres flammes
brûlantes au milieu de ses nuits
Le soupçonneriez-vous, lui ?

Lui, ne s’en prive pas et pour
éteindre toutes vos méfiances
on le voit faire à votre cours
du mensonge toute une science
avec suffisance

lui le beau parleur, le vrai menteur
vous faisant miroiter le myrte
et qui s’effeuille au premier souffle
à la première bise venue

Mais votre innocence vous fait si belle
moins il est là, plus il vous trompe
plus moi je vous trouve belle…

pour être infâme jusqu’au bout
On l’entend même se vanter 
Et même se moquer de vous
auprès de ceux que vous aimiez
en toute amitié

votre récompense ici bas
c’est de le sentir près de vous
quand chacun sait qu’il n’y est pas
qu’il n’est pas celui devant vous
que vous pensiez, mais...

une ombre, à peine une entité
abstraite et fuyante toujours
qui vous revient comme en un songe
quand se lève le petit jour...

Il pourrait vous empoisonner
à petit feu, jours après jours
vous ne l’auriez jamais pensé
lui qui vous contait son amour
qu’il compte vos jours...

En rêvant à leurs fêtes galantes
Combien sont ils qui remarquent au balcon de l’amante

Un monsieur que les polis 
disent de petite taille
Un monsieur pris dans les plis
Des pieds jusqu’à la taille

Que fièrement il arbore quand elle pousse un soupir
Quand elle se plie en deux pour lui dire
Tout ce que des amants peuvent à l’un l’autre se dire 

« Oh monsieur, petit monsieur
Vous êtes mon grand amour
S’il vous plaît pour mes beaux yeux
De grimper à ma tour »

Aussi grand que ces grands dadais,
Aussi benêts, jamais

Dans un verre se noie

lascive comme une odalisque

sous les regards hallucinés des cheminées 
et des fumerolles divines

dans la nuit bleue de chine

entre le ciel, et les persiennes
émouvante au dessus du vide, en équilibre
elle, la créature martienne
la revoilà tout en langueur  
subrepticement entre les fleurs ?

et mollement comme un soleil, entre tes jambes

profite de ta sieste et plein de nonchalance
s’enroule tel un grand boa
et se faufile en tapinois
délicieusement entre tes doigts

elle promène son regard de jais
faisant montre d’un intérêt très littéraire
pour le songe d’une nuit d’été

retourne jusqu’au canapé

semblant glisser entre les glycines

Saturday night was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowin' the cup,
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck.
So I took one girl outside with me,
Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me,
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said,

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby,
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, ""Everyday I wake up, hoping to die""
She said, ""They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away,
So our daddy couldn't rape us,
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to""

Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?

I saw a light
Coming through the trees

I saw a light
Coming through the trees

Freshly cut lawns
And little children sleepwalking

I saw a light
I saw a light
Shining on a car
And a couple inside
Had committed suicide

Death in your arms
Death in your arms

I saw a light
I saw a light
Coming through the trees
And I packed my things

After I saw the light
I packed my thing
The light gave me life
And helped me see more clearly

And the children went to sleep
And the car was towed away
And the leaves were rustling
As the night turned to day

I saw a light
Getting smaller in the distance
And I said goodbye

Been thinking about having a couple of kids
Comb a brush around their heads in the morning

Been on the road for so long
She wants to live in a place that has a number and a name
Find love as an anchor before the courage is gone

She really loves him, I tell you

To break the cross that bears her name

Needs something better than running away

You would want and more and more

Be proud when you dazzle the wondrous
Glitter your eyes for the town
Tell every last boy that you're my man
Try not to let you down

Till the siren come calling, calling
It's driving me evil, evil
I was a heart breaker, I loved you
The same way I do
But I've got so much wickedness and sin

My name is Pearl
And I'll love you the best way I know how
My blond curls slice through your heart
And the stars are exploding in the night

It won't be long until you'll break
No, it won't be long until you break
It won't be long until you break
It won't be long until you break
Cause I'm evil, 'cause I'm evil",Siren Song
Bat for Lashes,"Never see the big, church staple, when I call you on the phone
Never feel the rush of angels, when we stay up late alone
Never whisper you a great love story, only scream and cry or more
But you're a good man, but you're a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go
Oh, let go of the one who took all your gold

I get home and there's a love note waiting
But only he is here tonight
And the words, the promises you're making
Only echo all these lies
And for every sweet nothing you whisper
Why is goodbye my reply?
Cause you're a good man, cause you're a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go
There was someone that I knew before, a heart from the past
But I can not forget, and let him take all my gold, and hurt me so bad
But now for you, I have not been loved of all my go-gold

Stare my heart blank, am I ever gonna let him go? Get my gold back
And today I was a dead girl walking, city light birds, room for tears
Heard you say my name and get to talking of the love and all the fears
And you saw all the pain I was holding, and yet still you'd hold me near
Cause you're a good man, cause you're a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go
There was someone that I knew before
A heart from the past, that I can not forget
I let him take all my gold, and hurt me so bad

Press my hands between my thighs, and poured the thistle milk
Begged the thunder bolts to strike and mark me as alive

All of the lilies on the hill

And so I finished up my prayer, rose slowly and I stared
But I was empty as a grave and ghost less was the air
Laid back to bedden my eyes and searched those frivolous skies
Again begged the thunder bolt to strike to mark me or else I will die

Did I believe what I did see?
Did I believe what came to me?

Appeared a figure of a man, waving upon the hill
To the window I ran and saw what he had sent
Children of a private world, to beacons conceived in milk
Hundred marching to my door are bringing dreams to drink

Like lightning from clear sky
For I'm questioning your lord
His almightyness I defy

And watch the masses starve
On empty stomachs they may go
And to this kingdom it is far

In seven days the hog
Created light and what the fuck else
But then who created God

You think the death of one man
Self proclaimed the son of God a lost
But raise Hell and high water 'cause I rock and roll
Well, be my guest and crawl to your cross

The bigger cross the better Christian
Says the book of God's commands
But when you reach out you'll find
No one to grab thy fucking hand

And finally when truth comes clear
About death then what will you do
Y'see there's nowhere left to hide
From the grave waiting for you too

I have the knowledge guts and need
To questioning anything behind
Those pretty promises of heaven
Can't you see that you are blind

Because of one whose words you preach
And fall onto your knees before
Do not exist in fact I doubt
He'll knock your fucking doors

Sons of bitches whores of Christ
Your prayers never could
What I think faith in yourself and
Sane minds and hard work really could

Because to put all hope in one up high
Is sheer insanity
It will show fatal to us all
Yes, even fucking dangerously

You call yourselves the chosen ones
Because you've ""seen"" his light and soul
Well I've got news for you I'm stronger
Because I've got rock and roll

You think just 'cause you pray
Your souls'll be saved at any cost
While I'll burn 'cause I rock and roll

on his cloak and hood familiar. The one eyed old man matches the
description of the soothsayer, as told by the elders of his village by the
fires at night when he only a child. The boy, now a young man, eager to
know, asks the one eyed old man about his dreams. Dreams he cannot
understand. Dreams about strange things he is seeing himself doing. Then
the winds that seem to talk to him. Voices that whisper to him behind his
back. The one eyed old man tells him of the cycles of the stars, of the
trail of fate and of the valley where time and space had ceased to exist...
where his world ends and the shadows begin. The one eyed old man tells the
young man that fate has chosen him to interfere with the other world. The
disturbance is already made. The daughters of the four winds have sold
themselves to the shadows, distorting the balance of the universe. And the
one eyed old man says he has seen him come for a thousand years, and that
the aging gods have told him to teach him all that he has ever known and to
prepare him to ride beyond his world and into the shadows as their champion
to restore the balance. To his aid he shall be given a sword forged when
this world was young. He shall be guarded and guided by two ravens, and he
shall ride the eight-legged stallion of his fathers' god. He will encounter
the Woodwoman, and he will make a visit to the Lake. One hundred days and

Bathory,"Resting by my fire. Looking deep into it's flames.
My mind must have been somewhere else
Far beyond these plains.
I am suddenly aware of a pair of eyes staring at me.
I turn around and behold the most ugly thing I have seen.

The woman standing in the glade like a shadow in the night
Points her wretched finger at me with a wretched smile
And she asks me in a voice that sounds as if it's been so long
since she spoke, if I seek magic then I should come along

I'm but a man. Mortal, a man.
But she leaves no footprints in the snow
Still I follow on to where she is going
For she has promised me magic if I follow on.

She takes me to a part of these woods few have ever seen.
Where the sun surely won't reach
Still the ground ominously gleams.
She says she's seen me coming and that she knows where I'll go.
But before I leave she says there is this one thing I should know.

She offers me the ability to take a fatal wound.
Every cut by sword or spear will be absorbed by her tree-womb.
The magic will remain until it's time for me to part with this mortal world.
And all she'll claim is my young heat.

I'm but a man. Mortal, a man.
And I'll need all the help that I can get.
So I give my heart to the woman of the dark
With or without it, my life is not over yet.

Wing of bat and lizard's eye.
Dust of a star fallen from the sky.
Tears of a virgin, *** of a god.
Thirteen drops of an infant's blood
A twist of a cat's spit and oil of the moon
Stir for a while and very soon
A salve to be applied upon the chest
close to where the heart beats strong.

No pains will occur when her hand is pushed into my flesh
She'll slowly draw my living heart out of my open chest.
She'll place my heart in the pit of the snake and behold the years go by.
Hers to keep from the moment when the time has come for me to die.

[bottom will take a thousand generations. When this world was anew, the one]
[eyed old man, then a young wanderer, hidden behind a tree, had overheard]

[new, was kept safe in a lake in a part of the Eternal Woods. The one eyed]

Just let it roar, oh baby

This endless journey will never take me home
I carry in me hopeless love

Und wegen ewigen Lebens wird nie mein Tagebuch fertig.
Falsch gedacht, jetzt wird eingepackt,
Der Sensenmann mäht mich um, ich bin leistungsschwach.
Meine Lunge platzt, die Luft wird knapp,
Mein Kreislauf gibt den Geist auf ohne Muskelkraft.
Und durch suizidale Gedanken
Kann ich Gäste nun mit blutigen Armen empfangen.

Doch ich versuch frei zu atmen,
Trotz geschwollener, trockener Schleimhäute.
Mein Arm ist eingeschlafen,
Seit dem verfolgen ihn scheußlich-teuflische Albträume.
Der Schnaps bläst in meinem Kopf Lichter aus,
Mein Magen kann den Schock nicht verdauen.
Werd' ich so auf meine alten Tage labil?
Denn meine Psyche ist nicht mal in der Seitenlage stabil!

Alles Krüppel, jeder ist behindert,
Alle AIDS oder Krebs in Leber oder Blinddarm.
Überall krank, ja langsam nervt es,
Ich frag' mich was bekomm' ich wann als erstes?

Nach 'nem Bier muss ich nicht nur zum kotzen auf's Klo,
Meine Prostata ist offenbar zu groß.
Ich esse statt Kopfsalat nur Wurst,
Also lass' uns schnell zum Doktor fahren! Los!
Gucken sie sich von meinem Bauch schnell den Umfang an,
Von Schokolade krieg' ich nie genug - bin ich jetzt Zuckerkrank?
Hab' ich Diabetis, Vidalegis, Viagetis?
Aber das ist nicht alles, ich hab EHEC und seh' schlecht!
Ich guck nicht sehr weit, also gib mir nen Hinweis,
Ist Kurzsichtigkeit die Vorstufe von Blindheit?
So hat keiner für mich im Alltag Verwendung,
Gibt's für Krankheiten doch keine Altersbeschränkung.

Ich bitte dich den Unfallarzt zu holen,
Aus meiner Kehle ragt ein Dunst von Aceton,
Eine Stunde wart' ich schon,
Und verharz den Lohn.
Tabak teert mir eine schnellstraße zum Lungenkarzinom.
Ich leb' in ständiger Angst,
Bis ich an's Ende gelang,
Mit nem' chronischen Tinitus als Engelsgesang.
Fühl ich ein stechen in der Brust,
Ist das ein Herzinfarkt?

Doch ich hab' ihn gern gehabt.

So duftet mein Körper nach Bübchencreme
Es wär' gelogen, zu sagen, dass es mir übel geht
Zeitgleich ess' und trink' ich von früh bis spät
Das billigste vom billigsten Krümeltee

Du kennst tausend Anmachsprüche? Schön, ich kenne kein'
Hab weder Plan vom männlich sein, noch vom Händchen halten
Bin eine dumme Nuss, habe Körperbau wie Pummeluff
Hatte noch nie einen Zungenkuss, wahrscheinlich wegen Mundgeruch
Mich hat nur Mutti lieb, niemals Bräute
Bedeutet, ich hatte noch nie Geschlechtsverkehr
Und hab mehr Kuscheltiere als Freunde,
Dabei besitze ich nur einen Teddybär
Der Grund dafür ist leicht zu finden,
Aber mir nicht so leicht beizubringen
Leider verfüge ich nicht über so tolle Dinge, die bei irgendwelchen Leuten Eindruck schinden
Nie ein Rheinhaus, keine Segelyacht, kein Goldschmuck
„Lila Scheine braucht meine Seele“ sagt der Volksmund
Deshalb fall ich meine Jugend ohne nennenswerte Höhepunkte
Bis sich eines Morgens mein Gestänge in die Höhe pumpte
Vorher hatte ich weder Goldbarren, noch Volkswagen
Weder Style, noch das Geld, aber kann jetzt stolz sagen

Ich ich ich, ich hab einen Pullermatz
Ich ich ich, ich hab einen Pullermatz
Ich ich ich, ich hab einen Pullermatz
Ich ich ich, ich hab einen Pullermatz

Sei mal ehrlich, haste auch ein'? (Auch ein)
Zeig mal her, denn ich glaub, nein (glaub nein)
Und selbst wenn schon,
Würde der im Gegensatz zu meinem wohl keinem auffallen

Über Nacht hat sich einiges gut angestaut
So steht mein Penis nun mit mir jeden Morgen zusammen auf
Du Spasti trinkst 'n Schluck und bist fast beschwipst vom Suff
Aber mein Pullermatz, der bleibt standhaft bis zum Schluss
Ich halt ihn gefangen denn er leider zu viel Größenwahn
Wird er freigelassen, dann macht er, was er will und hält Groupiemösen warm
Fazit, Jede kommt schnell und freut sich heftig
Verliebt sich Hals über Kopf in ihn bei Stellung „69“
Auch deine Freundin, sie stöhnt und merkt deutlich, wie schön
Meine Schlange sich wohlfühlt im feuchten Milieu
Entweder lässt sie sich besamen oder macht sich vom Acker
Es ist, als wenn sie mit einer Flasche Bonaqua in Kontakt trat
Ich krieg' ihn ganz hoch, ist er eigentlich gewöhnt
Auch nach dem Xten Anstoß ist noch Kreide auf'm Queue
Will mich hier keinesfalls selbst verherrlichen
Aber jetzt kann ich endlich die Welt beherrschen, denn

Ich ich ich ich ich ich ich
Ich ich ich ich ich ich ich
Ich ich ich ich ich ich ich

BattleBoi Basti,"Scheiße das is wohl das Ende meiner Träume,
So eine verdammte Kacke ich habe verschlafen
Warum hat mein beschissener Wecker nich geläutet,
Jetzt muss ich raus aus den Federn und ins Bad renn
Schwitzte im Schlaf habe Achselnässe,
Es bleibt keine Zeit für eine Katzenwäsche
Wenigstens ruckzuck die Zähne geputzt
Und Reste werden runter durch die Kehle geschluckt jupp
Jupp, die suche nach reinen Klamotten lässt mich 
leider zu der Annahme kommen ich habe nur noch dreckige Sachen
Dabei habe ich doch vor nicht all zu langer Zeit 
meiner Mutter aufgetragen sie hätte meine Wäsche zu waschen
Ja, na gut, ich gerat in Wut und zerdepper im Badezimmer die Armatur
Hey, Ist es Verzweiflung oder wahrer Mut?
Denn ich verlasse meine Wohnung im Schlafanzug
Schnell die Mappe gesattelt bin in totaler Aufruhr
Renne hin zur Treppe durch den Hausflur
Nehme dabei wohlwollend einen Sturz in Kauf,
Bewältige die Treppe per Purzelbaum
Ja man könnte behaupten ich habe Pech,
Doch muss ohne zu gucken über die Straße renn
Aber mein Scheißbus der fährt mir vor der Nase weg,
Alter ehrlich dieser Tag ist Dreck

So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
Kann man da von Schicksal reden? 
Keine Ahnung aber mich fickt das Leben!

Befinde mich immer noch auf dem Schulweg,
Den ich zu Fuß geh, mir tut der Fuß weh
Aber ganz egal wo der Schuh drückt oder Blut spritzt,
Heute komme ich nich zu spät
Hasse das Leben jetzt prasselt der Regen,
Ich hätte alles und jeden für eine Jacke gegeben
Es ist nass auf den Wegen
Und zu allem Überfluss bin ich in Kacke getreten
In einer Vielzahl, ganze vier mal, ja sogar an beiden Füßen
Sowas soll Glück bring'? alle Passanten gaffen mich an 
und denken ich würde in scheiße wühlen
Typisch, zu einem verkorksten Tag,
Gehört natürlich auch dazu passendes Regenwetter
Sollte das hier alles nie ein Ende haben
Und so weitergehn dann schick mir besser einen Seelenklempner

So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
So ein Dreckstag, so so ein Dreckstag
Kann man da von Schicksal reden? 
Keine Ahnung aber mich fickt das Leben!

Es war ein bitterer Tag (jaja) an dem ich um Erlösung bat
Ich habe das Gespür dafür, dass die Kacke, die ich heut erlebt habt nicht einmal die Krönung war
Dank meiner Vorliebe für Schokolade und fettem Essen
Is der folgende Weg ein einziger Kraftakt
Die Bewegung tut mir gut, verliere sieben Kilo unterwegs und drei Liter Wasser
Immerhin ein positiver Nebeneffekt,
Doch ich nehme wieder zu in Genen ist Fett
Ich möchte nicht mehr weiter durch die City rasen,
Ich möchte ein bisschen schlafen also bitte gebt mir ein Bett
Doch der Battleboi ist dick und muss
Weiter gegen die Zeit laufen bis zum Schluss
Eins hast du über mich nicht gewusst
Ich muss unbedingt in die Schule, bin pflichtbewusst
Irgendwie versuch ich klar zu komm,
Spring über Bänke auf denen die Penner pennen
Danach über Geländer renne so wie ein Beserker
Und überhole die Rentner die mich währenddessen anmeckern
Doch ich höre da nicht hin ich habe anderes im Blick
Die Vordertür von meiner Schule is erreicht mit einem Schritt
Aber ich könnte weitermotzen die Vordertür ist verschlossen

Aber du hast 'ne Facebook Seite, geiler scheiß, einfach nice
Könnte nicht leichter sein, doch es gedeiht der Neid, man nennt dich Einheitsbrei
So hüte dich vor Hatern die vor Eifersucht geplagt sind
Und Geschlechtsverkehr mit Schlampen nach dem Reißverschlussverfahren
Du bist zwar einer unter Hunderttausend weiteren, aber dir ist klar
Dass die mit ihren dummen Sound nur scheitern könn'

Dann gründe ein Label, das dich signed
Mach paar ernsthafte Tracks, das ist ok
Und sag dann mehrfach im Text, dass Hip Hop lebt
Auf deinem Album müssen dicke Features sein
Frag Sido und Bushido, die sagen sicher niemals nein
Über's Internet sind die ja leicht erreichbar
Und mit den Features in der Tasche ist gleich der Hype da
So wird deine erste Platte zum Selbstläufer
Auf der nächsten haste Eminem mit drauf

And haunt my severed county with your dripping secret games
You picked the unripe lilies, deflored and peeled the bleeding petals
Made known to me the grainy stains, the crimson lotus
Of the black ash inheritance, the semen feed of Gods and masters
The worms still in me, still a part of me, racing out from leaking rooms
Swoop from broken lungs
To block the transmission to put an end to the nomad years

I played the game and never won
Thought rock and roll would bless
my soul forever.
Songs of love and ecstasy
Remind me how it used to be
I thought those days would never end
But now it seems I need a friend

I remember all those days gone by
I remember all their faces
The old familiar places

[Chorus]
Don't let the music die,
No our song could last forever
Don't let the music die,
Don't let the music die
And though we've said goodbye,
We could spend our lives together,
So as time goes by
Don't let the music die

Yesterday, the world was mine
I played the clown and Pantomime
Or was it just a dream that's gone
forever
Echoed voices from the past
Recall the songs I thought would last
And say ""Those times will never die""
And the love we share's the reason why

I remember all those days gone by
I remember all their faces,
The old familiar places

When we were young we had our time
And we would drink
sweet talking wine
but now that it's over
All the songs sound out of rhyme

Smiling faces, have they ever seen
Empty hallways? Will they ever end?
The fool again

Masquerading in a hyper dream
Fading shadows talk of their machine
Through the haze another cigarette
So much to say to forget

[Chorus]
Inside a broken dream I cry
Is love the reason why?
Inside an empty room I'll stare
At love that is not there

Life begins with your head in the dark
The chord of life reveals the final spark
Takes you nowhere then nowhere takes you back again",Inside a Broken Dream

With a smile upon his face,
He fired the starting pistol and
Began the human race

They were running everywhere
But everywhere is nowhere
And nowhere isn't there.

[Chorus]
It's a game a game, a game that we're playing
But I don't mind but I don't make the rules
It's a game, a game, a game that we're playing
Just a game for lovers and fools

Well there's snakes upon your ladder
And there's dice upon your skirt
There's lipstick on my collar
And there's sweat upon my shirt
The neighbors will start talking but
You know that I don't care
For the neighbors, they are nowhere
And nowhere isn't there.

Bayou Boys,"Oh little girl, oh sweet baby

Oh girl, I’d be in trouble if you left me now
’Cos I don’t know where to look for love, I just don’t know how
Oh girl, how I depend on you to give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be there

All my friends call me a fool
They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now

Oh girl tell me, tell me what am I gonna do?
And I know I've got a guilty face
Girl I feel so out of place

Yeah girl, what am I gonna do? Do
What am I gonna do?
If you leave me baby what am I gonna do?
I don’t know where to go, who to see yeah

Oh girl, I guess I’ll never know
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl I’ve gotta get away from here
Oh girl, girl, girl pain will double if you leave me now
’Cos I don’t know where to look for love and I don’t
I don't know how, oh no

Oh girl, girl, why do I love you so?
I really wanna know, I really wanna know

Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity

Bayou Pickers,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo

Strut your stuff
I worry about you
It's ok
If you don't care
Now I'm down and I wish you were here

Wish you were here, wish you were

You need some, some downtime
I'm sorry if you're so unhappy
I'm dying without you
Be happy cause you know I care

You're a queen
Surpass the things I've seen
I'm dying without you
Call me sometime

Sorry that
You failed
To fuck up my life like you fucked up theirs

To tell you all of the things that I meant to that day

Meant to that day, wish I could

That I'm not alright
When you tear open my chest
I'll try not to flinch
Won't make promises
You taught me that
I'm still losing what's left of my self esteem
And I'm still watching the slow fading of all my daydreams

The hardest things to say are the words that mean the most
So I'll bite my tongue til it bleeds and I doubt you'll even know
The easiest things to fake are feelings to fool someone else
And I've been tricked for so long by you that I spent these last few months in my own hell

A failed apology
A day too late but now I see
That all you really want's to see me dangle neck first from a tree
But what would you need me for
You've got friends galore
And all you'll ever be to me is a stupid lying excuse for a person

I guess that's what I should get for crawling back at your feet.
And now I'm feeling so down, that there's no God above.
No mercy for a soul that's just way too fucked up.

There's a pain in my chest growing stronger with every heartbeat.
Now there's nothing left of me,
but empty bottles of pills and Bacardi.

Break your neck like you broke my will,
The guardrail will take you home

I guess you get caught up,
In the day-to-day,

And if I try to climb again, this time the fall is fatal
I don't deserve such an easy exit

Then we can teach ourselves again
'Cause it's worth the chance we take
When we were young we never cared
But now we're scared of jumping in
Like we've forgotten how to swim
But I think that we should try and we should tread
'Cause if we never take another dip again
We'll never know the joy that failure brings

I understand, but I gotta remind myself
That even at my worst I can keep my head
Alone I stand
United we fall apart
One union under God
But not for long,
One union under God
But not for long, thankfully

And I'm the Novocaine you pump in your cheek
That's why I'm still around, you've got blood running down your chin
But you suffered peacefully

She was a termite
Eating away at my roots

I was filling a void with you

And I can't, can't wait
Till you've see see seen
What death and disgust
Have done to me

And I spent three years
Wishing for two things
That one day you'd break
And I'd get to see

How all the choices you've made
Would drive you insane
I wish we never met

As angry as I sound
That's just the way I cover up, the way I feel
I've been that way for years and years
Slave to broken hearts and sex appeal

And she was a termite
Eating away at my roots

Throwing punch after punch
After punch I, I give in
I'm so dumb, I'm surprised when they duck

Scared, paired walking soldiers
We're all wounded anyway
In our respective ways

Scientists, they couldn't fix me
I'm so tired of getting out of bed
But who would want to die as a cowardly little child
When our time is up, we'll be ashamed or proud

You stretch the truth like a crooked salesman
Telling lie after lie
After lie, but where's the line
You burn bridges, you're breaking down dams

Scientists, they couldn't fix me
I'm so tired of getting out of bed
But who would want to die as a cowardly little child
When our time is up, we'll be ashamed or proud

Let's take this train for one last stop, I know
It's not the end, but it can't be that far

Scientists they couldn't fix me
I'm so tired of getting out of bed
But who would want to die as a cowardly little child
When our time is up, then our time is up

You practiced it and everything

But in both our times free thinkers only thrive in history books

'Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just looked at him and said, ""Son, 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""

And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""

Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just hung her head and said, ""Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.

Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, good god, now, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing
Say it again, war, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing, listen to me

Before I find a love to let me live again.

When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,

How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.

For some tender arms to hold me tight.

I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May

His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies

Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams

So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep

He's a man. He's just a man.

And I've had so many men before,
In very many ways,
He's just one more.
Should I bring him down?

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.
I'm the one who's always been

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.

I'd turn my head. I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know.
He scares me so.
I want him so.

I love him so.",I Don't Know How To Love Him
BBC Concert Orchestra,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Music of the Night
BBC National Chorus of Wales,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem

You can fool the rich by drivin' in a wreck
You can get up someone's nose, every time you bounce a cheque

You can talk some bimbo into takin' you home
You can fool the wife into thinkin' you're alone

BBM,"The price is gettin' higher every, day
When it comes to good loving, it's the same old way
The high cost of love, gettin' higher every day
The less I get the more I have to pay

I came home with the groceries, you said, you need some more
I gave you my last two dollars, you said, you need 3 or 4
The high cost of love, gettin' higher every day
Seems like the less I get, the more I have to pay

I bought you a leather coat, you said, you wanted a mink
The way you spend my money, you think, you're married to a bank

BBM,"There's a place in my heart where you used to be
There's a pain, deep inside, don't want the world to see
Nothing, but emptiness, once there was your caress
I was touched by your naked flame

Now, it was hard sometimes, those things that we went through
But believe me when I'd say, I would never mean to hurt you
I hold the memory of holding you next to me
In my arms like a naked flame

Think it over before you break my heart
Think it over before the crying starts
Then we can say goodbye to the tears

I should have known that this time was a coming
But if you ever need me, I'll come a running home to you
There's a place in my dreams where we used to meet
But there's no one around now, it's just an empty street

In my arms, like a naked flame
In my heart, burns a naked flame",Naked Flame

Waiting in the wings
Just around the next dream

From the distance I could see
Her standing alone
Shine like a jewel in the night
Hidden from the eyes
A thief of the soul
Behind the shadows of love

Set me on fire with the stories you tell
Drown in the ocean of dreams
Close to the flame on wings of desire
Nothing's what it seems

She was waiting outside
With arms open wide
Ready to break my heart's fall
Oh the lightning in her eyes
