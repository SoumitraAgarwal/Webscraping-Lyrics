Fred Mollin,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come
Fred Neil,"Would you like to know a secret just between you and me
I don't know where I'm going next, I don't know who I'm gonna be
But that's the other side of this life I've been leading
That's the other side of this life.

Well my whole world's in an uproar, my whole world's upside down
I don""t know where I'm going next, but I'm always bumming around
And that's another side to this life I've been leading
And that's another side to this life

Well I don't know what doing for half the time, I don't know where I'm going
I think I'll get me a sailing boat and sail the Gulf of Mexico
But that's another side of this life I've been leading
And that's another side of this life

Well I think I'll go to Nashville down in Tennesse
The ten cent life I've been leading here gonna be the death of me
But that's the other side of this life I've been leading
And that's another side to this life

Would you like to know a secret just between you and me
I don't know where I'm going next, I don't know who I'm gonna be
But that's the other side of this life I've been leading
But that's the other side of this life.",Other Side to This Life

I got sand all in my shoes
You know I got stuck in the big city
Got to sing the big city blues

And I don't like it
Well they best leave us alone

Gonna swim to the gulf of Mexico

Fred Neil,"If I should leave you
Try to remember the good times
Warm days filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain
And just a little bit of rain

And if you look back
Try to forget all the bad times
Lonely blue and sad times
And just a little bit of rain

And if I look back
I'll remember all the good times

Fred Neil,"The water is wide
I can't cross over
And neither have
I wings to fly
Build me a boat
That can carry two
And both shall row
My love and i

There is a ship
And she sails the sea
She's loaded deep
As deep can be
But not so deep
As the love I'm in
I know not how
I sink or swim

Oh love is handsome
And love is fine
The sweetest flower
When first it's new
But love grows old
And waxes cold
And fades away
Like summer dew

Build me a boat
That can carry two
And both shall row
My love and i
And both shall row

Fred Nelson III,"How do you keep
The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever
Forever

If we can be
The best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day
To make it better as it goes
With any luck than I suppose

Fred Penner,"Winken and Blinken and Nod one night
Sailed off on a wooden shoe
Sailed down a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

Now where are you going and what do you wish?
The old moon asked the three
Well we're going out fishing for Herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea

And some silver and gold have we
Said, Winken and Blinken and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

While the little stars were the Herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets wherever you wish
Never a feared are we

So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Winken and Blinken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

T'was all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought t'was a dream
They dreamed of sailing the beautiful sea

But I shall name you the fishermen three
Winken and Blinken and Nod

Now Winken and Blinken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle bed

So close your eyes while mother sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see the wonderful things
As you rock in your misty sea

Where the old moon rocked the fishermen three
Winken and Blinken and Nod

Fred Penner,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Ghost riders in the sky.",(Ghost) Riders in the Sky

Fred Penner,"Why does the gay little dicky bird sing?
What put the ""zing"" in a butterfly's wing?
What's the reason for the smile of a troubadour?
Why does a breeze have a barrel of fun?
Even the bee who's a son-of-a-gun,
It's all because they're free
And stringless, the same as me

I've got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret
Or make me frown

I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me

Hi-o the merri-o
I'm as happy as can be
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me

I've got no strings so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
How I love my liberty

Fred Penner,"Batteries exhausted but emotionally charged
The whole world can hear me as I think too loud
Unlucky in gambling unlucky in love
Time to remote my velvet glove

Allergic, allergic

I meditate in public day & night
As my positive thinking is on strike
Ego scratched under the sole of my sneaker
Feel like falling asleep with my head in the speaker


This is a free train station philosophy
Pain and compassion are on sale lately
It's OK to say it'abs all wrong
I got my 1st class one way ticket to the dawn

I am allergic to myself",Allergies
Fred Penner,"When you find that your mind
Keeps you worried and blue
You can always let your feet
Keep your disposition sweet

Want to see
What makes me feel the way I do?
Will you kindly cast an eye
On two good reasons why?

Happy feet
I've got those happy feet
Give them a low down beat
And they begin dancing

I've got those ten little tapping toes
And when they hear a tune
I can't control my dancing heals
To save my soul

Weary blues can't get into my shoes
Because my shoes refuse to ever grow weary
I keep cheerful on an earful of music, sweet
'Cause I've got hap, hap, happy feet, yes

Happy feet, happy feet, happy feet
We've got those happy feet
Give them a low down beat
And they begin dancing

We've got those ten little tapping toes
And when they hear a tune
We can't control our dancing heals
To save our souls

Weary blues can't get into our shoes
Because our shoes refuse to ever grow weary
We keep cheerful on an earful of music, sweet
'Cause we've got hap, hap, happy feet, oh yes, we do
'Cause we've got hap, hap, happy feet

Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Fred Small,"Annie's up at seven on a work day
Brewing up a cup of peppermint tea
Gathering her papers and lesson plans
She grabs her keys
Teaching arithmetic and Africa
Geology and girls' basketball
All the kids in her class will tell you she's the best
But she's heard other teachers in the hall saying

[Chorus]
""What are we going to do about Annie
Pretty girl like her shouldn't be alone
If she took our advice, dressed up real nice
She'd find a man to take her home""

Mondays come with questions of couples
Where and with whom did you go
Avoiding the personal pronoun
She hopes it doesn't show
Shopping with her lover in the city
Two women holding hands don't get a stare
If the kids at school knew, what would they do
Would they hate her, why should they care, tell me

[Chorus]

Never getting too close to a student
Never letting out too much of her life
Keeping her delights and disappointments
Tucked out of sight
Annie takes herself to the Christmas party
The principal whispers with a smile
""You're vivacious and bright, if you play your cards right
There's some men here tonight worth your while,"" thinking

[Chorus]

Work that you love is hard to come by
The kids she could never bear to lose
So she makes conversation out of silences
And half-truths
But at night by the fire with her lover
She looks out at the wind-driven snow
And imagines the day when she'll look in their faces
And tell everybody she knows, she'll tell them

Don't you worry about Annie
She don't lie awake and pine
Got love to fill her heart, flowers growing in the garden
Annie's doing just fine",Annie
Fred Small,"All my life
Working at the factory
The pay looked mighty good to me
When my body was my own
Doctor won't look me in the eye
My youngest child asks why
I won't ever see her grown.
CHORUS:
Now I can feel the darkness
Growing wild inside me
Catching my soul by surprise
You know that you've made it
You got your home, your job, and some good times
Then they tell you it was death in disguise.
In the consultation room
They explain the x-ray slide
I stop the rising tide
Of self-pity and cold fear
Pale in the fluorescent light
I find no one left to fight
And remember all my careless years.
CHORUS
Half the town works there
So people fear the truth
There's no conclusive proof
There's any danger in those fumes
The company never saw my face
They've got another in my place
Another life to be consumed.

Fred Small,"You hear so many rumors sometimes you get confused
But I read it in Time Magazine and I heard it on the news
We'll see dramatic changes in the lifestyle we enjoy
If those megatons of atom bombs are actually employed.
The scenarios are scary, oh, but they don't worry me
Since I received a pamphlet from a federal agency
It's got diagrams and checklists and I read it front to back
And it told me what to do in case of nuclear attack:  Just

Dig a hole in the ground, and climb right on down
Lay some boards on top of you and sprinkle dirt around
You won't have to be dead if you only plan ahead
You'll be glad you kept a shovel on hand!
Now you can't just go picking any old place to dig your hole
Got to take a ride to the countryside to the town where you are
told
If your plates are odd-numbered please don't panic, you'll be
fine
Just politely let those even-numbered cars go first in line
If you don't have a car, just hail a cab or ride your bike

You and thousands of your city friends will be welcomed

By townfolk who will show you country hospitality--then

We're sure to give you notice up to seven days before
But it's wise to recognize the warning signs of nuclear war
If the temperature is rising in a flash of blinding light
Grab your toothbrush and a flashlight and shut the windows tight
If the wind is blowing wicked and there's buildings in the air
Blisters on you body, fire in your hair
If the tupperware is melting and your dinner plans are wrecked
Stay calm, it's time to put this foolproof plan into effect:

Fred Small,"In the stillness of the alley waits a man with an open blade
And he hurts the woman badly and within her plants his seed
She can't shake the dirt and horror as the seed takes root and grows
But the law now claims her body, the doctor's door is closed
She goes back to another alley to a leering butcher's blade
And the deal is dark and bloody in the crime the law has made.
CHORUS:
And the face at the window never blinks never turns away
When you wake in the night to a flashing light
When you burn on judgment day
They have spoke aloud your daydreams
They have listened to your plans
They have watched you dance in the rainstorm
They have seen you ride the wind.
Walking slowly home at night a man touching a man
And the car looks kind of familiar and it's coming round again
You got no chance in that deadly dance when they cut you to the bone
There's a bleeding gash from the broken glass and you hear somebody moan
And maybe somebody calls the cops and they take their own sweet time
And they say it's just a couple of fags again and maybe your friend is dying.
CHORUS
And your lover comes to you softly and you touch and you feel no shame
And you steal away from the city and lightning fills your veins
In an air-conditioned office the committee discusses your case
They know the words you whispered they felt the flush upon your face.
They have files on every fantasy, who's on top and who's below
You have crossed into the shadow place where outlaws freely roam.
CHORUS
You can drink the lies of paradise while the books on the shelves disappear
You can make a comfortable living, you can swear it can't happen here
And maybe they'll come for the unionists and maybe they'll come for the Jews
And maybe they'll come for the heretics but they'll never come for you
When you hear the step in the hallway, when you taste the iron fear
Don't you go shouting out for justice 'cause there's no one left to hear.

Fred Small,"From the land of shooting waters to the peaks of the Coeur d'Alene
Thimbleberries in the forest, elk grazing on the plain
The People of the Coyote made their camp along the streams
Of the green Wallowa Valley when fences had no name

And they bred a strain of horses, the treasure of the tribe
Who could toe-dance on a ridge or gallop up a mountainside
Who could haul the hunter's burden, turn a buffalo stampede
The horse that wore the spotted coat was born with matchless speed

[Chorus]
Thunder Rolling in the Mountains
Lead the People across the Great Divide
There's blood on the snow in the hills of Idaho
But the heart of the Appaloosa never died

In the winter came the crowned ones near frozen in the cold
Bringing firearms and spyglasses and a book that saves the soul
The people gave them welcome, nursed them till their strength returned
And studied the talking paper, its mysteries to learn

In the shadow of the mission sprang up farms and squatter towns
The plain was lined with fences, the plow blade split the ground
In the shallows of the Clearwater gold glittered in the pan
And the word would come from Washington: remove the Indian

[Chorus]

The chief spoke to the People in his anger and his pain 
""I am no more Chief Joseph. Rolling Thunder is my name. 
They condemn us to a wasteland of barren soil and stone 
We shall fight them if we must, but we will find another home.""

They fled into the Bitterroot, an army at their heels
They fought at White Bird Canyon, they fought at Misery Hill
Till the colonel saw his strategy and sent the order down
To kill the Appaloosa wherever it be found

[Chorus]

Twelve hundred miles retreating, three times over the Divide
The horse their only safety, their only ally
Three thousand Appaloosas perishod with the tribe
The people and the horses dying side by side

Thunder Rolling in the Mountains said, ""my heart is sick and sad.
Our children now are freezing. The old chiefs are dead.
The hunger take our spirit. Our wounds are deep and sore.
From where the sun now stands I shall fight no more.""

[Chorus]

They were sent to Oklahoma, malaria ran rife
But more died of broken hearts far from the land that gave them life
And the man once called Joseph at death was heard to say
""We have given up our horses. They have gone away.""

But sometimes without warning from a dull domestic herd
A spotted horse of spirit wondrous will emerge
Strong it is and fearless and nimble on a hill
Listening for thunder, the Appaloosa's living still

[Chorus]",The Heart of the Appaloosa
Fred Small,"In nineteen thirty-who at a zoo in Los Angeles
a polar bear named Larry performed for the crowd,
they'd cheer aloud
He'd go slipping and sliding, jumping and diving
The people would laugh. They took his photograph.
Larry was born at the zoo
He never knew as he grew older
anything colder
than Los Angeles
which is warmer than Alaska
where Larry's parents were born.
CHORUS:
Larry the polar bear
He'd never harm a hair on a child's head
He'd do tricks for them
at the Los Angeles zoo,
as he'd been taught to by his keeper Fran.
Fran would teach him new tricks
A funny pose
scratching his nose
He knew there'd be a fish at the end,
Fran was his friend.
One day she said ""Larry, you'll be in the movies
with real movie stars and a few simple tricks
and lots of fish
to be filmed on location in Alaska.""
and so they rehearsed for Larry's big scene,
He's supposed to be mean
and growl at a woman who was rescued by a man who scared him away
It was stupid
but fun to do.
The director would frown
and jump up and down
kind of like the chimps at the zoo.
CHORUS
At last came the day of the trip
They put Larry in a crate
twelve foot by eight
and he sailed aboard a steamship
The journey was long
and boring
Fran would visit
she'd talk to him
and bring him his favorite fish
then the noise and the rumbling stopped
and they lowered him down
set the crate on the frozen ground
and opened it
Fran said ""Larry, we're here
It's time for your tricks.""
And Larry appeared
He looked out at the gray Bering Sea
He squinted and puzzled
put his nose to the wind
and the scent of the seal made him tremble
He smelled the fox in its lair
and the weasel and hare
felt lichen and snow 'neath his paws,
and he looked at the tundra and ice,
looked at the loon in the sky and he ran
slowly at first
kind of lumbering
he ran
gathering speed
gathering memories from within
old and dim
growing stronger
to run and to swim,
to dive and to float,
the cold at his throat
But warm inside
'neath the fur and hide
Ocean and ice all around him
He ran
He ran
He ran
and he swam away.

Fred Small,"The market place was bustlying in the morning
When the army and the ORDEN made their strike
Like a farmer killing chickens for the market
They cut down every living thing in sight.
They tore into the wombs of the women
The sunlight gleaming on their bayonets
And the fishermen downstream, though they never heard the screams
Hauled in a harvest of human carnage in their nets.
CHORUS:
Take down my name
I ain't alone, I ain't ashamed
And I say U.S.A. out of El Salvador!
You can tell the Pentagon
We want no more Vietnams
We ain't marching into that jungle anymore.
She left her home in Ohio far behind her
She swore a sacred vow to help the poor
With three sisters she was raped and slowly tortured
Left in a shallow grave in El Salvador.
A doctor, he would grieve at all the suffering
He never asked his patient's party line
But he saved a rebel's life--the death squad came at night
Healing the sick his only crime.
CHORUS
Our taxes buy the bullets of the killers
Our helicopters darken southern skies
Our business wants new markets and cheap labor
Our papers rush to print C.I.A. lies
But take a message to the smiling politicians
Who like to talk so tough and act so brave
The rattling words of war, we've heard them all before
And we will answer them with peace and joy and rage.

Fred Small,"CHORUS:
Peace is the bread we break
Love is the river rolling
Life is a chance we take
When we make this earth our home
Gonna make this earth our home.

Feel the cool breeze blowing through the smoke and the heat
Hear the gentle voices and the marching feet
Singing call back the fire, draw the missiles down
And we'll call this earth our home.

We have known the atom, the power and pain
We've seen people fall beneath the killing rain
If the mind still reasons and the soul remains

Fred Small,"I went for a jog in the city air
I met a woman in a wheelchair
I said ""I'm sorry to see you're handicapped.""
She says ""What makes you think a thing like that?""

And she looks at me real steady
And she says, ""You want to drag?""

So she starts to roll and I start to run
And she beat the pants off my aching buns
You know going uphill I'd hit my stride
But coming down she'd sail on by!

When I finally caught up with her
She says ""Not bad for somebody ablebodied.
You know, with adequate care and supervision
You could be taught simple tasks.
So how about something to eat?""

I said that'd suit me fine
""We're near a favorite place of mine.""
So we mosied on over there
But the only way in was up a flight of stairs.

""Gee, I never noticed that,"" says I.
""No problem,"" the maitre d' replies.
""There's a service elevator around the back.""

So we made it upstairs on the elevator
With the garbage, flies, and last week's potatoes
I said ""I'd like a table for my friend and me.""
He says ""I'll try to find one out of the way.""

Then he whispers, ""Uh, is she gonna be sick,
I mean, pee on the floor or throw some kind of fit?""
I said ""No, I don't think so,
I think she once had polio.

But that was twenty years ago.
You see, the fact of the matter is,
If the truth be told,
She can't walk.

So he points to a table, she wheels her chair
Some people look down and others stare
And a mother grabs her little girl
Says ""Keep away, honey, that woman's ill.""

We felt right welcome.

Then a fella walks up and starts to babble
About the devil and the holy bible
Says ""Woman, though marked with flesh's sin,
Pray to Jesus, you'll walk again!""

Then the waiter says ""What can I get for you?""
I said ""I'll have your best imported brew.""
And he says ""What about her?""
I say ""Who?"" He says ""Her.""

""Oh, you mean my friend here.""
He says ""Yeah."" I say ""What about her?""
""Well, what does she want?""
""Well, why don't you ask her?""

Then he apologizes.
Says he never waited on a cripple before.
We immediately nominated him for Secretary of the Interior.

Well, she talked to the manager when we were through

She says ""There're some things you could do
To make it easier for folks in wheelchairs.""
He says ""Oh, it's not necessary.

Handicapped never come here anyway.""

Well, I said goodnight to my newfound friend
I said, ""I'm beginning to understand
A little bit of how it feels
To roll through life on a set of wheels.""

She says ""Don't feel sorry, don't feel sad,
I take the good along with the bad
I was arrested once at a protest demo
And the police had to let me go.

See, we were protesting the fact
That public buildings weren't wheelchair accessible.
Turned out the jail was the same way.
Anyway, I look at it this way--
In fifty years you'll be in worse shape than I am now.
See, we're all the same, this human race.
Some of us are called disabled. And the rest--

As your dreams describe a circle growing year by year
The postcard you send from Vancouver or South Bend
Recalls the friend too long away.

May the rain run off your shoulder when you're caught in a storm
When the frost comes a-calling may it find you safe and warm
May your place be set, may your promises be kept,
May you never forget you are loved.

Sunny in Salinas, where you nearly broke your heart
It was snowing in St. Paul but the people filled the hall
And you sent them all home singing through the cold.

All the big Italian women who look just like me
You can take your slender models and their Fifth Avenue clothes
But you'll never find a flower like the big Italian rose

Well, the more she thought about it, the more it made her mad
How they make you feel so ugly, how they make you feel so bad
Sell you junk food and booze then make you diet till you're dead
She sat and wrote a letter and this is what it said:

""Well, I'm nearly 57, my hair is turning gray
The dress I wore at 20 I cannot wear today
Just an ordinary woman and it sure would make me glad
Just for once to see someone like me in your ad""

Three weeks later came an answer, from New York it was sent
Said ""We'd like to take your picture for our next advertisement""

Fred Small,"The baby blinks her eyes as the sun falls from the sky
She feels the stings of a thousand fires as the city around her dies
Some sleep beneath the rubble, some wake to a different world
From the crying babe will grow a laughing girl

Ten summers fade to autumn, ten winters' snows have passed
She's a child of dreams and dances, she's a racer strong and fast
But the headaches come ever more often and the dizziness always returns
And the word that she hears is leukemia and it burns

Cranes over Hiroshima, white and red and gold
Flicker in the sunlight like a million vanished souls
I will fold these cranes of paper to a thousand one by one
And I'll fly away when I'm done

From squares of colored paper, it will take the pain away
With loving hands she folds them, 6 hundred 44
Till the morning her stumbling fingers can't fold anymore

Her friends did not forget her, crane after crane they made
Until they reached a thousand and laid them upon her grave
People from everywhere gathered, together a prayer they said
And they wrote the words in granite so none can forget

This is our cry, this is our prayer, peace in the world
This is our cry, this is our prayer, peace in the world
This is our cry, this is our prayer, peace in the world

This is our cry, this is our prayer, peace in the world

Fred Small,"We have cleared off the table, the leftovers saved,
Washed the dishes and put them away
I have told you a story and tucked you in tight
At the end of your knockabout day
As the moon sets its sails to carry you to sleep
Over the midnight sea
I will sing you a song no one sang to me
May it keep you good company.

You can love whomever you will
You can travel any country where your heart leads
And know I will love you still

You can choose one special one
And the only measure of your words and your deeds
Will be the love you leave behind when you're done.

There are girls who grow up strong and bold
There are boys quiet and kind
Some race on ahead, some follow behind
Some go in their own way and time
Some women love women, some men love men
Some raise children, some never do
You can dream all the day never reaching the end
Of everything possible for you.

Kind of graceful, kind of tough

He just lay there helpless and silent
Not a tear, not a smile, not a word
But they held him and rocked him and sang him to sleep
And talked to him as if he really heard
And he grew with the sun and affection
Though his body was spindly and small
And a hundred times they stood him with his hands upon the fence
And a hundred times watched him fall
And their daughters warned it was useless
They said, ""Mama, that boy will break your heart""
She said, ""Love never comes easy
And miracles mostly come hard,"" she said

May used to play the piano
And sing the old songs from the war
There was always music on the radio
And the records she bought at the store
And sometimes they swore he was listening
Though of course there was no way to know
Maybe he was flying in his own blue sky
Where no one else would ever go
Maybe he was lost in a forest
Where demons and woodspirits dwell
But for sixteen years he had never spoke a word
Never taken one step for himself, but they said

A ripple of music broke the night

And risk a cruel bovine snub
Would you lead me down the receiving line
And boldly boast, ""This moose is mine!""

Shake their heads, ""It's just a phase""
Or would they thank the stars above
Their precious heifer's found her love?

A coat that harbors ticks and fleas

But a moose can be a handy thing
When hungry wolves come visiting
In icy gust of winter storm
Our fur is deep and dry and warm

And someday should your milk run dry
And farmer stare with baleful eye
In dead of night I'd slip your noose
And lead you home to the land of moose
If I were a moose and you were a cow

If hunters came to do me harm
Would you hide me in the barn
Would all the herd come on the run
And glare until they dropped their guns?

Fred Small,"Call us America's sweethearts - we found a place in Roxbury
Where we can meet the mortgage, go to church on Sunday
I teach communion class and David leads the choir
Ten years together thinking about children

Lots of children out there beat up, beat down, hoping for a 
Home and a harbor, a hand that doesn't hit
Where the form said father and mother, we had to cross it out
Father and father, that's David and me

Twelve months of waiting, suddenly two little boys on our doorstep
Scared and crying, gave them a bath and tucked them in
Three-year-old Jamie, little brother Scott
Jamie had a bruise like a boot in the middle of his back

Refrain:
Love is love, no matter who, no matter where
Love is love, and a child knows when it's there
They can pry away the fingers that graced these walls with dirt
They can pull us apart, they can lie, oh they can hurt
But love leaves a trace and the heart holds a place for love's return

McDonalds and K-Mart - do you know how hard it is to find kids' shoes
Scott's first haircut, grinning and a little confused
Outside the aquarium baseball jackets red and blue
A picture is like time that's standing still

Jamie was a scrapper, he punched his brother, decked the kid next door
He threw a plate at David then ducked and cowered waiting for the blow
After supper I held him close, ""You're safe here, this is your home""
And the rains came to the parched and broken earth

But the papers smelled the headlines - gay parents, two little innocent boys
TV news on the front porch, politicians made a lot of noise
Liberal governor, he gave the order
Social worker phoned, ""Have them ready at three""

Picked Jamie up at daycare, kids were running shouting as they played
We didn't want to tell him, maybe the governor could have explained
Jamie was screaming when we strapped him in the welfare car
David said, ""We love you,"" and they were gone

You find out who your friends are, some came 'round some just let it go
Rallies on the common people singing people saying no
This is crazy - but Scott and Jamie 
Are still pinballs in a busted machine

The kitchen's clean and quiet, we changed the furniture around
Still keep Scott's rabbit - in the middle of the night sometimes I wake to the sound
Of a little one crying when there's nothing there at all
David holds me, says ""Go back to sleep""

All the time in the world to watch you when you're sleeping
All the time in the world to kiss you when you wake

Fred Small,"We pass through these rooms without speaking
Where the light throws a pattern of lace
You say you don't know if you are leaving
But there's no shadow of doubt upon your face
And you tell me there is no other
And I know you well enough to know it's true
And well enough to know you need a lover
Who can give what I never gave to you.

You can say that you were lonely
When I lay right by your side
You can say you saw the distance
When I looked you in the eye
And you can say I never reached you
No matter how many times I tried
But don't say I didn't love you
Cause that's a god damn lie

I emptied the drawer filled with letters
And I bowed my head and cried
No one ever loved me better
There was love in every line
But there were times I didn't hold you
When all you needed was a touch
And there were times when I said nothing
When one word would have been enough

And it seems sometimes like I lost my hand to a machine
In an accident a long time ago
It grabbed at my fingers and tore them off clean
Still I wait for these fingers to grow
And if I had fingers I'd touch your cheek
With a gesture so gentle and fine
I would braid your hair with baby's breath
I would take your hand in mine

You can say that you were lonely
When I lay right by your side
You can say you saw the distance
When I looked you in the eye
And you can say I never reached you
No matter how many times I tried
But don't say I didn't love you
Cause that's a god damn lie

I hear your voice in the morning
Singing softly to yourself
I know you imaging the loving
That awaits you with somebody else
And maybe I will find another
Who will take me in spite of these scars

And each of us yet may discover
How innocent we are

You can say that you were lonely
When I lay right by your side
You can say you saw the distance
When I looked you in the eye
And you can say I never reached you
No matter how many times I tried
But don't say I didn't love you
Cause that's a god damn lie

I know you won't say I didn't love you
Cause you know it would be a lie

Fred Small,"When gravity's dragging you down
Look up

So you see yourself stalking the city
Staring straight down at your feet
You notice the scuff on your shoeshine
You avoid all the holes in the street
And you pity the drunk in the doorway
While you wave the panhandler away
And you take it as a sign of insincerity
When someone says ""Have a nice day""

But when gravity's dragging you down
When gravity's dragging you down
When gravity's dragging you down
Look up

Look up where the sun hits the skyline
Where the thunderheads warn of a squall
You don't need to believe in a miracle
It's a miracle to be here at all

Where the bus driver grins through his mustache
And an old woman's lost in her book
And a man is possessed of a paisley vest
That insists upon a  second look
And a little girl in a baseball uniform
Is leading her father who's blind
And a man who is muttering under his breath
Is having a very hard time

And when gravity's dragging you down
When gravity's dragging you down
When gravity's dragging you down
Look up

I have looked in the eyes of the damned and despised
Seen souls no different from mine
And what I perceive in this world I believe
Is no more than I'm looking to find

I didn't know I'd have these waking dreams
I didn't know under the blanket of flame
I didn't know that you wore my name next to your heart

I didn't know -- I read the newspapers
I didn't know your hair smelled just like hers

In the valley of clouds
In the span of the branches
Two eyes keep the watch
Where the hummingbird dances
And the snake hesitates
With the calm of command
The jaguar waits

The chain saw is whining the bulldozer roars
Monkeys are screeching in flight
The spires of the Arawak cut down at one blow
Where will the jaguar go
Where will the jaguar go

Under the hammer of hunger
On the anvil of fear
The poor of Sao Paolo
Stream to the frontier
With the promise of farmland
Honest work honest pay
Till the rains unrelenting
Sweep the topsoil away

The captains of cattle take the land cheap
New York and Osaka crave beef
Hooves crush the dirt into dust below
Where will the jaguar go
Where will the jaguar go

When the circle is broken
When the crystal is cracked
When the thread of creation is torn
We slip through the veil into terrors unknown
Where will the jaguar go

In the canyons of commerce
In convoys of light
The armies of loneliness
Drive into the night
Trading plastic for plastic
Making fashion of trash
We are dreaming of love
As love turns to ash
The fires of Prometheus flare to the sky
The seas of the prophets boil dry
This gutted globe was a garden I'm told
Where will the jaguar go

The barley and the soybeans are at the feed lot now
Leaves as dry as paper crumble neath my tread
Colors of October like memories of the dead

And the last time I saw autumn's fire was a thousand years ago
I put my faith in autumn -- seasons come seasons go
And every sign of autumn now is bound to make me blue
The last time I had autumn I had you
The last time I had autumn I had you

The crooked streets of Cambridge are skirted now with snow
There's a bookstore crammed with browsers every twenty yards or so
And one night last December I searched each one high and low
To find the gift you wanted that only I would know

I put my faith in winter -- seasons come seasons go
And every gust of winter now is bound to make me blue

Just to cry by the side of the road
How many times must I reach and grasp at nothing
Before I can let you go

In the hills above Las Cruces forget-me-nots have bloomed
I walk the ridge till sundown and whistle a lover's tune
They've put me in the same old bed and the people here are kind
I get the urge to call you and put it from my mind

And your little sister don't you love your sister
And who would believe you
Just a little girl with a big imagination
Everyone knows me I'm an important man

I get ready for school
My hair is brushed and pulled tight in a bow
But I am dirty I am dirty
Mommy puts on my coat
Red and purple blotches up and down my legs
She won't look at me she won't look at me

I will run to the park
I will climb on the swing
I will swing so high
Up above everything

On a silver chain I wear a pretty stone
A friend gave me to say she loves me
And to say I can love
And to say I am worthy of it
It is not easy it is not easy

Sometimes I scream
Sometimes I weep like the little girl
I never was I never was
I tell the story
Somebody stole my life but I'm taking it back
I can see colors I can see colors now

Tracing the truth through the tangle of lies
Forgiving myself what I did to survive

In the restless heat of sweat-stained sheets
We strain for love cry out for love

And every page is love
And pushed to shove we kill for love

Fred Small,"When the Klan came to Montana, they made no grand parade.
No hooded knights on horseback, no banners boldly raised.
Spray paint and bomb threats, a voice on the telephone line:
""Kill the niggers, kill the homos, Jew bitch die.""

Five-year-old Isaac woke screaming in the gloom.
""Mommy, there's a man at my window, looking into my room.""
""Son, there's nothing out there but the shadows branches make.""
The little boy went back to sleep, his parents lay awake.

For Isaac's bedroom window showed their faith for all to see
The candles of the menorah stood for hope and memory.
The next night, out of the darkness, a cinder block was hurled.
It shattered Isaac's window, and the boundaries of his world.

[Chorus]
One moment of conviction, one voice quiet and clear,
One act of compassion, it all begins here.
No safety now in silence, we've got to stand our ground.
No hate. No violence. Not in our town.

The cop was not unfriendly. He said, ""Ma'am, if I were you,
I'd take down that menorah, the Star of David, too.""
Isaac's mother Tammy said, ""I'm sure that's good advice.
But how then could I ever look my children in the eye?""

Then at their doorway a little girl did stand
A gift for her schoolmate in her outstretched hand.
A menorah drawn in crayon, from a Gentile to a Jew
It read, ""To Isaac, From Rebecca, I'm sorry this happened to you.""

[Chorus]

Have you seen the paper? Did you hear the news?
What kind of people are we? We thought we knew.
Can children primed in prejudice in peace together dwell?
If we look out through this shattered glass, do we see ourselves?

Margaret McDonald called her pastor on the phone.
""This time the Jews will not face their foes alone.
We'll make paper menorahs, display them from our homes.
We'll show the bigots there are more of us than they have stones.""

Volunteers printed up menorahs by the score.
Children in their Sunday schools colored hundreds more.
Grocers and dry cleaners gave out the design, singing:
What's a little broken glass when freedom's on the line?

Now in the town of Billings live not 100 Jews,
But menorahs now were everywhere, on every avenue.
Thousands upon thousands, in windows rich and poor.
When a neighbor stands in danger, we will not close our door.

Through the drifting snow, Tammy drove her children round
To see all the menorahs in the windows of the town.
""Are all those people Jewish?"" asked Isaac as they went.
""No,"" his mother answered, ""they are your friends.""

Everything from opera down to harmony

And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing

Fred Wesley,"You think that I don't feel love,
What I feel for you is real love.
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, born  in poverty,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, take a look at me.
 
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, by society,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, diff'rent from the rest.
Hold on, Whoa.
 
I started school in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out.
I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me.
Don't think I don't need you,
Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.
 
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, never quite as good,
(I'll always love you.)
Love Child, misunderstood.

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Seeing images in the firelight

Just how wonderful you are,

Knowing when to freeze and when to run
And regret is just a memory written on my brow
And there's nothing I can do about it now.

I've got a wild and a restless spirit
I held my price through every deal
I've seen the fire of a woman's scorned
Turn her heart of gold to steel

Freda Payne,"I used to be the apple of your eye
I had you with me every day,
But now whenever you are passing by
You're always looking the other way
It's little things like this
That prompt me to say:

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely presents you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything from
The five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own.
But after thinking it over and over,
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me.",You Turned the Tables on Me

It's my happy heart you hear, singing loud & singing clear 
& it's all because you're near me, my love 
Take my happy heart away; make me love you, make my day 
In your arms I want to stay, oh my love 

Feeling more & more, like I've never felt before 
You have changed my life so completely 
Music fills my soul now; I've lost all control now 
I'm not half, I'm whole now, with your love

Can't you hear my happy heart 
Oh oh please take my happy heart

Freda Payne,"Odds and ends of love that used to be
You're gone, but memories linger on
Odds and ends of what you meant to me
Love that we once knew, dreams that never quite came true

A tiny ring made of glass
Worth more to me than the world
A picture of you and me
When I was your special girl

An old teddy bear that's lost its hair
You won at the county fair
A redneck tie I bought for you
You never got around to wear

Momentoes of the love we shared
Reminders of the hurt I felt
Odds and ends of love that used to be
You're gone, but memories linger on
Odds and ends of what you meant to me
Love that we once knew, dreams that never quite came true

The easy chair, the robe you wore
When you came home at night
Your last pack of cigarettes
Your first old chewed-up pipe

The sound of a dripping faucet
You claimed that you repaired
The first dress you bought me
That I forced myself to wear

A little girl, a little boy too
Who constantly ask where are you
Odds and ends of love that used to be
Odds and ends, it wasn't meant to be

All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dream I hold

If you are still here with me

You took me from the shelter of a mother I had never known
Who loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom

Freddie Brocksieper,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Cause it's Bump takin' the lead
I'm not down with ya hypocrisy FUCK AROUND GET STOLEN
Cause I peal niggaz for greed
Stop grinnin' in a motherfucker face WHEN YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME
You get slapped the bitchy way
You can put a bunch of brawl in your voice BUT YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE ME
You get J stay with your way
If you beef without my two-aim PLEASE BE A THUG AND SIGN IT!
Cause it's day for you to hide
I put your body in a river N-why-P-D WON'T FIND IT

[Verse 2]
Bump bringin' you another selection FROM MY MAIN MAN PRIMO
To the heart forever plural
For blessin' hip hop with the one nigga PRODUCERS CAN'T SEE THOUGH
To the end should by our girl
If it takes me a lifetime to prove I'm THE NICEST MC
Then I'm down for every war
And if it ever get bigger than rap THEN I GET MY SHIT be	
Come on down, I'm holdin' fours
I hate to be pain in the ass CAUSE IT REALLY AIN'T LIKE ME
But I couldn't help but notice
You come into this game with a mask AND SNEAK AROUND LIKE WIFEY
And get popped like shooky sodas
Rap voters get Al Gored, which means low scores
On all the music awards
It's all good though, niggaz from the street DON'T SWEAT NO TROPHY
Cause it don't make you hot
Aiyyo Roy I'm the heavyweight champ of hip hop WALK LIGHTLY
Some of y'all must've forgot
Means nothing to me if another nigga got a Knuckle CAN TRUST ME
And I swear that forever
Cause I ever take a ass-whipping dude YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUST ME
Pretty much I'm sayin'; Whatever
See I punish MC's that come in with big dough
Cause I know they gonna pay they way right too slow
These Hollywood niggaz from the hood better know
I'm so ever soul forever flow
Always quick to they spine I'm never slow
I'm probably something you don't want to do, let it go
Basketball players, boxers, wrestlers
Don't take it personal cause I'll get the best of ya
Ask these sorry-ass RAPPERS
They know I'm so CRAZY

[Chorus]",Lazy!!!

And I'm allergic to a broke bitch
I think I need my medicine, I had to po' up 'fore I wrote this
And doing dirt will keep a nigga with a deep pocket
Dope fiends and the cluckheads keep shopping
Steady praying that the yayo keep clocking
Keep a strap 'cause the jackboys keep robbing

Chevy on 6s, them Forgiatos ain't ever scrubbing
Watch honeys run through 100 bottles like it was nothing
We leave the club with two foreign models, her and her cousin
Niggas say that we the brand new thug life
Washing dirty money with this mic, I wish it was right
Tell a song, sipping Perignon, fuck a Bud Light
Tony said the world is yours, only if you plug right
My God, when they bury me, pray my casket be solid gold
Funeral packed with a separate section for all my hoes
Most niggas choose it and lose it quickly, but I was chose
Cook it and sell it, my mama smell it up in my clothes
Betyour favorite rapper get extorted for his paycheck
Mask on my skull, they ain't identify my face yet
We sticking suckers up, I hope they sticking to the cheddar
You pussy niggas might be rich but you ain't rich forever

When we ride on our enemies
Never hide from our enemies

With them old-school Tommy gun extended clip

Should've known that them gangster niggas don’t trip
Flag swinging, me and Deep nigga, yeah we gangbanging
Bringing down the ashes if you niggas flaming
Aim for your dome, head shots, slug shots
Police put me throughout, 2-1 on my mugshot
Crazy-ass niggas, yeah we insane
Put the pistol in your mouth, blow out your brain
Bail out on eight million dollar bond
Soon as I hit the streets, nigga, it’s back on

Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder

When I finger fuck my .45
I hit a nigga right between his eyes
Pull out the heat, make him dance, and do the dougie
Before I blow the back of his shit out, it can get ugly
Yes, y'all, I put his cherry pie on the wall
When I ride on my enemies, niggas know it’s uncut and raw
Mr. Bossalini, you can try to stand guard
But niggas like me be going Taliban hard
I spit grenades and piss bullets
Eat a bitch nigga for breakfast when I aim and pull it
Doing wonders for this bread, I Pillsbury these motherfuckers
When his doughboy die with the heat, I carry in my clutches
I’m a natural born rider, like my nigga Freddie Gibbs

When I first jumped off the porch older niggas tried to play me, but I got
Big balls, big paws on a small puppy
Now I'm the big dog and you mutts ain't got nothing for me
Fresh out the guts, most niggas fear it, few niggas love it
Just give me my motherfucking money
Cause all I got is

Straight killa, no filla
No sipping for a ho
Ain't taking shit from no nigga
I came up in the fingers with jackers and dro dealers

Hit 'em for the muhfuckin weight but I got my face sliced up by some mexicans, Muhfuckas bout they luda, stab and shoot ya for them presidents
Cause ever since we was toddlers, we knew that we needed dollars
Tryna live off illegal product, yeah the shit they don't teach in college
Most niggas don't need no products, these corners is all they know
My homie 16 and won't see daylight till he 64
That's just how we livin' though, with limited opportunity
Twisted of reefer, parents and teachers could not get through to me
My nigga pimp was schoolin' me, put me up on the game
Don't think with your dick, but make ya bitch keep yo dick on the brain
Since then I been on it mane, and ain't thought about lookin' back
When push come to shove you can't be no pushover pushin' packs
So bitch what you lookin' at? Keep them eyeballs to the floor

He thought I was there to purchase 10, but I robbed him for 90 more
Now I'm 100 solid, bout to set up shop in Wisconsin
Grabbed my phone and chirped my plug in Milwaukee, he just responded
Homie told me sex, money and drugs, they rule the earth
So get your own, you know them thangs good as gone when they touch the turf
Destined to pay for my dirt, the resist of temptation was hard
So be a thug from your birth til you face to face with your god

Baptized in a lake of fire, so this how hell feel

Made a little change and they forgot that you barely made it

When there ain't shit twerkin, niggas get murked in this life of mine
And I took some hits on some niggas, never knew what they did
Never considered they momma, they family or they kid
Loaded up my sig, got a pint of gin and I took a swig
Bout to go knock his ass off the map cuz I'm on my dick

Niggas die for money and bitches
What I embody is so ungodly, god is my witness
Emotions froze, I'm so cold on every bitch on my team
A rolling stone, I move on like it's a daily routine
I used to have this bitch that had me twisted
Used to get drunk at the club and call me for random visits
She stumbled into my door and I smashed her in the kitchen
Yes she get rough when we sexing, flexing in all positions
Whispered and I often listened, she got a nigga at home
Not quite at home, he took a pitch and since ‘06 he been gone
She say she grown, she pay her bills and raise her kid on her own
Plus he touch down in a few days, I should just leave her alone
But it's that devil on my shoulder, telling me to come over
3am I hit the gas in my Chevy, blowin on doja
Got me stuck and I can't understand
Why I can't notice, I'm so bogus cause I know her man
I guess I'm dead wrong

Money and bitches make the world spin
Fucking with you can make my world end
How I get caught up in this whirlwind?
Dead wrong, fucking my homeboy's girlfriend
Fuckin my homeboy's girlfriend
But it's your homeboy's girlfriend
Fuckin my homeboy's girlfriend
Lovin my homeboy's girlfriend

I wish I had the nuts to tell you this
While you was locked away in jail I was out here nailing your bitch
I even helped out with the house note, the car payments and shit
I never thought about our friendship, I just thought with my dick
And I was dead wrong, on bogus shit from the start
Cause of this lust in my mind, I carried this guilt in my heart
I be so weak to let a piece of pussy peel us apart
If you found out about this shit, might twist your feelings in knots
Speaking of feelings, I caught em
Big bag of dreams and I bought em
Visions of me and her stuck on an island hideaway balling
Sometimes I don't return her calls and pray one day she be off it
But yo it seems like since he came home, she been calling more often
Damn..guess she addicted to the way I treat her
Because she right back at my doorstep everytime that he beat her
Fussing and crying saying baby I need you, why you ignore me?
Testing me, stressing me, how dare she question my loyalty?
Damn

Niggas die for money and bitches
Trying to stay occupied, so I stay out there fucking bitches
But my affairs with this woman was extremely indecent
Truth is my homie got every right to come leave me leaking
Woke up with my phone on fire
Twenty, thirty missed calls
Called him back, he picked it up and I could tell he pissed off
He told me, bitch nigga, you see me, walk the other way
No room for explanation, just jump straight into pistol play
All them years we go back just got flushed down the toilet
Might lose my life behind this bitch, but man I just can't afford it
Whole situation could have been avoided
I wonder what went through his head when he picked up that loaded pistol and pointed
Like damn, if I can't have you in life, I guess I'll have you in death
Finished her off with 3 shots and turned the fifth on himself
Was it really love or did we both all fall for a sleazy broad?
Killed his girl and spared my fucking life, who had the deeper bond?

You put me in my own world, make a niggas toe curl, like a real girl supposed to do
Plus I must admit I get sad when you away
I just can't live this life without you, I can't get through my day
One summer we had to break up cause you couldn't deal with the heat
Everybody in the hood wanna say that you a stone cold freak
They hit it last week, but I don't listen to a peep

Gotta switch up flavors and colors, she accessorize
On the real, if you came as a meal, I would lick you fresh off the plate
Woke up this morning, brushed my teeth and kissed you fresh out the gate
Yeah Ima fool for you, let them niggas hate
When I don't bring you 'round my homies say I'm handcuffing
Fuck em, they straight, they straight
They know you stay on deck

To set up for my next lick
In the Chevy, about to roll up the stress, with a Tec
And what he got on his neck, got him a death wish
It's kinda funny cause he used to be my nigga tho
We was breaking bread, flipping bricks like a year ago
Shit can get into a nigga's head when his digits low
Make you wanna send one of your friends to his funeral
Maybe me and him was never friends in the first place
Don't mean a thing cause we share the same birthplace
Same city, same hood, but we down to kill each other for a dollar
Cause we want it in the worst way
Money talk and bullshit gon walk a marathon
And I ain't scared of getting killed cause I'm getting mine
And if they ever try to raid, I'mma hit the fuckin pigs with the K's
I ain't tryna do a lick of time
Spend all my last money, the bills too high
His jewelry, his whip game, the wheels too fly
I'm thinking about murder every time we cruise by
Heard he got like 84 elbows of blue fire
In the basement, muthafuckas still think basic
Thinkin' I'mma show up and erase 'em, but I ain't gonna chase 'em
I'mma be up in his crib waiting
""Bitch where the cash? I can taste it""
Put em on their faces: what you know about kidnapping
And holding a nigga's whole family for ransom?
When your stomach empty it's easy to understand it
Got me out here taking them penitentiary chances
""Born in this world of tears, will die laughing""
Put that on the headpiece right above my casket
Still in the game, my batteries still lastin
Bout to put some gas up in my Caprice Classic, and...

Rob me a nigga
Rob me a, rob me a nigga
Bills too high, this nigga right here too fly
Right now I just might rob me a nigga

As I look at the charm, thinking of a strong arm
Seen his watch as he reachin for his car alarm
Bet this hundred round drum pussy nigga thinkin twice
Fore he try to run, shots spit, and the cops come
All they seen was my golds and a black mask
Throw the car round the corner, tinted up with no tags
All these niggas wanna flash, Ima put it to they ass
With the K out, ask a nigga, “Where da sack at?""
Give it here, you wanna die for that rolex?
You can either get your life or that watch back
Ima shoot you point blank, I’m just hoping you think
You can take it as a loss, you can get it back

I’m leave you there, do you, that’s how the shit go
Just another episode, A-K explode
In his head, left a smoke hole
Be a shamed if you died over fake shit
But that’s a lesson, if you out here on some fake shit
Come and robbin everyday, know the young nigga hungry
They be murkin for a quarter brick
Know they kill a whole fam for the whole thang
All the shooters up in Gary on the same thang
All the little homies strapped, so they look plain
Gun shots rang out, nigga, see flames
We be takin so much, now the shit fun
We be lookin for your shit fore your shit come

Or be the one to rob a nigga

There's something about a broad that like to suck her thumb
She on my shoes like a piece of gum (When she know you not)
She know I'm not the two, I'm the one (I'm the one)

Man, I'll stay on point like icicle
Niggas can't decode, or figure my rhyme riddles
Took my money to the source and said fuck the man in the middle
Talkin' hard, soft, heroin, green, that's what we had boy
Erica was the bag lady, I was the bag boy
Option was that minimum wage, live in a cage
Buildin' a prison everyday, man they cultivatin' these slaves
In this new age
Dude's wage is fugaze
I'm the whole gallon and half pint like school days
I been killin' 'em since Kool Moe Dee, Ra, Cool, Face

Yeah, nigga
And if the devil die today, I'mma treat it like it's a holiday
Bout the Michael Jackson, beat it, I mean it, I got a powder day
And nothin' funny, but I play with the money like it's Monopoly
And if the devil die today, I'mma treat it like it's a holiday

I used to lay in bed starin' at the ceilin' fan
Feelin' cramps, wishin' I could get a killer gram
Tryna understand why I wanna kill a man
With high hopes like rubber tree, plants, and ants
We cheat death with each breath
The only one who make it last forever is Keith Sweat
You ever see a body lyin' dead in the streets yet
Then eat breakfast?
Swallow forced beliefs like police justice
If my city is like yours then cereal scratch
Fingerprints is wiped off
If people seem to always have somethin' to fight for
But still end up in the state pen or the psych ward
It's lights off
They catch so many casualties it's like war
That's the reason I don't believe in the hype y'all
The devil talkin' bout he wanna extradite y'all
Now I'm the nigga they shinin' the search light for

I got thousand dollar jeans on my ass cheek

How that make me look if I don't help her get up on her feet?
She keep a different nigga, now she end up pregnant every week
I pray you take these devils out our life, lord
That's our vice, lord
Baby momma's come with the drama, made her my wife lord
Lord know I'm goin' hope you see I'm trying to do right, lord
Shake 'em up and blowin' the dice

Yo, my memoirs are like the Anarchist's Cookbook
Meets the time, fall, spring, summer look book
Some people wanna see me hanging from a good hook
Instead I hang with a language and slang in the anguish
And pain fit as well, cause it came with us
After all these years carrying this shame with us
Now the entire planet is going insane with us
Seven year old kids carrying flame spitters
Fortified fences, mortify senses
Crossfire miss my little daughter by inches
Chemical dependence, medical expenses
But no amount of money on earth can buy vengeance

Must have sowed a whole O up
And you stuck it out with me, I love you like a brother
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't have a record deal or nothing

I got a shorty that's willing to sell it for me
She my lover, my homie, the devil cursed me with a pimp hand
I hope my daughter never lives this type of lifestyle
Creeping under street lights as a night child
My uncle still can't put the liquor or the pipe down
Meanwhile I'm in this kitchen whipping up the while gal
Plus I got addictions of my own, boy
The pills into laced blunts got me gone, boy
The Oxycontin and heavy syrup got me looking in the mirror saying
""Is you a dope fiend or a dope boy?""
Smoking on some shit that I can't pass to a nigga
Eyes shiny than a bitch, glass to a nigga
Down to kick in the door, .44 Mags to a nigga
Got some habits I pray that I never pass to a nigga
All about the dollar signs, fuck the sympathy
And fuck police cause' they killing you and killing me
Slanging and banging, my paper stay getting fatter
So do black lives matter when you're about to kill your enemy?
I need to know it, drop that paper boy don't be heroic
You'll get a trip to see your Jesus if you're reaching for it

Already it's heaven and we've barely met
And you haven't started loving me yet

For she's really not the cook I know she'd like to be
Oh but a smile across the table says I love you
And I thank the Lord that she belongs to me

Was the very same gal he robbed and stole
For name in her wedding day for name in her wedding day

As he looked at the wall so strong and tall I could hear him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first I'm gonna be the first

There ain't no doubt they will carry you out

An old guitar hung on the wall that wore Hank Williams' name
As I stood and wondered what a sight to see
I'll swear I heard Hank's old guitar start to talk to me

My friend you're looking at old lonely soul
While these mem'ries locked inside of me that's worth much more than gold
Oh we were closer than friends could ever be
Everything we did we did together in perfect harmony
I would remember one night up in a hotel room
To look upon his face you'd thing that his whole world was doom
But as I stood there in the corner I could see
That a song would soon be born tonight oh he reached his hand for me

And he held me like a man would hold his girl
I was a closest thing to him in his lonely world
I could fill a story begging of release
That night we wrote Your Cheatin' Heart another masterpiece

Yeah we wrote so many songs just like this
And we're proud to know that we gave to world just a little more happiness
Hank told me just before he went away
Oh buddy I'd like to take you with me but this time you will have to stay

Still I can hear Hank's old guitar crying all in vain
Like a child has lost I heard its mournful cry

Come to me baby I'm a one woman man

Now won't you love me baby just to kinda hang around
I'll always love you honey, I'll never let you down
Never love another even if I can
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man

Come to me baby I'm a one woman man
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man

Freddie Hubbard,"From moment to moment, every moment that I live
I live for every moment with you
To see you, to touch you, to imagine this will be
The moment when a dream comes true

Just an ordinary day becomes adventure
Such sweet adventure I never knew
And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you

Just an ordinary day becomes adventure
Such sweet adventure I never knew
And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you

Freddie Hubbard,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Freddie Hubbard,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

You're the only one that really knows
Maybe you'll be surprised after your search is through
When you find you've just been chasing you

Believe me, I understand
The vision of your mind
But I'm so afraid that the girl you'll find
May not need a man like me

I don't wanna lose you
I love you as you are
I don't wanna lose you
I couldn't love you more, more

Tell me, love will remain
Though we may change

I really think that you have little faith in me
You're the only one I'll ever need
If you really understand how much you mean to me
All your doubts would fade and disappear

Maybe you'll never find
The secrets of your mind
But you've got to try that I realize
And I'll help you all I can

I don't wanna lose you
I love you as you are
I don't wanna lose you
I couldn't love you more, more

When she would leave without good-bye, yes, sir.

So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee,

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother.

You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite,

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Let me prove that it adores

Content to stargaze at the skies.

I remember one jazz club
Where we went to pat feet
Down on 52nd Street

That they named it after Bird
Where the rythym swooped and swirled
The jazz corner of the world
And the cats they gigged in there

When I think back on, on the good times
That I shared with you, Janay
Oh, it makes me sad 'cause you're somewhere else
There is nothing I can do, Janay

Memories floatin' my mind seems like yesterday
It chills up and down my spine
How can I go on feeling this way?
How can I go on another day?

Janay, Janay, how could something so right go so wrong?
Janay, how could I let your beauty slip away?

Has nothing to do with me

And the world you used to love so much?
Can you help me out? Can we work it out?

Look around and you're gonna see
Just look around, baby
No one's gonna love you like me

Freddie Jackson,"There's something that I want to say 
But words sometimes get in the way

I love you so

You're everything I need and more 
You are my lady 
You're all I'm living for 

There's no way that I can resist

So hypnotized 
Just say that you'll stay with me 
'Cause our love was meant to be 
I promise to love you

Freddie Jackson,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last",Save the Best for Last

Freddie King,"Living on the Highway            L Russell/D Nix

It was twenty years ago, I was about fourteen years old,
When I first heard that Wolfman's howl.
He sneaked me through the door, there was whisky on the floor, 
And the fuzz they were on the prowl
 It seems so long ago,
I'm living on the Highway now

He's a giant of a man, He always understands 
The very best notes to use
His hand make two of mine, his heart beat right on time
He taught me how to sing the blues
He's the reason why I choose to live on the highway now

I played the blues with Walter, and Muddy pulled me through
I know a Jimmy Rogers song or two
But there's one thing I know, no matter where I go
I can do a little howling too
That's why I sing these blues, I'm living on the highway now

The years have come and gone but the blues still go on
I only sing my songs for fun
If you ask me to, I'll do a song for you,
'Cause the women like to see me come
Me and my guitar,  my band, we're living on the highway now",Living on the Highway

Seekin' my fame and fortune, lookin' for a pot of gold

Rode in on the Greyhound, I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through, must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my
Friends
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans
Fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar, for every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play while people sat there
Drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live

Like the tears that fall from my eyes 
As I sit in my room

When the sun used to shine on my back door 
Now the sun is turned to rain 
All my laughter is turned to pain
Yes it's the same, the same old blues
 
Sunshine, sunshine is all you see now
But it all, it all looks like clouds by me

Freddie McGregor,"She didn't bat an eye, as I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would cry, or sit around my room and grieve
But oh the girl she fooled me this time
Acting like I was the last thing on her mind 
Now I'd like to start all over again
I just want to change my mind

As I took those steps, toward that open door
Knowing all the time, oh Lord I just didn't wanna go
She didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me wanna change my mind
And I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
'Cause I would like to change my mind

You know, I was confused, sitting here by myself thinking
watching you walk to the door and walk away
what was I supposed to say change your mind

Oh I've played my game so many times before
But people let me tell y'all, that I never reached the door
Oh the wind it is high tonight 
I keep lookin' for my baby but she's not in sight 
And I would like to start all over again

I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood. 

Til all this black on black crime stop. 

Some say the blind lead the blind. 

But in the ghetto you never know  

When it's gon be yo time. 

[Sons of Funk  Mo B. Dick  O'dell] 

Sittin at the ghetto thinkin bout 

All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!) 

Candy painted cadillacs and triple gold 

That's how me and my boys rolled 

How could it be? 

Somebody took my boy from me 

My best friend's gone 

And I'm so all alone 

I really miss my homies 

Even though they gone away 

I know you in a better place 

And I hope to see ya soon someday 

[Master P] 

I used to hang with my boy even slang with my boy 

Used to bang with my boy, goddam I miss my boy 

We started out youngstas in the park throwin birds 

In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt 

The game got me workin, got me perkin, never jerkin 

Still blowin dolja fo ya cause I know you up there workin 

Ya little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight 

But today's a sad day to see the t-shirt with ya face 

From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall 

In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall 

In the projects you's a legend on the street you was a star 

But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin in that black car 

A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried 

You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire 

Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain 

Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change 

Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall 

The ghetto persons that lost they loved ones to these ghetto scandals 

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!) 

Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli) 

All my homies who done made it to the crossroads 

(Biggie Smalls) 

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell] 

How could it be? 

Somebody took my boy from me 

(It's like I can't believe you gone) 

My best friend's gone 

(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on) 

And I'm so all alone 

(Everytime I see something you done left 

I really miss my homies 

(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg)

(I just keep reminiscin) 

I know you in a better place

[Pimp C] 

We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys 

But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy 

Off in the club smokin weed til 3, hollerin at the hoes 

Spendin $4000 on me on gators and clothes 

When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game 

Nigga told me, ""see, leave that dope, cause rappin is yo thang"" 

I ain't gone even lie, some nights I ride and cry 

Wonderin why the real niggas always the ones to die 

So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind 

I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time 

I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs 

For all the niggas in the game that be sellin ki's 

I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong 

But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone 

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell] 

Even though you gone away 

(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon be forgotten) 

I know you in a better place

You gon live through me and other TRU playas)

I'm just sittin here dazed thinkin bout all the times we had 

Thinkin the past, some was good and some was bad 

Remember Dante? 

It was a group of us, just a group of five 

Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive 

To all my soldiers before me, may ya'll rest in peace 

When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies 

He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me 

Wishin I could rewind time like demos 

Me and you gettin girls, writin down numbers like memos 

Makin million dollar bets, makin all our money stretch like limos 

Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry 

But if I close my eyes and visualize me together 

Then I suddenly want to smile 

To see you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up 

You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us 

Even though you was wrong, I never could belive that that was true 

You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos 

See me and see and P forever gon be ridin and thuggin 

Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it 

And rest in peace to my brother 

We gon miss you 

(I love these fools) 

I know you in a better place 

(Every time I get on my knees) 

And I hope to see ya soon someday

I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin

Material ambition that her gentleness disguised
She gave herself to him certain of his fame
Wanted him for luxury for limelight and his name

That sweep into my soul
That slowly take control

I love you for your fire

That burns me in it's flame

His rise was irresistible - yeah, he grew into the part
His explanation simply that he suffered for his art
No base considerations of some glittering reward
The prize was knowing that (his work) his work was noticed and adored

Freddie Mercury,"When all the salt is taken from the sea
I stand dethroned
I'm naked and I bleed
But when your finger points so savagely
Is anybody there to believe in me
To hear my plea and take care of me?

How can I go on
From day to day
Who can make me strong in every way
Where can I be safe
Where can I belong
In this great big world of sadness
How can I forget
Those beautiful dreams that we shared
They're lost and they're no where to be found
How can I go on?

Sometimes I tremble in the dark
I cannot see
When people frighten me
I try to hide myself so far from the crowd
Is anybody there to comfort me
Lord...take care of me

How can I go on
From day to day
Who can make me strong in every way

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart

You are the one for me, I am the man for you
You were made for me, you're my ecstasy

Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream, and my dreams come true

Freddie Mercury,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember","Goin' Back [Larru Lurex, 1973 B-Side]"

Do I see

Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When youre in love, my how they fly

All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you

We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you

Then I went far away

And you found someone new
I read your letter dear
And I wrote back to you

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
Good luck God bless you too

Is that your little girl
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too

Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""

Turn around I’ll be following you, when you need someone to care
And you need a love to share, turn around I’ll be following you
Turn around I’ll be walking behind you, with a love that’s true and never ever die
Maybe someday honey you’ll see, that this love was meant for only me

Freddy Fender,"Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind 
For you don't belong to me
You heart belongs to someone else
 
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue
 
Don't you remember the day 
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely 
Prayed for you only, my love

Why should I keep loving you 
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

It must go to someone of course

I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And there was even postage due

And then it had to be with you

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.","I've got you under my skin, song (from the film ""Born to Dance"")"
Frederick Fennell,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night","In the still of the night, song (from ""Rosalie"")"
Frederick Fennell,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me

I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Fredrika Stahl,"She can't sleep at night, still on the hunt for her four leaf clover
Through her tunnel sight she seeks out the chances left over
She can't waste time with so much left to do
Ease was a ticking bomb, dreams the target that it blew up
Now it's pulling her down

She walks a tightrope race over slopes so steep
Where the light keeper seems to have fallen asleep
Can't they see she'll never get where they expect her to be
She walks a tightrope race over slopes so steep
While the light-keeper seem to have fallen asleep
Can't they see she'll never get where they expect her to be

I can't sleep at night, a sense of peace and my body shivers
She can't sleep at night, it's under her skin like a thousand slivers
Cause I can't waste time with so much left to do
Ease was a ticking bomb, dreams the target that it blew up
Now it's dragging me down

Where the world I once knew is now falling apart
Can't she see I'll never get where she expect me to be

Fredrika Stahl,"Indifference
The lack of lust that keeps you alive
The loss of the flame that helps you survive
The state in which nothing really matter(s)
When the sound of your voice gradually gets flatter
Determination,
The time you know what's to be done
When you've set the goal and start to run
When you're willing to give more than all
And to get back up if ever you fall
Confusion,
A lack of knowledge, a weakness of mind
A vulnerable state where your directions are blind
The moment you would grab any stretched hand
The time you could loose your strongest band
Hapiness,
When you have a million reasons to live
And at least a thousand things to give
Those precious moments you wish never to stop
The candy with cream on the top
This is just a fraction of what's happening inside
But you ought to know your words and my feelings coincide",A Fraction of You

To a random destination
Living the present
Without a single obligation
Willing to grab
Whatever the future will propose
And prepared to fight
Whatever it may oppose

To start a new verse
I'm not the only
Passenger on this train
A dozen of us trying
To break the chain
Scared about leaving
A comfortable life
Some even dropping
Their home and wife

Probably a 430 drop, ruthless, wit buggy eyes
What if Red and Meth freestyled and battled on stage?
What if Daz had bald head and Onyx had braids?
What if history was changed? Slavery reversed
Would black ladies see white boys and clench they purse?
What if Diallo Dege is shot, 41 times?
What if the kids was popular that went to Columbine?
What if Ewing would have dunked it, instead of fading away?
The Knicks woulda been the champs, he wouldnta got traded away

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

I feel the touch of paradise
Far away from home
The world is mine

Every night we play this game
Sing with us and call our name
I like it, you like it, we like it

Far, far, far away
On the road, no time to stay

Freedom Call,"They tell me things that I don't understand
So many things that twist my mind
I learned to follow, I learned to obey
I learned believing every word they say

I wake up crying at the dead of night
I feel as helpless as a lonely child

Free world of innocence, far beyond the skies
Where freedom and innocence await
Free world of innocence, no more tears and lies
Children so innocent

I see the craziness spreads everywhere
My mind is lame I feel a deep despair
No time for grace, no time for charity
I have to function like a cold machine

I wake up crying at the dead of night
I feel as helpless as a lonely child

Free world of innocence, far beyond the skies
Where freedom and innocence await
Free world of innocence, no more tears and lies
Children so innocent

Freedom Call,"A distant noise, a silent stream
I'm standing all alone
Surrounded by the empty space
We're roaming through the galaxies

We're pioneers, we search for land
We ride the universe
Will we find survival there?
To create a better world

I see a light, a sign of hope
A virgin paradise
I will call for you, my destiny
To set my spirit free

We are the children of a dying paradise
Come and follow us to the glorious land
We're on our journey to a kingdom far beyond
You will follow us, the way to heaven's end

A tender voice, a silent dream
An unknown mystery
My memories are haunting me
A flash of past and history

I can't foretell, I can't foresee
No one knows what's there
Happiness or tragedy
Time will tell and we will see

I see a light, a sign of hope
A virgin paradise
I call for you, my destiny
To set my spirit free

We are the children of a dying paradise
Come and follow us to the glorious land
We're on our journey to a kingdom far beyond
You will follow us, the way to heaven's end

Here I stand alone, there's silence everywhere
Neon lights throw moving shadows on the wall
A lonely dreamer, in my memories I recall
No one hears my silent cry

A distant world, a mystery
Far beyond the skies
I will call for you, my destiny
To end this misery

We are the children of a dying paradise
Come and follow us to the glorious land
We're on our journey to a kingdom far beyond
You will follow us, the way to heaven's end

Screams of pain and agony
Rend the silent air
A flash of past and history
All I feel is a deep despair

Pain is my reality
I'm suffering alone
My memories are haunting me
Revelation, prophecy

He was seen in a damaging light
Picking popcorn from his tooth
Ordering cocktails with his eyes

Spitting out straight abuse
Vocabulary of a broken marquee
And a wit she couldn't use

At least try to look pretty
Tonight we're going into Tucumcari

Pulled a wet bill from his shoe
Wrinkling a dignified face
By the broken heart shaped pool

With a boy from the Trouble Tree Bar
Snapping her jeans while the radio sings

Left my money in a Maxwell's coffee can

Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Was born to be a child of voodoo
Do as I do, follow and move you
To the rhythm blues with a blue-r curse
Sunken in rib cage, a point blank range
Blow from a twelve gage, better get him a nurse
Split second too late, brown hearse
Right door second, left door first
I noticed my flaw in a plan
Everything was rehearsed
Two knocks on the door, but they did everything twice
Received the device, two pairs of latex gloves
A scalpel, a rich knife
Looked at each other and said let's get it on
Strapped the body down, checked the temperature
To see if it was warm
Stick man sculpture on front side
Skin splits in two, reveal insides
Now it was a homicide
As it drove away, I heard bullets ricochet
And a hell of a skid marks left from the six tray

And we can roam, we can roll in my six tray

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Chilly be
And I'm a surefire, full blooded bonafide house rockin' Jam-On Production MC
If you want the best, put me to the test, and I'm sure you'll soon agree
That I got no force 'cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see
'Cause when I was a little baby boy my mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like Dolymite
Time went by, on this God creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam On Production Crew
So go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy
I said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy
'Till the sure-shot beat chills you to the bone 'cause Chilly B is on the microphone
'Till your mind is floatin like you're in a dream and you feel so good that you gotta scream
(Jam on it) jam on it, jam on an n on an on on an on
'Cause the beat don't stop 'till everybody's gone an that doesn't happen 'till the break of dawn
Clean out your ears and you open your eye, if you want to hear the music just come alive
If you don't know how get ready to learn
'Cause Cozmo's takin' his turn to burn

Take the see and O and the Z
Then they add M-O and the freaky D
Add a funky beat, and then what do you see
It's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me
I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet
Without me rockin' it's incomplete
So rock this, y'all, rock that, y'all
Rock on and don't you dare stop
You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact
'Cause the Jam On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomo ride off the track
And give the whole wide world a funk attack
A to the beat y'all, get down
Let me rock it to the rhythm of the funk sound
From hill to hill, from sea to sea
A when Jam On's rockin' everybody screams
(Jam on it) jam on it, jam on and on, on and on it
And if you're feelin' like you want to dance all night
They go on ahead and flaunt it
'Cause jammin' on is what we do best
It's what separates us from the rest
And if you go deep, I'll cruise down for real
Let me tell what happened to the man of steel

(Said Superman had come to town to see who he could rock)
(He blew away every crew he faced until he reached the block)
(His speakers were three stories high with woofers made of steel)
(And when we boys sit outside, he said I boom for real)
He said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set
I don't need no fans to cool my amps, I just use my super breath
I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat
I socialize with X-ray eyes, and ladies think it's sweet
(And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move)
(And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove)
(And just when he had fooled the crowd and swore he wouldn't fight)
We rocked this bet with a 12 inch cut called Disco Kryptonite
Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, you rock so naturally
I said now that you've learned to deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real
I'm Cozmo D from outer space, I came to rock the human race
I do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong
That's why the whole world is singin' this song

(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
As days turn to night and night turns to day
Whatever time it is I want to hear you say
(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam on-on-on, jam on it
Jam all around and upside down
And keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound

(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control
With a sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul
(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
Get outta your seat and jam to the beat
And don't you dare stop till early mornin'

Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it

(Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo)
(You were right, kid, that's the way you do it)
(Yeah, like did you see when he went in the corner)
(And he started doin' this)
(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)
(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)

(Ah, man, this is too funky for me)
(I'm goin' home)
(Hey, Mergatroid, let's go)
(Hey, you fellas seen my sister Mergatroid)
(She was standin' over here just a minute ago)
(Yeah, I think I saw her over there with Randy)

And we doing it back and forth roll with a gang of thugs
My burner my hood passport fresh from the airport I'm back again
And I clap your men; I'm from a block where niggas might blast your pops
No chance ambulance can't save your kin; smoke reefer burn reefer
Chill in my spot instead of making selat drink liters of gin
I'm drunk again I'm high again I just might fly a kite
To my niggas up state knocked off in the pen
They booked in a jail; I'm booking a flight
It's fucked up last year we was all on the block

Must be out his mind let the rugger spray
Clap until we alright all out of dodge (alright)

Check on the war report; check on the stores we bought (yeah)

This dedicated to my niggas that grind from ten to ten
In other words all day duck the cops 'cause they want to be free

And he lose a couple pounds and his skin get pale
And he's sittin in his cell til his patience gone, you know
Freeway be feelin your pain, I got twelve homies doin the same
And if they had bail, homey, they'd be out
But they don't so they sittin for a minute
That's the price of the game when you in it
Your freedom get strippin away

My man Black hit they wheel with the K, spun it around
Same day cops book em guess who send kites to em, nigga?

Shootin out with Free you gon' need a four leaf

And leave niggas killas leakin like Aunt Jemima
Fuck what ya man think that nigga gone but he ain't Free
Gimme the kees, y'all niggas is bitchin
Package it up, I'm out with the breeze
In and out of lanes until I get where I'm goin

Not payin attention, lunchin, gripped by the deez
Gotta be on point movin ya work by them benches
That's how I got my change, fam
Ain't a damn thang free in this world but your boy got a mean plan
To get my team out the ghetto with my boys in stilettos til we rich man
I'mma play Joe Clark when it's hardly norm
Free!  Whether the coupe on F or coupe on E
I can get ya chick on E
See through her dress, get the address
Give her the F, pass her to E
They say the best things in life are free, but I can't tell
I gotta pay for all the food that I take in
And gotta pay for all the chronic that I inhale
That's why I stick with my team, nigga, stick with my men
y'all dudes freelance, play for any team
Don't stand for nothin then you fall for anything
Turn on your voice soon as you get any cheers
But it's cool, beat downs with bats and spiked chains are free
Gettin played and haters screamin my name ain't me
Gettin paid and changin the game is me
That's why I keep a gatt in the tuck
That rip through ya bean, y'all niggas mad 'cause y'all ain't Free
Look, I focus and aim, listen to bull
One verse can fuck up the game
Kick in a door, icier chain
Clean up ya kids, hook up ya bulls but gotta work hard 'cause it ain't free
Used to get work hard couldn't cook soft

Rowdy lil youngin', was the snotty nosed youngin'
Everybody lil youngin'

They only youngin' out huggin' that pavement
For paper, and was shoveling pavement for neighbors
I never made it to them 5 on 5's(Uh!)
They was playin' live, I was tryin' stay live!

Tryin' to stay alive!
Moms workin' 11:30 to curfew, I was tryin' to stay til' 5
Hopin' the corners stay alive, while I'm killin' it
Can't stop me before the day I'm robbed

I'll be coppin' again
So fuck a day job while I'm feelin' it
They ain't stoppin me
Straight from the center to ""State Property""(UH!)

Now she wish that she could sleep with him (sleep with him)
Take a stroll with him

Roll with him (with him)
And turn to a freak on him
Ain't have no patience with him when the ceilin leaked on him
Creeped on him
But I'm a boss baby you crossed the line

He was known for shootin' the hoops up
Little hustle nigga grind (grind)
To get his jeans and boots up
At the summer league game D game rough
And the summer heat had ya'll niggaz feelin' like ya'll so damn tough
Wrong words, couple of shoves, park full of hoes
Had his hands all in your mug
How could you roll with pride in your way
You drove with your .38 to the place where he stay
Said, ?say hi to the pearly gates and scrolls.?
Now I pop beers reminisce with your bro
You can't make it to the show
And niggaz make it to the jail
Shed a tear

[Chorus: Freeway]
When you hear the song
Will you cry (it's fucked up man)
Cause you know you wrong(how you go out then you locked up)

Cause you know your wrong (but I got one more person to address)
Will you cry (I ain't forget about you ol' girl, I remember)

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Oh look
Who could it be, Ms. Lee
You know this nigga ain't kiddin'
Think harder, Freeway L. Pridgen
Shit you used to tell me make me want to work harder
At gettin' crack spots sent me to prison
Said I'm never gonna be a thang
So I listened and skipped school
Had them thing distributed
Fuck class, on the block all day
My science was choppin', baggin', dividin', addin', the math
How my teacher gonna tell me I'm dumb
Had me feelin' like a sore thumb
Clown of the class (uh)
I got graded most hated with guns
But now I made it to the life
Couldn't make it to the class
If this nigga chew your ear
That's an oh for you to hear
Kiss my ass!

[Chorus: Freeway]
When you hear the song

It's that real street shit
[Incomprehensible] they're ready for this one, nigga
Ooh shit ohh

I came up with my man, same hood, same age
Withheld names to protect the guilty and
Your boy, Free was filthy, same clothes, different day
Be the first to admit it, while niggaz claim to be willies, hey

We cleaned up the first Donny I drove
We cooled up the first tommy I seen, follow the flow
Smoke a timmy, with this semi, made his chimney move
Nerves made his body shake, everybody froze

So young with a pump and a mac
But still manage to make it the magic, the bad kids
On the block, with a bundle of crack, package of pills
All heads will try to teach us to rhyme

He said, ?Muhammed walk with a sword?, I roll with a gat
This the same shit, different day, from times
Now my man Book ain't writing me back
So I figured, try to reach 'em with rhymes, no listen to Mac

We thuggin' for life gonna take it
And then enough ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

To all my boys in the hood, the East Coast throw boy back
From the land of them throw boys black
I keep my toast in the hood, gon' squeeze
Hope you throw yours back come to the streets
To bring my homeboys back

Blew my mind out this piece, but I'm always back
I got sheet in my air, like mac, fall away back
Shit, I'm trynna come way up
And make the path so freak, I tear the runaway up

My life a bitch with a period on
But still I keep it real, dog, I'm hittin' it raw
And I don't know how to carry this bitch
Sometime I wanna marry this bitch

Sometimes I feel like quitting this whore
But I can't 'cause it feel like, giving it all
I've been on so fucking much, feel like my living was all
But in my lifetime, I'm a deliver regrets
Still with the evils, know that one day I'ma sit with the boss

We thuggin' for life gonna take it
And then enough ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

It's not even close, we throw toast, sleep with ya gats
It's the worst of both hoods, holla at 'em Mac
Follow up exact with the Mac, and the V
Get back, if you happen to see, the Mac or Free, at where you be

I be where you at, I come where you live
The cat untuckle the gat, maneuver the thing
The Mac untuckin' a pump, removin' they wig, with ease
Hear the feds trynna ruin the boss Sieg'

'Fore they kill me like Cornbread, you be like Dial Lo
Before I'm stuck like Luima, I be up when you need it
And I'ma ride for you, lace up my sneakers, puffin' my reefer
Tuckin' my heater, duckin' your rounder

Tell 'em tricks they gonna die when I see 'em
Let 'em know my friend colt 45 trynna meet with they mind
But we keep drama, think, rhyme is the reason
And Freeway the reason that you tied up in pajamas

We thuggin' for life gonna take it
And then enough ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

Four door for the stick up boys if they want war
Fiends comin' all night all I heard was four more

When it was jumpin' me and Rell hit dances
You could pick me out the crowd rockin' the cap
But things change
'Cause my man Rell fightin' a body
On state row where it's so cold
Rockin' his blues
I roll with the ROC
Still trynna rock at a show
Shit ain't like 98' niggaz pockets is low
Which way do I go?
Indictments blew over
Man whipped a few shoulders
Shovel nick boulders gettin' it slow
Me, I'm in the studio switchin' the flow
Changin' the styles
My son and daughter need pampers
'Cause they just shittin' them up
And changin' the size

See the change in his eyes

Just grab four and a half get it outta my trunk

Out to lunch - out on the block
These niggaz just pulled out on my man
And the only rock I worry bout is right on my face
We bout to go shake, rattle his block (shots) with no plans
Shots fired, cops came
But I'm a grown man
I stick around till my clip is empty
Cops threw me on the ground
When my clip got empty (shots)
Now bars is all I see a thug is all I'll ever be

Wrote him right back
Told him I control the bones

Leave that drug shit alone
Don't forget you grown
It'll put you places where your mind can't get you back from
Little nigga ain't write me back since

Rain...sleet, hail...snow man

Slang dough, E, hydro man...

[Beanie Sigel]
...no, B. Sige in the third lane
Gramps still prayin' workin on my nerves man...
Like, ""Son you gotta get your soul clean...
Before they blow them horns like Coltrane...""

But still I cry tears of a hustler
Wipe tears from my mother, pull out beers for her brothers...
That's above us, make beds for the babies
Tuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers

Shit I'll probably be wylin' with their fathers
Tell Ms. Robert, tell Enijah that I'm ridin' for her father
That's like my brother, like same mother different father
Any problems dog know I got 'em

And still we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom sold crack in the alleyways
Still gave back Marcy a Dollar Day
Real gangstas make hood holidays

They ain't thank us but we still paid homage mang
Soul Food Sunday lookin' like Big Momma's mang
Tell the gang I never break my promise mang... mang... unnh!",What We Do...
Freeway,"[Intro]
[Female Singing] You don't know
[Freeway - talking] Whoo..on the grind, uh, so gangsta, don't ya agree? uh
[Female Singing] You don't know
[Freeway - talking] This just in case why'all dunno how it go down in the hood
Freeweezy here to break it down to ya

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
Tryna to survive in the hood everyday
Takes, everything you work with
Everything you got quick
From the cops wyle off the product

Show em what helped a lot but I can't get it
I hugged the block, light an L
Let my man hit it and ran with it
Sell it nixed to the pops

Hate to tell ya if he don't get it from me
Then he gon get it somewhere else
Sometimes I would if I was somewhere else
Me and my man on the corner with two crates

Picture us rollin, somewhere else
Pretendin to be pushin the V's
Then two fiends walked up to me
Brought me back to reality

He want three and he want five
But my packed stash (why) 'cause the cops act like I'm Lil' Cease
Crush on me, keep rollin by
Tryna to put the cuffs on my black ass literally

[Chorus - Freeway + (Female Singing)]
(You don't know)
How it is in the hood so Freeway bring the hood to your front porch
My niggaz duck court pour weed in the woods
Set up shop and move rocks on the front step
(You don't know)
How it is in the ghetto the tech blow hear shots echo
We can't let go, stuck on the block
Stuck in the hood, street niggaz up to no good

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
No rules, no trees just a lot in the push
My [unknown] in the house, read my mouth
Fuck the D's got a pocket to push
Send fleas in the opposite way

Quarter to one guess I stop at the ?
Gimme a grub, count up the profit I made
Rule number one
Sell your first stack and cop you a gun

We hear gun shots, we hardly amazed
My man Willie Mays and Santana live on the run
What does it mean? not goin' back
Not gettin' caged, strong with a gat

Prepare for the raid
Listen Mothers, bodies still underaged
You better talk to your sons
Send em on a straight line from the lines

And move straight to the pen
Sleep with a blade, husky niggaz touchin they chin
Get bailed, get out and then they at it again
All for the love of the pay

[Chorus - Freeway + (Female Singing)]
(You don't know)
How it is in the hood so Freeway bring the hood to your front porch
My niggaz duck court pour weed in the woods
Set up shop and move rocks on the front step

How it is in the ghetto the tech blow hear shots echo
We can't let go, stuck on the block
Stuck in the hood, street niggaz up to no good

[Verse 3 - O. Sparks]
Every since I don't stop waist side
Sparks had the ambition to ride
O. Town play games but I need this chain
Got me deep in the game

To the point, yea coulnd't get no rest, no sleep
All I did was hug the block
And shake the police while they shakin the bag
At age 18, like half a brick, crack got half the street

Most of my always call me ""Snoop""
'Cause I couldn't cook this shit then
So I brought all my worst stylin fiends
Runnin' back to the kid like ""Sparks man, you sold me some bullshit""

But I kept on pumpin' cause the block kept on jumpin
I'm not stoppin', I was told the sky's the limit
Plus I'm tryna to push the roads
And park the [unknown]

And let you know what exactly takes places in the ghetto
When techs blow
When the cops circle, I know the bells like ?
Run fast with that .38 special

[Chorus - Freeway + (Female Singing)]

Fuck the cops cause the Fed's was paid

Tuck the glock come pedal with K's
We can settle it here
We run with this beef, we runnin his peeps
Like five in the mornin while they under them sheets (wake up)
Like five gats drawn, soldiers come out they sleep
Tell me what they gon' tell me when the gun out they reach
