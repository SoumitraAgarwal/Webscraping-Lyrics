Irving Berlin,"It's a lovely day today
So whatever you've got to do
You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true

And I hope whatever you've got to do
Is something that can be done by two
For I'd really like to stay

It's a lovely day today
And whatever you've got to do
I'd be so happy to be doing it with you

But if you've got something that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day

It's a lovely day today
And whatever I've got to do
I've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true

But perhaps whatever I've got to do
Is something that can be done by two
If it is then you could stay

It's a lovely day today
But you're probably busy too
So I suppose there's nothing we can do

For if you've got something that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day

It's a lovely day today
If you've something that must get done
Now don't forget two heads are better than just one

And besides I'm certain if you knew me
You'd find I'm very good company
Won't you kindly let me stay?

It's a lovely day today
And whatever we've got to do
We've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true

And I know whatever we've got to do
Is something that can be done by two

I'll say it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day",Act I: Plenty to Be Thankful For
Irving Berlin,"I could dance nightly
Just holding you tightly
My sweet
I could keep right on
Because you're so light on
Your feet
You're easy to dance with

There is no doubt in
The way we stand out in
The crowd
Though it's called dancing
To me it's romancing
Out loud
You're easy to dance with

Loving you
The way I do
Makes you easy to dance with
That is why I'm always right on the beat
All those charms
In one man's arms
Makes you easy to dance with
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet

Let's dance forever
Come on, say we'll never
Be through
It's so easy to dance with you","Act II: Be Careful, It's My Heart"
Irving Berlin,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(Ah, gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had",Act II: Finale Ultimo (Steppin' out with My Baby/I'll Capture Your Hear
Irving Berlin,"Sweetheart of mine, I've sent you a valentine
Sweetheart of mine, it's more than a valentine
Be careful, it's my heart
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart
It's not the note I sent you that you quickly burned
It's not the book I lent you that you never returned
Remember it's my heart
The heart with which so willingly I part
It's yours to take to keep or break
But please, before you start
Be careful, it's my heart",Act II: Song of Freedom
Irving Berlin,"Happy Holiday
Happy holiday, happy holiday
While the merry bells keep ringing
May your ev'ry wish come true

Happy holiday, happy holiday
May the calendar keep bringing
Happy holidays to you

Come To Holiday Inn
If you're burdened down with trouble
If your nerves are wearing thin
Park your load down the road
And come to Holiday Inn

If the traffic noise affects you
Like a squeaky violin
Kick your cares down the stairs
And come to Holiday Inn

If you can't find someone who
Would set your heart a-whirl
Take your car and motor to
The home of boy meets girl

If you're laid-up with a breakdown
Throw away your vitamin
Don't get worse, grab your nurse
And come to Holiday Inn

Unite and sing a aloha-hi to me

Irving Fazola,"In a Sentimental Mood I can see
The stars come through my room
While your loving attitude is
Like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make
My Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing since you

Irving Fazola,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Irving Fazola,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Irving Fazola,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true,

My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,

Irving Fields,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Irving Fields,"I love you much too much
I've known it from the start
But yet my love is such
I can't control my heart

I love you much too much
I ask myself what for
Then, darling, when we touch
Mm, I love you more

Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly
But who am I to say
If I should hold it lightly
It might slip away

I love you much too much
You've never really known
I love you oh so much
I'm yours alone.

Irving Joseph,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [From Jubilee]
Irving Joseph,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Irving Joseph,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin [From Born To Dance]
Irving Joseph,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night [From Rosalie]
Irving Joseph,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Irving Joseph,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.
I'm a lazy lout that's just about to stop,
But if Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top! You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you simply too, too, too divine,
You're a Botticelli, You're Keats, You're Shelley,
You're Ovaltine.
You're a boon, You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon over Mae West's shoulder.
I'm a nominee of the G.O.P. or GOP,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.
By the River Rhine, You're a sturdy stein of beer,
You're a dress from Saks's, You're next year's taxes,'
You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,

Tyhjänä milloinkaan seiso ei kehto.

sen vanhana taitaa.
Sen vilkaisu kamariin voi vahvistaa.
koska vaimokin pitää vain risaista paitaa,
Se vanhankin vielä niin nuoreksi saa.

Ihanuuksien ihmemaa!

mutta siitä on värkätty pontikkapannu,
Iloa murheisiin tiputtelemaan.

You get enough tears to fill an ocean
That's what you get for your devotion.
I'll never fall in love again.
I'll never fall in love again.

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies and pain and sorrow.
So, for at least until tomorrow,
I'll never fall in love again!
I'll never fall in love again!",I'll Never Fall in Love Again
Isaac Hayes,"One more time to test the will power of me
These feelings that I hold now
Just won't let me be
This woman won't leave me alone
She's trying to ruin my happy home
With a man's temptation

Now I've got another back home
Who's the beat of my heart
I never thought no one else
Could ever tear us apart
To each other we had been so true
Until alas come a love like you
With a man's temptation

I know I've got to be strong
I've got to fight this all along
So afraid of what I must do
I got to take my woman or you

Now, I've got a feeling telling me
To let your heart be your guide
I don't want to lose either one
Which makes it hard to decide
Though my mind continues to roam
Oh Baby, my heart it stays at home
Controlling my temptation

And even less about the place

It's just a job but she'll do the best she can

We both agreed it was gonna be a one-night thing, no strings attached.
I go my way and you go yours, and look what happened.
Yeah, but...

I lay there every night while you loved me,
And I'm used to nights that go by slow.

But you never cross my mind,
Though I cry from time to time.
No, you never cross my mind.
You just stay there all the time.

I got a letter from you. You promised you wasn't gonna do that.
But from time to time my eyes found a picture,
The very one I forgot to put away.
Hmmm.
Just another memory trying to make me miss you,
And I found one more without you in my mind.
But you never cross my mind,
Though I cry from time to time.
No, you never cross my mind,
But you just stay there all the time.

You want to know why I'm calling you.
I want to know why you wrote to me.
Well, I-I--I just wanted to say hi.
I can understand that, 'cause...

Now and then, a friend will say they saw you, 
And I said what could all that matter to me.
You know what, late at night, when I'm content with being lonely,
I get this unwanted visit from old misery.
And that's why, that's why you never cross my mind.
And you never cross my mind.
No, you never cross my mind.
You just stay there (Stay there.),
Stay there (Stay there) all the time.
I said you never, never cross my mind,

And I call it 'Soulsville' ah, yeah.

That means an increase in the welfare line;
The crime rate is rising too, but
If you are hungry, what would you do?

The rent is two months past due, in a building that's falling apart,
Little boy needs a new pair of shoes, and this is only a part of Soulsville

Some of the brothers' got plenty of cash, tricks on the corner is going to see to that,
Some like to smoke and some like to blow, some are even strung out on a $50 Jones
Trying to ditch reality, by getting so, high,
Only to find out, that you can never reach the sky, 
Because your roots are in Soulsville, oh, yes they are.

Every Sunday morning, I can hear the church sisters sing 'Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Trusting the Lord to make a way, oh yeah;

Isaac Hayes,"I've been diggin' on you little girl
Every time you stroll by
And I can't help but notice
The sad look in your eyes

Ever didn't be your man and hurt you
The pain is on your face
It's a shame to see
All that good lovin', just go to waste

So don't waste it, don't waste it
Don't waste it, baby
Just give all that good lovin' to me
Give it to me, you see, I can use it

Also know how it feels
To be the victim of a bad relation
So don't you feel all by yourself
Because we're in the same situation

You need love and I need love
We both got love to give
So let's stop drowning in our sorrows
Let's get together and live

So don't waste it, don't waste it
Don't waste it, baby

I swear I do
No other women can love me
Oh, like you do

You're the best thing
That ever happened to this man
And I'm gonna keep on loving you
Just as long as I can
I love you, I love you

One night alone is too long alone
When one's been loved by you
It's so good to touch
When I've missed so much
This thrills been long overdue

The love you give is the reason I live
You're food to this hungry, so are mine
If satisfaction was money
I'd be the worlds richest man
'Cause you give me such good lovin'

Givin' me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through a darkest hour
Lately I'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why

Lately I'm a-prayin'
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me.

Isaac Hayes,"If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay

Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could

For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star
Like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are
How fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star

And you never, never, never realize

Who thrills me through and through
And I'll never find another
If I search this whole world through
Oh, no, no, no

Now you know why
I smile all the time, baby
You give me such peace of mind, honey
Heartaches and pain is
A thing of the past, baby

Anything you want
I'll glady give to you
Cause you never did nothing once
That's why I love you too

Isaac Hayes,"You've come a long way baby,
From wealth and food stamp lines,
You're moving on up,
And leaving poverty behind.

And seen the best of the schools,
But when you take a drink,
The ghetto comes out of you.

I took you out of the ghetto,
(I took you out of the ghetto)
I took you out of the ghetto,
(I took you out of the ghetto)
I took you out of the ghetto,

But I could not get that ghetto out of you.

You're a foxy lady,
Your mamma had a beautiful child,
You're built like a brick house,
And that's no lie.

When we go to the disco,
You drive the fellas wild,
When you shake your booty,
Ghetto style.

[Chorus]

You're a hunk of raw sugar,
Got some real sweet hips,
Your love, your love, your love,
Is like a honey drip.

Your roots are in the mean streets,
That'll never change,

Stay the same.

Fever yea I burn for sooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight

Oh daddy, wont you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them

You better walk on by

Y que llevo en el alma Andalucía

De llevar esta estrella que pesa tanto
Que perdí en el camino tantas cosas
Que me hicieron a veces tanto daño

Si todo el mundo tiene la razón

Y desnudar el alma

Que le debo a la vida tantas cosas

Que parte mi universo en dos
Que llega del olvido hasta

Mi propia voz y arana mi pasado
Sin pedir perdón estas aquí
Te siento en cada espacio
De mi soledad te miro

Y te sonríes y después te vas
Y cruzas la distancia
Y yo me quedo aquí
Pensando en ti, pensando en ti

Me he escapado contigo
Cuantas veces mis labios
Han gritado te quiero

Cuanto tiempo esperando
Desde que tu te has ido
Cuantas noches vagando

Mi cariño para luego derramarlo

Me engañaste, me engañaste
Te cruzaste una tarde en mi vida
Disfrazada de amiga para luego inventar
La mentira y echarla a volar

Y sembrar en la gente
Esa duda que llega y que duele
Y que hiere y que mata
Que se agranda y se queda
Por siempre flotando

En el aire, escondiendo la cara
Y que crece y se arrastra
Como una mala hierba
Y te mira a los ojos y te hace llorar
Y te llena de pena

Me engañaste y aunque callaré
Tu nombre para siempre
Tú lo sabes, me engañaste
Como engaña el gavilán a la paloma

Te burlaste, me engañaste
Me engañaste, sin pudor profanaste
Mi vida disfrazada de amiga
Para luego inventar la mentira
Y echarte a volar

Eres una mentira cuando siembras
La duda que duele y que hiere
Y que mata cuando callas y gritas
Y sufres y lloras y cantas

Eres toda mentira porque vas por
La vida como una mala hierba
Y si miro tus ojos me hacen llorar
Y me lleno de pena

Tú sembraste en la gente
Esa duda que llega
Y que duele y que hiere y que mata
Que se agranda y se queda
Por siempre flotando

En el aire, escondiendo la cara
Y que crece y se arrastra
Como una mala hierba
Y te mira a los ojos y te hace llorar
Y te llena de pena

",Eres Una Mentira
Isabel Pantoja,"Amanece día a día indiferente
Desayuna sin siquiera hablar
Y se marcha sin decir te quiero
Acelera sin mirar atrás

Luego va muriendo el día y no me llama
Y la espera se hace larga en soledad
Soledad que en mi se hace infinita
Cuando llega y me doy cuenta que no está

Quién diría, este amor que era tan grande como el cielo
Quién diría, este amor que siempre fue todo lo bueno
Quién diría, este amor que yo juraba ser eterno
Está enfermo y no sé por cuanto tiempo va a durar

Amanece día a día indiferente
Desayuna sin siquiera hablar
Y se marcha sin decir te quiero
Acelera sin mirar atrás

",Quién Diría
Isabel Pantoja,"Me esta faltando el coraje
De decirte lo que siento
Es algo que llevo dentro
Que se mezcla con mi sangre

Me están sobrando verdades
Que no salen de mi boca
Y me estoy volviendo loca
Y ya se nota en el aire

Que esto es puro amor
Amor amor incontrolable
Y si sigo así pobre de mí
Me va a matar

Porque es puro amor
Amor amor inalcanzable
No se que hacer
Con mi querer con este amor

Me esta faltando el coraje
Pero no es de cobardía
Y van pasando los días
Y ya se nota en el aire

",Puro Amor
Isabel Pantoja,"Cuando me miras
Me pones tan encendida
Cuando me abrazas
Conmigo ya no sé que pasa

Cuando me tienes
Como un imán
Me retienes
Y no me suelto

De lo bien que tu me quieres
Siento tu boca
Y me pongo como loca
Cuando me besas pierdo yo la cabeza

Veneno
Aunque fueras un veneno
A mi me resultas bueno
Por este amor

Locura
Aunque sea una locura
Seguiré siendo tan tuya
Y qué mejor

Tu me conoces
Como jamás
Me supo nadie
Y ahí me llevas

De una mirada por le aire
Y aunque me digan
Que eres lo peor
Que me ha pasado

Así es mi vida
Y yo no consulto si es pecado
Siento tu boca
Y me pongo como loca
Cuando me besas pierdo yo la cabeza

",Veneno
Isabel Pantoja,"Me preguntan si lo quiero todavía
Si los años no ayudaron a olvidar
Si recuerdo su mirada su sonrisa
La figura de su cuerpo al caminar

Me preguntan si a mi vida no ha llegado
Otro amor para que ocupe su lugar
Todavía ese amor no lo he encontrado
Y es difícil si el que siento aún está

No es que yo viva de recuerdos
Conozco bien la realidad
Pero lo mío no fue un sueño
Yo fui feliz y de verdad

Yo lo quiero todavía
Hace parte de mi vida
Viene por momentos
Va en mi pensamiento

Y en las horas de tristeza y soledad
Yo siento que él está
Y siento que me da
Amor eterno

Yo lo quiero todavía
Hace parte de mi vida
Y por consecuencia
Lloro por su ausencia

Me preguntan hasta cuándo va a durar
Para decir verdad
Tengo que contestar
Amor eterno

",Amor Eterno
Isabel Pantoja,"Adelante
No lo pienses, ven conmigo y adelante
Que yo tengo tantas cosas para darte
Para amarte como nunca amé jamas

Tú no sabes
Pero siempre yo en mis sueños he soñado
Despertar al lado tuyo y abrazados
De una noche sin final de tanto amar

Adelante
Que no hay nadie como yo para quererte
Para amarte con locura y protegerte
Para darte mas y mas

Adelante
Que lo tuyo lo respiro con el aire
Que podemos ser felices como nadie
No lo pienses mas

Adelante
No dejemos de vivir lo que sentimos
Los momentos que tú y yo los elegimos
De ese mundo donde un beso puede mas

Tú no sabes
Pero siempre yo en mis sueños he soñado
Despertar al lado tuyo y abrazados
De una noche sin final de tanto amar

",Adelante
Isabel Pantoja,"Luz de luna y esa noche de calor
Y a lo lejos se escuchaba esa canción
Fue envolviéndolo de a poco esta pasión
Que encendió mi corazón

Eres fuego que me quema
Lentamente me encadenas
Y me atrapa el corazón

Eres fuego que me quema
Y que sube por mis venas
Va directo al corazón

Eres fuego que me quema
Como el sol
Es el fuego del amor

Eres fuego que me quema
Fruta dulce que se entrega
Y me endulza el corazón

Vino rojo que enbriagó
Mi corazón y en tus brazos
Fue creciendo esta pasión

Y sentimos que teníamos los dos
Llamas en el corazón

Eres fuego que me quema
Lentamente me encadenas
Y me atrapa el corazón

Eres fuego que me quema
Y que sube por mis venas
Va directo al corazón

",Fuego (Llamas en el Corazón)
Isabel Pantoja,"Arrepentimiento, por amarte tanto
Por enamorarme y rendirme a tus encantos
Arrepentimiento, por haber sentido
Un cariño grande que no fue correspondido

Trataré de olvidar, arrancarte del todo de mí
Alejarme para siempre y esconder mi dolor
Aprender que en el amor no siempre puedes ganar
Que se sufre, se entristece y que se puede llorar

Todos me dicen que es difícil olvidar un amor
Olvidar un amor

Corazón, necesito que me ayudes
Corazón, deja ya de recordar
Corazón, has borrón y cuenta nueva
Quítame toda esta pena, quítame esta soledad

Corazón, necesito que me ayudes
Corazón, deja ya de recordar
Corazón, son castillos en la arena
Quítame toda esta pena, quítame esta soledad

Todos me dicen que es difícil olvidar un amor
Olvidar un amor

",Arrepentimiento
Isabel Pantoja,"Te marchabas, te ibas de mi lado
No podía creer que era el adiós
Que este sueño tan bonito terminara
Que yo me quedara sin tu amor

De repente las lágrimas llegaron
La tristeza no pude contener
Y ese frío tan grande que se siente, caló
Inundó todo mi ser

Era tarde, sentí tú despedida
Ya sabía que no ibas a volver
Y con rabia y amor al mismo
Tiempo te grité

Buena suerte
Que en adelante solo encuentres cosas buenas
Que no te toque una de cal y otra de arena
Que sea todo felicidad

Buena suerte
Aunque me quede sola y triste en el camino
Que Dios te ayude y sea bonito tu destino
Sé que no va a ser fácil
Trataré, trataré de olvidar

Te marchabas, te ibas de mi lado
Me rompías de un golpe el corazón
Arrojabas al viento tus promesas
Y matabas para siempre mi ilusión

Era tarde, sentí tú despedida
Ya sabía que no ibas a volver
Y con rabia y amor al mismo
Tiempo te grité

Que en adelante solo encuentres cosas buenas
Que no te toque una de cal y otra de arena

",Buena Suerte
Isabel Pantoja,"Cuando te fuiste
Pensé que pronto una vez mas regresarías
Que te enojaste
Como otras veces pero al tiempo pasaría

Cuando te fuiste
Creí que todo era una lluvia de verano
Que pasa pronto
Que en un instante volverías a mis manos

Pero esperando
Me he dado cuenta que esta vez tu no regresas
Porque por algo
Aumenta tanto mi dolor y mi tristeza

Cuando te fuiste
No imagine que era en verdad tu despedida
Todo lo malo que en tu ausencia pasaría
En blanco y negro

Sin alegría cuando te fuiste
Hoy me doy cuenta que tu ya no me querías
Que te marchaste para siempre de mi vida
Que tu no vuelves, que es despedida

",Cuando Te Fuiste
Isabel Pantoja,"Perdona si te hago llorar
Perdona si te hago sufrir
Pero es que no esta en mis manos
Pero es que no esta en mis manos
Me he enamorado

Me he enamorado, me enamore
Perdona si te causo dolor
Perdona si hoy te digo adiós
Como decirle que te amo
Como decirle que te amo

Si el me ha preguntado
Le dicho que no, le dicho que no
Soy honesta con el y contigo
A el lo quiero y a ti te he olvidado

Si Tu quieres seremos amigos
Yo te ayudo a olvidar el pasado, no te aferres
Ya no te aferres, a un imposible
Ya no te hagas.ni me hagas mas daño

Tu bien sabes que no fue mi culpa
Tu te fuiste sin decirme nada
Y a pesar que llore como nunca
Yo seguía de ti enamorada

Pero te fuiste
Y que regresabas, no me dijiste
Y sin mas nada por qué? No se
Pero fue así, así fue

Te brinde la mejor de las suertes
Me propuse no hablarte ni verte
Y hoy que has vuelto ya ves
Solo hay nada

Ya no puedo ni debo quererte
Ya no te amo
Me ha enamorado, de un ser divino
De un buen amor

Que me enseno a olvidar
Y a perdonar

",Enamoradita
Isabel Pantoja,"Es sábado de noche
Noche de fiesta
Noche de baile
El moreno se arregla
Prepara el cuerpo para ir al baile

El salón esta lleno
Todos se miran
Nade es de nadie
El moreno esta cerca
Ya se respira ya esta en el aire

El moreno aparece
Cruza la puerta
Pisando firme
Las mujeres lo miran
Buscan la forma de seducirle

El moreno se ríe
Juega con todos
No busca a nadie
El moreno ha venido
Pá divertirse le gusta el baile

El moreno baila
El moreno ríe
El moreno quiere mover el cuerpo
Y que todos le miren

El moreno baila
Pero no es de nadie
El moreno quiere mover el cuerpo
Le gusta el baile

El salón esta lleno
No cabe un alma y hay gente afuera
Que noche de locura
Una luz verde para quien quiera

Ese un poco de todo
Y ese moreno que esta en el baile
Es Sábado de noche
Todos con todos, nadie es de nadie

",El Moreno
Isabel Pantoja,"Es pura candela, es candela pura
El amor no es juego, no es una aventura
Es pura candela, es candela pura
El amor no es juego, es una aventura

No maltrates mi querer
No me digas que te vas otra vez
No dispares a matar
Es mejor contar primero hasta 10

Que si me dejas tal vez me pierdas
Que yo no sé si te esperare
Que si te vas cerraras la puerta
Que yo no sé si te la abriré

Mucho cuidado mi amor
Piénsalo bien

Porque el amor es pura candela
Que si se apaga no enciende más
Que yo no quiero aguantar la vela
Que si te marchas me perderás

Es pura candela, es candela pura
El amor no es juego, es una aventura
Es pura candela es candela pura
El amor no es juego, es una aventura

Una vez te perdone
Me quede esperando solo tu amor
Ya cambie no soy así
Si te vas ya no tendrás mi perdón

Que si me dejas tal vez me pierdas
Que yo no sé si te esperare
Que si te vas cerraras la puerta
Que yo no sé si te la abriré

Mucho cuidado mi amor
Piénsalo bien

",Pura Candela
Isabel Pantoja,"Amor yo me pregunto que nos pasa
Que estamos tan distantes sin querer
Hay nubes que oscurecen nuestro cielo
Y lagrimas que empiezan a correr

Los días van pasando indiferentes
La noche ya no acerca nuestra piel
Y siento que el silencio en nuestras vidas
Divide nuestra sin querer

Yo sé que esto no es falta de cariño
Te quiero como nunca he de querer
Por eso te propongo que vivamos
Nuevamente enamorados, la mejor luna de miel

Una segunda luna de miel
Por tu amor y por mi amor
Por las cosas de los dos

Nos debemos la oportunidad
Hay peligro a naufragar
Nos tenemos que ayudar

Es urgente no lo pienses mas
Buscaremos un lugar
La tormenta ha de pasar
Regresando la felicidad

Yo sé que están faltando las palabras
Tenemos que volver a dialogar
Pues cuando se equivoca la pareja
Son dos los que se deben perdonar

",Una Segunda Luna de Miel
Isabel Pantoja,"Deja de llorar por ese amor
De sentirte triste, deprimida
Solamente ha sido un tropezón
Y hay mucho camino todavía

Echa a andar no lo pienses mas
Echa a andar no lo pienses mas

Que la vida se hace solo de momentos
Y el dolor no es alimento que nos pida el corazón
Que la vida aunque no quieras continua
Que la vida es sola una; un regalo del señor

Echa a andar no lo pienses mas
Echa a andar no lo pienses mas

Deja de vivir en soledad
Abre las ventanas a la vida
Que la noche pasa y sale el sol
Y hay mucho camino todavía

",Echa a Andar
Isabel Pantoja,"Pobre corazón viviendo de recuerdos
Pobre mi esperanza de esperar por él
Grande la soledad que dejó su ausencia
Tristes pasan los días sin su querer

Lágrimas por él mis ojos derramaron
Lágrimas de amor corrieron por mi piel
Él se fue una mañana y al despedirse
Me dijo que esperara que iba a volver

Pasa la primavera
Pasa el verano,se va el otoño
Va llegando el invierno
Y sigo sola pensando en él

Pasa la primavera
Pasa el verano, se va el otoño
Y no lo he vuelto a ver
Y no lo he vuelto a ver

El amor que yo quiero sigo esperando
Y no lo he vuelto a ver
Y no lo he vuelto a ver
El amor que yo quiero me está matando

",Pobre Mi Esperanza
Isabel Pantoja,"Perdí yo sé que te perdi
Qué tonta que yo fuí estoy arrepentida
Por no cuidar con celo tu cariño
Y no saber que tanto te queria

Jugué y en cosas del querer
Qué fácil es perder se deja hasta la vista
Apenas resta un hilo de esperanza
Porque un amor así jamás se olvida

Si pudiera pediria
De rodillas a tus pies imploraria
Como loca lloraría
Si pudiera, si supiera dónde estás

Si pudiera pediria
De rodillas a tus pies imploraria
Como loca lloraría
Si supiera que me vas a perdonar

",Arrepentida
Isabel Pantoja,"Sola con tristeza en la mirada
Con la vida destrozada
Sola caminando por las calles
Sin saber adonde ir

Sola porque un día me dejaste
Me soltaste de tu mano
Sola en el invierno, en el verano

Sin amor, sin alegría
Siempre sola, siempre sola
En la angustia de vivir y recordar

Sola por amarte, por perderte
Porque existe mala suerte
Sola en mi dolor desesperada

Y no encuentro la salida
De que vuelvas a mi vida
De sentir que soy querida
En tus brazos otra vez

Y por eso estoy aquí
Y por eso vengo a verte
Porque yo no se vivir
Sin mirarte sin tenerte

Y por eso estoy aquí
Porque en todos mis caminos
Que mi cuerpo y yo anduvimos
Te buscaba a ti

jamas pudo existir
tanta belleza
las cosas tan hermosas

Jamas duró una flor
dos primaveras

por mucho tiempo

aunque no quiera
y una mañana gris
al abrazarnos
sentimos un crujido
frio y seco
cerramos nuestros ojos y pensamos

Se nos rompió el amor

Quiero poder corresponderte de una forma o otra a diario

Y yo que estoy a tu lado haces de cuenta que no estoy

Se acabo ahora me escuchas y tu te callas
Que no ves que yo tengo la razón
Tú te crees que soy tu tonto o que no tengo corazón
Ya ves que te equivocas lo que no tenia es valor
Tu me cansaste paciencia y hoy te pongo un hasta aquí
Ya dime cara a cara que tu quieres pues de mi

Que te crees que yo sin ti me muero vete tu y veras que no
Tu te crees que estoy contigo porque no hay otra mejor
No niña te equivocas como tu hay un montón

Y óyeme si así vas a ser siempre
Pues jamas tendrás un buen señor
Tu te crees indispensable y ese es tu gran error
Por eso es que me ignoras tu no aquilatas este amor

Ya ves que yo te adoro pero mas me adoro
Yo ya no aguanto mas mentiras, más traiciones mas ya no
Si me quieres o si me amas
No seas tonta aquí estoy",Dímelo
Isabel Pantoja,"No sabía de tristezas 
ni de lagrimas, ni nada 
que me hicieran llorar 
yo sabía de cariño, de ternura 
porque a mi desde pequeña 
eso me enseno mamá 
eso me enseno mamá 
eso y muchas cosas mas

Yo jamas sufrí 
yo jamas llore 
yo era muy feliz 
yo vivía muy bien

Yo vivía tan distinto 
algo hermoso, algo divino 
llena de felicidad, 
yo sabía de alegrías
la belleza y de la vida
pero no de soledad 
pero no de soledad 
eso y muchas cosas mas

Yo jamas sufrí
ay, yo jamas llore
yo era muy feliz 
yo vivía muy bien

Hasta que te conocí 
vi la vida con dolor 
no te miento fui feliz 
aunque con muy poco amor 
y muy tarde comprendí 
que no te debí amar 
porque ahora pienso en ti 
mas que ayer, pero mucho mas

Porque tu fuiste muy malo 
si muy malo conmigo 
por eso no te quiero 
no te quiero ver jamas

Y ahora quiero que me digas 
Si valió o no la pena 
En haberte conocido 
Porque no te quiero ver 
Porque que tu fuiste muy malo 
si muy malo conmigo 
por eso no te quiero ver 

No te quiero, no 
No te quiero, no ver 
No te quiero, no 
No te quiero, no ver 
Que No te quiero no
No te quiero, no 
No te quiero ver 

Porque que tu fuiste muy malo 
si muy malo conmigo 
por eso no te quiero 
No te quiero no 
No te quiero no 
No te quiero, no te quiero, no te quiero no
Ya no quiero verte",Hasta Que Te Conocí

Isabel Pantoja,"Hoy, he sabido lo que valgo para ti 
He aprendido que para amarte hay que sufrir 
La lección, muy bien me la aprendí 
Y no, no me gusto y no quiero verte nunca más 
Porque mis ojos se cegaron de mirar 
Lo ya indecible que solo me hizo sufrir 
Si, sé que con Dios llevas muy buena relación 
Pero conmigo otra fue la situación 
Tú no me amaste y como a mí tampoco a Él 
Tú me hiciste ver, el infierno sin ser 
La culpable de una cruel crucifixión 

Lo bueno que es contigo Señor 
Conmigo, conmigo nunca lo fue 
Conmigo fue infiel 
Me hizo llorar 
Me hizo todo lo que no se debe hacer 
Me hizo sufrir 
Me hizo penar 
Pero de todo corazón lo perdoné

Tú, tú me enseñaste que en la cruz Jesús murió 
Crucificado por amar y por amor 
Y que murió por todos 

¿Cuál es la causa de que no me amaras tú? 
Si yo moría por ti 
Por nadie más por ti 
Pero yo vi que esto nunca te importó 

¡Ay! y me nos mal que de la muerte me salvó 
El amor propio que mi padre me inculcó 
Con mucho orgullo y con mi propia dignidad 
Me dije hasta aquí 
Hoy me tengo que ir 
Romper contigo eso fue mi obligación 
No sabía dónde ir 
Si vivir o morir 
Y empecé a pensar en mí con fe y con devoción 

Y una noche vi el cielo de azul 
Cuajado de estrellas 
Muchas de ellas formaban una cruz 
Y me dió la señal 
De que era el gran final 
De un constante sin vivir 
Me iluminó y entonces vi por fin la luz",Por La Señal De La Cruz
Isabel Pantoja,"Donde este hoy y siempre 
Yo te quiero conmigo, necesito cuidados 
Necesito de ti 
Si me voy donde vaya yo te llevo conmigo 
No me dejes ir sola, necesito de ti 

Tú me sabes bien cuidar 
Tú me sabes bien guiar 
Todo lo haces muy bien 
ser muy buena es tu virtud 
Cómo te puedo pagar 
Todo lo que haces por mí 
Todo lo feliz que soy 
Todo este grande amor 
Solamente con mi vida 
Ten mi vida te la doy 
Pero no me dejes nunca, nunca, nunca 

Te lo pido por favor

Tú me sabes bien cuidar

Isabel Parra,"Quién me iba a decir a mí
como me iba a imaginar
si yo no tengo un lugar.
Si yo no tengo un lugar
en la tierra.
Y mis manos son lo único que tengo
y mis manos son mi amor y mi sustento.

No hay casa donde llegar
mi paire y mi maire están
más lejos de este barrial.
Más lejos de este barrial
que una estrella.
Y mis manos son lo único que tengo
y mis manos son mi amor y mi sustento.

Quién me iba a decir a mi
que yo me iba a enamorar
cuando no tengo un lugar.
Cuando no tengo un lugar
en la tierra.
Y mis manos son lo único que tengo
y mis manos son mi amor y mi sustento.

Isabela,"Olga Tañon Flaca o Gordita Letras:
Que bonito.. 

ya llevamos tanto tiempo, 
Pareciera que fue ayer.. 
Cuando te bese por primera vez, 
Me prometisteis que por mi morirías.. 
Me llevaste hasta la luna, 
Me sentí como ninguna.. 
La costumbre asomo, 
Su cara a los dos, 
Why yo no quiero que esto pase a mayorr...!! 

quiero mas tiempo, 
Igual que ayer.. 
Quiero mas besos con sabor a miel.. 
Que no se te olvide, 
Que quiero escuchar 

que estoy bonita, 
Flaca o gordita 
Que me quieres mucho, 
Que me necesitas 
Como antes decías, hecha a tu medida 
Quiero piropos de esos que me decías 
Regálame rosas son margaritas, 
Que sean de sorpresa con una notita 
Una reconquista llena de caricias 
Que no nos pase como a muchos, 
Se resignan 

un detalle siempre cuenta, 
Para que esto nunca muera 
Si tu quieres saber lo que siento yo, 
Ven siéntate 
Why escúchame por favor! 

quiero mas tiempo, 
Igual que ayer.. 
Quiero mas besos con sabor a miel.. 
Que no se te olvide, 
Que quiero escuchar 

que estoy bonita, 
Flaca o gordita 
Que me quieres mucho, 
Que me necesitas 
Como antes decías, hecha a tu medida 
Quiero piropos de esos que me decías 
Regálame rosas son margaritas, 
Que sean de sorpresa con una notita 
Una reconquista llena de caricias 
Que no nos pase como a muchos, 
Se resignan 

por mi parte yo 
Te veo mejor que ayer, 
Why aunque pase el tiempo, 
Yo te amare, 
Yo te amare... 

vamos a tomarnos un vinito, 
Vamos a recordar hasta cuando tu tenías pelo 
Ya estas casi calvito, 
Yo estoy un poquito mas gordita no? 

que estoy bonita, 
Flaca o gordita 
Que me quieres mucho, 
Que me necesitas 
Como antes decías, hecha a tu medida 
Quiero piropos de esos que me decías 
Regálame rosas son margaritas, 
Que sean de sorpresa con una notita 
Una reconquista llena de caricias 
Que no nos pase como a muchos, 
Se resignan.. 
Que no nos pase como a muchos 
Se resignan

Isabela,"Que ganas de no verte nunca más,
Aunque me muera, Hacerme de coraje
y escapar por esa puerta

Que ganas de no verte nunca más
Y ser valiente, decirte que con el
estoy mejor, que el me comprende

A el le sobra el tiempo como a mi
A el le arde la sangre como a mi
Con el me siento nueva, tan dispuesta,
Tan entera, mujer de carne y hueso por amor

Que ganas de no verte nunca más
Que ganas de no verte nunca más
Que ganas de cerrar este capítulo en mi vida
Donde fuiste una mentira y nada más

Que ganas de no verte nunca más
Que ganas de no verte nunca más
Haberme dado cuenta que contigo estoy desierta,
Que no tengo más paciencia que inventar

Que ganas de no verte nunca más
Te lo confieso, No pidas que me
Vuelva a equivocar,No, no pidas eso

Que ganas de no verte nunca más
Y ser valiente
Decirte que con el estoy mejor
Que el me comprende

A el le sobra el tiempo como a mi
A el le arde la sangre como a mi

Isabella Castillo,"Triste
Me dejaste triste
Con esta canción
Lagrimas de amor
Fuiste
Quizá nunca tuviste este corazón
Lagrimas de amor
Y te vas
Y te vas
No me queda nada
Y te vas
Y te vas
No me queda nada
Por que no estas
Dime
No sé por que te fuiste
Antes de que muera este amor
Lagrimas de amor
Viven viven los besos que me diste
Ya no creo en nada mas

Y te vas
Y te vas
No me queda nada
Y te vas
Y te vas
No me queda nada

Y te vas
Y te vas
No me queda nada
