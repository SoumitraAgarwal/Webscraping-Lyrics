The Strokes,"Right, wrong, what to do?
Someday it will come to you
Hostile indians
We named our summer camp for you

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I'm in utter dismay
I've got nothing to say

Harmless children
We named our soldiers after you
Don't be a coconut
God is trying to talk to you
We could drag it out
But that's for other bands to do

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to give
Got no reason to live
But I will fight to survive
I've got nothing to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy

I'd like to watch
I'd like to read
I'd like a part
I'd like the lead

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to give
Got no reason to live
But I'll kill to survive
I've got nothing to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy",Ask Me Anything
The Strokes,"Oh it's strange to impress a mirror
Oh friends don't realize I'm here
I wish two drinks were always in me
I pretend I had the perfect day

Take me to the water
Make me understand that I was wrong
For me tomorrow is my first day
So please don't tempt at a wrong way

Its almost after midnight
I can see the city lights ahead

Change your mind, tonight
You belong to the city now
When you're closer now I know
You belong on the radio

I swear I'll give it back tomorrow
But for now I think that ill just borrow

All the quotes from that song
And all the words from whatever song I heard
Yes that day

Change your mind, tonight
You belong to the city now
When you're closer now I know
You belong on the radio

I will not disturb you
I was just returning you the compliment",Electricityscape
The Strokes,"They love you or they hate you
But they will never let you be
They'll thrill you or sedate you
But they will never let you see

In the evening sun
In the evening sun

Encourage and derange you
Watch you walking scared alone
Despite their reputation
Pleased to watch you dance alone

In the evening sun
In the evening sun

Go your separate way now
Someday you'll come back
And I'll be dreaming I was sun burnt
I don't wanna make your heart
And break you heart in two half's
Keep one half
And give one half to me
I like the sun
Miss the summer
Tell me what you do
Nothing will do

Oh act as they pretended
It seems as they will sometimes lie
Oh kids are always honest
Cos they don't think their ever gonna die
Oh your the pretty smartest captain of the team
I love you more than being seventeen

In the evening sun
In the evening sun

How did anybody find it out
I was hiding from the world. I was a squirrel
You chopped down my tree to get my fur

Here you come
Falling asleep [x3]
You're no fun [x10]

I guess everybody's week must have been pretty rough
'Cause everybody is drunk, loud, and pissed off
I know you hate to be impressed with someone else (other than yourself)
But you know, trying to hold back on being an asshole helps

The Strokes,"Well I don't feel better
When I'm fucking around
And I don't write better
When I'm stuck in the ground
So don't teach me lessons
As I've already learned
Yeah the sun will be shining
And my children will burn

Oh the heart beats in its cage

I don't want what you want
I don't feel what you feel
See I'm stuck in a city
But I belong in a field

[Repeat x7]
And ya left 

Now it's three in the morning and
You're eating alone

Oh the heart beats in its cage

All our friends they're laughing at us
All of those you love, you mistrust
Help me I'm just not quite myself
Look around there's no one else there
I went to the concert and I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around

[Repeat x7]
Oh yes I left

I'm sorry you were thinking I would steal your fire.
Oh the heart beats in its cage
Yes the heart beats in its cage

And the heart beats in its cage",Heart in a Cage
The Strokes,"I think I know what you mean but watch what you say
'Cause they'll be trying to knock you down in some way
Sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep
How do you wake someone up from inside a dream?

You mind would wander and search for its place in the night
Your body followed this feeling like following light
Once that your music was born it followed you 'round
And It gave you activities meaning and let you be loud

You're sad but you smiled
Its not in your eyes
Your eyeballs don't change
It's the muscles around your eyes

An egg to fertilize
A pulse to stabilize
A body to deodorize
A life to scrutinize
A child to criticize
Young adults to modernize
Citizens to terrorize
Generations to desensitize

You're dreams are sweet and obsessed
And you're overworked
You're over taken by visions of being overlooked
I'm disappointed would the I.D.I.P.P be
To see such our power in our hands all wasted on greed

Am I a prisoner to instincts
Or do my thoughts just live as free
And detached as boats to the dock?

Just like music was born
And detached from your heart
Is your free time to free minds
Or for falling apart?

Night after night
You turn off the light
You don't fall asleep
Right away
Are we, are we done?

A desk to organize
A product to advertise
A market to monopolize
Movie stars you idolize
News to scandalize
Enemies to neutralize
No time to apologize
Fury to tranquilize
Weapons to synchronize
Cities to vapor-I",Ize of the World

But it's easy, can't you see?

If he colored it black
And that he wouldn't sound as harsh if he could tone it all back
They dressed him up in a craze
To make him look pretty
They said the kids would dig
If he looked like he came from the city
They listened back to his cut
His music was tight

In the chorus it might
Sound fresher than ever

And all the ladies will sing it

So why don’t you lose the innocent face

That you can just save me from running the race

'Cause it’s so hard to say no to a girl with those little black pumps

Shake it you got to take it
Baby don’t break it, make me believe
It’s over give me the shoulder, give me it colder

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

The Style Council,"I stood as tall as a mountain
I never really thought about the drop
I trod over rocks to get there
Just so I could stand on top

Clumsy and blind I stumbled
As I crawled through desert sands
I didn't stop to think about the consequences
As it came to pieces in my hands

Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu
Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu

I thought I was a maritime marvel
I believed that I ruled the waves
All I could say is time is motion
And every effort others made I would save

I was a shit stained statue
School children would stand in awe
I truly believed I was a ceiling of sky
Never thought about having flaws

Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu
Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu

I felt as reverent as Jesus
The sanctimony stunk
I thought I was admiral of the missing fleet
I couldn't see that I was sunk

I roared my pride in the darkness
I scratched away at the stars
I thought I was lord of this crappy jungle
I should have been put behind bars

Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu
Tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu tu are you, tu

But now I sit with my head in my hands
And wail to the weeping wall
The avalanche of my emotions
Holds the audience of one enthralled

I'm learning the lesson the hard way
Like a fall from command
I thought I was king of the whole wide world
But it just came to pieces in my hands
",It Just Came to Pieces in My Hands
The Style Council,"Handed down from fathers to sons
Was the hatred of weakness and the love of guns
A talk of peace but not in our time
To save our souls and stop the crime

Onwards and upwards but going nowhere
So how many now truthfully swear
That they do no evil, see no wrong
The ad-mass agents, the writers of song
The bankers, the poets, the modern day seers
Clouding an issue that was never quite clear

Sent through the ages of boy to man
The living testament of making a stand
Killing the wicked then raising the dead
Eating propaganda and shit spoon fed

Grasping for wisdom, but thick all the same
So how many innocents now can claim
That they play with fire and get burnt
And through the same mistakes never get learnt
Hoping for a time it will fall to place
Faith shall show as our saving grace

Handed down from God with love
Was the whole wide world and some above
But not content to share the land
Greed was shown the winning hand

And those whose greed was the strongest of all
Took upon themselves to lead the call
That some must work while other rest
Without the question of what is best
The leaders, the losers and the kings
Pass the rifle butt that tyranny brings

Passed on over to the chosen few

Was the promise of freedom with a breadline queue
Ghetto's, gateaux and eating it too
Forcing it all down with a cola brew
The first amendment and the hunt for reds

A conscious contradiction with something said
That they see no evil with eyes shut tight
A cocaine culture that offers no fight
Dragged from birth, drugged to death
The common excuse is just being yourself

Hand us down before it's too late
The strength and wisdom to change our state
Governed by evil and all it will bring
I can't wait for the day they do the lamppost swing

And no mercy should they be shown
For you cannot reason with the devil's own
They say, they hear no evil, hands clasped tight
To shut out the victims' screams of ol' Uncle Sam fights
He sweats and he strains as his boney frame comes

Into the womb of an innocent one

The Style Council,"When I find you waiting hours; oh,
You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a head start for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space between us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week

You'll find you've got the strength
You can move a mountain
You just need the confidence

Let no one say they're better than you
You must believe you've got the power

To rise above the lies
'Cause what we're dealing here with today is a love thing
Right here, right now
Now listen

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
and this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock

I tried to think of an alibi

They need that little bit extra

They tried to tell me their's was the right way
I tried to shout that was a lie

Untouched by unhuman hands
'Cause only God knows I don't call that a man

The Style Council,"For liberty there is a cost - its broken skulls and leather cosh,
From the boys in uniform - now you know whose side their on -
With backing - with blessing,
From earthly gods not heaven,
A stones throw away from it all.

Whatever pleasures those who get - from stripping skin with rhino whip,
Are the kind that must be stopped - before their kind take all we've got -
With loving - with caring,
They take great pride in working,
The stones throw away from it all.

Whenever honesty persists - you'll hear the snap of broken ribs,
Of anyone who'll take no more - of the lying bastards roar -
In chile - in poland,
Johannesburg - south yorkshire,
A stones throw away: now we're there.",A Stones Throw Away
The Style Council,"Getcha mining soul deep - with a lesson in history
There's people fighting for their communities
Don't say this struggle - does not involve you
If you're from the working class this is your struggle too
If they spent more on life as they do on death
We might find the money to make industry progress
There's mud in the waters - there's lies upon the page
There's blood on the hillsides and they're not getting paid
There's brother 'gainst brother - there's fathers against sons
But as for solidarity, I don't see none
(Let's change that - let's fight back)

Going on 10 months now - will it take another 10
Living on the breadline - with what some people send
Just where is the backing from the TUC
If we aren't united there can only be defeat

Think of all those brave men - women and children alike
Who built the unions so others might survive
In better conditions - than abject misery
Not supporting the miners - betrays that legacy

There's brother 'gainst brother - there's fathers against sons
Let's change that - let's fight back!

Up north the temperature's rising
Down south she's wine and dining
We can't afford to let the government win
It means death to the trade unions
And the cash it costs to close 'em
Is better spent trying to keep 'em open
Try to feel the pain in those seeds planted
Now are the things that we take for granted
Like the power to strike if we don't agree
With the bosses that make those policies
That keep us down and keep us dumb
So don't settle for less than the No. one!",Soul Deep [*]

Have you ever woke to find the morning didn't come
Undelivered with the papers - stolen by someone
Found the milkman bound and gagged and shackles ' round the sun
And the holder of the keys turns out to be the one

Powerless to change its course, your feet fixed to the floor

Bitter turns to sugar - some call a passive tune

The winds after the blast
I wish we'd move together - this time the bosses sued
But we're caught up in the wilderness and an ever changing mood
Teardrops turn to children - who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through - another's evil mind

The love we leave too late
I wish we'd wake up one day - an' everyone feel moved

Let the rivers run dry

Who kills the Grace treads with intent
Into Heaven's domain, playing little Christians
Hear their voice soar in church
Giving thanks for this earth

Waiting helpless for dignity

For as surely as spring will come
Bringing freshness to order's dance
Until the ices melt away, then we will live again

I will try, I will succeed to train my sights upon the deep
And wait for summer's bloom to come
Bringing warmth to the frozen hearts
Until the skies are filled with love, then we will live again

I will search, I will find and grow again, the parts that died
Like the changes that autumn brings
We need the courage to go ahead
And not cling on to the past, then we can live again

The Style Council,"It's either,
Something in their eyes or something in the drink
But whatever it is they both stop and think
There's no going back and nothing above
It's lust or loneliness, but never love.
She takes a breath as he takes his keys
First name terms is the extent of it
there's no getting out as they're going in
But by tomorrow they both will begin

To regret and renege on a bond they have struck
A small price to pay and casual luck
Some lose nothing, some lose a lot
But whatever we have is all we have got.

In half light and silence for their clothes to remove
There's doubt in her mind but hope in her heart
That this last one of many may be the start.

So they wriggle and writhe for an hour or two
But time has no place when two are consumed.
They moan and they gasp but they don't really speak
As no conversation could fit this scene.

And tomorrow as always, always comes
As she slips away, he still dumb
He felt the urge just as she felt the need
Now the need to get out, still carrying his seed,
Which trickles down her leg and onto her shoe
Onto the pavement and then out of view
Into the gutter and down into a drain
Joining a river and there to remain 

There's no going back and there's nothing above
It's lust and loneliness that drives us along

You told me once I know, but loves a thing that can go
Vanish in the night, its gone by morning's light

Stay - in my arms always, never go away
I'll make this moment last and put time in the past
Where time alone can stop - stop me thinking

Walking the night - I'm wondering if I'm gonna see you again
You left me standing by wracked with wondering
Why I feel so insecure, yes a mad thing I know
but I can't help myself, shake this feeling off

The Style Council,"I don't know why, I went missing
It could have been the call of night
It could have been a change of mind.
I don't know why, I went missing
And though lost I found myself
Where I had been all the time.

When the clock chimes I shall be gone
But judge not the action but what went wrong
I'm no saint but I'm no sinner
That's one of the reasons why, I went missing.

Took me off to somewhere nice
a night at half bored in paradise.

There's plenty more I could have kissed
And those who wanted it - I could of resist
But I blamed myself for this out of town kissing
I made up an excuse of why I went missing.

But truth as in fiction is sometimes strained
And love and contradiction have a part to play
I once blamed myself now I blame you
Why I went missing is a fictional truth.

This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,

Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""

Comfort and joy

Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.

Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;

Unto the Lord did pray.

With every single step you take,
The longer you will have to wait.
The sigh in a silent room is a big mistake.
And now I forget my name,
I left it back in yesterday.
I'll never see, never know what's coming round my way..
What's coming round my way? 
The thieves and the rebels,
They know it all, they know it:
Where you go I follow!
Take me away to another place..
Each day comes, it passes.
And I walk by with my head held high;
Where you go I follow!
Take me away to another place, UGH! 
And now I forget my name,
I left it back in yesterday.
I'll never see, never know what's coming round my way..
What's coming round my way? 
The thieves and the rebels,
They know it all, they know it:
Where you go I follow!
Take me away to another place...
Each day comes, it passes.
And I walk by with my head held high;
Where you go I follow!
Take me away to another place... 
And now I forget my name,
I left it back in yesterday.
And when you breathe that loudest sigh.
In a silent room, It's a big mistake! 
The thieves and the rebels,
They know it all, they know it:
Where you go I follow!

In the fattest largest cloud up there. 
He's whiter than white and cleaner then clean. 
He wants to reach me.

But if he does I always notice him. 
Getting ready in his airy room. 
He's picking his gloves so gently off. 
He wants to touch me.

Pulling my collar it gets bigger, woooh

It really surprised me,
He put me in a bath tub, 
Made me squeeky clean, 
Really clean.

You must taste
The forbidden fruit.
 
He said hi. I said hi, 
I was still clean.

But if he does he'd want to get down from that cloud, 
First marzipan fingers then marble hands, 
More silent than silence and slower than slow,
Diving towards me.

They start at the chest and move slowly down.
 
I thought I had seen everything,
He wasn't white and fluffy, 
He just had side burns,
He just had side burns, 
And a quiff, 
He said hi.

When the revolution takes place
I'll be late
And be shot as a traitor

When the revolution takes place

When the sun rises I will not see a thing
I regret nothing, it was worth it
To go through life without an hourglass
It paid off

It paid off profusely
My reward was to be free and alone
Even now tied to the pillar
Blindfold at sunrise
And drums are Catalan beating

My heartbeat keeps up with the drums
But soon my pulse will fade away
My fade away, I smile
For I know when the sun rises
I will not see a thing

Bottomless dust, terrific sun,
And wetting quite nicely thank you,
I do say nicely,
I do mean that,
Actually.

Deserves lobster and fame,
Oh, Johnny,
Teeth and gums,
In my life,
Moon and sun,
In my life,
Lobster and shrimp,
In my life,
I don't really like lobster ( like lobster ).
 
Regina is too old
But the sun is much older
Still the sun with white teeth
But Mrs R. with none
Sun with false teeth
Give me lobster and fame.

So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby 
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

New York New York big city of dreams 
But everything in New York ain't always what it seem 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (haha ha ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! HUH!

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms
Chaka, 'cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you Chaka baby 'cause my name is Melle Mel

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

I was sitting on the corner just a wasting my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see huh!
The rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the be bop swing
To have Stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
To own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
'Cause rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap something people wanted to hear
See before my reign it was the same old same
You took ""the ba with the ba""
That's street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're stepping out of here
You ever think you're getting up, down, around or in huh huh!
You better think again my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off

Well, I'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow
So what ya M.C's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's at cock
I'll be carrying out bodies stiff as a rock
Carrying out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
'Cause anything you wanna do I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my M.C school, my class was packed
And tricks were for kids so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I'll buy a mansion for my mother
A 24/7, the cool-aid smile
Say hey Track 11, look at my power

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off

Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

c'mon
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand
Because I look good, do you hear my man?
And if you can't take that ya chump ya own hand
You one-girl-at-a-time getting M.C
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework you would surely find
When Scorp get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talking don't pay, you're drifting away
When I see you on a stage I'm a blow you away
You're right, there is no difference between me and you
Except I look good and you look Through
Take that!

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped in to the M.C scene
Biting your moves, taking fake awards
Saying everyone else was perpertrating a fraud
But your nothing but a clone of my flesh and bone
Now you trying to play grown on the microphone
But I'll tell ya 'bout a night, and ya know I'm right
When you listen to us rocking to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpertrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the word of the master teacher
Or you die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat ya
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why were gonna get everything we want
'Cause like a shadow in the night, I'm the sight unseen
And I'm the bona-fide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
'Cause my rhymes make vowels plus they make sense
See I'm down with Cowboy, you will rock the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and huh! Scorpio
Kami-Kazi, Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And going down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm a make you my slave
And I'm a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme then bury yourself huh!
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only M.C that'll never die
So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top
But when you se Melle Mel you're gonna have to drop
RAAH!

And not only that!

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

Now for all you M.C's, you heard my story
On my superfly cold crushin' fame and glory
How I rocked the children and the young ladies
I even rocked the countries that was overseas
'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm a do it to you
I'm a show ya how I rocked it y'all all night long
But when I rock with Chaka Khan I just said

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you

I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you Chaka baby 'cause my name is Melle Mel

Say what y'all
Say what!

To the D.J's scratch, you've met your match
'Cause were coming out fresh with a brand new batch
So taking you off into the galaxy

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so-so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy

Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""you want some more?""

The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Till one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

The Sugarhill Gang,"I said a hip hop
Hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it out
Bubba to the bang bang boogie, boobie to the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat

Now, what you hear is not a test I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown
The purple and yellow, but first, I gotta

Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along
And the next on the mic is my man Hank
C'mon, Hank, sing that song, check it out

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the Freak, Spank, and do the Bump
And when the sucker MC's try to prove a point
We're Treacherous Trio, we're the serious joint

A from sun to sun and day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was coming home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""by the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane""

""And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""he's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""you need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere

Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ

Everybody go, ""ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ
So I just take half, and bust 'em out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house

I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat

And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sureshot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same

I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got

I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor

I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind.  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo
And guess what, America, we love you

'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""

So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese

Oh so you say ""that's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""

And I know it seems like no use

The bomb is gotta stop Â­the bomb is gonna pop! [Repeat x4]

Praying to go somewhere,
And everyday I turn to gold and rock my shades,

And do you dream of me when the lights go down,
And do you breathe me in the smoke from your cigarettes,
Do you feel me with every breath?

And every morning she wakes up,
Puts on her make up, and sings my song,

A story about a girl.
No, you don't need to know what her name is,
But I wrote about her before.
I wish that I would figure it
Tucked down deep in her pockets.
She'd light me up, let me swing from her lips
Like a circus show.

This ain't a show, no
It's a song for a girl.
She's making my head spin,
Making me slur my words.
This is a song about a girl.
This is a song about love,
Love, la la la love.
I won't forget her name.
I'll always love her the same, my love
Love, la la la la la la love.

'Til I'm nothing.
Like a vision,
She swims through the sheets on the mattress.
She sets me on fire through the afterglow
Like a firework show.

Baby, I got 'em.
Bought a plastic ring if you want it.
'Cause we're growin' up, girl
But damn, still young.
If you jump, we can fall.
If you jump, we can fall in love

I won't forget her name,
Always love her the same, my love.

From her cowboy boots
Up to her little black dress
I need a Jameson shot of confidence

She says I can't sleep alone
I really like The Stones and I hate TV

I'm a little obsessed with Dawson's Creek
Yeah I know what you're thinking
It's not what it seems
Can I buy you a drink?

A friend in the eye of the storm.
And when all the lights burn out
I'll carry you out of the dark,

Chasing New York minutes from pacific time
And if I didn't believe in you, why the hell am I still here?
Like an album gloss we're lost in, even after all these years.

If you're dizzy now, when your world is caving in

We brought ourselves into the dream

Like you were a ten years old. 
You've never had the courage 
To have someone fight against you. 
 
You've always preferred having 
The others pull the strings. 
Waiting for an easy victory, 
You've never been the first in line, 
Never the one for the trial lap, 
Never the first one to jump, 
Never the one that works hard.

Have to believe in what you hope for,

And I've seen every loney roadhouse for the Top End to the Bight
And I've been across the nullabor at least a dozen times

You think you really want me but there's some thing you should know
If you try to tie me down I'll just get up and go 

And if you're lookin' for me tomorrow morning, I'll be gone
And if you think I wouldn't leave without a warning, you'd be wrong

Don't come looking here if your looking for a wife
'cause I'll be gone

You can pull me on the dance floor you can buy me a rum
But don't look at me that way 'cause I'm not looking for the one
I've met every witless w*nker from the Kimberley to Cairns
And I'd trade a hundred lovers for a dozen ice cold cans

You think you really want me but there's some thing you should know
If you try to tie me down I'll just get up and go

Gone like a truckie in the morning light
Off like a rocket on outta sight, I'm gone

The Sunset All Stars,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You
The Sunset All Stars,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes

Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Shoulda known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me

I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to

I've been catching up on my sleep
""Why don't you make a very special effort?""
""Why don't you just give me peace?""
I try to fix it so many times
But there's something wrong with my mind, because
I'm her lover, her lazy, lazy lover
I can't be bothered getting into bed
I'm her lover, her lazy, lazy lover
I'd much rather do it in my head
Sitting in her garden, sitting in a deckchair,
She's in a swimsuit eating ice-cream
Looking delicious,
Don't mean to be malicious
But my mind isn't where it should be.
I try to fix it so many times

I try to get it out but all I hear from you are lies
I can tell you're going through the motions

Once again we're playing off emotion
Which one of us will burn until the end.

Catalyst you exist to pull me down,
You contradict the fact that you still want me around,
And its all downhill from here,
And its all downhill from here

Reoccurring episodes with each and every kiss

I'm running till it all sets in

The Superstarz Kids!,"I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you

Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and onto someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must
Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby.
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

I never will forget those nights.
I wonder if it was a dream.
Remember how you made me crazy,
Remember how I made you scream.
I don't understand what happened to our love.
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back,
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

I can see you,

And you're smiling at everyone.

Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac.
A little voice inside my head said:
""Don't look back, you can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was.
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever.
I should just let 'em go, but

I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got that top pulled down,
And that radio on, baby.

Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right

The Supremes,"Love came through my window and right out the door
Leaving me alone and hurt forever more
Suddenly you came, you saw, you captured my heart
So tenderly you came to rescue in time this heart of mine.

Now no more by myself, no more hurt to be felt
And no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again
And no more long and sleepless nights
Now that I am in love again

Once in heartbreak I believed always in heartache
Lost in sorrow with little hope for tomorrow
Instantly when you smiled at me my heart stood still
All the emptiness I had inside you lovingly fulfilled.

And the note he sings was this, ah

Poor Johnny, one note
Sang out with, ""Gusto""
And just overlorded the place

Yelled willy nilly
Until he was blue in the face

For holding one note was his ace
Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class by himself, by gum

Poor Johnny, one note
Got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave

He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned 'round in his grave

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Ev'ry one was mute
Johnny stood alone

Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo, all were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping
Traffic ceased its roar

And they tell us Niag'ra stood still
He stopped the train whistles
Boat whistles, steam whistles, cop whistles
All whistles bowed to his skill

Sing out with, ""Gusto""
And just overwhelm all the crowd

The Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the Zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charmes us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers in the wilds
And starve together, dear in Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny on a roll
In Central Park, we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

The Supremes,"Mom was cooking bread
She wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low
Rolled to her feet, she just didn't know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh no matter how she tried, she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her

In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train
I married a guy, was livin' high
I didn't want him to know her
She had a grandson, two years old
I never even showed her

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you are not to blame, Momma, I miss you

Came the telegram
Mom passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best, ah! cookin', cleanin'
Always in the same old dress
Workin' hard down on her knees
Always try'n to please
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you've done your best
Momma, I miss you
Won't you forgive me Momma
For all the wrong I've done
I know you have done your best
I know you have done your very best you could
But I never understood

The Supremes,"Hey!  Life, look at me, I can see the reality
'Cause when you shook me, took me outta my world, I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
When you find that you left the future behind
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of
Then you better beware of

The happening
One day you're up, when you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me and it can happen to you

I was sure, I felt secure until love took a detour
Yeah!  Riding high on top of the world, it happened
Suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams torn apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose a precious love you need to guide you
Something happens inside you

The happening
Now I see life for what it is
It's not of dreams, it's not of bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you
And then it happened
Oo, and then it happened
Oo, and then it happened
Oo, and then it happened

Is it real?  Is it fake?
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine for certain
Suddenly it starts hurtin'
I saw the light too late when that fickle finger of fate
Yeah!  It came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up, so sure
I felt secure until love took a detour
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of
Then you better beware of

She wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low
Rolled to her feet, she just didn't know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh no matter how she tried, she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her

In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train
I married a guy, was livin' high
I didn't want him to know her
She had a grandson, two years old
I never even showed her

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you are not to blame, Momma, I miss you

Came the telegram
Mom passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best, ah! cookin', cleanin'
Always in the same old dress
Workin' hard down on her knees

For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting.
Whenever you are near, I Hear A Symphony, 
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms.
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine.
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind.
I'm lost in a world made for you and me.
Oo love me.  
Whenever you are near I Hear A Symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby.
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within, 
Don't let this feeling end, 
Let it go on and on and on now baby.
 
Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes, 
I care not for myself but for those 
Who've never felt the joy we've felt.
Whenever you are near,
I Hear A Symphony each time you speak to me 
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love.
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me 
Whispering how much you care,
A thousand violins fill the air now.
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end,
Keep standing close to me,
Oo so close to me, baby, baby.

Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep.
Spoken:  My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there

The Supremes,"All day long I hear my telephone ring
Friends calling giving their advice
From the boy I love, I should break away
'Cause heartaches he'll bring one day

But it's not gonna happen twice
'Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights

But now he's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied

It's easy for friends to say let him go
But I'm the one who needs him so
It's his love that makes me strong
Without him I can't go on

This time I'll live my life at ease
Being happy lovin' whom I please
And each time we make romance
I'll be thankful for a second chance

The Surfaris,"Uh-look-ah there
There she comes
Here comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when 
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with older guys from out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else

Hey look-ah there
Across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to myself 
That car's fine lookin' man
It's somethin' else

Hey look-ah here
Just wait and see
Workin' hard and savin' my dough
I'll buy that car that I've be wanting so 
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
The town will be all shocked with my white top down
I'll keep right on and dreamin' and-ah thinkin' to myself 
When it all comes true, man
Wow! That's somethin' else

Look-ah here
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am ah-knockin' on her door 
My car's out front and it's all mine 
Just a '41 Ford not a '59
I got that girl and I'm-ah thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man
Wow! She's somethin' else",Somethin' Else
The Sursiks,"Merry Christmas, baby, you really did treat me nice
Merry Christmas, baby, you really did treat me nice
Bought me a hi-fi for Christmas, now I'm living in paradise
Well, I'm feelin', mighty fine, I got good music on my radio
Well, I feel so fine, I got good music on my radio
Yes, I want to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe

Santa came down the chimney, 'bout a half past three
Left all these pretty presents that you see before me
Merry Christmas baby, you really been good to me

I will always love you baby
Now I'm happy as I can be",Please Call Me
The Suspenders,"Lace up your boots and we'll broom on down
To a knocked out shack on the edge of town
There's an eight beat combo that just won't quit
Keep walkin' 'til you see a blue light lit
Fall in there and we'll see some sights
At the house of blue lights
 
There's fryers and broilers and Detroit barbecue ribs
But the treat of the treats 
Is when they serve you all those fine eight beats
You'll want to spend the rest of your brights
Down at the house, the house of blue lights
 
We'll have a time and we'll cut some rug
While we dig those tunes like they should be dug
It's a real home comin' for all the ""Cats""
Just trilly down a path of welcome mats
Fall in there and we'll see some sights
At the house of blue lights
 
There's fryers and broilers and Detroit barbecue ribs
But the treat of the treats 
Is when they serve you all those fine eight beats
You'll want to spend the rest of your brights
Down at the house, the house of blue lights",House of Blue Lights
The Sutherland Brothers,"I know you wanna leave me,
But I refuse to let you go,
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy,
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, 
Please don't leave me, girl, 
Don't you go.
 
Now I've heard a cryin' man
Is half a man with no sense of pride,
But if I have to cry to keep you,
I don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, 
Please don't leave me, girl, 
Don't you go.
 
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away,
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand,
'cause I wanna keep you any way I can.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, 
Please don't leave me, girl, 
Don't you go.
 
Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart,
And each day it grows more and more,
I'm not ashamed to call and plead to you, baby,
If pleading keeps you from walking out that door.
 
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it,
Please don't leave me girl,
Don't you go,
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby,

The Sutherland Brothers,"I forgot just what it is to want
And I forget just what it is I always wanted
I forget the last time that I didn't cry over absolutely nothing at all
And this is getting so old
And I am getting so old
And this is getting so old
And you're just getting so old
I always thought if I was about to leave
I'd have something more to say
I don't want your revelations
I got stuck here on my own
Didn't someone say that things just have to get better?
'cause this is getting so old
And I am getting so old

And you lost everything you had
And you lost everything you had
{reach for the sky}

If it makes you feel better
{reach for the sky}
Do you remember what you want
And is it really any better?
Is it really any better?
Do you feel a whole lot better?
Is this really any better?",Reach for the Sky
The Sutherland Brothers,"I was in chains, chained to my love
Lying sleeping below the silver trees
Then up comes Davey and says
You must be running boy

Now I must fly, now I must fly
First to my darling down in the valley
I cried madly, hey, I'm here at your door
She says, John, John now be gone from my door
You and your misery I'll taste no more

I was in chains and bound for Australia
Dreaming wildly about my life before
Of my distrust all across the dreadful ocean
And of my true love I'll lay no more
And of my true love I'll lay no more

Oh, I was in chains and bound for Australia
Dreaming wildly about my life before
Of my distrust all across the dreadful ocean
And of my true love I'll lay no more
And of my true love I'll lay no more

Oh the, oh the future
The future before me, oh

?",I Was in Chains
The Sutherland Brothers,"Look at the rain and look at the stars tonight
All fallin' down on me
See them tumble through my door
I look at your face
The light is in your eyes
And there's something there I need
I long to hold a little more

Moonlight lady, let me in
Take me in your arms again
I'm lost, in trouble here tonight
Moonlight lady, hold my hands
And let me know you understand
When I say I need a friend
Stay here with me till the end

Deep in the heart of nowhere
I'm still on the lookout for a sign
That there's an answer in the cards
The more apart, the more I need you at my side
To shine the light you have
To guide me through the stars

Stay here with me till the end
Moonlight lady let me in",Moonlight Lady
The Swallows,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
The Swallows,"Dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dip
Dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dip
Sitting here wondering what it's all about
This rock and roll music that makes you shout
You tune in on Bandstand and they're jumping like mad
And the dance that they're doing it don't look bad
You get that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping 
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping 
You're a rocking and a rolling
You don't understand it but it sure feels nice
You thought you might try it 'bout a once or twice
You started with that dance they call the stroll
But you felt much better doing rock and roll
You get that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs are flapping 
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping
You're a rocking and a rolling
 
You don't understand it but it sure feels nice
You thought you might try it 'bout a once or twice
You started with that dance they call the stroll
But you felt much better doing rock and roll
You get that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs are flapping 
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping
You're a rocking and a rolling
 
You come in the house with your hair all in
Nobody had to ask you where you been
You come in the house, you're still jumping like mad
I seen a lot of people with it but a you've got it bad
You got that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping 
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping
You're a rocking and a rolling
I don't understand it why you go go go
There must be something 'bout this music that I don't know
I went to a hop and it didn't take long
I got the feeling something was a going wrong
You got that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping 
You're a rocking and a rolling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping 
You're a rocking and a rolling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping

You could never understand girl 
I was living on desire 
But that was just the way we were 

'Til you make a world of love in you
