Clay Aiken,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows that turkey and some mistletoe
Can help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you",The Christmas Song
Clay Aiken,"Don't get so busy that you miss
Giving just a little kiss
To the ones you love
And don't even wait a little while
To give them a little smile
A little is enough

How many people are crying
Some people are dying,
How many people are askin' for love

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday

[Chorus]
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love

How could you wait another minute
A hug is warmer when you're in it
Oh Baby that's a fact
And saying ""I love you's"" always better
Seasons, reasons, they don't matter
So don't hold back
How many people in this world
So needful in this world
How many people are praying for love

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday

[Chorus]

Let all the children know
Everywhere that they go
Their whole life long
Let them know love

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Yeah, and give a little love everyday

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
Cause holidays have come and gone

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
Cause holidays have come and gone",Don't Save It All for Christmas Day

Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough

The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the earth
The Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

No more let sins and sorrows reign,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessing flow
For as the curse is found,
For as the curse is found,
For as, for as the curse is found.

He rules the world
With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, and wonders of His love
And wonders, and wonders of His love",Joy to the World

Clay Aiken,"She leaned with her head on the window 
Watching evergreen bend in the snow 
Remembering Christmas the way it had been 
So many seasons ago. 

When children would reach for their stockings 
And open the presents they found 
The lights on the tree would shine bright in their eyes 
Reflecting the love all around. 

This year there's no one to open the gifts 
No reason for trimming the tree 
And just as a tear made it's way to the floor 
She heard voices outside start to sing. 

Merry Christmas to all who may dwell here 
Merry Christmas if even just one 
May the joy of the season surround you 
Merry Christmas with love. 

Carolers sang as she opened the door 
Faces of friends in the crowd 
And all of the shadows of lonely reminders 
Driven away by the sound. 

Now the heart that for years had been silent 
Was suddenly filled with a song 
As she clung to their hands like a child in the night 
She found her self singing along. 

Merry Christmas to all who may dwell here 
Merry Christmas if even just one 
May the joy of the season surround you 
Merry Christmas. 

Merry Christmas to all who may dwell here 
Merry Christmas if even just one 
May the joy of the season surround you 
Merry Christmas with love

Clay Aiken,"Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Til' He appeared and the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on Your knees
Oh hear the Angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born

Clay Aiken,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too.
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""Yoo-hoo!""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, it's grand,
Just holding your hand.

We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we.
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two.
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray.
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day.
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop,
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop. Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy,
When they pass around the turkey and the pumpkin pie.
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives.
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives!

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too.
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""Yoo-hoo!""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride
Clay Aiken,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we stroll along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"", we'll say ""No, man,
But you can do the job when you're in town.""

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play
The Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.",Winter Wonderland
Clay Aiken,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unshared
Until it died in his silence

And Solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing Solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And Solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope, goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
Solitaire
And by himself it's easy to pretend 
He'll never love again
Oh

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire
Solitaire, solitaire",Solitaire
Clay Aiken,"You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right

For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful

You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me
Through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life

You've been my inspiration
Through the lies, you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

Because you loved me
You saw the best in me
Because you loved me

You saw the best in me
Because you loved me
Because you loved me
",Because You Loved Me
Clay Aiken,"Baby, I don't understand
Why we can't just hold on
To each other's hands

This time might be the last time I fear
Unless I make it all so clear
I need you so

We're in this life together
Even when one moves without the other
Different pages from the same story

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong
And make it right

This aching is familiar
It's something I remember
We can't touch without feeling
Can't heal without healing

Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
I need you so

Only the young could fall so hard
Can be so careless, and ignorance costs

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Let us in

So you've moved out of the way this time
Making room for each other
One without the other
We are broken but we are moving still

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

We're in this life together
Even when one moves without the other

You got to learn to fly, learn to live that love so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up for us and let us in

We are broken but we are moving still
A thousand different ways
",Broken Wings
Clay Aiken,"Baby, if we can't solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears?
Oh, so you go again
When the leading man appears
Always the same theme
But can't you see we've got everything going on and on and on

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

(Every time you go)

Go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to me
I can feel your body move
But does it mean that much to me
I can't go on singing the same theme
Can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Oh ooh,

Clay Aiken,"Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted all of the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

What do I say when it's all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word?

It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd

Would you reach out for tomorrow or try to turn back time?

These open arms will wait for you
These open arms can pull us through
Between what's left and left to do
These open arms, these open arms
These open arms will wait for you

Did you really love the ones you said you loved, think twice
And did you make a bit of difference in somebody else's life?
Tell me is there someone you can count on when you need a friend?
Can you see I need a friend?

These open arms will wait for you
These open arms can pull us through
Between what's left and left to do
These open arms, these open arms
These open arms will wait for you

Give in, stop questioning why
Open your heart up to love
And you'll see, you will find

And when everything was said and done, they'd go back home
They ought to know, they ought to know
That you're mine, all mine",A Thousand Days
Clay Aiken,"Why do we have to fight?
Why can't spend our time, trying?
I wanna be close to you
Keep love from slipping through, my hands
The words said in anger aimed at someone
Are hard to take back once the damage is done

Let's stop now.

[Chorus]
As long as we're here, alive on this earth
I'm gonna love you, for all that it's worth
And one of these days, we're gonna understand why.

Let's make the most of our time
As long as we're here (Yeah)

Some people live their lives
Holding their fears, inside them
Afraid to build windows
To let the light of the world in.
They hide in the darkness of self-imposed walls
If they could just tear them down, they'd have it all

[Chorus]

Let's make the most of our time
As long as we're here (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

When you're with me, I breathe easy
You are my need, right now love me

Oh, I'll make the most of our time
As long as we're here,
As long as we're here.",As Long as We're Here
Clay Aiken,"Get out of my dreams
There's no room left
Get out of my bed.
We did goodbye yesterday
Don't you think I heard what you said

You want too much
You play too hard

Well, well you invade my morning light again
Don't wanna answer the phone
I went to sleep last night angry
I'm sure I was alone
You know me well
Always ring my bell

And tell me what would I want from you
'Cause you tried so hard to be who you are
But there's no way I understand what you do
The last of a dying breed
'Cause we've come this far,
But it has to stop
You're everything
Everything I don't need.

(Get out of my dreams)
(Get out of my bed)
(Get out of my room)
(Get out of my head)

I don't wanna listen to answers
To the questions I didn't ask
It's all about you ,I wanna move out
Before the breakdown starts.

It's all wrong
Won't you let me go
And tell me what would I want from you
'Cause you tried so hard to be who you are
But there's no way I understand what you do
The last of a dying breed
'Well we've come this far,
But it has to stop
You're everything
Everything I don't need.

You fill my head
You block my view
It's killing me
You're everything I don't need

If it's all I do I'll be free 'cause you've taken everything
Everything I don't need

What would I want from you, oh
'Cause you tried so hard to be who you are
But there's no way I understand what you do.

Clay Aiken,"Silence long lost friend
You've come to me again
Night comes closing in
And the loneliness within
I'm older, should be wiser
Still I never seem to learn

[Chorus]
I'm closer than ever to the edge
And I'm falling, I am falling
From the world I use to know
Been trying to hold on for something for so long
Now this never ending dream won't let go

I am falling

Restless I lie awake
And try to escape
Memories that never sleep
A Taste of bitter sweet
And I hold on to forever
Still I'm stuck in yesterday

[Chorus]

Come back and wake me up again
I can't face this world alone
In my dream I return again
I am falling I am falling

I am falling I am falling
From the world I used to know
Been trying to hold on to something for so long
Now this never ending dream won't let go

Clay Aiken,"Some folks always get the rough ride
Seem they end up on the wrong side
Constant battle just to survive on any given day

Watched a mother on my TV
Hungry children that she can't feed
Still I've got everything that I need
And that just don't seem right
That I sleep safe tonight

[Chorus]
There's gotta be some rhyme or reason why
We turn away and we close our eyes
Wish I could find some way that we could justify all of this suffering
There but for the grace of God go I

Everyday it makes the headlines
Someone struggling for their lives
Feels like I'm watching from the sidelines
When nothing ever changed
Just the truth got rearranged

[Chorus]

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In a truth that we can't even see
But faith holds the hope for the world
And I know, I know

[Chorus]

When I'm thinking it's a bad day
Feels like nothings going my way
I pass a wreck out on the freeway
And I pray that they survived
There but for the grace of God go I.",Grace of God
Clay Aiken,"Maybe I've convinced myself
I've really been in love
And I've been wrong all along

For all I know the feeling and the picture
That I've tried so hard to find
Isn't mine

Could be it's all just a waiting game
Want to share my everything

And on my own it's hard
To tell my heart it'll be alright
This love it holds
Will one day find a home
As hard as love can be
It's harder still it seems
To be a lover all alone without love

Picking up the pieces makes me wonder if
I only build it all to watch it fall
The faster it can go away it means
The less of me is gone to stay
And I'm OK

But lonesome tomorrow comes anyway
I'm alone for another day, another day

And on my own it's hard
To tell my heart it'll be alright
This love it holds
Will one day find a home
As hard as love can be
It's harder still it seems
To be a lover all alone without love
And on my own it's hard
To tell my heart it'll be alright
This love it holds
Will one day find a home
As hard as love can be
It's harder still it seems

Without love

Maybe I've convinced myself
I've really been in love
But I've been wrong
All along",Lover All Alone
Clay Aiken,"I took my first step
On that black and white kitchen floor
I sometimes wonder if that house
Is even there, anymore
I had my first glimpse of love
When I was five
I watched two people split apart
But still the three of us survived

I've seen the best
I've seen the worst
I wouldn't change what I've been through
I've touched the sky
I've hit the wall
But I did what I had to
Oh

[Chorus]
On my way here
Where I am now
I've learned to fly
I have to want to leave the ground
I've fallen hard
But I've been loved
And in the end it all works out
My faith has conquered fear
On my way here.

Oh yeah yeah

My address has changed
Almost every year
I've found that standing still
Can quickly make a lifetime disappear
I'd rather try and fail
A thousand times denied
And this, whenever you feel pain
It lets you know that you're alive

I've been a fool
I've been afraid
Yeah, I've been loved
I've been lied to
I've been wrong
And I've been right
I stood up when I had to

Yeah yeah

[Chorus]

No guarantees
I believed that I would find
An open door or a light
To lead me to the other side
I guess that is why

[Chorus]

Yeah
Oh",On My Way Here
Clay Aiken,"Foolish heart looks like we're here again
Same old game of plastic smile
Don't let anybody in
Hiding my heartache, will this glass house break
How much will they take before I'm empty
Do I let it show, does anybody know?

[Chorus]
But you see the real me
Hiding in my skin, broken from within
Reveal me completely
I'm loosening my grasp
There's no need to mask my frailty
Oh, cause you see the real me

Painted on, life is behind a mask
Self-inflicted circus clown
I'm tired of the song and dance
Living a charade, always on parade
What a mess I've made of my existence
But you love me even now
And still I see somehow

[Chorus]

Shadows of shattered dreams
They followed me
They haunted me
But you've taken the broken pieces of my life
And help me to believe

[Chorus]",The Real Me
Clay Aiken,"Sometimes I feel like I'm chasing the shadows in your eyes.
Loosing my footing and looking for something I recognize.
You tell me you're here for forever
But act like you're passing through
Which one's the real you? Which one's the real you?

[Chorus]
Are you only practicing until you find the real thing?
Taking up space until you find yourself that perfect face
Are you looking over my shoulder am I enough or just your sacrificial love?

I know when we started I kind of talked you into it.
I was good for the moment but now something's missing from your kiss.
I see you lying beside me, but I feel you're moving on.
Which one's the real you? Which one's the real you?

[Chorus]

Do I have to spill my tears?
Teach you how to say goodbye?
If that's not what I am to you, then what am I?
What am I?

[Chorus]

Or just your sacrificial love?",Sacrificial Love
Clay Aiken,"Stop the music, play the song
We'll dance together all night long
The spotlight glows, somehow it knows,
That there's something about us
Something about us

People smile when they walk by
There's too much magic to deny
A fool can see we're meant to be
'Cause there's something about us,
Something about us

[Chorus]
The words on every poet's tongue
Every love song ever sung
Is about us, it's about us
From Romeo and Juliet,
To plays they haven't written yet
It's old and new, it's a classic tale of two
And a perfectly perfect love

You can see it in our ways
In how we spend our nights and days
A crazy laugh, a photograph
There's just something about us
Something about us

[Chorus]

Stop the music, play the song
And we'll dance together all night long
We'll reminisce of moments like this

Well there's something about us.",Something About Us
Clay Aiken,"Has anybody else but me
Ever felt this way before
Like the world is spinning
Much too fast
And you're falling through the floor
Struck by lightning
It's so frightening
When the morning feels like war
Unbreakable
(Don't you wish you were)
Unbreakable

[Chorus]
So, when you fall
Down, down, down
Don't get down on you
Don't you know that
Everybody gets
Down, down, down
Why you trying to
Carry the weight of the world

Some folks say that
We've been blessed
And I know deep down
They're right
But when you're feeling cold
Alone and desperate
And can't get through the night
It seems the only time
You test your wings
You're crashing through the sky
Unbreakable
(Don't you wish you were)

And just like the thunder brings the rain
Something beautiful brings on the pain

[Chorus]
It looks like it's going to be the same this time around
I want to let you in but I don't know how
I've been here one to many times
Seems like whenever I let somebody get this close
I'm right back where I got hurt the most
And that's why, oh that's why
Around my heart is where I draw the line

I wish I could just forget
Not have one more regret behind me to remind me
What I've given up
Could I ever live with this
Knowing that I might have missed my last chance
For love to find me
I could stay here drowning in the rain
Unless you have the strength to save me
Nothing's going to change

[Chorus]
And it's going to be the same this time around
I want to let you in but I don't know how
I've been here one to many times
Seems whenever I let somebody get this close
I'm right back where I got hurt the most
And that's why, oh that's why
Around my heart is where I draw the line

Either you're gonna rescue me
Or you're gonna be the death of me

It's going to be the same this time around
I want to let you in but I don't know how
I've been here one to many times

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

With a sound so pure and so clear
Came words whispered so softly

There, in the middle of knowing
Where my hope had started to sink
Grace, like a dove, guided me onward
And brought me all I wanted to drink

Was pre-ordained a mighty plan
That I should walk with Him alone
The cords of trust unbroken


But fate foresaw my wandering eye
That none could yet restrain
To violate the friendship I
Would cause Him so much pain


Chorus:
And everytime I close my eyes
I see the nails, I hear the cries
He did not keep Himself away
He was no stranger to my pain
He walked a mile in my shoes
He walked a mile


Feet so dusty cracked with heat
But carried on by love's heartbeat
A man of sorrows filled with grief
Forgiveness was His anthem


No feeble blow from tongue or pen
Could ever sway my love for Him
Across the echoed hills He trod
And reached into my world.

We could bring Heaven down out of the sky
If we could love one another
We could bring hate to its knees tonight
Wouldn't every future be bright
If we could love one another

We find it easy enough loving the latest trends
Take something that's dead and make it our closet friend
Imagine what this world could be
If we worked as hard at loving you and me

Don't let your anger get the best of you
When you're provoked you simply refuse

Lift up a soul with the words you speak
Shake it up with a revolution - and set the world on fire.

Ooh the things of wonder we could know
Ooh I want to be illuminated

Reappeared before my eyes

Glowing like a fire

And created to inspire

About a fall from grace
A change of heart a rise to glory

But the places that I led turned out to be so hollow
And in the end I just turned out to be a fool

All I ever wanted was to walk that line
But I jumped across and broke Your heart

And when I turned my back on You, You stood right there
And You never left me, no You never left me

These scars I have, I know they are here to remind me
That everything I've said and done I can leave far behind me
The door is shut and I shall never more return
Everybody says that Your childhood dies

A little bit more every day
But all around me are mercy's eyes
And they'll keep me close to You I pray

Images come to me
Looks like a world gone wrong

I can read it on your face

Clay Crosse,"What would you do for a king
If He won all the battles He went out to fight
And returned as a hero on a starlit night to a cheering crowd?
Would it make you proud?

What would you do for a king
If He kept every promise that He'd ever made
Would you get out the tickertape and lead a parade, a society ball?
Would you care at all?

Kings always seemed to me as such grand, imposing men
So full of stature, full of power
So much authority in every word they say
I never thought I was quite the type
But Iíd still love to meet one someday

What would you do for a king
If He came to your door, would you ask Him in
Would you tell Him how much you admired Him
Do you think you'd dare
Would you be too scared?
Most kings don't seem to know much about the common man
So far removed and set apart
I cheer with thousands, we blend into a roar
Another face in an endless crowd
Is that all I really am, just one more?

So what would you do for a king
If He saw you fishing out by the sea
And He walked up to you and said ""Follow me - it's time you know""
Do you think you'd go?

And what would you do for a king
If He took off his crown and agreed to die
And as you tried to understand it, He looked you in the eye and said,
""This is for you""

Well, what would you do?
",What Would You Do for a King?

Got a love come rain or come shine 

I've placed the blame and you've cursed my name

I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said, ""Son I know you live here
But this is still my home
It's my way or the highway""
So I said alright, ""I'm gone""

And before I slammed that door
I said, ""I hate you""

It'll be here that's a given

And I've walked through the fires of hell
Are you coming back, lord, I don´t know
I guess the silence speaks for itself

He probably told you everything
That´s running through my head
Now it´s much too late to say

You told me just as plain as it could be
How you needed to hear some words of love from me

I hear angels singing.
Telling me to make my move.
Listen to it, their voices ringing, baby.
If you feel it, get in the groove.

Love is a rhythm of two hearts beating,
pounding out a message steady and true.
Talk to me baby, tell me what you're feeling.
I know what love is, what's it to you?

Time's up, train's a-leavin', baby,
Are you ready to take that ride?
Get on board, don't keep me waiting,
Say you're willing to cross that line.

Love is a rhythm of two hearts beating,
pounding out a message steady and true.
Talk to me baby, tell me what you're feeling.
I know what love is, what's it to you?

I'm sure your heart is telling you true.

I guess that's the way that it's meant to be

Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture

She pins back her hair and Lord, she gets them orders out

Them milk shakes must be good, 'cause I just can't get my fill

""Hello,my name is Alice""

She looks like a queen
Workin' in that white palace

When she works the drive-through window I burn up a tank of gas
I get one thing at a time so I can make another pass
I bet I'm the only one who ever gives her a tip
'Cause I love to hear ""thank you"" coming' from those sweet red lips
Someday I'll get up the nerve and ask her for a date
And we'll drive out to Ft. Worth and I'll buy her a t-bone steak

Clay Walker,"The last day of school was the first of June
Me and Bobby watched the clock all afternoon
Waitin' for the bell and Mrs. Greer
To say, ""Have a good summer, see you next year""

That night I couldn't sleep 'cause the very next day
They started up the summertime matinees
With a different movie every afternoon
At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two

Me and Bobby rode rockets into outer space
We drove Daytona and we won the race
We shot a lotta bull and some bad guys too

At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two

Well, the years went by and the price went up
From a couple of quarters to a couple of bucks
Bobby and his family moved away
So I found my little girl to take his place

Me and Betty saw our share of love scenes
We even saw a couple on the movie screen
John Wayne won the lady and I did too

At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two

Now the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
Is a second hand store called 'Nothin' New'
All that's left of the old marquee
Is some broken glass and one crooked 'T'

And I watch old movies on a new TV
With Betty on the couch sittin' next to me
We still hold hands like we used to do

Clay Walker,"Let's go to Louisiana boys
Way down in Louisiana where the moss and cypress grew
You'd find old Jack in a shotgun shack
In the back of the black bayou
Some folks called him crazy but I knew better than that
He kept a hundred dollar bill tucked away in the brim
Of his dirty old cowboy hat

Jack told me a story when I was ten years
He said there was once a fool tried to swim this swamp
With his back weighted down with gold
He said you should've seen that alligator smile
He had a meal fit for a king
But he need up on my table son, money ain't everything

He said there's only one way into this world
And one way out it's true
You either eat the alligator
Or he's gonna eat you
There's people livin' in a high-rise
That'll never hear a robin sing
What good is first place when you're in a rat race
Money ain't everything

Little Maggie May lay dying, her heart was about to go
When her daddy found a sack on the porch out back
With a half a million dollars in gold
They still talk about the stranger who saved her life that spring
No name on the note but someone wrote, money ain't everything

He said there's only one way into this world

Clay Walker,"I'm not the kind to take things for granted 
A simple mind and two strong working hands 
But at the time I thought my feet were planted 
You came along and uprooted this simple man 
A strong-willed woman with every chance to show it 
But I didn't mind 'cause you made my life worthwhile 
A beautiful woman with every reason to know it 
You liked my courage and honey I sure liked your style

A country boy and city girl makin' life in this old world 
We went against the grain and against all odds 
It don't matter what they say, I'm gonna love you anyway 
And time won't undo what you've gone and done to my heart

I always thought we'd stay together 
And I still think about you from time to time 
But I should have known nothing lasts forever 
But I'd never be the one to say goodbye

Catch me now

I'm heart over head over heels over you
Look at what I fell into 
You throw me girl like a tumbleweed on a Tilt-A-Whirl
I'm all turned around, got my down side up 
Either way it looks like what they say about true love's true 
'Cause I'm heart over head over heels over you

I need you to hold me real tight 
Next thing you know I just might 
Break loose and I could fly right into the stratosphere

Clay Walker,"Met a little senorita named Margarita down in Mexico 
She taught me more about love in a day or two than I'll ever know 
I had to go back across the Rio Grande 
And leave that little girl behind
I can't believe how heavy she's laying on my mind

Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad 
I'm hoping that the tequila is gonna take me back 
Give me the salt and the lime 
So I can taste her and hold her one last time
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need her bad

Those eyes and that smile they drove me while, I just couldn't resist 
I couldn't get enough from our first touch to our last kiss
I never understood a single word she said 
Oh but she left no doubt 
When she spoke to me in the language of love 
She turned my world inside out

Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad 
I'm hoping that the tequila is gonna take me back 
Give me the salt and the lime 
So I can taste her and hold her one last time

Clay Walker,"Was I nervous the night I first met you
Was it love at first sight
Did I know you were the girl I'd marry
I'd say that's right

When your daddy said, ?Son do you love her
With all of your might?
I looked him in the eye and said, ?Yessir
I'd say that's right?

I'd say that's right on the money
Sure as the summer in Florida's sunny
I'd say that's right down the middle
Ain't no doubt, not even a little
Will I love you for the rest of my life
I'd say that's right

If I woke up tomorrow up in heaven
Saint Peter looked me in the eye
And said, ?Mister, would you rather be with her?

Clay Walker,"Kindergarten, five years old
You and me and Mother Goose
Learning lines to nursery rhymes
That's when I fell in love with you

Back when it was
One, two, buckle my show
Three, four, shut the door
Five, Six, pick up sticks
Even then my heart was yours

College days, miles apart
So afraid you'd forget
Writing letters every day
And evading every one like this

One, two, I miss you
Three, four, I walk the floor
Five, six, come back quick
I don't wanna miss you no more

A little girl, a little boy
Playing on a swing in the yard
As we watch, I hold your hand
You're still holding onto my heart

And now it's
One, two, I love you
Three, four, let's have one more
Five, six, I wouldn't miss
A day of this for all the treasure
On the ocean floor

The rumor you heard about me living you
Well I never told a soul

They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope it's true

Well I've got a ring and a plan
But I see you already know what I'm gonna ask

But baby that's me
I've always been a dreamer
You'd rather face the cold hard truth
But baby that's you, you called it like you see it
Half the time my heads up in the clouds
And you're the only thing that keeps me on the ground
That's us 
As different as the night and day
That's us 
But the good Lord had it planned that way
That's loveHe looked down and knew
A man would need a woman's touch

That's us
And when I feel like I just can't go on
The dreams have come and gone
I know you'll always be there
And  when that old cold truth is hard to face
I'll carry you away
Years form now I'll still care
In rockin' chairs we'll share old memories
Made up of part of you and part of me

He's got two pretty children and a real nice wife

And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt

I've done my share from time to time

Ain't it strange how forever changed
With just one look

The magic filled the night
She touched my soul like no one else

You better run for cover
You better hide your heart
'Cause once you start to love her
You know you'll never stop
She shines like a diamond
When she walks into a room
She can charm the stars
Hypnotize the moon

Once i held her close
I knew just where i stood
No, you never get a second chance
To ever feel so good

Then and there I knew
These words were etched in stone
If you can't feel the power of
The greatest love you've known

Clay Walker,"I was standing at the checkout by a rack of magazines
Cover story told about another heartbroke beauty queen
How she was gettin' over just one more sad affair
And as I waited for my change, you know it hit me then and there

That ordinary people have extraordinary love
A million little miracles far beneath the stars above
The greatest gift that I could ever wish for you and me
Is a life as ordinary as can be

Then I heard some famous people had an anniversary
Five long years together; it was Hollywood history
Now my grandma and grandpa never made no printed page
But they took the love of fifty-seven years right to the grave

'Cause ordinary people have extraordinary love
A million little miracles far beneath the stars above
The greatest gift that I could ever wish for you and me

Now, we all like to watch, and by the time the movie ends
Who of us hasn't wished to be a little more like them?
But I bet every time two stars are breaking up
That they wish somehow, someway they were a little more like us

Still no signs of a better time and place
Have we lost the key to an open door?

Clay Walker,"He was driving home one evening
In his beat-up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her Mercedes had a flat

He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Til he said 'I'm here to help you, ma'm
By the way, my name's Joe'

She said 'I'm from St. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you'

When he changed the tire
And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said 'How much do I owe you?'
Here's what he had to say

'You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you'

Well, a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way

But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
She must have been eight months
Along and dead on her feet

No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her
Change from a hundred dollar bill

The lady slipped right out the door
And on a nakpin left a note
There were tears in the waitress' eyes
When she read what she'd wrote

'You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you'

That night when she got
Home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking about the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low
'Everything's gonna be alright
I love you, Joe'",The Chain of Love

Kickin' up dust down the dirt road

So far from the city lights
But give two kids all that room

Is everyone's lookin' for a way out
But that never crossed their minds at all

The two of them saw so much more
Than corn and barbed wire fence
They found a love worth stayin' for
And they've been together ever since

Still I want you to listen closely

But after all isn't love like that
I would be crazy to let this moment pass

What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love
Don't come twice

We could be blessed without even knowing
Just for a minute
Close your eyes and don't take another breath
'Cause what if you miss it

Don't come twice

I don't wanna wake up by myself

If you don't open up
I may never know

Clay Walker,"She's perfect for a cotton dress
Pretty when her hair's a mess
A little wine and she gets a little loud
Once or twice she's bleached my jeans

She's right as rain on a thirsty cornfield
Right on the money 'bout the way that I feel
A cool breath of fresh air
When life tries to burn me down
She's right behind me when I doubt myself
With a little push and a hand to help
A Quiet comfort on a troubled night
Right beside me, yeah, she's always right

Well she's the first to speak her mind
Never been the quittin' kind

She likes talking on the phone
Calls the mall her second home

Was a jolly happy soul
With the corn cup hat and button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
 
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day
 
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance all around
 
Oh frosty the snowman
Was as alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
 
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said ""let's run and have some fun
Before i melt away""
 
Down to the village
With the broom-stick in his hand
Running here and there all around that square
Saying ""catch me if you can""
 
He led them down the street of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him howler ""stop""
 
For frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying ""please don't cry
I'll be back again someday""

Clay Walker,"This workin' all day ain't gettin' me nowhere
Breakin' my back won't get it done
Wish I had a dime, wish I had a dollar
For every dream that I gave up on, that I gave up on
This hammer I'm swingin' is startin' to feel heavy
I clench my fist when I punch the clock
a little for the back leaves nothin' for my baby
Stretchin' my paycheck around the clock

[Chorus]
I need to go face first into that fresh air
Free up there where the eagle flies
Need to drop the line in that cool clear water
Leave the city behind and get countrified
(Fit to be tied 3rd time only)

A fools gold watch and a lone line of black smoke
Is all I get for all I gave
My only reward for this broken down body was diggin' my way to an early grave
Alway dreamed I'd end up on a river
Fast asleep on a mountain high
But I'm way down here in this concrete valley
In a sea of bumpers and red tail lights, red tail lights

They love to tan, they love their gouchi, their raban shades, and eatin' sushi
Over in Texas they love the cowboys

They love their ribeye, ropin' steers
Shootin' Jose Tequila, and long neck beers

To need someone more than life

To live one second without you here
Left without your kisses wanting more
Not to hear your heartbeat, like before
What would I do, where would I go
If you were gone and I had to move on
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know

Called your name in the name of love
And I cried as heaven took you on angel's wings
I woke up and screamed
""God in heaven above, don't take her from me""

Clay Walker,"I stumbled on a preacher, Sunday morning,
All decked out and made up for TV,
Askin' for some money from God's people:
Talking all that high theology. 

Well, I might be just an old blue collar:
There's things about the Lord that I don't know.
But I bet he never had a million dollars,
Or wore a lot of stylish fancy clothes. 

'Cause Jesus was a country boy,
Walkin' down a dirt road, with everything that he owned,
He never met a stranger.
Born in a barn underneath the stars,
His Mama laid him in a manger.
Swimmin' in the river, fishin' for his dinner,
Livin' with the sinners like me.
Makes me think, Jesus was a country boy. 

My Daddy never cared much for religion,
And my Mama worried a lot about his soul.
She'd hit her knees and pray for him on Sunday,
While Daddy hit his favorite fishin' hole. 

You see, Daddy was a rebel and a rambler,
But I always knew he loved my Mama so.
An' I never doubted he'd make it to Heaven,
'Cause it ain't who you are, it's who you know. 

An' Daddy knew: that Jesus was a country boy,
Walkin' down a dirt road, with everything that he owned,
He never met a stranger.
Born in a barn underneath the stars,
His Mama laid him in a manger.
Swimmin' in the river, fishin' for his dinner,
Livin' with the sinners like me.

Thought I'd take this vacation and finally catch up
So I checked out the view, and let go of that ladder
I thought to myself, this is what matters

Got my back in the chair with your hand in my hand
Couple umbrella drinks, and some shrimp cachgion platter

Clay Walker,"'Bout ten years old, hide and seek
I found me in the closet
Ready or not, I stumbled on
And opened up that box of
Yearbooks, letters, black and whites
A hundred, maybe more
Next thing I know my brothers and me
Got 'em scattered on the floor (yeah)

There was one of her, flippin' the bird
Sittin' on a Harley
And a few with some hairy hippie dude
Turns out his name was Charlie
Her hair, her clothes, her drinkin', smokin'
Had us boys confused
I'll never forget the day us nosy kids got introduced...

To mama 'fore she was mama
In a string bikini, in Tijuana
Won't admit she smoked marijuana
But I saw mama 'fore she was mama

We put that box right where it was
And never said a word
But growin' up got hard just tryin'
Not to picture her
In anything but aprons, dresses
Mini-vans and church
Oh, and Daddy would have whooped our butts
For diggin' up that dirt...

On mama 'fore she was mama
In a string bikini, in Tijuana
She won't admit she smoked marijuana
But I saw mama 'fore she was mama

We laugh and hang it over her head
Right above her halo
Her face turns red when we bring up
That tie-dyed Winnebago
She runs and hides and still denies
That hip-high rose tattoo
She burned that box of forget-me-nots
When she found out we knew...

About mama 'fore she was mama
In a string bikini, in Tijuana
Won't admit she smoked marijuana

Standin' here waves crashin' in

Clay Walker,"I didn't know you were gonna be at that bar when I walked in
Til I walked in
I looked up, saw your face, turned around
And I walked back out again
Then I thought there's too much that we shared
So I made myself get ahold of myself
And walked back in
And went right up to you 
I could feel you were caught off guard
Neither one of us knew just what to do 
So I said 
How ya been, been a while
Tell me how's your Mama
You said Good, you can sit down if you wanna
I said I was just thinkin' bout Oklahoma 
The wild roller coaster ride we had that summer
Before we knew it we were on our 2nd glass of wine
Sittin' there talkin' just like 
We had never said goodbye

Well even after all that time well it clicked just like before
Maybe a little more 
Before we knew it they were closing up the joint 
Yea, stackin' them chairs
Lockin' them doors 
I asked the waitress would she mind if we slept there 
And stayed for breakfast 
We both laughed
You grabbed your purse
I paid our tab 
Standing underneath the moon 
I couldn't help but ask 
What you say we take a stroll down by the river 
What a night, girl can you believe this weather
I been thinking we were pretty damn good together
You said yea wonder why did we ever let it go 
I said I don't know but after seeing you tonight
Well It feels just like
We had never said goodbye
Never said goodbye 

I been thinking maybe we should give it one more try
Like we never said good bye",Like We Never Said Goodbye
Clay Walker,"Twenty four C don't believe in God
But he always prays when the thing takes off
And the grandma that he's next to watches the window
Three B's got her headphones on
She's still not used to her daddy being gone
She gets to see him every three months for the weekend
Just people in planes

Seventeen A's in an exit row
Waiting for his Jack and Coke to show
Just wishing he didn't settle so fast in college
I'm over here in a middle seat
Watching the world, but half asleep
Wondering why there's never movies on the ones I'm on

And it occurs to me
Maybe I've got too much time to think
But it helps to be reminded how we're

Just people in planes, when it comes down to it
We're side by side on the same ride
There's not a whole lot of difference
At the end of the day,
We just want to know it's going to be okay
Counting on somebody we can't see to land this thing
We're just people in planes

Hey, do you remember back when
Your dad could still lift you then
He'd pick you up, and you'd think that you were flying
You'd spread your arms and start to land
Do you remember how to laugh like that
Why does that baby feel like crying

We 're just people in planes, when it comes down to it
We're side by side on the same ride
There's not a whole lot of difference

The girl in front of me spilling their guts to some lady 
She's never met and will never see again
Has been weighing for a long time on her conscience
There's seat kickers and loud talkers
Honeymoon lovers and several in the back there looking hung over
Must be coming back from Mexico...or Vegas

People in planes, when it comes down to it
We're side by side on the same ride
There's not a whole lot of difference

Got a boss on me like a snake on a frog
There's got to be more than what I've got
On this big, ole piece of rock

Coconut drink and a reggae band
Just might be the place where I get off

But after a round or two, it's just another dead end

For a minute or two, I'll get you off my mind

That you got on a plane and you ain't comin' back

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

And then she asks me, Do I look all right?

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head

Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra,"Je vous parle d'un temps
Que les moins de vingt ans
Ne peuvent pas connaître
Montmartre en ce temps-là
Accrochait ses lilas
Jusque sous nos fenêtres
Et si l'humble garni
Qui nous servait de nid
Ne payait pas de mine
C'est là qu'on s'est connu
Moi qui criait famine
Et toi qui posais nue

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire, On est heureux
La bohème, la bohème
Nous ne mangions qu'un jour sur deux

Dans les cafés voisins
Nous étions quelques-uns
Qui attendions la gloire
Et bien que miséreux
Avec le ventre creux
Nous ne cessions d'y croire
Et quand quelque bistro
Contre un bon repas chaud
Nous prenait une toile
Nous récitions des vers
Groupés autour do poêle
En oubliant l'hiver

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire : Tu es jolie
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous avions tous do génie

Souvent il m'arrivait
Devant mon chevalet
De passer des nuits blanches
Retouchant le dessin
De la ligne d'un sein
do galbe d'une hanche
Et ce n'est qu'au matin
Qu'on s'asseyait enfin
Devant un café-crème
Épuisés mais ravis
Fallait-il que l'on s'aime
Et qu'on aime la vie

La bohème, la bohème
Ça voulait dire, on a vingt ans
La bohème, la bohème
Et nous vivions de l'air do temps

Quand au hasard des jours
Je m'en vais faire un tour
À mon ancienne adresse
Je ne reconnais plus
Ni les murs, ni les rues
Qui ont vu ma jeunesse
En haut d'un escalier
Je cherche l'atelier
Dont plus rien ne subsiste
Dans son nouveau décor
Montmartre semble triste
Et les lilas sont morts

On était jeunes, on était fous
La bohème, la bohème
Ça ne veut plus rien dire do tout",La  BohĂ¨me

Mais on le fait avec humour
Enrobés dans des calembours mouillés d'acide

Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

A l'heure où naît un jour nouveau
Je rentre retrouver mon lot de solitude.
J'ôte mes cils et mes cheveux
Comme un pauvre clown malheureux de lassitude.
Je me couche mais je ne dors pas
Je pense à mes amours sans joie si dérisoires.
A ce garçon beau comme un Dieu
Qui sans rien faire a mis le feu à ma mémoire.
Ma bouche n'osera jamais
Lui avouer mon doux secret mon tendre drame
Car l'objet de tous mes tourments
Passe le plus clair de son temps au lit des femmes
Nul n'a le droit en vérité
De me blâmer de me juger et je précise
Que c'est bien la nature qui
Est seule responsable si
Je suis un ""homme oh"" comme ils disent.
...",Comme Ils Disent
Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra,"Il faut savoir encore sourire
Quand le meilleur s'est retiré
Et qu'il ne reste que le pire
Dans une vie bête à pleurer

Il faut savoir, coûte que coûte
Garder toute sa dignité
Et malgré ce qu'il nous en coûte
S'en aller sans se retourner

Face au destin qui nous désarme
Et devant le bonheur perdu
Il faut savoir cacher ses larmes
Mais moi, mon cœur, je n'ai pas su

Il faut savoir quitter la table
Lorsque l'amour est desservi
Sans s'accrocher l'air pitoyable
Mais partir sans faire de bruit

Il faut savoir cacher sa peine
Sous le masque de tous les jours
Et retenir les cris de haine
Qui sont les derniers mots d'amour

Il faut savoir rester de glace
Et taire un cœur qui meurt déjà
Il faut savoir garder la face
Mais moi, je t'aime trop

Mais moi, je ne peux pas
Il faut savoir mais moi
Je ne sais pas",Il  Faut Savoir

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Strong-holdings and salt in places yet to heal
Crying at the site of strings

A great man and the child in you
Enough when I take you far from here
Enough to cut a morning view

Strange how a sound could change your feelings
Staring wide and dirty breathing
I remember how a calling came in
Scared of deceiving and all I could hear was ""Run!""

Am I the only one, who sees what you've become?
Will you drift away?
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you stay?

People making choices they can't fake
Sacrifice it all and maybe say

Something extraordinary
Something real (something real)
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)
I'm not gonna compromise
Surely you can sympathize?
Say you feel the same

You've wandered down a path I can't explain
Have you seen her? The grass is greener
To let me pass you by would be a shame
If she's your only then why're lonely?
'Cause I'm the only one, who know the things you've done
I'm so good for you

Boy, you got me freaking, I never thought I'd be like this
When you go, I'm tweaking and pining for another fix
Told you before, your love is my oxygen

So hear me when I say this, boy I tell you true, I ain't easy
There's something about you just makes me so crazy

I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Every single thing you do just set my heart on fire
I struggle to breathe, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire (Fire)
Start it again, I can't breathe, you set my heart on fire

So hear me when I say this, boy I tell you true, I ain't easy
There's something about you just makes me so crazy

Clean Bandit,"In the quiet of my room
I gather up my thoughts and questions
Could I ever be like you?
Could I ever be a person, so real and so true?
It seems implausible
I look at my reflection
If only I could say
The things I never mention
The things you never knew

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes

Once upon a time there was a girl who so much loved the world
She gave her only begotten sunshine
And dried her stained eyes on a neck tie
Took the best lies made 'em truths
And spit sad soliloquies in the booth
'Cause people think they know but they barely knew
The reality of what the other-siders do
But I've been there, I've learned that
Seen a whole bunch of world and done came back
Got a reckoning for wrecking in my knapsack
'Bout to journey on foot through the outback
GRRRL PRTY is the label on my snapback
Doin' worldwide shows in a black hat
'Bout to tell your ass a story so take that
Free prophecies from a black cat

Seen his demise with a pair of brand new eyes
It was sickening, guy
Never wanted to be stickin' it to thickening thighs
But now he deeper than the secrets that he keep with a lie
""Mm, tastes good!"" baby say with a cry
Now wait
Thinkin' about it too much, too much
Deepen the profit sooner, sooner
He never wanted to be a loser
But the bruises of losing is oozing through his fingers
The tips that like to brush at my hips
Is now at the hilt of a sword, Lord
On the battlefield, torn, sworn
To never think about another lover
Hopin' he had time to recover but nothing's ever easy
Beware the sting of queen bee (Grr!)

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes

So many things in he I would like to be
Wiser, more light on my feet
I could look up in the mirror and change me
Or right over my shoulder and save me
Thinkin' about back, back when, when I ain't have nothing
Not a thing or a ring to my name
Now my feet in the game, knee deep, don't speak
Feelin' like Gwen Stefani in this thing
But I can't complain 'cause we asked for this
Feelin' like a workaholic or a masochist
Don't call like I should like it's sacrilege
To make a dollar in a dream into packed venues
Take a second, put your shield down
Laying down my sword, getting off the battlefield now
Makin' bigger moves, bigger pictures in my view now
Get up out of my way I've got ammo for days, pow!

I can feel the weight of wars you've lost
They're victories in my eyes
Every swing you take brings me closer and closer
Open the gates and I'm poised to charge
You told me we'd never get this far
Now we at the final round
There's no way we'll escape battle scars
Battle scars

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes",New Eyes

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

She said a ""hey plow boy done ate half a cow
And I still can hear your big old belly growl""
So I steamed up a fresh heap of broccoli for you
You've got calories to burn and some pounds to lose

Well you can bring that broccoli with squirrel and dumplings
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin' for nuthin'

She said ""I've cooked non-stop in this house for weeks
Time to get your big butt up on somewhere's else to eat""
So I've been down to Shoney's four times today
I hit the Sizzler and the Quincy's they were on the way

I 'bout blowed out my colon from buffet jumpin
Cause Cledus don't stop a-eatin' for nuthin'

If you like love handles and big old buns
I've pounds of passion and tons of fun
I look like Flabio in my king-cab truck
To look like Brooks and Dunn I need a tummy tuck
YUUUUUCK

We got to find a little place where I can eat some more
Before I start rollin' on this hardwood floor
Heck down to Hooters break out the wings
Then make a run down to the border I'm an eatin' machine

Fire up the stove and keep the fat clams comin
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'
If it's all you can eat then you'll see me runnin
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'
Tell Richard Simmons he can kiss my (bump-kin ???)
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'
Make my pies pumpkin
And my donuts Dunkin

I could get back at my ex-wife,
With the touch of a button, I could ruin her life.

I bought a new lift kit and four new tires.

In a couple of days I got my TV back.
She said she'd like to come back, as well.
I told her to go straight to AOL.

For droppin' that box at Cledus' address.

HANKENSTEIN

Midnight in Montgomery
Full moon shining on a shack
Where a country music legend is about to be brought back
Cledus got the idea from the late night creature feature
And figured he would foller a similar procedure

HANKENSTEIN

Now laid out on the table is the body of a man
In a white suit
Cowboy boots
And a guitar in his hand

He's hooked up to a tractor with a set of jumper cables
And if anything could start a cold cold heart a John Deere should be able.

HANKENSTEIN

Now what's about to happen here is nothin' less than shockin
With a record player in the corner blaring Hey Good Lookin'
That foot began to tap along with that old 45
And you can hear old Cledus yelling UH OH ITS ALIVE!!!!!

CHORUS:
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster
HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster
HANKENSTEIN

In no time Hankenstein was mo-anin' the blues
And Cledus has decided it's time to spread the news
They'll hit the road and put on shows all over the nation
Yeah, he's gonna be the next country music sensation

HANKENSTEIN

Everyone still loves to hear the tale of old Kawliga
And they all sing and dance when he cuts loose on Jambalaya
Playing on the Opry stage was his final test
Now Hankenstein has become a monster success

CHORUS

Lovesick in a hotel near the Mason Dixon Line
Hankenstein is sitting there so lonesome he could cry
He's had it with the life he leads singing all them tunes
Now he's out there somewhere honky tonkin howlin at the moon

CHORUS

HANKENSTEIN
He's a honky-tonkin monster

Together were bad to the bone

We can bust a move to a funky groove
Or a hardcore country song

Billy Ray Cyrus and little David Ball
A little bit of luck and my life will be complete
There's a little bitty blonde that I'd really want to meet

I sure like Mindy McCready
Start pumpin iron and a-eatin my Wheaties
Got to get in shape
If I want to get a date
But first I gotta lose a little bit of weight

My little bitty sweetie in her little nighty gown
A litty bitty kiss and I'd probably come unwound
I love to watch her dance and I like to watch her sing
Want a little better look at her belly button ring

I sure like Mindy McCready
Take a little ride down to Panama City
Just the two of us on her little bitty bus
With a whole lot of love and whole lot of lust

I work a little job for a crummy little check
Heck I'd trade it all for a hug around the neck
Paid a lot of hope for my little bitty scheme
Cause I could never fit in her litte bitty jeans

I'm a good old boy she's a pretty little girl
Wish I had a chance to rock her little bitty world
I'm a little bit insane cause I love her somethin fierce
Gonna go and get my big old belly button pierced

I'd sure like to meet Mindy McCready
Give me half a chance and buddy yes indeed-why
Guys do it all the time I'd better get in line
Better go and buy her some of Deana Carter's wine

Cledus T. Judd,"I was staring a hole through CMT
Watchin' everybody else who'd been waitin' for me
I thought by now I'd been a household name
After all I had, if Shania was mine
And though ""Bigger Than the Beatles"" got played all the time
Them funny videos why there's my claim to fame

Now all of a sudden there's a slew of comedians
Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and back comes Ray Stevens
Folks right there's some real competition
I started getting a little bit paranoid
Heck if this keeps up, I'll be unemployed
Then out of the blue it came to me in a vision

Now I'm the psychic to the stars
They call me up from wherever they are
I'm always over-booked
Lord my phone rings off the hook
I'm the psychic to the stars

Ha ha
I told Tim and Faith they ought to tie the knot
Why you think Deana Carter's so hot
Boy I'd shave my legs for a sip of that Strawberry Wine
When Mindy McCready's on my caller ID
I'd take her call immediately
Ten Thousand Angels couldn't get me off of that line
Garth Brooks called dang near a hundred times
But I was too busy consultin' Leann Rimes
Trying to predict the number of albums she sold last night

I had Brooks & Dunn on a conference call
They said ""Cledus would you look into your crystal ball""
I said ""I'd love to boys, but I got Tanya Tucker on hold,
Gotta go.""

Now I got a new career and I charge a hefty fee
Why it worked for Dionne Warwick now it works for Cledus T.
Call me

Now I'm the psychic to the stars
They call me up from wherever they are
I've got a clairvoyant sense

Cledus T. Judd,"Don't tell her what it's worth, third rock from her thumb

Well, he walks in the pawn shop, one thing on his mind
Wants to buy a diamond but he doesn't have a dime
He finds the one he likes and they cut him quite a deal
A two carat solitaire but neither one's real

Picks up the pay phone, puts it to his ear
Calls his chick, collect and says, ""Get over here""

When he shows his girlfriend, she can't believe her eyes
She never thought she'd ever really get one that size
He tries to think of somethin' when she asked him ""where'd you get it?""
Down at diffie's pawn but he never will admit it

He tries to change the subject, ""Forget the wedding list
Let's head on out to Vegas and get it over with""

Flaws and defects, no billing ads
Hope she never finds out how much he spent
Nothin' else shines like a zirconia
Don't tell her what it's worth, third rock from her thumb

Just outside of Vegas, the truck gets a flat
She says, ""We woulda made it if you weren't so doggone fat""
They try to hitch a ride from some hippies in a van
To a ratty little motel called 'The S and M grand'

Puts on her little nightie, gives him a little wink
Ring slips off her finger, down the bathroom sink

She starts to call a plumber, he begins to shout
""Give me a coat-hangar, I think I can get it out""
Fishes out the ring in a big ball of hair
Slips it on her finger as he pats her derriere

Thinkin' to himself, ""It's a lucky thing
A plumber woulda cost me much more than that ring""

Flaws and defects, no billing ads
Hope she never finds out how much he spent
Nothin' else shines like a zirconia
Don't tell her what it's worth, third rock from her thumb

Flaws and defects, no billing ads
Hope she never finds out how much I spent

Hm-hm-hm boy, I sure hope I get a purdy'n. 
Maybe she'll look like Terry Clark or Faith Hill or somebody. 
Hm, hope this ain't a party line. 
Here we go!

Ha-ha. I's laid up 'na house watchin' C.M.T.
Thought I'd have a late night snack
So I headed to the kitchen on a commercial break
When sup'm called me back

It was the sexiest voice that I'd ever heard
Comin' out of my television set
Said, ""Call now, you can hear me live
And I'll tell ya 'bout my naughtiness.""

So without hesitation or further ado
I grabbed a hold of my Visa
And dialed the number flashin' on my screen
1-900-SHEILA

You can tell it all to me
I'm your phone fantasy
1-900-SHEILA

Oh man! Ah
So I kicked back the recliner
And on the second ring
She whispered, ""Hello. This is Sheila.
Your credit card number, please.""

I said, ""How much will it cost
For this here trip to paradise?""
She said, ""You can't put a price on love""
That's another $4.98 minute went bye

After an hour of conversation
She had me chewin' on the receiver
Well, I worked up a sweat, I's out of breath
Over 1-900-SHEILA

You can tell it all to me
I'm your phone fantasy

Like a man possessed I dialed her number
Mornin' noon and night
And slowly but surely we fell in love
As my phone bill shot out of sight

After so many costly heart to hearts
I just had to meet her face to face
She wouldn't give me her home address
So I had her number traced. He-he.

Well, I thought it'd lead to a passion palace
Some penthouse in the sky
And, I must admit I was a little let down
When I found her in a double wide
A double wide?

That beauty that I envisioned
That goddess that drove me crazy
Answered the door with a cigar in her mouth
And weighin' in at over two eighty. He-he-ho!

They say love conquers all, well I reckon it's true
Even when it's for a fee
We said I do, and now were one
Though she makes two of me

And she talks to me no charge
Every time she takes a breather
And I'll never have to work
As long as all you jerks dial

Cledus T. Judd,"Cledus went down to Florida, he was lookin for a car to steal.
He was in a bind, ten payments behind so the bank repoed his wheels.
When he came across this old man down at Jalopy's Used Car lot.
Then Cledus jumped up on the top of one and said:
""Fella, let me tell you what.""

""I'm not gonna be proud of the deed I'm 'bout to do.
""With no time to spare, I gotta be somewhere, 
""So I'm gonna steal a car from you.
""Now I've seen your selection here and I admit the pickin's are few.
""I know the Pinto's gold but consider it stoled,
""''cause I got a show to do. "" 
The man said: 'My name's Jalopy,"" as he gave an evil grin.
''cause he knew that car wouldn't get too far 'fore the motor blew up again. 

Cledus, you better hit the road if you're gonna be a star. 
The show's way up in Georgia and you're opening up for Garth. 
Your future's riding on this shiny Pinto painted gold.
And if you're late, it's Jeff Foxworthy's show. 

Oh, gosh a Pinto, my foot. It drives more like a horse and buggy. Durn. 
Cledus said: ""No way in heck you're gonna open up that show.""
Then fire flew from the manifold as his right front tyre blowed.
And he pushed that wreck across the street and man was Cledus tissed.
And he tried and tried to start her up but it sounded something like this.
Come on. Come on. 
Oh Gawd, I'm in a mess what am I gonna do.
My one big shot for Garth Brooks .
Oh durn it. 

When Cledus opened up the hood he said: 'I'll be a son of a gun'.
And didn't long to figure out why the heck it wouldn't run. 

Fire from the engine, lots of smoke.
He can already hear them redneck jokes.
Dead blamed oil pan laying in the road.
Will he make the show, heck no, heck no.
Whoa oh.

Taxi! Greyhound! Yellow cab! Somebody!
I'll show him a redneck.
He'll have a redneck when I get my hands around his throat.
I'm sick of it.

Cledus shook his head as he watched Foxworthy's show.
And he heard him joke of how he passed a burning gold Pinto.
Then later on, Garth told Cledus: ""you'll never get the chance again,""
As he gave the check to that durned redneck who drove a Mercedes Benz.
He said: ""Tough break, big guy.
""Before I go would you like to hear another redneck joke'
""Did you know I got my own TV show'""
Well, does anybody watch it' (No, heck, no.)

Well, you might be a redneck if your mom and daddy cathes you out behind the barn.
Whupping Jeff Foxworthy for talking about rednecks all the time.
Aw, shoot I'm just kidding, Jeff.
I wished I could be your best friend.

And drinkin' all my wine

They're hanging 'round my teepee
Can't wear my Buffalo briefs

Cledus T. Judd,"Been together four years and had five kids
So we did the right thing and finally got hitched
We tracked down the preacher after altar call
And proceeded to the VFW Hall

When he said, Cledus T. did you take Debra Liz
I stuttered, I do, knowin' I done did
The wedding cake was, 'Moon Pie', stacked three tiers
And the punch bowl flowed with Falstaff Beer

Now that's about as swanky as this town gets
For they throw rice, heck, they threw grits
No stretch limousine, just a full sized van
But at least we was headed for the promised land

On our hillbilly honeymoon
No champagne Caviar or Cordon Bleu
A can of Vienna Sausage and a Mountain Dew
And soda pop too
On our hillbilly honeymoon

Spent all our money on pay per view
Didn't need Playboy to get in the mood
Just a roller derby wrestlin' and a Rambo II
And III and IV, I was up in the room
On our hillbilly honeymoon

Well, after a while things simmered down
So we got dressed up for a night on the town
There ain't nothing too good for my sweetheart
Took a romantic stroll through the Super WalMart
We got back wanting some fine cuisine
We bought out the whole dern vending machine

On our hillbilly honeymoon
No dainty little plates of finger foods
Just M&M's Snickers and tomato juice
And Cheez Wiz too
On our hillbilly honeymoon

I spent half our savings on the hardware aisle
She spent the rest on the latest styles
A thong underwear that drove me wild
Back in the room, I tried them on too
On our hillbilly honeymoon

Well, it's been three years, got four more young'uns
Ain't a lot of time for much kissin' and a huggin'
For the last eight weeks I've slept on the couch
Think it's about time we renewed our vows

And took another hillbilly honeymoon
No [Incomprehensible] egg nog, just barbecue
And a box of wine will be nice down too
Won't need a corkscrew, yeah
On our hillbilly honeymoon

We can raid little Tommy's piggy bank
Scrape up a hundred dollars worth in change
Just enough for a night at the bowling lanes
And some new perfume, cheap motel room

Cledus T. Judd,"Be vewy vewy qwiet…we are huntin' somethin')

Me and Harold Muffert were outdoors men
Set in our backwoods ways
Both members of the huntin' club
Both active in the NRA
(National Redneck Association)

We scouted a location where we had no doubt
We'd kill the biggest buck in the world
(About a 34-pointer)
Harold waited in his tree stand
But all he seen was a squirrel

Dang near two weeks since the season started
And neither one of us was amused
(HA HA HA)
We had on real tree camo, high-powered ammo
But no big game to shoot

Then we finally saw a deer as big as a horse
Harold had him in his crosshairs
(Shoot him!)
But that squirrel jumped off of a branch above us
And landed in Harold's hair
(Dang, get it out! Dang!)

Harold fell off the stand, on his head he landed
Like a wimp he laid there cryin
Till I climbed on down,
Picked him up off the ground
And it didn't take us long to decide,
That squirrel had to die

Goodbye squirrel
With black-eyed peas,
You're gonna taste good to me
Squirrel
It's you or me,
Come on out of that tree
Squirrel
Hey guess what,
You've eaten your last nut
Squirrel

Me and Harold went down to the surplus store
Bought a keg of dynamite
Two baseball bats and a case of M-80s
We were in for one heck of a fight
(We'll show you!)

When you're huntin' with dumb and dumber
Something's surely bound to go wrong
(Now be careful)
And when Harold lit that real short fuse
I knew it wouldn't be long

When the dynamite blew,
Harold's foot did too
And fingers began to fly
(Fly)
We were barely alive
When the game warden arrived
And much to our surprise,
That squirrel didn't die
(Gosh!)

Goodbye squirrel
Just one more shot,
You'll be in my crock pot
Squirrel
You'll make a lunch,
You overgrown chipmunk
Squirrel
I'll skin ya hide,
And make a hat when it's dry
Squirrel

Gimme that, I said gimme that gun
Look out!
Look out, duck!

Cledus T. Judd,"Twas the fight before Christmas
When all through the house
No furniture left standing, no TV or couch
Our aquarium, heck they even knocked over my Chia Pet
MeMaw was flung 'cross the room by her hair
By her sister Ethel who never fought fair

Let's get ready to tumble!!!!!!!

The children all wrestled and jumped off the beds
Dropping elbows and knees on each other's heads
And mamaw with her frying pan and pa with his bat
Cleared half the room in ten seconds flat
The whole brawl began from an innocent matter
When aunt Flo thought Eugene said ""she looks a whole lot fatter""
She knocked him through the window he fell with a crash
Tore down the gutters and busted his leg really bad

You ought to have saw it 
It looked like he'd been in a motorcycle wreck
No kiddin'
Yeah awful I couldn't turn to look at it

you see both sides of our family have never gotten along
And every holiday something always go wrong
You ain't supposed to fight but spread joy in this season
But when they get the nog they just look for a reason
In no time at all everybody joined in
And right there we squared off with our closest of kin
It's a time for givin' said uncle bill
As he gave a black eye to his brother-in-law phil
I heard somebody say ""it's the thought that counts
And right now I'm thinking about knocking your butt out""
Presents and fists flew all over the room
And nana had some fancy moves with the broom
She took out three cousins and knocked down the tree
And I ducked just in time she swung out at me


It's my favorite time of year
Dad always has too much beer
Gets on the roof and hunts reindeer
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily

Tie the antlers on the dog
Save some shine for Santa Claus
From all the in-laws and outlaws
Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily


I crawled to the phone lord it seemed like a mile
And called 9-1-1 which we keep on speed dial
In a matter of minutes out the window appeared
Flashing blue lights and the sheriff John Deere
Just then six men burst through the door
Some yelling ""hey it's us"" some ""get on the floor""
A stray punch from grandpa found the sheriff's chin
And just for good measure he clocked him again
It took all 6 cops to get grandpa in cuffs
You know he gets feisty when he runs out of snuff
We all stopped our fighting and cheered grandpa on
Heck I thought he could take them I guess I was wrong
As they dragged him outside he yelled ""I've been framed""
He was kicking and screaming and calling them names

""You (bleep) you (bleep) 
Let me go you (bleep) 
You donut eatin stupid (bleep) son of a (bleep)""

We stood on the porch as did all our neighbras
Who always took interest in our family's behavior
""mind your own business"" we heard grandma shout
And ""we'll take back the presents and then come bail you out""
By now we'd forgotten what we were fighting for
We were battered and bruised but united once more
Then we all joined hands and sang ""violent night""

Violent night

And we heard grandpa exclaim as they drove off out of sight:
""Merry christmas to all...man that was a good fight!!!!""


Deck your neighbor deck the halls
'Tis the season for a brawl

Cledus T. Judd,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face

It's gagging me to death
Something must have died inside of you
What you ought to do 
Is chase a Cert or two 
With Listerine
Even when you're gone
The odor lingers on
I'm buying you an Oral be and a jumbo tube of Crest
'Cause I can smell your breath

Bad breath

Can't you smell the fog that's floating through the air
Must be something that you ate",Breath
Cledus T. Judd,"Every time a country awards show comes on my TV
I'm forced to put up with some choreography
I really like She Daisy and Sara Evans is mighty fine
But I prefer my country music without all that bump and grind

So Shania put some clothes on
Stop prancin' all around
And Mark Miller I get dizzy watching you spin with Sawyer Brown
Even Jo Dee Messina's shaking her hips and all of her red
But if George Strait starts dancing somebody shoot me in the head

Well you never saw Hank Jr. do the electric bugaloo
And I can't see Merle Haggard moonwalking in his boots
Now Faith Hill is a diva and she can shake her bootyful thing
But I prefer my country singers to just hold real still and sing

So Kenny Chesney keep your hat on 
Quit trying to get down
You don't see Brad Paisley sugar footin' like James Brown
(Hey I want to get in too)
Even the Dixie Chicks got their groove on and Earl's dead
But if George Strait starts dancing somebody shoot me in the head

Last night I had a bad dream that country was going pop
I seen Alan Jackson break dancing while McGraw did the robot
So Trace Adkins put one glove on if you're gonna dance like that
You move like Michael Jackson but you wear a cowboy hat
(Hee Hee)
Now I don't much agree with what Lee Ann Womack said
So if George Strait Starts dancin' somebody shoot me in the head

Hair on my back I don't plan to shave
I've got the house to myself while the wife's away
I'll be rockin' all night

Lounge in my boxers like I used to do
There'll be no Ally McBeal on the tube, no
I'll be watchin' the fight

Well, it's a great day to be a guy
Played cards with my buddies until sunrise
You know, I never thought that my neighbor would
Be sunbathing topless, Lord, she sure looks good

I caught a 10 pound bass out on the lake
Played 18 holes with my best friend, Jake
Best balls I hit was when I stepped on a rake
Oh, well it wasn't too bright

Now I look in the fridge, what do I see?
Last night's pizza starin' back at me
Pepperoni and anchovies
What a beautiful sight

Well, it's a great day to be a guy
Buck naked in my lawn chair swattin' at flies
Got some hot dogs on the charcoal grill
I don't wanna burn my wieners but I probably will

That fried baloney and cheese macaroni
Tasted good this afternoon
But now I'm passin' some serious gas and
I might have to leave the room
Pee hee!

Well, I might go get me a new hairdo
Spend a couple hours in a tanning booth
Might even get me a gold front tooth
Whoa, hah, yeah!

And it's a great day to be a guy
But when my wife gets home, she's gonna tan my hide
I'll be hung over but a lookin' good
From a week of reliving my bachelorhood

It's a great day to be a guy
But another week of this and I'd probably die
I tend to party harder than I should
When my wife's not here to make me be good
Yeah hoo!",It's a Great Day to Be a Guy

I will be right there beside you as you travel down life's road
I hope I leave you laughing when the curtains close

Some gold that you can cling to and the memories we made
And if by chance tomorrow Heaven's angels call
And I go on before you to the greatest show of all

Cledus T. Judd,"I got a buddy named Stacy Fay
He's been known to stay up for days
Pulls the shades and locks himself in the house
Sits in his room with his hand on his mouse
His phone's been busy now for over a week
So I dropped by to see what in Sam Hell is going on

And here's what he said to me:
Come on in and let's burn one Cledus
No need to go to the record store
I've got every song that you're looking for
On my PC
And they're all free
Just click and download you some MP3s Presto you can make your own CDs
I'll show you how it's done
Fire up the computer and let's burn one

Before my eyes could not believe my ears
Every song ever sung in the last fifty years
He made me Conway Twitty's greatest hits
And threw in the Flock Of Seagulls for the flock of it
Time sure flies when you're burning one
It was three A. M. when I got home
My wife was mad at me
Till I gave her that CD
With a mix of her favorite songs

And I said
Lemme show ya how to burn one baby
No need to go to the record store
I found every song you're looking for on the PC
Even got me
No you won't ever find me downloading porn
Just Haggard and Jones, Limp Bizkit and Korn
And I could use some Brooks and Dunn
So Fire up the computer and let's burn one

Country jazz rap and pop
A lotta Bocephus and a little Kid Rock
And like Toby says ""Get'chya some
Fire up the computer and let's burn one

But I'd sure love to hear some Metallica tonight

Dreaming of opening day, how 'bout you?
Yeah me too
The only thing I want to do is hunt with you
Kill a bird or two go get your gun

Let's shoot dove all day long until all our shells are gone
Shoot five times then reload
Run like heck if the game warden shows
Yeah when the sun comes up let's shoot dove

You know Faith gets mad at me when she thinks I'd rather be
In a field with you sippin' brews, shootin' anythin' that moves
I think my sight's a little off to the right, you can't hit nothing

Let's shoot dove all day long until our eardrums are blown
By tonight one things for sure
Boy our shoulders will be sore
I just can't get enough let's shoot dove

Let's shoot dove all day long until all our shells are gone
Point your gun towards the sky
I want to see them feathers fly
And when the sun comes up I just can't get enough let's shoot dove

Nah do you?

Uh yessir do you have Man of Constant Borrow by Cledus T. Judd

No sir somebody's already borrowed it


Constantly borrows everything

I'm the man of constant borrow
There's nothing I can call my own
Some may try to say it's all stolen
I prefer permanently loaned
He's the biggest mooch we ever known

SOLO

My grass mowin
Bot I've got no mower
My neighbor won't let me use his
I can't really say is though I blame him
Kept it three years last time I did

He thought for sure that it was his

I need a ride down to the pawn shop
Lend me the keys to your Corvette
What do you mean you don't trust me
I never not brought it back yet

I don't think I could take that bet
You know dang well (he's gone away)

Well you may have heard of me
Cledus T J-you-double-D
Better known as the reining King of country parody
Coming with a new style
High profile
When I'm on the mike well you know I'll get hog wild
Comedian
Extrodinaire
A fat Eminem with the bleach blonde hair

I know that you think
I've got your chainsaw
You can't find it anywhere
I can't cut no wood
Since way fore winter
I gave it back to you last fair

Check his garage it's probably there

I sure could use a hundred dollars
I'll gladly pay you back Tuesday
I know that's what I said the last time
You can't believe a word I say

He has no plans to (really???) pay

Cledus T. Judd,"Some kids have it, some kids don't
I was eleven when I was signed
I was on the CMA's and
Y'all thought that Vince Gill sang high

Then puberty played a trick on me
A few mustache hairs
A change occurred
My voice matured

My first single did so good
I bought bikes for all my friends at school
A little something for mom and dad
Like an in-ground swimming pool

Look at this pimple
Oh, man it hurts
The sweetest voice you'd ever heard
'Till my voice matured

My voice, my high pitched voice
It just went away
It happens to all boys
It keeps changing every single day

I bet nobody thought
I'd go overnight from soprano to bass
Now all of my hits are too high
For me to sing all the way

I need some help, it sounds absurd
I used to sing just like a girl

Can't that wait till Monday? 
What are you putting up over there a log cabin?

I bought a little house in a west side neighborhood
The girls came over to party life is good
Till Willie moved in next door and he's made my life a wreck
Now the girls are always over at Willie's cause 

Willie's got a big deck
With
A hot tub on it
And the girls really want it

There's a barbecue grill in the corner and they're eatin' weenies
Check out the blond on the hot tub ladder
I guess it just goes to show size does matter
Willie's got a big deck

I decided to get some redecoratin' done
I got some plants made sure they were well hung
I thought a long hot tanning bed might do the trick
But all I got was this tan and 

Willie's got a big deck
With
Hot babes on it
And they know how to flaunt it
In those itsy bittsy teeny weeny yellow dental floss bikinis
They're drinking frou frou drinks with umbrellas and they're burning tikis
Check out the twins on the hot tub ladder
I guess it just goes to show size does matter

Cause Willie's got a big deck
Well
If you can't beat 'em might as well join 'em

Now me and Big Willie and I are the best of friends
And some day I'm gonna be like him

With
My tanning bed on it
And the girls really want it
The hot tub's bubbling over with thong bikinis
They're funnelin' beer and sippin' martinis
There's a nekkid redhead everybody's staring at her
Willie showed us all size does matter

Cause Willie's got a big deck
Hey you know mine might not be as big as Willie's but it's, uh, all I got,

R: Grandma got runned over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog,
And we'd begged her not to go.
But she'd left her medication,
So she stumbled out the door into the snow.

When they found her Christmas mornin',
At the scene of the attack, 
There were hoof prints on her forehead,
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back. 

R: Grandma got runned over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.
(On her way home)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
(Say there's no Santa)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

Now we're all so proud of Grandma,
He's been takin' this so well.
See him in there watchin' football,
Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle.

It's not Christmas without Grandma.
All the family's dressed in black.
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?

But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig.
And a blue and silver candle
That would have just matched the hair in grandma's wig.

I've warned all my friends and neighbors.
""Better watch out for yourselves.
They should never give a license,
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.""

At the Christmas pot luck dinner
At the Holy Roller Hall
They don't allow no drinkin
Of any alch-ee-hol
So my Aunt Hazel makes a juice
Without the use of liquor
And every year
It seems to disappear
A little quicker

CHORUS
It's Hazel's homemade Hallelujah Punch
Guaranteed to spread some Christmas cheer
Fill the cup
And drink it up
It doesn't take too much
Of Hazel's homemade Hallelujah Punch

When everyone's done eatin'
And they're had a glass or two
The strangest things start happenin'
Just like they always do
The spirit of the season
Flows throughout the congregation
There must be some magic in that bowl
To cause such a sensation

CHORUS

She swears there's nothing in it
But the juice of fruits and berries
Some raisins, dates, a few yeast cakes, and maraschino cherries
She corks up two five-gallon jugs
And seals them every spring
And when she opens them up for Christmas
The cheer starts to sing
Ah

And every sip tastes better and better
And better
And better

You know a man does have to eat him somethin'

I love candy bars...eat them all the time
My combo meal's are super-sized
And I crave the stuff they put inside those dang ding dongs
Mmm

My cholesterol is off the chart
I keep a blood pressure cuff on my left arm
Doctor says that my poor heart won't last too long
My nickname in school was double wide
Cause my momma fried

Now I weigh 270 somethin'
Always huffin and puffin
Lay around the house all day
No wonder I can't lose no weight
See that pizza on the TV
Oh man don't it look cheesy
You know they deliver here for nothin'
That's why I weigh 270 somethin'

My insurance said that they'd co-pay
I made the same appointment Carnie Wilson made
Plastic surgeon said he had a way to get those love handles off
He stapled and sucked stuff through a tube
I lost a hundred pounds in one afternoon
When I came to in the recovery room
Wouldn't much left of me
When he removed the bandages from my thighs
I couldn't believe my eyes

Now I weigh 180 somethin'
Didn't have to do much of nothin'
I'm lookin' like Jean Claude Van Damme
To fit in a pair Mark Wills' pants
Now everyone who sees me
Can't believe that I'm so skinny
My body fat is nearly nothin'
Ha ha
Now that I weigh 180 somethin'

Ha Ha

Now I date a model with a GED
But do you think she'd be with me
I wonder (I wonder)
If I (If I)

Still weighed 270 somethin'
Stuffin down blueberry muffins
Onion rings and cans of SPAM
That's how I got so fat
Now everyone who sees me
Can't believe that I'm so skinny
I used to break a sweat just doin' nothin'
Back when I weighed 270 somethin'

I push the gas down fearlessly
Breaks stop working then
I watch the engine overheat

I can't ever get far
This one breaks down on me all the time
It's got four bald tires
And it always backfires
And I'm sick of that check engine light
I need a new car

I replaced all the cables and hoses
Had grease all over my face
For a couple weekends I had parts thrown all over the place
I put it back together fast
But now it's even worse
Now my friends just laugh
Cause it only goes in reverse

I need a new car
Getting to work's hard
When you have to drive backwards all the time
I'd find a junkyard and I'd sell it for parts
But I know they won't give me a dime
I need a new car

I won't repair anymore
Now the dang transmission's about to fall out
The only thought that's on my brain is the new car
I could be driving now

Rumor is they're having a sale over at the push pull or drag car lot
If I can get this towed down there I swear I'll take anything they've got
So with a credit line of $20,000 plus
No interest or money down and no more taking the bus

It's got a VCR cruise control and Onstar

Shooo...I think it's time for you to change your little bitty diaper
That little boogie boogie boogie boogie boogie
I love you so much...but I wish you would just quit crying.

Well I'm sittin here rockin our cute little baby
Tell me why you just won't stop cryin'
My little souvenir from Dollywood last Valentine's

Yeah I burped you twice sounded good
Did everything a father should
Read Barney and nursery rhymes
I guess your momma needs a girls night out every once in a while

I put on a brand new diaper baby
Huh huh don't you wet it
Everything was going just fine
Till's you threw up on me when I fed ya

Where's your mommy
I'm going crazy
Call up a buddy
I need a friend
Cause I'm a new dad
Who don't know what to do
When a tummy starts to rumblin

Staring at my lousy ravioli can
As she walked right in and said to me
Is there any way that I can make your day complete
I told her if there's anyway you can
Could you grease up that old metal roasting pan

And bake me a country ham
Honey glazed with a side of yams
Leave it in till it's golden brown
Pineapples all the way around
Let the sweet smell fill the air
Serve it to me in my underwear
I'm tired of eating imitation Spam
Could you bake me a country ham

I looked at her, with hungry eyes
She asked if I needed ketchup for my curly fries
I held my breath I could hardly wait
For my little slice of heaven on that Dixie plate
I could feel the juices running down my chin
As my stomach started singing once again

Could you bake me a country ham
Honey glazed with a side of yams
Leave it in till it's golden brown
Pineapples all the way around
Let the sweet smell fill the air
Serve it to me in my easy chair

Spend music way to little

Really gets me aggravated

He's got a gold tooth grill

And a dozen amps

When she cleans 'em out at the waffle house,
They'll bring in more ham and eggs , oh.
She's got a butt bigger than the Beatles.
Her favorite food is chocolate ding-dongs.
It's wide enough to play line-backer for the Eagles.
Deon Sanders better leave her alone.
Try chicken that's baked, or fat-free milk shake.
Enough for God's sake: Stop the insanity.
Weight watchers, yeah.
Weight watchers, yeah. 
Yeah, I watched her weight.
I watched it go from one seventeen and a quarter when I married her,
To three hundred and seventeen and a half, two-and-a-half years later. Mooo! 
But I still love ya, honey.",(She's Got a Butt) Bigger Than the Beatles

New lyrics by Cledus T. Judd and Cris Clark, La-Po Music (BMI)/Chris Clark Publishing Designee.



This is what Cledus T. wants...


If Shania was mine

Wouldn't be proud of me

Couldn't hardly blame her

'cause I'm so derned ugly

But on our first date

We could have a good time

If I got her on the moonshine


If Shania was mine

Say it fit just right

Though my polyester suit was just a little too tight

And there's no way

I'd have a bad hair day

'cause I'd buy a new toupee'


Oh, I'd love to seduce her

But she married her producer

Now all I do is pray, pray, pray!

She'll get a deevorce someday


If Shania was mine

I'd probably lose my mind

If she only squeezed me, teased me

Pleased me one good time

And if she only knew

All the things I'd do

I'd be the lawn mowin, crop growin

Tater peelin, house cleanin kind

If Shania was mine


Ha huh


If Shania was mine

She'd have to agree

Can't no one cook road kill better than me

Add a dozen mountain oysters and some old fatback

She'd say ""Mmm, I like it like that"" cha...

Now all I do is wonder

Whose bed have her boots been under

I wish she'd hadda been mine

Now I whine, whine!

That girl is so doggone fine


If Shania was mine

I think I'd go slap blind

Starin' at her yummy little tummy

And her booty shakin' round behind

And if she only knew

All the things I'd do

I'd be the lawn mowin' crop growin'

Tater peelin' house cleanin' kind

If Shania, if Shania, if Shania,

If Shania, if Shania (ACK HACK)


Now was that Mutt Lange or Deewight Yokel


When she shimmies and shakes

It's more than I can take

Oh, what she does to me in them videos

Wife's gonna leave me if I don't explain

What I see in Shania Twain

I'd love to see her in a magazine

Centerfold if you know what I mean

Oh me-a oh my-a

I wish that Shania

Would buy me a house in South Carolina

Two, four, six, eight, nine

Oh I wish that Shania was mine!

he he he huh huh

Want to be a gal of mine...

New lyrics by Cledus T. Judd (No Relation), BLT Publishing (BMI)

Yes I admit I've got a stinkin problem
Pheeeew
Ban Roll On just won't do
I soaked in Clorox bleach
Lysol and Pine Sol too

Yes I admit I've got a stinkin problem
I filled the tub right to the top
I'll start with my Brillo pad
But I don't know when to stop

I wake up and right away
A foul odor hits my nose
What's my sweat glands start to pour
I'll stink from my head down to my toes

Yes I admit I've got a stinkin problem
Aqua Velva can't cut through
Calgon won't take me away
Mr Bubbles just says ""pew""

Yes I admit I've got a stinkin problem
Put Dr Scholl's in my flip flops
Then I'll scrub my private parts
But I don't know when to stop

I've been called some filthy names
Why you no good littleâ?¦
And a lot of dirty words
Son of aâ?¦
I'm in a funk but just the same
I refuse to be deterred

Deterred???

Yes I admit I've got a stinkin problem
Even lye soap won't remove
Ivory Liquid and Irish Spring
I even tried my dog's shampoo

(woof)

Yes I admit I've got a stinkin problem
Smell like a hog knee deep in slop
I wore out my loofah pad
Maybe I should try a mop

David Ball might have had him a hit
But Cledus T.'s done stunk it up

Cledus T. Judd,"Now, we all know the pride of Hazzard County, Bo and Luke
Uncle Jesse, and let's not forget Miss Daisy Duke
Rosco, don't you know, that sheriff was no straight shooter
Some may hate Boss Hogg, but man, we all love Cooter

The girls down at the Boar's Nest used to love to see 'em comin'
There ain't much in that little town them Duke boys ain't tried jumpin'
And when we hear that General Lee's familiar ""Dixie"" hooter
We all knew we'd get to see a little Cooter

Now, Cooter is the reason that TV show was so hot
And Bo and Luke, they hung out with Cooter quite a lot
And when they took Cooter for a ride in them backwoods
They did things with Cooter (ha ha!) no man ever should

Cooter kept them boys' engine fired up and smokin' 
No matter how they tore it up, Cooter kept on goin'
No such thing as GPS or On-Star computer
Them there boys didn't need no help when it came to findin' Cooter

Now, we have every episode on high def DVD
And we love to watch ol' Bo hood slide across our big TV
And Daisy in her short shorts could knock me any cuter
But what we want to see is a whole lot more Cooter

For those of you who think this song could not be any cruder
Get your mind out of the gutter; I'm just talkin' about Cooter

Yee-haw!",Cooter
Cledus T. Judd,"I'm his biggest fan, since I heard The Dance
His music's meant the world to me
Cept that Chris Gaines CD
Since he's been gone, it's been too long
Since I've heard a song like 'Thunder Rolls
Or that Rodeo

I know he's in Oklahoma, yeah, with Trisha and his kids
Is he ever gonna put an album out again
Garth must be busy

He'd always sign, when the show would end
He'd grab a pen and stay all night long
Till the line was gone
He says he's through till his daughters are grown
And out on their own, he ain't coming back
Come on, just one track

He's got friends in low places that want to hear him play
But he won't even show up at the CMAs
Garth must be busy

And I know in the big picture, I'm just another fan
And Garth's got better things to do like drive that minivan
And my unanswered prayer is just to hear him sing
We're begging him to come back, but he ain't listening
Garth must be busy

Country Weekly news, ain't much changed
It all sounds the same since he went home
'Cept Kenny Chesney's grown
He loves his little girls, so don't hold your breath
Buddy, you can bet he won't go out on the road
He'll have to work, y'know

And his label's still mad at him for the slump in record sales
But he just tipped his hat and told 'em to go to hell

And he said, ""son, since george w

When mccain picked her as his running mate
I thought for sure that they'd be great
Till she spent a hundred thousand just on clothing

Have we lost our mind, we'll know in time

He's got a brand new, four year plan
He'll get 'em out of afghanistan
Bring 'em on home, we're waitin' on obama
And if he lowers my taxes like he says he'll do
And if half of what he says is true
Well, it'd be worth it waitin' on obama

'cause I've hardly been anywhere
With the price of gas this year
Sometimes, I think they did it 'cause they can do it
Billions spent on bailout plans
While they stick it to the working man
I guess by now, they think we're used to it
Now, I'm killin' time in the welfare line
Waitin' on obama

I saw where all the polls have shown
It's way past time for bush to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know folks is ready
So, stop, here comes obama time
And once he's in that house of white
I'll get myself some credit if they've got any

Don't waste our time, there's a real long line

He acts while other men just talk

His needs are more, so he gives less
They call him the winner who takes all
And he strikes, like thunderball

Any woman he wants, he'll get
He will break any heart without regret

His days of asking are all gone
His fight goes on and on and on

Tonight tonight tonight
And I guess its not that funny but ill say it anyway
Alright alright alright
And the joke is that the stereo just ate the mix tape that you made
Alive alive alive
And I don't think your friends coming cause the answering machines
Turned off turned off turned off
And the joke is there's one beer left so the punchlines all we have left
To drink to drink to drink
And you were hoping that maybe a party would break the silence of this room 
With laughs with laughs with laughs

Clem Snide,"Your beautiful African friend
Next to him I look so white
So white that you turned away
And wanted me out of your sight

To be exotic and I did pretend
In the back yard to slowly undress
As you pull the twigs from my hair
That I'd put there myself, I confess

So come lay on the couch with me
'Cause nature's too wild and free
Come lay on the couch
We don't have to work on our tans

A beautiful African man
Well, next to him, I felt so white
As white as a page in a book
That I'd read but still don't understand

So I joked of a forbidden fruit
As we argued into the night
In a city of tanning salons
And TV screens all shining bright

'Cause nature's too wild, it's too wild and free
Come lay on the couch

And warm, buttered is good

For high fives and shakes

And the bathroom's a mess

Clem Snide,"The Dairy Queen has melted
Having laid all her eggs
And the sporting good store
At the corner under the overpass

With an ice cream hot mouth
She smiled a carnation pink
Into the root canal music
Of a prom night disaster that sink

On roads paved with liver and onions
As the ginger ale tickled her noise
And the power lines traced with a finger
Where gray turning gold

Jokingly blowing a bubble
As the teenagers slammed on their brakes
And sucking her teeth
She insisted on raising the stakes

Now the Dairy Queen is quiet
Sweating brown vinyl seats
With a need for directions
And candy that's never too sweet",The Dairy Queen

Dance that couch across the floor
You'll sprain your wrist

There's no way that love can help
Your twisted ankles when you fall

Entertain a love that's always late
Jumping jacks could ease your mind
Folding sweat suits with a knotted hand
You can almost touch your toes

Under construction forever
Changing her form she fits like my clothes
And trying to kiss her I bloody my nose

Through parking lot cities with a coal miner's sense
And I know her love is not worth it
As the thing to try to impress
As the thing to try to undress

Clem Snide,"Mike kalinsky had asthma
He was often absent from school
But he still performed well on tests & quizzes
So all the other kids felt like fools

Mike kalinsky had asthma
Spinning bottles never pointed his way
You see, he had difficulty breathing
So he couldn't participate in sports
And all the jocks said he was gay

There is no cure for asthma
But does anyone even care?
Mike kalinsky spent high school alone in his bedroom listening to joy division and the misfits
And going nowhere

and years passed
I forgot all about him
And then one night, I was hanging out at a local rock club
Checking out a band a friend of mine said I really shouldn't miss
And there he was, singing
A song that went a little something like this:

'I couldn't even blow out a simple match'",Mike Kalinsky
Clem Snide,"Love can be hard but it was so smart of you

Summer will come and be all green with the sweetness of thee

Just because you were both born on that day
And half-Jewish boys make kick ass drummers
But if you need lessons I'll have to pay
And I hope that your friends are true and funny
And your girlfriends are sweet and wear tight pants
And after your heart is gently broken
I hope that you get a second chance

Clem Snide,"When it finally collapsed all you heard was the radio static
And the fluttering sound of the bird that was trapped in the attic
But you couldn't be sure that it wasn't just all in your head
As you carefully swept all the broken glass out of your bed

When it finally collapsed all the actors were hotly protested
The people they had to portray were a little depressing
So a grass roots initiative based upon sharing and trust
Went into production to harness the power of dust

When it finally collapsed as it had been since way before when
The pedophiles did their rendition of You've Got a Friend
Everyone had to admit that it wasn't half bad
But they still felt uneasy fearing they'd be dismissed as a fad

When it finally collapsed giant billboards made people aware
Of the idea that we are comprised of just water and air
A vandal had written that Jesus knows just how you feel
When you're falling asleep, asleep at the wheel",Collapse
Clem Snide,"You're so sophisticated
Your mind's been liberated
You're the first to notice when a movement's come and gone

Just as the curtain closes
I strike authentic poses 
Now that we know all the words to history's sad songs

So don't be apocalyptic
There's still time to get your last licks
But very soon the glory will make shameful what is true

And don't be apologetic 
So what if it is genetic?
The cowards still breathe easy as their secret's safe with you

Are you still feeling bad
That your mother left your dad?
Are you so sure that everybody lies?

Guess what your pains been done
Took perfection by everyone
And the first thing every killer reads is

There'll be no sliding down your chute

Your blood will color every sunset

So I stared at the sun till the tears filled my eyes
Well I thought I was empty so I paid the cost
But now that I'm found I miss being lost

With the promise that I would be free of my sins
But I only felt guilty that he died on the cross

Twas the pills that she was poppin' that did her in

Clem Snide,"I woke up to the sound of German hip hop in my head
A great unholy clatter quickly filling me with dread
I wondered then if silence had forever disappeared
What, with everybody yelling the end was finally here

I scrambled for the television, desperate for its light
Hoping that my favorite stars could stop this endless night
I waited for instructions, I waited for a sign
I listened very carefully when told just what to buy

Lovers became bitter, mathematicians counting crumbs
Some were filled with angry lust, the rest felt mostly numb
The sun became the enemy, they'd hunger after dark
And kill time swapping partners at a club called Noah's Arc

Those who spoke of doom impending, suffering and such
Had found the place in people's heart that beauty had once touched
They filled the auditorium, the tickets far from cheap
Those that couldn't get in started fighting in the street

The day came so we gathered in a field behind the mall
A noted scientist predicted there we'd see it all
The city council members came, they told us not to fear
The king and queen of homecoming both shed a poignant tear

Just like that it happened, the starling blinked its eye
The molecules collided and became part of the sky
All my life I've never known a moment quite so still
Like space that's being emptied at the same time that it's filled

I woke up to the sound of German hip hop in the air
It sounded like a hum of insects nesting in my hair
I wasn't so much tired but I felt that I should sleep
So I closed my eyed and mumbled something about a soul to keep",The Sound of German Hip-Hop

Are dropping from the sky
They're wonderfully efficient
Engines fueled by Spanish wine

Maybe just a sip
To help us get a grip
Did you know Isaac Newton
Was a virgin when he died

A hundred thousand naked woman
Running on the beach
In such a state of wild abandon
They ignore my speech

About the overt flow
A dangerous undertow
And how there is a hole so deep
It swallows up the sun

Oh, the smoke seems sweet to me
Must be a perfume factory
Just one of many ancient travesties

The gold that we found buried in her teeth
For wigs her hair was sold
To drunken soldiers, stumbling down the street

The rainbow colored shapes to fill our eyes
Made powder from her bones

Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation,
And for the old folks at home.

All the world is sad and dreary,
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home",Swanee River
Clement Verzi,"Elle a de ces lumières au fond des yeux
Qui rendent aveugles ou amoureux
Elle a des gestes de parfum
Qui rendent bête ou rendent chien
Et si lointaine dans son cœur
Pour moi c'est sûr, elle est d'ailleurs

Elle a de ces manières de ne rien dire
Qui parlent au bout des souvenirs
Cette manière de traverser
Quand elle s'en va chez le boucher
Quand elle arrive à ma hauteur
Pour moi c'est sûr, elle est d'ailleurs

Et moi je suis tombé en esclavage
De ce sourire, de ce visage
Et je lui dis ""emmène-moi""
Et moi je suis prêt à tous les sillages
Vers d'autres lieux, d'autres rivages
Mais elle passe et ne répond pas
Les mots pour elle sont sans valeur
Pour moi c'est sûr, elle est d'ailleurs

Elle a ces longues mains de dentellière
A damner l'âme d'un Vermeer
Cette silhouette vénitienne
Quand elle se penche à ses persiennes

Clémentine,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Clémentine,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Clémentine,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again

Clémentine,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Carical fat cap, perfect.
Sapessi che ho combinato
Fratè ho rubato 30 mila euro in un programma

Da allora sono una divinità come Zeus
Facevo la comparsa per una fiction sugli sbirri
Dovevo stare sul posto alle otto
La canna in tasca sempre fissa
Tu hai mai visto un rapper fatto vestito da poliziotto??

Tesori nei bauli chiusi dei pirati

Clementino,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind

Sono I miei passi che si muovono
Sotto queste palazzine
Qui giù si scovano 
Le più belle ragazzine
Il neomelodico droghe qui nelle stanzine
Le compri a poco e pure sfuse 
Come le cartine
Non siete mai sicuri
Pure con I cani
Qui negli angoli più bui
Le notti non vi coricate più
C'è una politica che stritola
Le teste come il boa
Schiaccia dentro il cervello
Come le feste goa
Niente robin hood
Questa non è l'hollywood

Vengo dalle palazzine
Nelle tasche bianche galatine
Io lo so non per sentito dire
E con voi non ho un cazzo da spartire
Dalle palazzine vengo dalle palazzine
Nelle tasche bianche galatine

Guardo sto mondo dal mio attico 
Del quinto piano
Senza ascensore arrivi in cima
Con un polmone in mano
Portoni aperti
E carry al pianerottolo
Gli sbirri in rally in elicottero
Sul pusher che lavora a cottimo
Su centocelle il sole splende
Inverno-estate
Con le nike squagliate tutt'uno 
Con st'asfalto incorporate
So cazzi per chi campa
Con la svolta in una scarpa
E la storia nell'altra
Palazzine in busta
Taglia e scarta
Giorno e notte via vai
Casa piazza
Punto snai
Soldi in tasca
State of mind
RM by night
So cazzi nostri
Marmitte Malossi
Borchie sui collari dei molossi
Le bevute ai mostri 
Street gossip
Appare fumo
Arriva la volante e non c'è più nessuno
Roma vince 4-1 al derby
Tra ste strade te ce perdi facile
Se non sei del luogo
Napoli Roma fino a Nola
Nella zona alziamo più fuoco

Qui ti ribalti senza ribalta delle cronache
Per ogni testa che salta
Ne spunta un'altra con la febbre alta
Sparta contro atene sembrano le comiche
E vivi tra mostri come Cthulhu e riti Woodoo
Scendo di notte e tra le tag
Sono il conte Vlad
Ti pare niente mutagenics para siempre
Per adesso ancora onesto
Resto senza dubbio alcuno
Il successo ha tanti padri
Il fallimento ne ha solo uno
Meglio re per dieci
Che gregario per diecimila
I miei fratelli al notiziario
E non in cartolina
È leggendario ogni nome
Su questa panchina
Scolpiti nelle fondamenta
Di questa disciplina
Prima di chiamarmi rapper
Qui mi chiamano MC
Porta rispetto 
Senò te lo metto in bocca Oral-B
Ora ti danni ma è tutto inutile perchè
Parli di strada quando da vent'anni
È la strada che parla di me",Dalle palazzine

Ho la soluzione
Chiameremo tutti quanti
Con un solo nome
E sarà quallo che già sanno
Perchè da quest'anno

E gli idealismi soffrano
I cinici si espandono
E I numeri congelano I cuori
Che intanto battono 
E non si fermano
A stabilire il minimo
Ma puntano al massimo
E premono sul limite
Tra un uomo ed il suo simile
La strada è l'università
Che laurea chi attacca 
E si difende dal pusher
Che ti compra
E ti rivende a un prezzo da miseria
Ti fa pagare l'aria 

È una tribù che balla
Edizione straordinaria

Clementino,"Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea grandissima culpa.

Vivo o morto, che differenza c'è?
Voi siete buoni e lo dovete a me.
Gira e rigira qui nessuno è innocente,
Il mondo si divide tra chi fa e chi è òmmo 'e niente.
Vivo o morto dimmi,
Che differenza fa?
Questa vita è peggio dell'aldilà. 
Io di morire no, non ho paura
E il Paese solo grazie a me
Non è affondato ancora.

Giuro di dire la verità
Sicuro la colpa è di essere vivo, per carità.
Giudice, questo è un equivoco sai che qua, 
Pentiti in giro che gridano falsità
Nelle colonne di cemento armato 
C'è minimo il nonno, il fratello e il cognato 
Che sono stai fatti a pezzi da Dio.
Mò ce l'hai con me?
Era meglio se morivo pur'io.
Il controllo del territorio non è qua, 
Pippo e Topolino che comandano nel lunapark.
'Sti ragazzi pippano il granito che è tagliato
Con il chewing gum e li porterà nell'aldilà.
Sono storie di merda,
E non ci posso fare nulla,
Io sono innocente come un bimbo nella culla.
Vado in chiesa tutti I giorni prima dell'aperitivo
E la mia unica colpa è quella di essere vivo.

Io di morire no, non ho paura
E il Paese solo grazie a me

O la morte o in galera,
Qui non c'è via di mezzo.
Camminiamo sui sacchetti,
A noi che cazzo ce ne frega. 
Tutti corrotti signor giudice, anche lei 
È inutile che prima fa il pazzo e dopo nega. 
A parte il fatto che non siamo solo noi il cancro della società
C'è la crisi nell'aria si sa.
I vecchi al governo non lasciano il posto ai giovani 
Chi guarda la differenza di costo e poveri.
Diciamo che un certo Roberto Saviano,
Diciamo che un certo Giuseppe Impastato,
Diciamo che un certo Giovanni Falcone
Non vi fate Capaci, come l'attentato.
È difficile azzerare tutto e ricominciare da capo, 
Ricominciare da ca-, ricominciare da capo
In cella mangierò bene quando il pranzo è servito,
E la mia unica colpa è quella di essere vivo.

Vivo o morto, che differenza c'è?
Voi siete buoni e lo dovete a me.

Io di morire no, non ho paura
E il Paese solo grazie a me

La storia va storta, avvocato
Coi casi irrisolti e coi morti nel prato.
Tutto sommato,
Lei crede alla Chiesa 
Non vede se è Satana o Madre Teresa 
O-K mi fa capire perché dovrei 
Sentirmi dire certe cose, potrei
Prendere pistole, minacciarla farei 
Una grossa bomba a mano e poi venire da lei.

Ti giuro mamma
Questo è l'ultimo caffè che bevo
Il poco riposo mi rendo nervoso
E mi chiedo
Se rimarrà solo la polvere
Nelle mie mani
Ed il risultato sarà correre
Su quelle navi.
I figli di puttana
Fanno saltare I miei piani
Loro ci vogliono trattare
Da poveri schiavi
E chi sogna l'america più lontana
Come un secolo fa il sangue
Dei nostri avi
Dimenticati dal padre eterno
Brucia qua l'inferno
E chi non sta mai fermo
È perché è stanco dentro
Camminando a testa alta
Ascoltando la voce del vento
Avrà fatto centro.

Parlo a nome di una generazione
Che qui non ha più niente
Ed è costretta a dipendere
Sempre dalla gente
Andare via fino a su
Ma con la mente di giù
Rimane solo il vento
A noi artisti
Sempre di più
Con la valigia in mano
Varchiamo una nazione
Che non dà opportunità
O valore
A quello che inventiamo
Nun c'a' facc' ‘cchiu
Trent'anni in mezzo a sta' merda
Ma mi rimbocco le mani
Frà ricominciamo
Se credi che da grande
Ragioni così
Allora ragazzino
Tu non hai capito un cazzo.
Ti aspettavo
E per la prossima fine del mondo
Come disse un vecchio saggio
Io speriamo che me la cavo.
Guarda la gente quand' sent' o' vient

N'copp' ‘a pell'
Ragiona che cos' n'copp' all'anema
E quell' che pruov' a chiamma' verità
Sensibilità ppe' l'aria din't a' na carica
Vorrei capire adesso il tempo
Che ho a disposizione
Per confessare I miei peccati
E quanti no, signore!
E quell' che pruov' a chiamma' verità
Sensibilità ppe' l'aria e vient ‘ppe l'anima

Me sient' song a voc e chi n'ten nient

Me sient' song a voc e chi n'ten nient
Mentre parton' e bastimient'
Ce riman' sultant' o' vient, o' vient

Ti giuro mamma
Questo è l'ultimo caffè che bevo
Come troisi
Mi rende nervoso
E poi mi chiedo
Quando le storie finiranno
Sempre le stesse
Il tempo mi passa davanti

Scaglio l'ultima pietra
Tra peccatori ci capiamo
E voi benvenuti al sud
Mo' ve lo speghiamo
Porto una croce come gesù cristo
Ed il suo calvario
È quello di essere italiano
Sai come mi chiamo? Bravo
Le persone che mi apprezzano
Per quello che sono
Perché a volte non c'è un prezzo
Per quel suono
Le mie idee continueranno
A viaggiare
Con la voce del vento
Di chi non ha nulla
E che sa cantare

Clementino,"Dammi la mano e adesso stringimi
Che farò notte
Il battito del cuore a tempo
Come un pianoforte
Hai solo 16 anni ti senti già grande
Tuo padre torna ubriaco a casa
I buchi nelle scarpe
L'espressione e il volto della depressione
Pochi mesi fa un agguato e per sbaglio
La mamma era al mercato
Tu non l'hai mai accettato
Gli psicofarmaci ti servono 
A guarire o alleviare ferite
Mi chiedo se tutto questo
Ha un senso se con un fiore
Combatti il cemento
Passano ore e parole che invento
Immortalare momenti rubati dal vento
E quando guardi quelle foto
Vuoi la forza di 300 soldati messi in fila
Pronti a puntare il pugnale 
Bevi rum e tequila per imparare a scordare
Almeno questa sera non ti può
Fare del male
Almeno questa sera ti può sembrare normale

Dimmi adesso dove andrai
Dimmi che succederà
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate
Dimmi poi cosa sarà
Di chi profuma di strada
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate

Una città che brucia
Qual è la strada giusta
Conti sti pezzi d'erba
Tutti messi in una busta
Gli amici qui 
Ti vogliono veder felice
Sorridere e poi lo sanno
Che la noia è una cosa terribile
Per il tuo amico non è stata
Rosa e primavera
Per lui e per tutti gli altri
Suoi fratelli li in galera
I tatuaggi fatti bene perchè 
Il tipo è esperto
Fanatico del calcio segna pure
In mare aperto
Però c'ha un male dentro
Ed è un veleno 
Che ha già preso il sopravvento
E la faccia da spavento
Le mani tremano 
Hai fumato 4 pacchi
E non ti tengono alla prima
E tutti alzano I tacchi
Rimani solo in questo porco mondo
È naturale e questa merda nel tuo cuore
Che sta per scoppiare
Almeno questa volta non ti può fare del male
Almeno questa sera ti può sembrare normale

Dimmi adesso dove andrai
Dimmi che succederà
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate
Dimmi poi cosa sarà
Di chi profuma di strada
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate

I tipi fanno a botte fuori da quello chalet
Sembrava una scazzottata
Come le tante altre
Non ti farà pensare al dramma
Che potrà arrivare
Con I miei occhi ho visto un uomo 
In aria saltare
Il giorno dopo sul giornale 
Una notizia gira
Non è la fine del mondo
Ma quella del rispetto
La fine dei ragazzi
La fine della vita
Per chi rimane in strada
Ancora carenza d'affetto
Un mare di cazzate che raccontano in tv
Se non la spacco devo ringraziare la tribù 
Di quelli che mi stanno sempre più vicino
E che ci credono alla profezia di Clementino
Adesso fuori qui fratello
Scoppia il temporale
Non ci rimane che andare
Sotto la pioggia compare
Almeno questa volta 
Non ti può fare del male
Almeno questa sera ti può sembrare normale

Dimmi adesso dove andrai
Dimmi che succederà
Quando le vele saranno ormai
Tutte spiegate
Dimmi poi cosa sarà
Di chi profuma di strada
Quando le vele saranno ormai

E sono morto ridendo qui mentre tutti piangevano.
Suona rock, house, blues, Rock and roll's, lo sciamano nel deserto,
Segnala la strada sicura ma mi perdo.
Se un giorno all'improvviso ti svegli e non vedi il sole
In poche parole, o sei morto o sei il sole.
Sfonda le porte della percezione, è un'eccezione,
Che convalida la regola e in testa un'ossessione!
Voglio tornare bambino, perchè le ginocchia sbucciate 
Fanno meno male che dei cuori infranti da vecchio,
Dal momento che non mi fido piu' di nessuno 
È sicuro fratello il mio migliore amico è lo specchio
Se ti dicono che l'amore è un sogno 
Tu sogna pure ma non stupirti se ti svegli piangendo
Siamo buoni a nulla ma capaci a tutto, 
Questo pezzo te lo dedico e il mondo se ne sta cadendo

Chi di voi sa di esser davvero vivo,
Ogni giorno qui è veleno nocivo,
Piccola lady, che mi succede?
Questa è la fine, this is the end
Chi di voi sa di esser davvero vivo,
Ogni giorno qui è veleno nocivo,
Piccola lady, che mi succede?
Questa è la fine, this is the end

E la notte è un pozzo nero
Dove bagno le mie opere è un mistero. 
Ora! Baby balla intorno al totem, 
Mentre vado a uccidere mio padre, 
A fottere mia madre!
E vedrai apparire li un serpente,
Sulle scaglie avrà la storia di tutta la gente.
Divora le coscienze,
Mostro di energia onnipotente
Sulla fronte un occhio rosso ed un occhio tutto verde
Io poeta maledetto, hai capito del delirio 
Sono la vera divinità
Mi puoi chiamare Re lucertola

Sei come sei
Tu sei come sei
Tu sei come sei

Tu sei come sei
Perchè non parli mai
Il sole nei tuoi occhi
Brucia tutto e te ne vai
Bella come sei
Non cambiare più
A illuminarmi l’anima
Ci riesci solo tu
Non so se sia una follia mia
Quest’indelebile svarione di malinconia
Il peso dei ricordi che lascia la scia
Con un messaggio ho rovinato tutto
E sei andata via
Non mi rimane che il mare
Guardare le onde
Qui sono profonde
Fenomenale come le note
Di quella canzone
Che tu mi mettevi
Ogni giorno a colazione
Dici che sono stronzo
Perchè non ti rispondo
E signorì sei solo tu
La vera fine del mondo
Ordini di tutto e non ti va
Di mangiare
E c’ho la forza ancora
Di chiamarti lascia stare
Ma siamo fuori
Sono io che ti ho lasciato ieri
Siamo riflessi nello stesso specchio dei pensieri
E la tua voce che è più calda di queste parole
Picchi in testa come rum sotto al sole

Tu sei come sei
Perchè non parli mai
Il sole nei tuoi occhi
Brucia tutto e te ne vai
Bella come sei
Non cambiare più
A illuminarmi l’anima
Ci riesci solo tu
È un destino
Quello di essere soli
Come me
Nel cestino le emozioni
Non so contenere
Monogamia
Sociopatia
Fotografia dei nostri tempi
Non per sorridere
Mi mostri I denti
L’amore è autodidatta
I corpi sono gli strumenti
Accordati il suono spacca
Senza effetti
Come indumenti
Settime ottave
Se ti può dare
Cosa importa il tono
Se è il falsetto grave
Per una coppia così
Ci vuole un letto grande
E un tetto trasparente
Lo spavento sta sparendo
Spasmi fantasmi una scala di tasti
Spaghetti di nastri
Disastri rimasti di altri
E sono sempre e solo
Le tue mani che voglio su di me
Finchè viene domani
Too man groupie
Entrano nel backstage
Finte come le loro extention
E il peggio sono tutte ex dei miei

Tu sei come sei
Perchè non parli mai
Il sole nei tuoi occhi
Brucia tutto e te ne vai
Bella come sei
Non cambiare più
A illuminarmi l’anima
Ci riesci solo tu
È che non ti faccio mai un regalo
È che sono sempre in ritardo
È che sono io il più bastardo
E come al solito quello più codardo 
È che non ti faccio mai un regalo
È che sono sempre in ritardo
È che sono io il più bastardo
E come al solito quello più codardo 

Tu sei come sei

Clementino,"Ma che sarà?
Quando il tempo cambierà
Chissà cosa farai?
Quando tutto questo passerà
E passerà
Alle medie I professori
Ci chiamavano
Ritardati mentali
Tutti coi capelli uguali
Fatti a criminali
Ballavamo trance ai mak P
Arrivavamo in discoteta in 3
Sopra a un si
Quando ero a scuola
Dopo l’occupazione
Ci misero dentro un salone
Di una villa abbandonata
A fare lezione
Passare le ore
Copiare il compito di matematica
Uanema fuori dal balcone
Dream team la tribù che dal sud
E con l’asso di bastoni
Sulla targa a testa in giù
Non c’era un cazzo e inventavamo
I giochi più strani
Lo schiaffo del soldato
A nascondino frà non ci trovavi
Le impennate con le moto truccate anormali
Il mio scooter fra la scia
Dietro la ferrari (uanema)
Ero perso tra I sogni
E I miei tabuù
Senza fare il biglietto sul bus

Camminando per le vie della città
Osservando poi la strada che se ne va
Svagando svarionando
Senza pensieri
Tu puoi guardar cadere le stelle dei desideri
E cominciai a fare rap
All’epoca suonare
Nei locali era difficile per me sai
Perchè? il tipo mi diceva
Si ma quanta gente mi porti?
Se lo sapevo facevo il PR cumpariè
Forse è meglio iniziare a fare le gare
Che tantomeno fai dei soldi
E poi ti fai notare
E I miei dicevano Clemè statt accort
Andavo solo senza doppie manager e scort
Le partite ai videogiochi fino all’alba
Con quelli seri I miei fratelli
Botte da orbi sul divano
Scugnizzi per le strade
Hinterland napoletano
Una mente contorta
Come Frank Matano
E mi affidavo alla saggezza degli anziani
Che mi dicevano di rispettare
I sogni e I piani
Hai imparato a camminare e mo ti piace correre
Si ma fai piano così tu andrai lontano

Camminando per le vie della città
Osservando poi la strada che se ne va
Svagando svarionando
Senza pensieri
Tu puoi guardar cadere le stelle dei desideri
La mia vita suddivisa tra pagine e righe
I pensieri dalla mattina alle 15
Intendo fino a ieri
Così la svolta parte da una birra al bar
Le gare musica illuminaci la via
Più giusta a noi guerrieri
E mi domando che sarà
Quando il tempo passerà
Voltandomi vedrò lo sfondo
Della strada scomparire da lontano
E le abitudini che qua sono diverse
Dal posto in cui sono nato
Dove respiro aria di mare
Aspiro ad arginare questa negatività
Fino ad arrivare lassù
Sulla punta di una vetta
Sventolando una bandiera
Con la faccia di una iena estrema
E non lo so se poi tornerò
Sui miei passi brò
Al massimo è un classico
Che chi ritorna indietro
Lo fa senza rimorso
Quindi se c’è un muro ci si passa attraverso
Camminando sulla sabbia a piedi nudi
E sentire sotto l’acqua l’effetto che fa
E poi cantare respirando aria di mare
E poi andare a far l’amore fino a quando ti pare
Ma che sarà?
Quando il tempo cambierà
Chissà cosa farai?
Quando tutto questo passerà
E passerà
Passerà
E passerà",Senza pensieri

Qui vedi va bene così,

Questo è il terzo giorno che ci svegliamo male e chiami giuda me,
Hai buttato giù la mia valigia dalle scale quanta rabbia esplode ancora prima di un caffè,
Ieri poi a vedere ""I love radio rock""
Senza lenzuola addosso,
Uno schock,
Dio quanto mi piacciono I tuoi viaggi,
E poi quando mi baci I tatuaggi,
Please miss? kiss me
Gira una ruota d'amore,
Freesbe, 
Si ma in fondo mi rendo conto che nonostante tutto va bene così,
La gelosia fa più male del veleno in vena.
La passione che va e ritorna mentre ieri mi ami,
Ora gridi: ti odio iena!

Come quella tipa si ma noi di più.
La nostra droga tra le dita tipo Grignani su youtube,
E ti senti libera,
E sei tu no il fato che mi guiderà.
E balliamo sembriamo Jim e Pam,
Attaccati come l'ombra a Peter Pan,
Ti porterò nel luogo segreto e vedrai 
Che c'è nascota come un osso sotto un cane che abbaia,
È questa musica che spacca e che volevi 
Tu sarà la fine del mondo come sfidare I maya

E I tuoi capelli al vento,
E come queste piante,
Dici che per tante pietre ho perso il miglior diamante.
Non è il corvo piove sempre,
Quelle notti tu hai presente?
Sono I nostri ricordi ma dirtelo adesso lo so che poi non vale niente.
Ti ricordi la luna com'era?
Quella sera eri sulla cometa,
Guardavamo universi e la costellazione di Orione da un altro pianeta.
Ti dicevo che quando mi amplifichi il battito sala in un attimo istinto animale.
Apro gli occhi sono quaggiù poi mi giro e tu non sei più qui

E andare più lontano quella è la risposta

Una tazzulella di questo caffè e passa l’appucundrì
Con una sigaretta sopra e quando piove è una magia
Anima e cuore e con la chitarra hai composto queste poesie
Io so pazz e non me scassat o’cazz
Ora si rivolta il rione e tutti scendono dal palazzo
Saluta totò, massimo e pure edoardo
Ti penso in queste note se mi sento quando quando
napoli è un carta sporca, Napoli è mille colori
E ci hai lasciato in queste vie nere con la paura
E se ogni scarrafone è bell a mamma soia sicuro
Allora la voce di questi bambini resta il futuro

Ti vedo se guardo il mare
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Perché sei napoli
Ti penso se guardo il cielo
Se un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Guarda come se cambia davvero
gesù, Gesù non te ne accorgi più, guagliò
Ti vedo se guardo il mare
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Perché sei Napoli

Io dubbi più non ho fratello che dio ti benedica
Che male c’è se adesso questa canzone è la mia amica
Un deserto di parole, non calpesto I fiori
Vorrei essere allegro con uno spinello qua fuori
Chi ama il mare cammina a bocca salata lo sai
Che siamo neri a metà, yes I know my way
Io sto vicino a te ma tu resta con me
E guardo dai balconi di napoli se è morto un re
Stanotte è suonato il telefono e la notizia mi uccide
Io stavo dentro l’albergo sveglio senza dormire
Mi hai lasciato in bocca l’amaro di chi non può scappare
So che sei fiero di me e ora mi devo fare ascoltare
Il tuo nome rimarrà impresso in queste vie
In queste teste, in questi dischi una canzone amica
Grazie per i consigli mi danno coraggio
Voglio dire solo zio pino ora fai buon viaggio

Ti vedo se guardo il mare
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Perché sei napoli
Ti penso se guardo il cielo
Se un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Guarda come se cambia davvero
gesù, Gesù non te ne accorgi più, guagliò
Ti vedo se guardo il mare
Sei un ricordo che rimane per sempre
Perché sei napoli

Porterò con me i preziosi consigli che mi hai dato
E terrò custodito con cura quel regalo che mi hai fatto
Così le parole delle tue canzoni
Saranno trasmesse di generazione in generazione ancora di più
Terrò vivo il tuo ricordo nella mia musica per sempre, promesso
Ora riposa in pace zio Pino

Io mi chiamo Cafiero Pasquale
Sto a poggio reale dal '53

E al centesimo catenaccio
Alla sera mi sento uno straccio
Per fortuna che al braccio speciale
C'è un uomo geniale che parla co' me

Tutto il giorno con quattro infamoni
Briganti, papponi, cornuti e lacchè
Tutte l'ore cò 'sta fetenzia

Per fortuna c'è chi mi risponde
A quell'uomo sceltissimo immenso

Non chiedo la grazia pe' me
Vi faccio la barba o la fate da sé

Voi tenete un cappotto cammello
Che al maxi processo eravate 'o chiù bello
Un vestito gessato marrone
Così ci è sembrato alla televisione
Pe' 'ste nozze vi prego, eccellenza

Clementino,"Ye
Tolgo gli occhiali scuri
Voglio guardare il celo
E voglio fare bene, la vita appesa ad un treno
Nella mia scesa tremo
Paura del futuro come Martin io volo
Contro il muro del suono
Trattami come un figlio adesso che ci sei
Le notti testa e foglio scrivo fino alle 6
Un altra fiamma accesa ci sta aspettando
Tocco il silenzio per loro nei giorni che verranno
E sognavamo su panchine viaggi che calore
Eravamo nel cortile calci a quel pallone
Qui fuori grandina gocce di pioggia frenano sul vetro di questa finestra che mi affascina
Il cuore che si agita quelle foto buttate nel cesso
Di un dimenticatoio che sparirà e facevamo
Senza capire fratelli e amici ed eravamo felici
Fumavamo queste radici
Oh oh non andare via, via dalle mie mani
Oh oh non andare via, via da questo sguardo",Lettera Alla Musica
Clementino,"Notte che nasconde i colori dietro alle stelle
Riempio le valigie di momenti insieme
Le volte che noi ridevamo a crepapelle
Pensare di nuovo al passato non conviene

Domandavi se era l'amore puro
O era senza futuro
Un cuore duro, una kalimba di luna per magia
Ci guidava quando il sole
Se ne andava via

Adesso tutto è cambiato
Sei scappata lontano
Colpa della fiducia
E alla fine del caso
Perché non c'era un piano
Quindi noi ce ne andiamo
Per due strade diverse
Perché noi ci capiamo

Sento la tua voce nel silenzio
Questo tuo profumo ferma il tempo
Chissà se ci vedremo nello stesso posto
Ricordi l'anno scorso ad agosto

Ricordo quella notte al mare
Un sogno che non può tornare
E penso a quelle cose rare
Che adesso vorrei sotterrare
Ricordo quella notte al mare
Un sogno che non può tornare
E penso a quelle cose rare
Che adesso vorrei sotterrare

Kalimba de luna
Un suono tra la sabbia se ne va

Kalimba de luna
Sient' arrivà l'onda

Kalimba de luna
Quando l'onda ci travolgerà

Kalimba de luna
Sient' arrivà l'onda

Te la passo, mi guardi due tiri e già riparti
Mi lasci solo in questo party
Vuoi toccare il cielo? Non serve un aereo
E adesso sale un fumo denso dallo stereo
Ti chiamo quando meno te lo aspetti
Ti diverti
Inventi
Mi dici sono fatto di difetti
Perfetti

Ti arrendi

Pubblicavi le tue foto sorridente
Ti arrabbiavi quando mi vedevi assente
Mi taggavi negli stati continuamente
Ho cambiato già tre nomi praticamente
Tutte le discoteche, i murales a Londra
Ti piacevano e correvamo sotto la pioggia
Tornavamo in Italia, c'era un sole bestiale

Quella sera dovevo andare a suonare al mare
Dopo il concerto sulla spiaggia

C'era la luna più bella mai vista
Veniva sempre più vicino
Ci addormentammo davanti a sto falò
E ci svegliammo col buongiorno delle prime luci del mattino

Adesso non ci sei più ma quando ascolti 'sto groove
I pensieri che salgono mano a mano lassù
Nella testa sento ancora un ricordo che fuma
Attraverso il suono di una kalimba de luna

Ricordo quella notte al mare
Un sogno che non può tornare
E penso a quelle cose rare
Che adesso vorrei sotterrare

Clementino,"Vorrei tornare indietro! ma quanti sbagli fra’
Ho capito che non li ripeto
Il cuore dentro si era fatto qui come la pietra
A 15 anni una promessa che volevo questo e prendermi anche una cometa
Quante notti oscurate, nocche spaccate, 
Note stonate, quanti dei nostri a fare le cose sbagliate
C’è chi si è perso dietro un muro e chi va avanti per il suo
C’è chi ha la forza tutti I giorni e poi combatte il buio
Io che sto qui a guardare il mondo da più sfumature
Lontano da mamma e papà dove sono le cure? 
Circondato dal disordine, scappato come rondine

Quante cose cambiate negli anni
Un amico mi chiamava e diceva frate
Perché se cadrai io ti rialzerò
O mi sdraio qui vicino a te
La storia di un musicante emigrante anima vagante
E guarda come cambia tutto quando sei distante
E la voglia di sentirti grande
5 ragazzi e un volante
Uanema santa
Ma k capa vacant
Così mi tengo stretto dentro tutto quello che ho
Pregando che dall’alto qualcuno ci salvi perciò
Chi porta I figli a scuola tutti I giorni spera in un futuro migliore
E c’è chi guarda fuori e prega il signore
Me lo lo riscrivo adesso con l’inchiostro sulla pelle
Di tutti quei ricordi come schiavi nelle celle
I chiari di luna, la notte più infame e ribelle. 
Noi da bambini volevamo toccare le stelle.

Clementino,"Ti ricordi quando sei partito?
Nelle tasche nemmeno un quattrino
Perso in un campo un fiore appassito
Ti nascondevi come un assassino
E la musica volevi nella vita
Forse l’unica che avevi tra le dita
Alti e bassi fra risate e pianti
Questi grandi passi con i tanti pazzi

Quando sei arrivato lontano
Cercare un lavoro non è molto strano
Su queste cose ci passerei
Quando resti solo come ""Cast Away""
E cercavi delle buone idee
E dicevi dove sono i miei?
E tua madre dice come stai?
E tu al telefono ""mammà poi vedrai""
Quando sarò di nuovo laggiù
Questo ragazzo che tornerà al sud
E ti racconterò di più

Il giorno che io tornerò
Sotto le stelle canterò
Il giorno che io tornerò
Come ti sembra frà la mia città
Non è cambiata ma
Sotto le stelle canterò

Ora che tutto è cambiato
Vorresti tornare ma come ti senti?
Fra vari spaventi rimangono in testa
Domani chissà cosa inventi e rimangono in venti
Da mille che avevi
Ne avevi un milione
Quanti ce ne sono ancora
Preme la stretta il microfono al cuore
La mano alla Panda guardando il signore
Eravamo ragazzi
Vivevo per trovare incastri
Mano che è sporca di nero ma il tempo passava firmando i palazzi
Ora le note traducono passi
Mille volte trasudano sassi
Questi passi mi spingono forte
Di notte le casse diventano massi
Quando sarò di nuovo laggiù
Questo ragazzo che tornerà al sud
E ti racconterò di più

Clementino,"Da quanto tempo ci conosciamo, sembra ieri
Pistole ad acqua, cannoni come bersaglieri
Progettando delle note al profumo di jazz
Nelle bustine come bombole, fuga di gas
Appartati sempre nelle peggio situazioni
Senza capì nient, senza effett ca patoni
Le luci dei lampioni, panchine nei rioni
E chi compatte ancora adesso signore e signori
Dai ruderi del sud italia e gare di freestyle
Fin sopra al nord magica iena segna per noi
Dicevano I ragazzi dei palazzi negli studi 
Di tatuaggi dentro I club di quartieri quelli marci
Ma sto tempo adesso mi cancella le ferite
Se penso a me stesso mi stresso e dentro è dinamite
E voi non mi capite
E fumo criptonite, dal basso risalire

Una vita a fare il rap il rap a salvarmi la vita
Come spray senza fet’ chep’ senza dita
A sto giro fratellino si punta più in alto
Come reti di sto bomber di punta e di tacco
Il riscatto di questa città che sta affondando
Distratto dalla società che sta affogando
Qualche amico è rimasto e qualcuno è partito

Ma quanto male farmi, io cerco di scordarti
Cerco di disprezzarti, ma metto via le armi
Artigli già rientrati, i denti non sporgenti
Quanti finti interventi, quanti ripensamenti
Le notti più crudeli, i tempi sono quelli
Ma quanti sbandamenti, questi respiri freddi
E adesso che ti inventi, tutte le uscite insieme
E molti sti lamenti, questi destini incerti
Come mi trovi cambiato?, ora dimmi in fretta
Mi gira strana sta vita, bastarda chi diserta
Lo fa per cambiare il mondo, e pure se fallisce
Magari ha perso qualcosa, e più non ci riesce
Apro gli occhi per vedere il mondo diverso da ieri
Un viaggio introspettivo I miei pensieri 
Misteri
Mina vagante sono per gli amici sinceri
Una promessa fatta per sempre come mery

Quelle volte che sei lontana, la tua voce nell'anima
La mia mano in auto, la marcia ingrana
Tra le mie canzoni e la mariua
Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
Come quelle volte che sei lontana, la tua voce nell'anima
Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
La mia mano in auto, la marcia ingrana
Tra le mie canzoni e la mariua

Il resto tutto bene, cara amica ti scrivo
Tu sei laggiù, adesso il mondo c'è crollato addosso
Spostami il palinsesto, danze tribali e penso
Tutti I tuoi lati nascosti sotto il cappotto rosso
Cammino a più non posso
Voglio cercare le orme bagnate dei tuoi passi
Vorrei averti tutta adesso
Nuda sul letto, due cannette e pure solo un sorso
Di quello che ci manda fuori il tempo di un morso
Eppure in questo mestiere ci si ritrova soli
Tra le corriere, macchine, ti sposti, navi e voli
Il mio respiro grande, di tutta la giornata
La mia rivincita sei tu, nuova puntata

Quelle volte che sei lontana, la tua voce nell'anima
La mia mano in auto, la marcia ingrana
Tra le mie canzoni e la mariua
Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
Come quelle volte che sei lontana, la tua voce nell'anima
Chissà se proprio adesso, tu mi starai ascoltando
Che sei a mille miglia da dove io sto cantando
La mia mano in auto, la marcia ingrana
Tra le mie canzoni e la mariua

Solo per la strada che porta all'inferno
Vivere in eterno, sì, ma a quale prezzo
Quanto t'incontrai sembrava tutto bello
Ci ritrovammo a pranzo soli come un frutto acerbo

Chiuso nel vischio, il microfono non fa respirare 
Aspetto il cielo che migliori la mia giornata
Attendo il giusto suono per una nuova puntata

Se questa vita ti ha servito pane col veleno

Quando tutto sembra uguale, giochi a carte con il male

And touches with her hand the summer trees
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own

There's a dance pavilion in the rain, all shuttered down
A winding country lane, all russet brown
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely

That spring of ours that started so April-hearted
Seemed made for just a boy and girl
I never dreamed, did you
Any fall would come in view so early, early

Darling, if you care, please, let me know
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so
Let's never have to share another early autumn

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

The coffee cup,
I think about you.
I want you so,
It's like I'm losing my mind.
The morning ends,
I think about you.
I talk to friends,
I think about you.
And do they know?
It's like I'm losing my mind.
All afternoon,
Doing every little chore,
The thought of you stays bright.
Sometimes I stand
In the middle of the floor,
Not going left,
Not going right.
I dim the lights
And think about you,
Spend sleepless nights
To think about you.
You said you loved me,
Or were you just being kind?
Or am I losing my mind?

Cleo Laine,"Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

You could drive a person crazy,
You could drive a person mad.
First you make a person hazy
So a person could be had,
Then you leave a person dangling sadly
Outside your door,
Which could only make a person gladly
Want you even more.
I could understand a person
If it's not a person's bag.
I could understand a person
If he meant as a gag.
But worse 'n that,
A person that
Titillates a person and then leaves her flat
Is crazy,
He's a troubled person,
He's a truly crazy person himself.

When a person's personality is personable,
He should not sit like a lump.
It's harder than a matador coercin' a bull
To try to get you off of your rump.
So single and attentive and attractive a man
Is everything a person could wish,
But turning off a person is the act of a man
Who likes to pull the hooks out of fish.

Knock-knock! Is anybody there?
Knock-knock! It really isn't fair.
Knock-knock! I'm workin' all my charms.
Knock-knock! A zombie's in my arms.
All that sweet affection!
What is wrong?
Where's the loose connection?
How long, O Lord, how long?
Bobby-baby-Bobby-bubbi-Bobby,

You could drive a person buggy,
You could blow a person's cool.
Like you make a person feel all huggy
While you make her feel a fool.
When a person says that you upset her,
That's when you're good.
You impersonate a person better
Than a zombie should.
I could understand a person
If he wasn't good in bed.
I could understand a person
If he actually was dead.
Exclusive you!
Elusive you!
Will any person ever get the juice of you?
You're crazy,
You're a lovely person,
You're a moving,
Deeply maladjusted,
Never to be trusted,
Crazy person yourself.",You Could Drive a Person Crazy

Cleo Laine,"They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise

I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant

Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young

Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

When I never said what was on my mind.
How was I to know you'd go so soon?
Your God would come to take you home
Leaving me stumbling over
Stupid lines on a shabby page.
Daddy, sometimes I'm filled with rage.
I lost the only thing that was really mine.
So daddy, can you hear me?
Oh daddy, do I still make you laugh?
And I know just what you'd say-
Is this really the time and place
To say all of those things that we never said?
There've been too many times
When my head was filled with stupid pride.
I hope you're laughing now
That all these words have been set aside.
Oh daddy, can you hear me?
Oh daddy, do I still make you laugh?
And I know just what you'd say-
Is this really the time and place
To say all of those things that we never said?

It seems so long since I saw you,
And yet it seems like yesterday.
There's no need to make amends
For I look on us as friends.

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [*]

And so she takes her summer time
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arm?

And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

Then the sadder world will seem like new... 
The next time I see Mary-Anne...

Mary Anne, there are no words that I could say, 
No way to tell her what it means to me 
To see her face again.....

In the sunlight I'll kiss her, 
Married we will be - my baby and me 
The next time I see Mary Anne... 
The next time I see Mary Anne... 
Mary Anne... ",Poem
Cliff Richard,"How to start? What to say?
I don't remember ever feeling this way.
Can it be true? Does anyone care?
Is it only make-believe or are You really there? 
Is there a chance I've been missing the best?
Could it be life is more than a guess?

I'm afraid to let go, yet I long to see.
If You are real, be real to me,
If You are real, be real to me. 

Okay, supposing I were to come to You?
Not saying I will, just supposing I do?
Would I have to be, just another guy?
Two a penny's not for me, it just won't satisfy.
I'm just confused, by candles and prayers.
I just need to know, if You are there.

Show me the way, for I long to see.
If You are real, be real to me,
If You are real, be real to me.

I'm just confused, by candles and prayers.
I just need to know, if You are there.

Show me the way, for I long to see.
If You are real, be real to me,
If You are real, be real to me.",Questions
Cliff Richard,"What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, I love you","For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her"
Cliff Richard,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow
Cliff Richard,"Girl you'll be a woman soon 
Love you so much can't count all the ways 
I'd die for you girl and all they can say is

Know when I come around what I'm gonna find 
Don't let them make up your mind 
Don't you know

Please come take my hand 
Girl you'll be a woman soon 
Soon you'll need a man

But what they're sayin', girl just cuts like a knife 
""The boy's no good"" 
Well I finally found what I've been lookin' for 
But if they get the chance they'll end it for sure 
Sure they would

That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will be my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess, within the veil
A life of joy and peace
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun",Amazing Grace
Cliff Richard,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

Together, give together.
One fine day,
A time beyond our time.
Come that day we'll make
It if we're strong,
So help it along, help it along,
Help it along.

Please don't laugh at me
When I tell you
I believe in love,
'cause it's still
The only thing that
There is too little of.
And it's a long time coming,
But come I'm sure it will
And just in time
The world will rhyme on
The far side of a hill.

On some fine......

Cliff Richard,"Butterflies danced on invisible strings  Showing wings they borrowed from a rainbow  And a blackbird on high sang a praise to the sky  While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain  Furry backed bees with a tireless drone  Never moan, they're happy to be working  And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen  While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain  Chorus:  Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul, before there's nothing left to fly at all  Take to the sky, higher than high, before the silvery rain begins to fall  Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn  Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song  There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew  Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain",Silvery Rain

We'll be free

Cliff Richard,"When did you becomethe topic of conversation,
When did you become this country's
Popular myth
Seems that overnight you caught
Everybody's attention
Everybody sings about you and your name
Bounces off their lips

When did you become superstar of
This generation
And when did you become commercial property
Everybody's got their own sweet lord,
Hear them sing
Looking here, looking there but they just don't
Seem sweet

Were you a guru, a godly man,
Or where you a genius, the best in the land

I read in the paper that you were back in fashion
Amongst the famous men you were high on the list
Don't they realise that fashion's a passing fancy

The truth is yesterday, today, forever
You'll be staying
Yesterday, today, forever never wavering
You stated who you were and that will
Never change
Like it or not you'll always be the same
Son of god

Like it or not, yesterday, today, forever (x6)
Yesterday, today, forever, like it or not
","Yesterday, Today, Forever"
Cliff Richard,"My heart has no desire to
Stay where doubts arise
And fears dismay.
Though we must dwell
Where these are bound
I must go on to higher ground.

I want to scale the
Utmost hight and catch
A gleam of glory bright.
For faith has caught
The joyful sound,
The song of life on higher ground.

Lord, lift me up
And let me stand my feet
On heaven's stable land.
Oh, greater plane
That I have found.
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground.

I'm treading on the
Upward way, new hights
I'm gaining every day,
Still praying as I'm homeward bound:
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground.

Cliff Richard,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide",Make It Easy On Yourself/the Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Any More

To exercise my delight,I went out that night and shook the town the way I knew

So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now

Six months later I'm a cool operator,and I know my way around

But that don't bother me now 'cause I've got a friend who's gotta friend who
Really knows how
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now

Still hanging on,still hanging on,hang on

I thought I'd play him along,give him a song,to keep the doom dust away from
My door
But I didn't do what he wanted me to,but it didn't seem to matter somehow

So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now

Still hanging on,still hanging on,hang on

Six months later I'm a part time waiter,but that didn't last long
I stretched and squeezed at words I'd never heard to write a song
And when it finally came,it sounded the same as a tune I'd heard before

Was talk behind my back

Nothing I could say or do
Would get to you

And fought the kid who tried to take her away

Running away,you don't know,you don't care

With no thought for the rest of the day

Cliff Richard,"Got every reason to feel like I do
From the top of my head to the bottom of my shoes
'Cause last night my baby took the weight off my mind
Told me everything was gonna be fine
She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way
She could have resisted my efforts to pry
But she knows how I feel and she's not exactly shy
Though right now I'm lonely I know it won't be long
I can hear the train comin' bringin' lovin' along
She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way
Oh I used to be so lost and confused
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried
But still I didn't rest I had to know
What was behind it all I'd come so far
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote
I couldn't resist it being beside her
Could have held that moment forever in my heart
The moment I saw her was the moment I knew
That her love is my life and her light's shining through
She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way
Oh I used to be so lost and confused
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried
But still I didn't rest I had to know
What was behind it all I'd come so far
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote",Give Me Love Your Way
Cliff Richard,"There's nobody here
There's nobody home
There's no one I can turn to
Or call my own

But this is what I've wanted
For a long long while
So I lay back, take it easy
And try a smile

So strange, how we go
Our love never shown
Except, when we are parted
Or oh, so alone

When we're together
We miss love by a mile
So I lay back take it easy
And try a smile

Can this really be for the best
I got an achin' in my heart
I wanna tell you that I love you

I know we had to close the door
Only to find that there were more
I wanna tell you that I love you
Yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do

There's nobody here
There's nobody home
There's no one I can turn to
Or call my own

But this is what I've wanted
For a long long while
So I lay back, take it easy
And try a smile

Can this really be for the best
I got an achin' in my heart
I wanna tell you that I love you

I know we had to close the door
Only to find that there were more
I wanna tell you that I love you
Yes, I do, yes, I do, yes, I do

Cliff Richard,"Life was filled with guns and war
And everyone got trampled on the floor
I wish we'd all been ready
Children died the day grew cold

A piece of bread could buy a bag of gold
I wish we'd all been ready
There's no time to change your mind
The son has come and you've been left behind

A man and wife sleep in bed she hears a noise
And turns her head he's gone
I wish we'd all been ready
Two men walking up a hill one disappears and

One's left standing still
I wish we'd all been ready
There's no time to change your mind
The son has come and you've been left behind

Life was filled with guns and war

Cliff Richard,"What kind of love is this that leaves me feeling cold
You look right through me what see nobody knows
You're in a world all by yourself - needing no one else
Feeling so secure

You're on the road to nowhere, left your past behind
What's to become of me, should feelings be denied
Another time another place, would i be the same old face
For you to have around

There's no way in, there's no way out i'm caught in the middle
Why must you leave my heart in doubt
We have a one way love that flows from me to you
There's nothing more for me to lose

We're through with talking now we know that it's the end
We've played our foolish games amd it's useless to pretend
It seems like only yesterday, that love had come to stay
How could we be so blind

There's no way in, there's no way out i'm caught in the middle
Why must you leave my heart in doubt
We have a one way love that flows from me to you
There's nothing more for me to lose

I don't know where your heart is or what's inside your head
If this is love you said it, if this is love forget it
If this is love then count me out",Count Me Out
Cliff Richard,"Spent all of his life in love with money
Never found love he never got lucky no
One hundred are the times he tried
And every time he lost a part of him died

Love can be found the people would tell
So he threw his heart
In the wishing well
Young Julie the girl from the city

With eyes full of pain and a heart
Full of pity yeah and she said...
No use cryin' 'bout your living dying
You're gotta make your peace

And and let your livin' just ease along
Let your livin' just ease along
You've got to give up livin' your life like a demon
Find your heart and the why, and the where,

And the reason
Oh - oh - oh
She took him up the mountain side
Where the air was clear and the water was wine

She loved him when the night was still
And the stars danced on the window sill
And over and over again
The lovers looked out from the mountain rim

There was no need to reach for the stars
You could catsh them all night and keep them in jars
And she told him...
No use cryin' 'bout your living dying

You're gotta make your peace
And and let your livin' just ease along
Let your livin' just ease along
You've got to give up livin' your life like a demon

Find your heart and the why, and the where,
And the reason
Ease along you've got to ease along
Spent all his life in love with money-ease along

Never found love never got lucky-ease along
With eyes full of pain and her heart full of pity-
Ease along

Cliff Richard,"I took your name you took my number
Look me up if you're in my town
You made a friend be sure of that
Let me know if you're free come down
You're making plans-things you'll do
Said I'll be someone I'm telling you

I'm gonna leave this town play me some rock'n'roll
I'm gonna find myself I'm gonna free my soul

We took a walk out in the grey
You didn't speak but had much to say
Don't talk too loud walls have ears
Criticise and you'll disappear
A souvenir from where you've gone
A pair of jeans or some chewing gum

I'm gonna leave this town play me some rock'n'roll
I'm gonna find myself I'm gonna free my soul
They built the wall until they had something to hide
To keep me out or is it to keep you inside

I'm gonna free me...",Free My Soul
Cliff Richard,"Searching for a green light
Looking for it all night
Using all my keen sight

From just this side of midnight
'Til dawn breaks into daylight

Well I've heard this story before
But that doesn't stop me searching
It's been so long since you gave me a sign

Cliff Richard,"Two sad faces tell the story
Heard so many times before
He is leaving she is staying
Neither of them know what for

There's no laughter there's no crying
There is love there's no denying
Differences led to goodbye and please remember me
And she said-I've got phone and a mail box

A front door that's unlocked
A faith in the feelings there'll be someone you forgot
True I'm gonna miss you, true I'm gonna need you
You know I'm not the one to worry

Oh but I heard the weather report
It says it's gonna be cold and lonely
So honey won't you please remember me
I'm the one that loves you

Please remember me
I'm the one that cares
Please remember me
I'll be thinking of you

And should you ever decide you want to come home
I'll be there
This is like that old love story
Those who've lost love know it's true

She's sitting by a window waiting
He's sitting somewhere wonderin' what to do
They know they should be together
They know they should reconcile

He knew he would regret her saying please remember me
She said-you've got a home and a warm bed
A roof over your head
A place in my heart for someone I'll never forget

Bringing down every one that you meet
Say who's it gonna be this time
Gonna use the same old line

Gone are the days of running free

Cliff Richard,"From here to eternity where time cannot reach
What is the lesson that life has to teach
Don't try to find it for the answer will come
In the message of love on the wings on the sun

A heart that is searching will find a new place
The wind is warm on the innocent face
A fledgling of love who has only just begun
To waken from dreams while she is still young

While she's young her heart is free
You gotta treat her tenderly
While she's young she's looking for someone who cares
Trust and understanding while she is still young

This fledgling of love has only just begun
Now to understand the questions of her mind
'Cause now she is searching for someone who is kind
While she's young her heart is free

You gotta treat her tenderly
While she's young she's looking for someone who cares",While She's Young

Cliff Richard,"All day I'm walking in a dream
I think about you constantly
Just like an ever flowing stream
Your memory haunts me constantly
Shadows fall and I try to drive you from my mind
So you're no longer near to me
But my heart sees you there with me
Every sunset you share with me
The rain that patterns throu the tree reminds
Me of you constantly
Your name is whispered by the breeze and love birds
Bring your song to me
Just as same as each star keeps burning
In the sky your flame will stay a flame in me
A flame that burns so bright
Not only throu the night
But constantly
Thro we may be_apart
You're constantly deep in my heart

I would take my guitar in the early early mornin'
And go down to the fields and play-ay-ay

Buys the pride I'd rather sell

And leave it all behind
Looking windward for my compass
I take each day as it arrives

Not getting on luv, not putting it down

We both felt we needed

No psychic fusion, just a steady date
No grand illusions of the romantic fates

Don't know why we conceded

'Cos we were high, now we're low
Tell me why did we go
Falling in luv, falling in luv

Under pressure from family and friends
They seem to treasure a storybook end
One look at them I realize luv is real overrated

Too many hours in the working day
Dead on my feet but I need the cash
Roll on Saturday make it fast

You step outside
To find the world is changing
Under your feet
Somewhere in the past
Is the world you knew
Soon you'll find that freedom
Is not so sweet
I can't imagine why you'd throw it all away
After everything i've said to you today
When you turn around to find there's
No one then you finally realize what you've done

In the night when there's no one there at all
In the night do you hear somebody call
You see someone and you tell yourself you're wrong
You hear a voice and you know it must belong
To the night just a shadow on the wall
And there's no one there at all

I gave you everything
Everything i had endlessly
Believing your love was true
And you will never know just how it hurt
To find that you were turning to someone new
I know that we can't ever change
What has been said but how can i
Believe our love is really dead
When you turn around to find there's no one
Then you finally realize what you've done

My arms were so lonely, lonesome and blue
Alone in my sorrow I heard a voice cry,
A voice in the wilderness
A voice from the sky.

Have faith in your darling
The voice seemed to say
Be true to her memory
She'll come back one day.
And though there was no one
Nobody to see,
The voice in the wilderness brought comfort to me 

We had a quarrel,
I was unkind
Why did you leave me
Love made me blind

My darling forgive me
I am for your touch
Have pity come back now

Your condescending ways
And all to frequent nights alone

To be a light to you is what I intend to do
To show the way you know you ought to go

So take the hand that I offer to you
To see the truth that you will be no longer

Do you ever take the time to ask me
If I want to be more involved in your life
It's so sad
You don't realize
What I can do for you
It's so sad

You won't spend more time alone with me
When you could be discovering my love
Can't you see just how much you're hurting me
When you say one thing and then do another
I forgive you
But still you take me for granted
It's so sad

You don't realize
What I can do for you
It's so sad

You won't spend more time alone with me
When you could be discovering my love
You know there are times
When nothing else takes my place
And those times
Mean more to you than anything else
But still you need more of me
And I need more of you, give me more of you

Cliff Richard,"Whatever happened
To the teenage romance
Is it hidden in a tacky magazine
Everybody's talking
Saying trash is neat
You think it's good fun
But it's never that free
Who is the man of the moment
Does his image stand ten feet tall
Or is he just a cardboard hero
Staring down at you from your wall

You can dream but you can't touch
You can dream but not too much
You can dream but you can't touch
You can dream but not too much

Friday night
Out on the town
It's a special date
First time around
You read all about the story book romance
He stands there waiting
And you want to hold his hand
Saturday
You're broken down
Your heart is lying somewhere
Is it lost or found

You can dream but you can't touch
You can dream but not too much
You can dream but you can't touch
If this is love it's not enough

You can dream but you can't touch
You can dream but not too much
You can dream but you can't touch
You want a love that costs too much
You can dream but you can't touch
If this is love it's not enough
You can dream of tender touch
Don't let your heart be lost to love

Cliff Richard,"O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie,
Above the deep and dreamless sleep,
The silent stars go by.
Yet in the dark streets shineth,
The everlasting light,
The hopes and fears of all the years,
Are met in thee tonight. 
How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given.
So God imparts to human hearts,
The blessings of His heaven.
We hear the Christmas angels.
The great glad tidings tell,
O come to us, abide with us,
The Lord Emmanuel. 
No ear may hear His coming.
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.",Little Town

From all of the lies that used to be me

I've been through the maze and it lead to your door
And the only way out is the only way in and it's you

Now every way's leading to you

Let me do all the things I've been missing so long

Cliff Richard,"When I was young my father said
'Son I have something to say'
And what he told me I'll never forget
Until my dying days

[Chorus:]
He said son you are a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son you'll be a bachelor boy
Until your dying days

When I was 16 I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as can be
But I remembered just in time
What my daddy said to me

[Chorus]

As time goes by I probably will
Meet a girl and fall in love
Then I'll get married have a wife and a child
And they'll be my turtle doves

But until then I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay
Happy to be a bachelor boy
Until my dying days",Bachelor Boy
Cliff Richard,"Imaging a still summer's day. 
When nothing is moving. 
Least Of All Me. 
I lay on my back in the hay. 
The warm sun was soothing. 
It made me feel good. 
The day I met Marie. 

The Sound of her whisper hello. 
Came tiptoing softly into my head. 
I opened my eyes kinda slow. 
And there she was smiling. 
It made me feel good. 
The day I met Marie. 

With the laughing eyes. 
She'd toss her hair and tantalize. 
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze. 

I remember her kiss
So soft on my brow
And the way that she said
Baby go to sleep now
Baby go to sleep now

I woke with the chill in the air
The warm sun no longer hung in the sky
I reached out but she was not there
She'd gone where she came from
But I still feel good
To think I've known Marie
With the laughing eyes
She'd toss her hair and tantalize
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze",The Day I Met Marie

We've just met
Just how lucky can one boy get
There's a light in your eye
I know it's love and I know that I could be happy
With a girl like you

Tell your mom tell your pa
And tell your favourite old wishing star
We're in love, just by chance
I asked you would like to dance
Fancy dancing with a girl like you
Funny how love can come to a lonely heart
I'm a boy, you're a girl I guess that's a pretty start
Here I am, there you are
Together baby we should go far
A girl like you, a boy like me
Two hearts together like they ought to be
Can't believe

He's sitting all alone
His blankets are made out of cardboard
And his pillows are made out of stone

It never tells a lie
Every face tells a story
It never tells a lie

See the man walking on the water
See the light in his eyes
He came into the world with a message to tell
He came into the world to die

It never tells a lie

You're always telling me lies

They love to walk holding the other one's hand
They always understand

Some people cry
Some people know why

Some people, they use one another so aimlessly
Not like lovers do
Well, I'm not like that at all

Some people they long for each other
They love to talk holding the other one's hand
They always understand

Some people cry
Some people know why

With a word unspoken with a voice unheard
When a word is broken by a tender word
When a heart is moved, when a heart is thrown
The silence tells you, you're not alone

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Holding the other one
Holding each other

Cliff Richard,"All I do is dream of you the whole night thru
With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're every thing, 
You're every song I ever sing

And were there more than twenty four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir,
And folks dressed like Eskimos.
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe,
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow,
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa's on his way,
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh,
And every mother's child is gonna spy,
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase,
To kids from one to ninety two.
Although's it's been said many times many ways,
Merry Christmas to you.

When i heard my child in prayer.
And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair.

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
All the streets were dark and bare.
In our town no scarlet ribbons,
Not one ribbon for her hair.

through the night my heart was aching,
Just before the dawn was breaking.
I peeked in and on her bed,
In gay profusion lying there,
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.

If i live to be a hundred,
I will never know from where.
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.

We've got their stockings by the fire.
A flame lights up the room and hand in hand,
We watch it start to snow.

And we drink last hot coffee.
Your head's upon my shoulder,
And they just played Misletoe and Wine on the radio.

Together with the ones we love
The ones we care for
We should be together for christmas
And be there with the ones we love
And not be far away
That's why they invented planes
So we could fly away
To the ones we love
And be there for this day

We should be together for cristmas
It isn't right to be apart
We could be here wild in our wishes
With all the love that's in my heart
I want you to be here
That's why they invented trains
So you could ride away
To the one you love
And be here for this day
We should be together

And it never matters where
Anyplace... we don't care
Long as we both are there

That's why they invented stars

I got no need for cars
Just a wish and I could be there
Where you are

Just like the ones I used to know.

May your days be merry and bright,
And may all your Christmas's be white.

Her nails are perfectly filed
Her lips painted deep jungle red
Her best color is black
And the clothes on her back
Show she's a woman with style
She wears satin and lace with impeccable taste
She'll tell you it runs in her blood
In a cloud of perfume she walks into the room
And it comes to a stop when she does
She's a heart user
No time for losers
She'll use you up and throw your love away

And as he straightens his tie
Some beauty catches his eye
Brings out the best in the man
And her fresh young face makes his cold heart race
She's wearing that deadly perfume

And he thinks she's playing his game
But anybody can tell they're just into themselves

There's something I've been trying to tell you
No matter where you are
From cradle to shining star
You're someone to look up to

Brother to brother worlds apart
One day I'll promise I'll be with you
Always I'll love you
Now just a memory
A lifetime of rivalry
I couldn't have a better friend than you

I used to criticize the way you used to be
The child that had the look that dreams are made of
A window to the past looks onto everything I see
The fire went out the flame just dies
I couldn't have a better friend than you

Brother to brother, when we meet again
There'll be no differences between us
Free from the darkest night, free till we see the light
Burning ever after

Time is a healer, calming our fears
A thousand questions left unanswered
Oh I believe in you
Brother of mine

Have you ever had somebody you were close to
Become a memory that's larger than life
Have you ever felt there's beauty in distortion
If faiths a crime give me a clue
And if it is then brother it's still you

Now I can see that you're feeling sad
Some one's chosen your heart to steal
Hey, my friend, you can take my hand
And I'll show your heart a power that's real

It will never let you down
It will always open any door
So pick the pieces off the ground
Because you may have lost the battle but we'll win this war

When it all comes down to the push and shove
We can make it through, we can rise above
'Cause you know that we've got the power of
Healin' love, talkin' 'bout healin' love

So wipe away your tears, you can put away your gun
And get ready to receive the strongest medicine

Cliff Richard,"I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came here to you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she'd cast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines of your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned
I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman

Be careful of the neighborhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

Still I remember
How did I ever let my heart believe
In one who never gave enough to me
And so many years gone
With love that was so wrong
I can't forget the way it used to be
And how you changed the taste of love for me
You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one moment
I'll always have in my mind
No-one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you
And we'll have no ending
If we can hold on
And I think I've come this far because of you
Could be no other love but yours will do
You were my one more chance

You were the one moment
I'll always have in my mind
No-one will ever touch me more

On which he feeds and yet tears him apart
And in this child so great that complication
Will surely destroy the strongest heart

And as you're drawn to cross his reckless line
And as I watch you peer into his darkness
I pray you'll never search, I pray you'll never search for mine
