Mis-Teeq,"Hey Mr. wonderful
You think your so beautiful
I bet you nine out of ten would fall
I ain't the one to be the fool

2 days to work you out
At home while you were out
Your last name came about when my girl's sister's best friend
Talking 'bout how you came round

[Chorus]
How does it feel
When your sittin alone
There's no-one else at home
It's my time for thrills
Now it's time you listen to my answer phone
Ain't no big deal
Your just one of a million guys
Lets keep it real
Your dirty laundry's out to dry

So Mr. know-it-all
Tell me how many points you scored
While you're clocking the girl next door
I know what you've been doing

To dinner bought her gifts
For afters you were it
I called work they said you were sick
A guy like you will never hit this

[Chorus: x2]

If you want to find someone you could call mine
A lady who's right
Who'll be there for life
So how will you feel if the truth is revealed
If you stayed the same you'll be played at your own game

[Chorus: x4]",How Does It Feel
Mis-Teeq,"You, yo, Mis-Teeq
Here we go with the one Blacksmith
Aye, oh and away we go
You're gonna get your roll on
Here we go again all, all, all night long
Enter, check, check

It's been a long week
And we've been working our booties off
Sometimes it all gets to you
And it's just too much

Gonna hook us up a potion
Guaranteed to bring some fun
Mix good friends, get some music
Head out to the club and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
Let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

So here we go another another night
Out on the town, we gettin' down
Havin' fun, stayin' young
The whole entourage has arrived

Here on the scene you know what I mean
When I say this world is mine
Just sit back and ride
So turn your speakers up and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
Let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

Roll on, roll, roll on
Roll on, roll on
So grab your boo and get your roll on
Roll on, roll, roll on
Roll on, roll on
So turn your speakers up

Let's take it to the flow
What are you waitin' for
The party's jumpin' now
We're gonna show you how

We like it, we like it
We really, really like it
So turn your speakers up  and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
Let me hear my ladies say
So turn you speakers up

Yo, yo, so here we go again with Mis-Teeq's flow
What are you waiting for, the crowd say, ""Bo""
Feel the vibe within your mind, within your soul
Move your body, body ready to roll

And I said Monday to Friday the work takes its toll
Here comes the weekend 'cause we make mad dough
Another dollar, let me holler, let me grow
'Cause in life what you reap's what you sow and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
Let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
Let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

Roll on, roll, roll on
So roll on, roll on
So grab your boo and get your roll on
Roll on, roll, roll on
Roll on, roll on

All I need to know (need to know that the world)
That the world is nuts snap my fingers (fingers) and
Everything is fine
That's all (that's all)
Firing it up and away we go

Sitting looking in the mirror like Alice
Through the looking glass
Life's a never ending journey be careful not to go too fast
Sometimes I can't help myself from falling in too deep
I know it may be hard to tell your love is calling me
Oh-ah, all I want to be, oh-ah
And away we go
Oh-ah, all I want is (oh-ah)
Gonna get on the mic, gonna make you whine

Floating on a river of dreams on a magic carpet ride
Take control of my destiny I know it's just a matter of time
That I will find that midas touch
And everything will turn to gold
It would mean nothing without you here to hold

I will lay my hair down for you a thousand times to show you
That when you reach me at the top
I'm gonna give you all I got
And wherever we go our hearts will follow

It's a UK thing, stuff that we bring
No one to burn, let the journey begin
We're the Mis-teeq, we're in chorus we sing
Quick off the mark, ring a ding ding ding
In a mix with a bag of tricks
Feel the vibe with the one sun-ship
Move to the beat it's about music
Roll through these tracks with fresh tactics

Mis-Teeq,"[Chorus: x 2]
What I want is for you to be with me
Lovin' you everyday will be easy
What I no is that we will never be	
But that doesn't stop me from wanting the dream of reality

I saw you this mornin' as I left my house on the way to work
You were wearing the same old attire the pinstripe suit and shirt
If only you knew the things we could do 
As we crossed round the corner at the photo booth
Don't think I can't see your lusting for me
'cause I know your down with opp

[Chorus: x 2]

Well I'm over here, you're over there
Tempting looks are all we have to share
But you can't take a bite of the apple inside
My bodies pulsating at the thought of you there
All I want to do is hold you tight
Want to know how you feel inside
But I'm with another man day and night
And your girl sits on the next desk 2 mine

[Chorus: x 2]

Don't let me show you my weakness
I'm falling deeper can't keep this
Burning desire that's deep in my soul
Now that your feeling you just can't control
Baby see my frustration
Unbearable situation
Your with her and I'm with him
So we can't let our love begin

Mis-Teeq,"Wake up early wipe the sleep from my eyes
Glance across the room its 8:45
Can't forget to hang the washing out to dry
Pick out my clothes so I can hit 'em with my style
Wash up my face and brighten up my smile
Fix up my hair and add some sheen so I can shine
Look at my watch it's saying 10:45
Grab me some breakfast, time to jump in my ride

My family is calling
I've been on the move since morning
Trying to fit it all in
Wish I could add some more hours to the day

[Chorus]
Check my mum and make sure she's OK
All in one day
Cook and clean cause nothing seems to change
It's everyday
Get my nails done, take a trip to Spain
Back the same day
Text my friends and drink some chilled Ros√©
All in one day
On the move we keep on going no time to lose
And we're just trying to keep the day running smooth
Who says that we can't have our cake and eat it too

Benn to the gym and now I'm feeling energized
I had to exercise and tone up my thighs
But I got to pay m bills they're on the red line
Gotta rush myself to the meter now before I get a fine

Went to my mum and now she's cooking the dinner
I got to wait for the chicken to simmer
Rice and peas with some sweet plantine
Go grab your coat
Let's go shopping in Spain

As we listen to the man sing Andala
We roll down the street street to the bay
Buy what we can buy and head back to the plane
Cause we've only got one day to

[Chorus]

All my girls shout
Let me see my sisters who go all out
Freshly dipped in caramel tans with the back out
When we do it right you know it's gonna last all night
When we get together know it's gonna be all high
And we don't need no fellas to spoil out vibe
And we goin' keep it rocking till the morning light
And we goin' keep it popping till the
Damn I forgot to call my man

Baby I'm sorry I'm late
Gonna make it up to you

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears

Misery Index,"Thrust into this competition naked and undone
Back to back
Yet divided on our own
Fear breeding fear
Exploding pressures on
We're locked away in self-made chains
Run out through the windows and into the streets
Terror abounds as each man lives in fear
Dread consumes their day
The public is passive
Inactive
And lame
Lock up the doors and let out the wolves
A fratricidal race
Given the chance you'd sit down to eat
Yet consciousness is sacrificed
This alter is never short on heads
Stare in his eyes
Your brother, this man
Yet your fear will breed resentment
Why can't you say a word?

They're standing on the margins - nullified
Outside the world keeps turning under the sun
While inside the soul is boiling over
This hate for the other is hate for yourself
The cancer condition
The dead-end ambition
You'll eat yourself alive
Submit to the anger
The coming of vengeance
The cult of uncaring
The chaos of living
And face this world alone
The hooks in your mouth now you'll swallow the bait
Distorting your vision
You'll drink from their poison

You take from the worst and give up the best
But never forget you're a human being...you breathe

To kill what's already dead?
The silence kept drowning my voice
When I had so much more to say
I pretend I'm asleep again
Because I don't want you to know
Can I escape from myself
And my fear to meet your eye?
I can smell you inside
It's all over me by now
Though I'm as close as can be
I have never felt so alone
We fuck 'cause we have to
If we don't, there's something wrong
Pushing each other downhill
At least we're partners in this crime

Show me what I can't see
Make me understand
Help me to understand
Why don't you prove me wrong?
Show me what I can't see
Help me
Some things come and go
And they sure went fast this time
Strong hands, big promises
Gave me nothing to believe at all
Turned me into a timebomb
Ready to explode in everyones' face
Who would hear my confession?
We don't listen anymore
No one can say we did not
Carry the missing well
Forever in debt to you for not
Being what you wished of me
Things got so difficult when I knew
That I could never win
Thought I was out of my mind
To even think the way I did
Why don't you prove me wrong?

The birth of the eleventh plague

Peered in from space
Sincere the hope, their wise believed
They could teach our race

But yet on Mars, a darker side
Like all things that God made
Their tribe of war would heed them not
Earth they must invade

See the fire in the skies
See them devastate the land
Mars attacks
The warlord chief commands

See the humans fight and die
See our planet laid to waste
Mars attacks
Monsters invade the earth from space

It was then in our darkest hour
When everything seemed lost
The hearts of men would not concede
No matter what the cost

They forged a sword of sound and steel
Upon the Martian doors
The voice of war would thunder there
Mars would be no more

See the Martian cities fall
See the death of the warrior tribe
Mars attacks
Now their planet won't survive

See their world turn into ash
See the terror on their face
Mars explodes
Cast out as rubble into space

Monsters invade the earth from space

I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
When my monster, from its slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash
And it's a graveyard smash
He did the Mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom, where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash, and it's a graveyard smash
He did the Mash, they caught on in a flash
He did the Mash, they did the Monster Mash

Well, the zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included the Wolfman
Dracula, and his son

(He did the mash)
The scene was rocking, all were digging the sound
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The Coffin Bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, The Crypt Keeper Five

They did the Mash, they did the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash, and it's a graveyard smash
He did the Mash, they caught on in a flash
He did the Mash, they played the Monster Mash

Now everything is cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this Mash was meant, too
When you get to my door, tell them Only sent you

Mash, then you can Monster Mash

Misha Mengelberg,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Misha Mengelberg,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You
Misha Mengelberg,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Misha Mengelberg,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Misha Mengelberg,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Big storm commin' soon
Passed out in my hammock
God, I slept till way past noon
Stood up and tried to focus
I hoped I wouldn't have to move far
Sure could use a bloody mary
So I stumbled over to Loui's back yard

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes it's quite insane
Think I hurt my brain
But it cleans me out, then I can go on

There's somthing 'bout this Sunday
It's the most peculiar gray
Strollin' down the avenue that's known as A1A
Feelin tired, then I got inspired
I knew it wouldn't last long
So all alone I walked back home
Sat on the beach and there I made up this song

[Chorus]

Well the wind is blowin' harder now
Fifty knots or there abouts
There's white caps on the ocean
And I'm watchin' for water spouts
It's time to close the shutters
It's time to go inside
In a week I'll be in gay par-ey
Hell that's a mighty long airplane ride

Misplaced Comedy Group,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die",Martha's American Pie
Miss Angie,"I've never seen You
Never touched You
Never, never, no
But I believe in Your Son [Repeat: x 2]

You, You make me free
Yeah You do
Yeah You do [Repeat: x 2]

Miss Kittin,"My head of metal is digging my own hole
I don't like it like that who likes to fall
Let's take a hammer and destroy everything around
Once the rage out still things aren't the way we want

The pressure always of never being good enough
Fff off I am running on my metal horse
A knight in the night there's only one thing I wanna do

Dancing in the dark when no one is talking to you

Sweat it out and get lost into the sound

I stole him from my best friend

And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,

But nobody can catch us.

Forever remember this

Wish and dream for everything
Be by my side this was supposed to last forever, last forever
Yous wish and dream not only for what you are missing,

In return all is taken away

Have been cleansed from my thoughts.
Floating branches are the only things
Truly connected to the ground

I'll never close my eyes again
How could I ever forget a place like this?
Somewhere that I can call my own
My eyes will never see where I'm suppose to be.

And keep my image of the sky,

I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,

Why it should be thus all the day long;
While there are others living about us,
Never molested, though in the wrong.

Farther along we'll know more about it,
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.

Sometimes I wonder why I must suffer,
Go in the rain, the cold, and the snow,
When there are many living in comfort,
Giving no heed to all I can do.

Tempted and tried, how often we question
Why we must suffer year after year,
Being accused by those of our loved ones,

E'en though we've walked in God's holy fear.

When death has come and taken our loved ones,
Leaving our home so lone and so drear,
Then do we wonder why others prosper,
Living so wicked year after year.

'Faithful till death' said our loving Master;
Short is our time to labor and wait;
Then will our toiling seem to be nothing,
When we shall pass that beautiful gate.

Soon we will see our dear, loving Master,
Hear the last trumpet sound through the sky;
Then we will meet those gone on before us,
Then we shall know and understand why.",Farther Along

Mississippi John Hurt,"Nearer my God to Thee, nearer to Thee!
E'en tho' it be a cross that raiseth me
Still all my song shall be, nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee.

Tho' like the wanderer, the sun gone down
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone
Yet in my dreams I'd be, nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee.

Or if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky
Sun, moon and stars forgot, upwards I fly
Still all my song shall be, nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee.

Nearer my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee",Nearer My God to Thee
Mississippi John Hurt,"The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all some day

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But not you've left me and love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away",You Are My Sunshine

Don't stand close to the candy man

Mississippi Sheiks,"Was all the summer, and all the fall,
Just trying to find my little all in all
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Was in the spring, one summer day
Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

An' you come here runnin', holdin' up your hand
Can't get me a woman, who can just kill a man
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

It have been days, I didn't know your name
Why should I worry and prayer in vain
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Goin' to the station, down in the yard
Gone get me a freight train, worked some, got hard
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

The lonesome days, they have gone by
Why should you beg me and say goodbye
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world",Sitting on Top of the World

That's how they do it where we from

That's how they do it where they from

I'm so faded, no exaggeration
Backs breakin' like a percolation
Boys to the yard for some hip spankin'
Where you make it drop down like you in the matrix
Can't take it, them chicks been fakin'
Ya'll still sleep, better stay awakened
Hot new dance for the hood to make it
Make the dope move fast, make them think you drinkin'
Head to the floor don't collect that though
You better huddle up cause the beat's so cold
Pop that, pop that, cock and reload
This another hit, I got an ace in the hole
Boys on my back, playa did you peep that?
You got a small stack, playa, you can keep that
I'm a Big Mac make you wanna eat that
Like m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak
Junk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump
Girls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue

Shape shift, nigga I think like a spaceship
False, oh-nah-nah-nah
I am so different than ya'll
So far apart
The way that I balance the bars
I never fall
And if I do I just call
The almighty yellow star, God
Lyrically I'm Optimus Prime
Look how I drive, look at my ride
When I go by, smoke in your eyes
So open your eyes, the joke's on you guys
And you ain't gotta be a mason in the see through
Some of this shit on occasion

The dance you doing is dumb
How they do where you from
Stickin' out your tongue girl

I'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak
Make a new track, make 'em fall on they crack
Give 'em a slap, appetizer and smack
I'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse
Yeah when I rap they be all on my jack
Boys wanna jump on this pussy cat
Got a new idea, let me switch it
Man, I'm so futuristic
Big lips and big, big, big hips
Body be thick like a bisque
I'm different, rippin' shit
Microphone grippin' it
Gettin' these Benjamins
New car, whippin' it
I'm so far ahead of ya'll
Man I'm on top of the stars

On my fucking light

When it rains it pours
I hurt like the cold souls
My style polishes like nails and toes
You know, know

Now you want to sing and dance
You want to shake your stanky ass
Well I'm sorry Sam

With the same old story
You bore me
Lordy have mercy on all these groupies
Sorry cutie
Why you go and shake your bootie?
Cause there's only one Lil' Kim
The triple beam, the misdemean
Nigga queen, whoomp, we Tag Team

Who wanna go around humping everybody
Can I get a hoe? You know what I'm saying? 
So I'ma talk about this one I had a fewa years ago

I had a friend named Cutie Tootie
Tootie turned tricks to get some Gucci
Known as loose bootie
Truly, she was a freak in the evenin'
And if she wasn't teasin', then give me one reason
Why she do dat? Always knew dat
She was hot as da nectar
Hector said he pecked her, disrespected her
Cause he bang bang swang in his dingalang
Broke his back long range
And make the ugly bitch sing

Why you hurtin me?
Tell me why more
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Why you hurtin me?
Tell me why more
Oooh oooh

Cutie Tootie with her sight
And if she humped Ralph
She humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike
Tight, is the way she wore her dresses
Has she learned her lesson
From all the dick testing
Now I'm guessing
She's laying in a casket
In a yellow basket
For a Gucci jacket
Daggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things
Cause he made the ugly bitch sing

[Chorus]

Tootie didn't know the facts of life
Staying up in clinics
Loosy bootie made trife
Feeling, she got the heeby geebies
Quick to give you freebies

Neighbors out the window sure was lookin'

I don't give a cotton pick and
She can do her thing
Cause me and her don't hang

[Chorus]

So you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody
Who's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank
Once again going around humping everybody
Everybody and anybody and anything

A part of the glamor and the glitz
Platinum rings and different things
How easy we forget

For it is Him, the Lord Almighty
Who allows us our success
When you on top above the charts
How easy we forget

Do you think without Him
You would be who you are?
For if He made heaven and earth
He also made you a star

You know there's One higher than us

In God we must trust

Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets

Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin' through the airport, sluggish, walkin' on crutches
Hit a fuckin' [*pregnant chick*] in her [*stomach*] with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out

I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (SHUT UP!)
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse
To give you insults wrote with a pencil (bitch)

 That if you battle me, 
 Then you must realize, 

[Chorus: x2] 
 I'ma smooth chick,

 I'ma shake my ass down to the music. 

 Come on baby lets to the bump, 
 Keep drinking 'til you gets me drunk, 
 Don't front smoke or a pound of funk, 
 Something real quick like uuuh uuuh! 
 Got tens in the back of the jeep, 
 If you got a friend and he all on me, 
 Could he be a fan of me?, 
 Or could he see that I'm Missy? 

[Chorus x2] 

 Eh baby! 
 Why you trippin for? 
 Cause I'm on top and you're down below, 
 You want me and you want my dough,

That I needed to be through' wit you (yea)
Cause you're the reason I can't eat or sleep (yea)
All the girls you runnin' through (yea)
Used to be best friends, down wit' me

You stickin' them chickens ?til I get home
When I'm home, you're wit' me
Kissin' on my ass, tryna be wit' me

Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know
You don't play, games wit' me

Keep yo dick in they jaws, Peter shoulda stayed in his draws 
Now I'm out the door and you can't claim me no more 
The loss is yours 
How you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'
Went to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it 
To think I footed all the bills and now you breakin'?
Stop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in 
You wasted my valuable time there's money to make 
Scared to set foot in another relationship 'cause of the heartache 
Heartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney, no it's Brat, Aaliyah and 
Missy You miss me 'cause we finished
I'll just keep the keys to the twenty inch rim ride with the TVs in it 
You don't need it, beat it, it's mine
Kiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass)
Keep stickin' them chickens 
Send Peter straight to the clinic nigga

See I'ma give you your props tho
You like a bad ass motherfucker
Runnin' two bitches at one time
When I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in

Give a boy French kiss, he wanna marry
See y'all jealous tricks, y'all cannot stand me
Ooh, that's fine and dandy
Hey daddy-daddy
Why these chicken heads, ooh they be so petty
Hey nah nah nah, you best not test me
I keep tellin' you nah you never ready
Nah you never ready

[Chorus:]
Get rowdy
Let me hear y'all loudly
Keep my high niggas 'round me
Let me see y'all work it and work it till y'all can't stand up
Get rowdy

Keep my high niggas 'round me
Let me see yall work it baby, work work it baby what!

[Missy]
In the club, I see niggas
They think I'm super fly, they blow me sugars
So I cut them short like some scissors
They trying to take me home, they give me liquor
You know who I am, I'ma bitch
Do you know what I make, , filthy rich
Do you know what this means, gotta gat
I thought you was a freak, never that
You see me on the road, when I stroll
I float through the toll, like whoa (beep beep)
You just a silly hoe, this I know
You be at every show, for the dough, hear me now (what?)

Or just an imitator
Stealin' our beats like you're the one who made 'em
Timbaland's the teacher and I'm the one who grades 'em
Check the verbatim, F is how we rate 'em
How dare you make 'em, jus like we made 'em
And I wont play 'em, and I won't say 'em
Save this for later, so I can tell you straighter

Givin me the side eye like she want to fight

Can't stand when a DJ fuckin up the song
Know I'm tryin to shake my ass all night long
Cuttin up the same shit all night long
High 'fore I got there, now my shit is blown
Can't stand when it ain't jumpin like I want

From day KRS-One all the way up to ""Nineteen Naughty Three""
To M.O.P., we ""Cold as Ice""
Nigga we rock it from the ""Dre Day"" to the Suge Knight
So fuck Chuck Phillips and Bill O'Reilly
If they try to stop hip-hop, we all gon' rally nigga
Post Biggie and 'Pac I gotta hold down the city
Make a nigga want to 'holla' like Missy, but fuck it
Just let a nigga MC
The best rapper alive, unquestionably
If you rip on your ""EP"" you gonna need an +MD+
So ""You Gots to Chill"" cause I ""Kill at Will""
Like solid water dude; y'all niggas don't get it
""Kill at Will,"" solid water? Ice Cube
Ha ha, that's how hip-hop has evolved

Missy Elliott,"Basically, can't fuck with me

I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental's based on instrumental
Records hey  so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the King
But niggas is decaf I stick 'em for the cream
Check it  just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it
In your Cross Color clothes you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Kross
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and coming for the head piece protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pulling niggas files
I'm sick, insane, crazy, Drivin' Miss Daisy
Out her fuckin' mind now I got mine I'm Swayze

Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

And when I was a lil' stereo (Stereo)
I listened to some champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
Will now I be the number one (Tical hahaha)
Now you listen to the Gargon (Gargon)
And the Gargon summary
And any man dat come test me (Test me)
Me gwanna lick out them brains (It's like that)

Brothers want to hang with the Meth bring the rope
The only way you hang is by the neck nigga poke
Off the set comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga you can bet your bottom dollar hey I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse word to God
It's the Wu comin' through sickin niggaz for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw em it's the Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test realize you're no contest
Son I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four
Nine three eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'

What, basically that, Meth-Tical, ninety-four style
Word up we be hazardous
Northern spicy brown mustard hoes
We have to stick you

Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel in some staircase piss

I'll fuckin', cut your eyelids off
And feed you nuthin' but sleepin' pills

You motherfuckers
(So) So fuck the hoe
Fuck the hoe

No you do not scare me, is you drinkin' Bloody Mary?
But shit, you betta hurry, before I have to bury
My attitude is bitchy, 'cause my period is heavy

My nigga was the shit, but then that stupid nigga left me
And now I'm lovin' Larry, but Larry go with Terri
And Terri is a freak, but it's his baby she will carry
The life he live's a fairy, cartoon like ""Tom and Jerry""
My flow is legendary and your style is temporary
Yeah, you need to worry, like Jason, it gets scary

Sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line I'm a hear this on the radio

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not from tumors
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bight

Gave her them back shots and got money out her ass
Now you can see me in the coupe like what!
Next time I'll hit her in that G5 truck!

From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower
With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky
I can go hard, know why, big girls don't cry
I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub

[Ludacris]
Once upon a time in Kyla park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap 
No one lift a hand 
So he went about his bidness 
And devised the plan
Made a CD then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Steped out the swamp with ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leaves your boobs smellin like Burberry cologne 
Still ride the chrome 
Got bidness in the kitchen 
Never home alone 
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll gimmie 
Ludacris, I look lord like Timmy 
Had the Clint East rumor
I got a head ache and its not a tumor
Get up on my lap get my head tucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
I'm hard to the core
Core to the right
You drop down turn around pick up hella clipe (ya) 

[Chorus]

Yo straight up, Missy killed that shit tonight foreal
I know I don't really care bout her being pregnant by Micheal Jackson
You know what we should do? 
We should go get her album when it come out, what she gon do she gon do, shh
Hi Missy! 
Hi Missy?! 
Wusup foos!
You think I ain't knowin why'all broke Milli Vanilli Jay Jay fan wannabes ain't over here gossiping bout me? 
Yo how bout you buff these Pumas for 20 cents or your lights won't get cut off
You soggy breasts, cow stomachs
Yo take those baby GAP shirts off, too
You just mad 'cause Payless ran out of plastic pumps for the after party
Yo by the way, go get my album
Damn!

That the fire in your heart is out

But you never really had a doubt

And all the lights that lead us there are blinding

Would like to say to you but I don't know how

Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall

Now I'm fightin' to get it back like Mike Tyson
I want to grab my helmet and ride but you took bike license
I just want to do it like we did it before
Cindarella you was wit it before
Now I want to bring a slipper
You act like you don't fit it no more
Like I got it but I can't get it no more
And I ain't usually chaser 
Cause I write wit my pencil
But also how to use my eraser
And at the present time I think about the past 
I think about yo ass and can I see it in the future
If I see you I'll salute yah
Cause for your lovin' I'm a soldier

But how about the ladies that got a head full of fake weave or braids
Holla at ya peoples
Oh see'mon

Ooh baby let me fix my weave
Touch me up and let me fix my weave
You could pick me up about a quarter to three
Before I walk in the club 
I gotta fix my weave
(Oh) Baby fix my weave
Baby baby let me fix my weave
On the highway I do above ninety
(Woo-woo) pull me over get the fake ID

I met a guy named Tommy
Very charming
He was on me like cheese be on macaroni
His game real tight making me so horny
Fine enough for us to fuck and be his baby mommy
You really don't know me
So I moves it slowly
Brush up and let him hold me
Let me spit some baloney
Baby you could call me
If you go down on me
But you got to back up off me
Wearing cubic zirconium
I told him baby let me fix my weave
I got a hair out of place and use a fake ID
Pepe LePew voulez vous ooh oui
You want to misdemeanor me
You gotta spend more G's (ohhwee)

(Woo-woo) pull me over get the fake ID

I used to date a guy named Chris
Sloppy with his kiss
But he was good with his tongue
I called him Mr. Young One
Mr. Young One had a big ding-dong
Balls the size of ping-pong
I had him souped like won-ton
I put the beat on
And on my ass he skeet on
I put the heat on young gun
Fresh meat he season
Yes yes we used to creep down the beach
He was insane like Rick James
And with a mask he's Superfreak
I told him gimme cash to fix my weave
And I don't want no excuses 'bout your baby mommy
Cause your child support money don't fix my weave
And you know nigga please me no fuck for free

Ooh baby let me fix my weave

Hey-lo how you doing
Used to ask who I was screwing

I used to get vex when he would sex another bitch
Said Baby don't trip just like Ben I'm rich
Jen don't bitch then Miss don't bitch
Lopez get rich call me Miss Affleck
I tell him baby I need a new weave
Because my tracks feel whack

You want to play like Ben then give me your keys
Cause even Jen drive a Benz to go fix a weave

Missy Elliott,"[Missy Elliott]
Check it
See I don't want to say that this is the end
I'll end by saying this is where we?ll begin
Hip hop is a freedom of expression, not a freedom of depression

Can I make my one suggestion?
Look at how we?re labeled gangsta rappers
Is that their only impression? WAKE UP!
Rappers are craft art in a rapper?s sport

Someone like a game of basketball can't be taught
But yet we accept the name thug
Like that's fly
See how they covered our eyes?

Give us names to separate us
Sit back and watch us beef and make us hate us! SAY WHAT!?!?!
I'm done talking
Mary J. Blige, let ?em know this is not a test
I hear you calling

[Mary J. Blige]
What you hear is not a test (Oooh!)
I'm rocking to the beat (I'm rocking to the beat)
See me and my crew and my friends
We're gonna try to move your feet (Move around, move around)

See I am Mary Blige and I'd like to say, ""Hello"" (Thank you for inviting me)
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow.

You know, make you climb the walls and shit

Walk up in the party, girls swingin' they panties
They was doing that before I had them brandy's
I get a little freaky when I'm in my yammy
I may act a little freaky but I still got manners
It's Nelly, felony, and Missy Misdemeanor
Both going down, there's just to many heaters
Check the records, we got records that broke records in record time
I ain't talkin' about the records that they buyin'
Lyin', can a nigga keep up with me?

Hey yo Hov, tell 'em
Hip-Hop better wake up

[Jay-Z]
Yeah! Turn the motherfucking music up!
Breezy! Yeah! Turn the motherfucking music up!

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Motherfuckers better wake up
Stop selling crack to the blacks
Hope ya brought a spare for ya flat
Cain has sent me talking real facts
Down the hill like Jill and Jack
Got speak what yo weak mind lacks
Ya heard that? I'm creative to the fullest
""What you talking bout Willis?""
Cause you talk it never kill it
I hear but don't feel it
Thou ain't realest, ya just sweet meat in the village
Yeah I'm a Don Diva Don Niva
why yall not seen her, heater squeezed into a wife beater 
Yep I'm a top leader, I got the Martin Luther King fever
I'm a feed ya what you teacher need to preach ya
It's time to get serious, black people all areas
Who goin' carry us? It ain't time to bury us
Cause music be our first love, say 'I Do' let's cherish it

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
If you don't got a gun (it's all right)
It you makin' legal money (it's all right)
If you got to keep your clothes on (it's all right)
You ain't got a cellular phone (it's all right)
And your wheels don't spin (it's all right)
And you gotta wear them jeans again (it's all right)
Yeah, if you tried oh well (it's all right)
Emcees stop the beef, let's sell (it's all right)

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Hip-Hop better wake up, the bed to make ups
Some of why'all be faker than the dragon make up
Got issues to take up, before we break up
Like Electra let go, Missy need a baker
I love Jacob, but jewelry won't fix my place up
Gotta stay up, studio nights to cake up
Now check my flavor, rich folks is now my neighbors
I got cable, now check out how I made my paper
Hip-Hop don't stop, be my Lifesaver
Like Kobe and Shaq if they left Lakers
I'm like an elevator DJ on the crossfader
Black people wake up I'll see your ass later

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z (Missy)]
I need rims that don't listen and a booming system
First piece of change I see, I'm goin' get one
7:45, no lights to drive
I ain't even got a home, I guess I'll live in my ride
Fuck it! (rewind)
""I can hear myself, but I can't feel myself
I'm want to feel myself like Tweet""
7:45, no lights to drive
I ain't even got a home, I guess I'll live in my ride
Fuck it, couple karats in the ear won't hurt
Need a nice chain, laying on this thousand dollar shirt
Evisu Jeans cover the rectum, my kick game just like David Beckham
Anybody in my way, I wet them
I'ma be this way till the cops come catch 'em
Till detectives sketch em
On the sidewalk wit chalk, New York's infections
Till I got taught a lesson
Couple niggas gone, couple went Corrections, Hillary got ten
Till I got fifteen, nigga even my kin
Got five years bringin' nineteen in
But just think I used to think like them
Now they gotta live through the pictures that I send them in the pen

You used to say give it to me, I'd say no
You used to talk that kinky shit up in my ears
And you would buy me pink pretty under-weas
And I would moan cause you would make me feel nice
And you would make me feel like making love twice
What I'm saying, you the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough
Hey shorty I can't get enough
Can't stop, won't stop, call me Puff

Missy Elliott,"Bet it, bet it taste like candy [Repeat: x 3]

I broke up wit my ex I couldn't take his sarcasm
Everytime we bone I had to fake an orgasm
Moaning and groaning tried to make him feel manly
I'd rather use my toys, plus my hands come in handy

I finally told him that my heart was somewhere else
Whenever we sexed I wished that he was someone else
That dude that approached me at the bar the other night
That be the mister right and hot enough to melt some ice

I think I'm in love like Beyonce be with Jigga
It's not his major figure that want him to be my nigga
He got that magic stick that make my little pussy quiver
Juices running like a river slowly down my kitty litter

Boy I'm so glad I found a nigga like you
A thug like you to make a girl say - oh
Hope he feel as strong as my pohah do
With you by my side its like I'm drunk off booze

If you be my man only my man I wouldn't mind tasting your magic stick, magic stick
If you don't cheat or sleep around ain't nothing wrong wit tasting your magic stick

[Chorus]
I bet it taste like candy, meant to melt in my mouth
I know you got plenty, baby you the shit
Now what you working wit candy meant to melt in my mouth
I know you got plenty, I like the way, I like the way

[Interlude]
I like the way, I like the way
I like the way you work your stick boo
The way you work it like voodoo
The way you wind and you wind and you grind
Don't stop the way you work your stick
Baby the way you work your stick
Baby keep on and keep on and keep on keep going

My ex boyfriend had to go
He didn't know how to work that magic stick
But I found a guy that sure do love
It's so true his love is cla-hassic yeah oohhh

Always shit talk to my moms and call the cops
Couldn't wait 'til I was nice and grown
Sick of daddy mouth 'til six in the morn'
On and on and on 'til the record scratch

I went through some struggles fightin with my ex-lovers
Stayed in lots of trouble, blessings then I had recovered
Had to pay them bills, the places I lived
Messin with them cats that's said to get I had to give
I had to tell them back up cause I was quick to smack 'em up
I didn't give a WHAT, Mary J. would act up

Every time I spit I blow one or two speakers
Top model diva but my name not Eva
Yeah I bring fever rocking classic Adidas
I'm straight off the heater ripping needles off the meter
Here I go, flip my flow
Back it up then I drop it low
It's a must cause I'm dangerous
I'll be a hassle on the busta call me angel dust

Ain't nobody here that can tear the track up
And naw I ain't done rappin so shut the hell up

If you step to me I shall throw blows
Raise up like I's break nose

Ice cold heart like zero below
If you wanna battle me then playa say so

About spitting hot rhymes on out

And the way he put it down he make it sound so (fresh)

When it comes to other rappers bout it boy get flexed
When I say I'm tight as wife beaters
Missy bout to teach you how to follow the leader
Hit the club in a blue two seater
Looking like I'm finna cock a nine millimeter
Get out with my high hill cuffs
Twisting my ass cause I know what guys want
Licking my lips like I'm taking him home
Teasing and teasing I'm faking the funk
Shaking my titties like I wanna bone
Bend over slow then I tell him I'm gone

And rearranged my life 
To make sure you was fine 
Cause our love was on the line 
And I became so unkind

Missy Elliott,"See it's two type of bitches in the world
You got a broke bitch, you got a rich bitch
That would explain what I am
And what my girl, Missy is
We the rich muthafuckin' bitches

That's right
And then you got a bitch like me
Who just stand above all bitches
That excludes my girl Missy, Mary

A muthafucka' ain't takin' my title
Or my girl Missy title
Or my girl Mary title, what? That's right

See only bitches like us
Is allowed to play a game of chess
You see, a real queen needs a king
You damn muthafuckin' right
I don't want a nigga laying up under me
That can't do for me
What I can't do for my muthafuckin' self

So when y'all see me in the street?
This is what I want y'all to do
Fix your lips, put 'em together nicely and say
Say it along, say it along now, say
""She's a bitch!""

I was walkin' real slow to the dance floor
He was lookin' at my ass and I turned him on
I seen him talking to his boy on the cellular phone
I looked at him and all he could say was
""Damn baby, bring it on""

I talk shit but I come through like a storm
I keep my piece so sweet, yeah nice and warm
And all he could feel, was this love baby

I don't give a fuck
About what they think, what they say
They can call me a freak
Call me anything they wanna name
I don't give a, I don't give a

I just wanna take him home
Take him to the house then turn him out

Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?

So the next one came with a bag of treats, she smelled like sugar and
spoke like the sea

'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away
And it was then I realize the conscience never fades
When you're young you have this image of your life
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross
And if you happen to you wake completely lost
But I will fight for you, be sure that I will fight
Until we're the special two once again

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's
'Cause we're the special two
And we can only see each other, we'll breathe together
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two

I remember someone old once said to me
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
I was comfortable and warm inside my shell
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well, my guess the answer is don't do it in the first place
I know, I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now
But if by chance you change your mind
You know I will not let you down
'Cause we were the special two and will be again

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's

Or something that could ease the pain
But nothing cures the hurt, you, you bring on boy yourself
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together
These hands would not be taught to hold another's
We were the special two
And we could only see each other, we'd bleed together
These arms would not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two",The Special Two (Live Version)
Missy Higgins,"Somebody said can ya find the way to God,
I said I found my way in beat dap-in-do-pa
That's how I found my way to God.

Walking down the street sayin' hi hello,
But how far do you think I can god
Before I start having to sing ya the blues dap-in-boo-pa
Tapping to the beat, singing hi-di-ho,
But how long do you think I can go
Before I start having to get in the groove dab-in-do-ba

'cause I know that there will always be a life for me
Because I found my place in history,
As a lover of the beat dap-in-do-ba,
That's how I found the way to God.

So your sittin in your seats, and tapping your toes,
How long do ya think you can hold,
Before you start having to join in my groove dap-in-do-baa

'cause there's a beat in my feet
As I tumble the seas
And the waves of ecstacy
And can you feel the vibe
Does it move you inside
Like the way it does to me

'cause I know, that there will never be a doubt in me
'cause Momma told me it was meant to be
I found my baby in the beat dap-in-do-ba,
That's how I found my way to God
Oh yeah
That's how I found my way to god
Oh whoa
That's how I found my way to god

Missy Higgins,"She ran until her face was numb with cold and
Wore a cotton gown that blazed the night untold.
She ran until her feet refused to hold
So heavy a heart for someone merely ten years old.
And when she reached the river her knees began to shiver,
Her head with pounding voices from home.
Behind her was a vision, a painful apparition
Of a darker world that no-one should know.

Somebody's bed will never be warm again,
The river will keep this friend.
Yeah somebody's bed will never be warm again,
No never again.

She dived beneath the water's icy skin,
Hoping the cold would kill the smell of angry gin,
And her eyes grew wider than they'd ever been
Just wishing the numbness to cut deeper with its pins.
And as her body lay there she decided to stay there
Till darkness came to pull her away.
And beautifully she sank as up river was the bank
Where some bodiless troubles would stay.

Somebody's bed will never be warm again,
The river will keep this friend.
Yeah somebody's bed will never be warm again,
No never again.

Somebody's bed will never be warm again,
The river will keep this friend.
Yeah somebody's bed will never be warm again,
No never again.",The River
Missy Higgins,"Like a freeze-dried rose, you will never be,

You'll embrace me like a star, 
Envelope me, envelope me

Promise to take me to before you went away 
If only for a day. 
If things get real for me down here, 
Promise to take me back to the tune 
We played before you went away. 

And if I listen to, the sound of white, 
Sometimes I hear your smile, and breath your light. 
Yeah if I listen to, the sound of white 
You're my mystery. One mystery. My mystery. One mystery. 

My silence solidifies, 
Until that hollow void erases you, 
Erases you so I can't feel at all. 
But if I never fell again, at least that nothingness 
Will end the painful dream, of you and me 
If things get real for me down here, promise to take me to 
Before you went away, if only for a day. 
If things get real for me down here, promise to take me back to 
The tune we played before you went away.

Yeah if I listen to, the sound of white 
Sometimes I hear your smile, and breath your light. 
And if I listen to, the sound of white. 

I knelt before some strangers face, 
I'd never have the courage or belief to trust this place, 
But I dropped my head, 'cause it felt like lead, 
And I'm sure I felt your fingers through my hair

I'll get angry at your words and I'll go home 
And you won't call after me 'cause I'll be back before you know, you know

So give me a tooth full of that smile, 
And know-it-all eyes you show me 
Just to prove that you don't need to lose it.

But is it a crime for me to say my own view 
And want then not to fear you? 

And so I'll run but not too far, in case you chase me

That we should go.√¢?? She said √¢??I'm just another girl 
Who wants to know just where you think it's 
Written down, this way that we should go...√¢?? 

It was a black winter night as she stumbled on 
And with every step grew closer to the ground. 
She knew her one chance of living on was to strip 
Away all the colors that were casting her astray.

Cling to my body like oil and fire,
And they will not sleep, they will not tire.

So we have a problem you see, my dear, 
'Cause I can't move on and I can't stay here.
I gotta fix it, I need your tears,
But mostly now I need your ears.

See I gotta tell you, I need you to know,
You were my ruin when you took hold.
You made me believe the lies you told,
But you won't get away with the pride you stole.
Getting off this dusty road.

Girls never tell you I don't know how,
But sometimes men you abuse your power.
We are strong and we do rebound,
But bruising tends to break us down.

So I gotta tell you, I need you to know,
You were my ruin when you took hold.
You made me believe the lies you told,
But you won't get away with the pride you stole.
Getting off this dusty road.

And I'm trading in my sympathy for sanity, 
So hear me because I

Wouldn't find one if you magnified
Because you've got the wrong girl

You'd never miss a thing but you missed me there
And I just kept thinking 'Am I prepared
To pull it out from under your trusting stare?'

And I'm walking round bumping into things you said
This has not been as easy as I thought it would

Watch as the lion eats the clown

Wings sprouted from her shoulder blades
And every bone inside her seemed to change.

And if she could she'd do it all again.

To leave only the bed in which they laid.
But an island is just there

Oh the pillars underneath them began to crack

She's playing all the minor chords
Wishing so damn hard he'd kiss her like before.

And why'd you leave me here?

Left or right, up or down, these are choices
The end of this life represents the choices we make
The decision to live your life out of tune
With your true nature, limits your external existence this is sad

Beyond this world, beyond this dimension lies incredible knowledge
If we close our minds with fear and ignorance we can't perceive these
Philosophies the universe is based on energy and continuous flow
This energy can be tapped and used we should learn
To use our power of deduction

We should know what to eat from our physiological makeup
We should know that destruction of great minds is monstrous
Because the emotion we posses is human
All these choices are a great lateral, a giant matrix up
A series of crossroads we must travel choose wisely

Mama please come put your arms around me
Cause where I'm standing life's so cold
Come and take on this peaceful journey

This is how we, do it down South
Platinum and the gold, ice in our mouth
Fo's in place, Chi-Town fades
4's or blades, candy sprayed

Down here we like it big, on that Dirty coast
Big money swanging whips, cause we serve the most
We live by that G code, that's what gangstas do
On the grind stacking chips, with a gangsta crew
Down here sipping lean, that's that purple stuff
Staying thoed getting bucked, playas living it up
Game spitters riding big, is a habit y'all
Everything you dream about, we done had it y'all
We got money yellow hoes, wearing g-string clothes
Sport sweaters in the summer, cause our necks stay froze
Gripping grain having change, hanging low as your belt
If you want to be a man, go and get it yourself
Down here we do it all, break laws and ball
Ghetto stars for the cause, either stand or fall
We live it up cause we love it, playa deal with that
Tite getting it how I live, keep it real with that

[Chorus: x2]

Down South, yeah we ride on dubs
Abuse them drugs, and hoes don't get no love
We just some thugs, with ice that glow and glisten
In a six hundred Benz, and the top is missing
Sit back and listen, cause what I'm saying is real
From Houston to Huntsville, boys got ice in grills
We love to chill, and ride on candy paint
Sip on drank, and blow on that stanky dank
Down South, we known as that Dirty Dirty
If you got your money right, I got them birdy birdies
They going for thirty, yeah you heard me clear
And if you didn't know nigga, that's how we do it down here

Down here, we be off the chain
Down here, we roll foreigns and wide frames
Down here, riding on dubs and 4 swanging
We staying iced up, from the heel to the brain

So I pay cost to be the boss, keep a time out in the crime house
We thoed we hold it down, wait for bidness no pleasure
This game is serious, ask M-J-G he'll tell you
Stay fired blowing big, sipping on a daily basis
I got better with my cheddar, I'm bout stacking my faces
It's the scrambling we gon handle em, living the best out our figgas
And if I'm lying we be draping choose my son, you tripping
When that Don from six, man I'm still a G to the N
I'm staying fly cause you smile, showing love to my kin
For shizzle my nizzle, from here McGregor we swang and bang
And in Peru hotting dudes, chopping by is from the fame
The girls best friend, princess cuts in everything

Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank

S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G

'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man

You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something

We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car

Le rap fran√ßais j'l'effrite et l'fous dans une Philip Morris
Ensuite j'le glisse dans une feuille, et l'fume avec mon pote Maurice
Les faux j'les terrorise, ils m'font golri d'ces humoristes
Moi, passe-moi moi un 11-43 et j'te fais danser m√™me Chuck Norris
On triomphe sans gloire √† vaincre sans risques

Mister You,"B√©n√©vole ne sert √† rien, mon but est lucratif
Niquer ne sert √† rien si t‚Äôes pas fort dans la pratique
Nous barrer la route? Ok mais tu feras pas long terme
Qu‚Äôest ce que tu crois vers chez nous les tits-pe deviennent tous comme √† Nanterre
Mais √† long terme un neuf une pute qui m‚Äôsuce sur un bateau
Ouais c‚Äôest √ßa ma vie tu prendras pas d‚Äôimp√¥t sur le b√¢ton
√âcoute bien, t‚Äôes mort si tu t‚Äôreposes sur tes acquis
Pens√©e √† toi si de ta grotte tu r√™ves du boule d‚ÄôAlicia Keys
√Ä fond sur mes ennemis comme quand j‚Äôaimais trop l‚Äôherbe
Ma foi il n‚Äôy a que les vivants qui te font des probl√®mes
Alors faut r√©gler √ßa, dis pas que tu sais pas comment faire
Au pire je sais pas emprunte les couilles √† ton grand fr√®re
Rien ne sert de ler-par on a ce qu‚Äôil faut pour remballer tes types
Dis leur You' pour qu‚Äôon ait peur faudrait nous envoyer des tigres
J‚Äôai un doctorat sur les recettes et les diamants
Une question : comment faire pour vivre on est tous d√©j√† morts?

On se checke √† la Sant√© et on se rattrape en ieu-ta
On est l√† pour repr√©senter trois mathus sur la ble-ta
Mec on se check √† la sant√© et on se rattrape au dio-stu
On veut se refaire une sant√© et dire adieu aux stups

T√™te de hafrite, j‚Äôai pas retourn√© ma veste
J‚Äôai mis du shit dans le Nesquik et de la vodka dans les Cornflakes
Woo Gata Zbl√®x
Si y'a un rappeur qui fait le cro-ma on va le faire passer √† travers le pareflex
Je veux rester seul avec mon zdeh merde
Je suis un √©go√Øste qui r√©fl√©chit et qui se dit que la mort viendra le faire taire certes
Donc ne m‚Äôen voulez pas de penser √† ma gueule z√®h
Neuf mois avant de na√Ætre pour m‚Äôen sortir j‚Äôy ai d√©j√† laiss√© des millions de fr√®res
Je marche √† l‚Äôenvers, comme les tits-pe dans le clip de Kriss Kross
Nique la m√®re aux hessess donc nique m√™me la m√®re √† Rick Ross
Salam ahlikoum ahlikoum salam

Mec on se check √† la sant√© et on se rattrape au dio-stu
On veut se refaire une sant√© et dire adieu aux stups

On nous reconnait de loin, √† nos silhouettes disproportionn√©es
On m√¢chouille des siwak on roule dans des caisses toutes optionn√©es
L‚Äôalbum s‚Äô√©coute fonce-d√©, alors tise et mets play
Je mets pas de Bandana juste pour caut√©riser mes plaies
Tout ce que t‚Äôas en falche je l‚Äôai en vrai
J‚Äôavais un bout de peau en trop mash'Allah je l‚Äôai enlev√©
C‚Äôest tout le monde qui veut des lov√©s
M√™me les manchots sont pr√™ts √† faire la manche avec leurs pieds
Le pass√©, balafr√© comme un corps de trav'
J‚Äôaime le fromage qui coince comme une porte de cave
Je ressors de GAV beaucoup plus l√©ger
Ma femme est lourde elle porte du Herv√© Leger
Je suis un client privil√©gi√©
Belz√©buth mieux vaut √™tre le roi de la benne que la reine des putes
Je veux du Black Label, de l‚ÄôAbsinthe, ou de l‚ÄôAbsolut
Je crois que je suis au bout du rouleau de P.ul-c

Mister You,"J'suis dans mon quartier, j'gal√®re, j'regarde en l'air
J'suis en train d'cogiter, j'suis d√©fonc√© sa m√®re

J'arrive charg√©, comme une porteuse √† Tanger
Apr√®s mon passage au ter-feu il te reste plus grand chose √† manger
J'roule un sdeh pour me percher, rejoindre l'√©toile du berger
C'est plus des couilles que j'ai, eh non, c'est des gros ≈ìufs de Faberg√©
J'suis overbook√©, OK zoogataga
J'ai appris une chose chez Ruquier
C'est le mot rutabaga
J'r√™ve que d'pouvoir, et comme vous avez pu le voir
Bah le rap fran√ßais c'est pas vraiment l'truc tah Audrey Pulvar
Mon point commun avec Natacha c'est mes chicos d'devant
Que moi-m√™me sans mes 32 dents, j'leur faisais du rentre-dedans
Ouais, bien sur que l'avenir est inqui√©tant
Pour des barrettes ils nous mettent 8 ans
Wesh, monsieur le pr√©sident, dites leur bien que
J'repr√©sente les 3arbis et les niggas
Moi j'suis plus riche qu'eux, donc pourquoi j'irai fouiller leurs caisses
En pleine crise, moi j'suis en plein dans les 30 glorieuses
Mais j'sais que ma libert√© bah, fait pas grand chose √† leur yeux
Demande √† Lacrim quand j'√©tais √† l'√©cole
C'est pour gratter les remises de peine
Du dispatching au disque d'platine
De l'affiche de recherche √† la fiche de paye
J'ai p√©t√© tous les barrages, mais je n'ai jamais √©t√© odieux
Comment idol√¢trer la vache, quand l'univers est √† Dieu
Dites leur bien que, m'en bat les couilles de leur baratin
Que la j'suis en promenade, 3√®me tour, Rabta dans un bar √† tinp'
Nique l'√âtat, ces schmetats r√™vent que de nous mettre dans la de-mer
J'vais m'branler et m√™me cracher sur leur putain syst√®me de merde
Woogata (ekh tfou) rap tah les fous
Ils pr√©f√®rent s'acheter une Rafleuse que d'faire du kung-fu
La Mecque, j'suis de ceux qui se baisse et Allah yaafo
Je t'ai d√©j√† dis, nous on cotise tous pour la retraite √† Clairvaux
Ils nous mettent des peines de p√©dophile pour des histoires de barrettes
Autant vendre de la coca√Øne butez-nous pour qu'on s'arr√™te
Les 3ineurs montre pas l‚Äô≈ìil, dites leur de niquer leur m√®re les chouettes
Moi, m'occupe de la vodka, woogataga gardez la schweps
Hey, d'apr√®s mon entourage moi j'reste un brave, 
J'reste un vrai c'est pour √ßa qu'il m'encourage
Apr√®s la pluie, y'a pas le beau temps y'a l'orage
C'est vrai que les petits sont hardcore, on √©tait pareil √† leur √¢ge
√Ä deux sur un scooter on vivez que de vol √† l'arrach'
Puis on a connu la crave-bi et on a vite tourn√© la page
J'me suis mis √† couper des barrettes, ensuite √† vendre des plaquettes
Puis d'la coke et des galettes, jusqu'√† ce que les keufs nous arr√™tent
Un jour j'√©tais dans le 19, l'lendemain un hessess fermait ma porte
Un soir j'√©tais avec une meuf, l'lendemain elle √©tait avec mon pote
La vie c'est dur, pas de peine nous tout ce qu'on porte c'est des flingues
Et y'a pas de vice de proc√©dure gros c'est la loi de la jungle
C'est pas d'ma faute, darwah, j'crois bien que j'suis tar√© d'naissance
J'me reconnais pas moi-m√™me des fois j'suis ravi de faire ma connaissance
Et quand je pars au shtar, bah t‚Äôinqui√®te pas que j're√ßois des mandats
Et j'ai toujours la frappe, tah hollanda et bellanda
J'suis rabtah, zoogataga sous ma v√©randa
J'glisse mes doigts dans les cheveux tah Esmeralda
J'emmerde l'Etat, j'emmerde les stups, j'emmerde les gendarmes
Trafiquant de rimes, trafiquant d'stups ou trafiquant d'armes
Je suis, comment vous dites? 
Parano√Øaque, ouais
Je m'en bat les yeuc', madame la juge baraneyek
J'te l'avais dit que j'avais des projets
L√† j'graille des brochettes, j'insulte ta m√®re et j'touche des gros ch√®ques
J‚Äôach√®te des trucs qui valent ch√®res, rien qu'avant hier
J'me suis achet√© 3-4 t-shirt, j'ai d√©pens√© ton salaire
J'me suis roul√© un gros sdeh, puis j'ai repens√© √† la mis√®re
A cet √©t√©, √† cet hiver, quand on √©tait au val-d'Is√®re
Au mitar tah la Sant√©, les promenades en camembert
Au mitar tah Fleury, j'revois les toilettes j'me dis beurk!
A les b√¢tards, comment ils ont pu me faire √ßa?
Ils me l'ont mise j'leur est remise woogata vice et versa
Yaa z√©h oblig√© de se faire remarquer, pas oblig√© de se faire embarquer d√©f√©r√© au parquet
Direction les grillages, bon, tr√™ve d'enfantillage
Yeah, I speak a little English, motherfucking biatch!
Ould l'kahba what you gonna do Ok j'continue tout doux j'big up le rott' Mamadou
Yoogata yoogata gangz to gangz
Ouais, tu connais la musique, celui qui veux teste j'le baise

Ban-ban-bandit j'fait que du propre, j'effectue les sales t√¢ches
√áa sert √† quoi de jouer le pirate, si t'enquilles pas √† l'abordage
Ils dopent en dopant, co on t'laisse le dos en deux
On est nous-m√™mes en (?) exorciste avec un joint d'beuh
Tous les soirs j'd√©grise, nos combines se d√©veloppent
Mais des fois les quis' d√©barquent et dans les comptes √ßa fait des flops
Du crime ouais y'a la cr√®me, Sta-ive c'est du v√©cu
Mon gros, chez moi le sang c'est vid√© √† cause du manque d'√©cus
Pas de X que t‚Äôach√®tes avec alcool et abus
De plus, j'baise ces nabots qui croient contr√¥ler la rue
Les yeux cern√©s au poste, menott√© √† des barreaux de chaise
J'r√™ve d'√éles Vierges m'en fumer avec des barreaux de chaises
La nuit j'dors mal, √©ternellement tourment√©
En pensant que j'vais prendre cher si les keufs arrivent √† tout remonter
Ceux qui s√®ment le vent, r√©colte du ons dans le ventre
A-L, futur ex-braqueur reconverti dans la vente

J'aimerais partir tranquille, les pieds d'vant
Un monde de fils de pute, j'suis oblig√© de vendre
Ah bon? 
√áa suffit pas alors on braque sa m√®re
M‚Äôen voulais pas dans le rap y'a trop de Zehmel
3 Quart, belle coupe, chico cass√©
La vie c'est speed m√™me mon ombre veut me d√©passer
Oh, le sky est class√©, j'suis chaud
Menac√© ne sert √† rien, j't'envoie 2-3 balles l'affaire est class√©
Ramass√© du biff, voil√† dans quoi j'me suis perdu
J'sais c'que c'est d'avoir la dalle, j'en connais ces vertus
Hyper dur, fr√©quentation malsaine
Chiale pas sur mon sort, tu sais qu'ici personne nous accepte
On conna√Æt le respect, Les valeurs et les principes
T'es le plus grand des hommes si tu te l√®ves pour bosser √† Rungis
Malheureusement pas mon cas, au fond de moi je les envies
Nos vies, c'est faire du biff, mais rest√© en vie
Donc faut marcher arm√©, puis avoir la trique
Aujourd'hui t'allume demain t'es matrix√©
C'est la vie du western, la vie d'moi j'suis r√©el
La tranquillit√© fr√©rot est bloqu√© dans mes r√™ves
Impossible de l'avoir, je ne prend jamais de rotte-ca
Mais Belek au feu le couz si tu mets trop de bois
Beaucoup de salopes font les voyous, wallah que c'est pas une fiert√©
Dit moi qui sera l√† le jour ou t'auras vraiment merd√©
J'ai l'orgueil d'un b√©b√©, je m'√©nerve et je p√®te tout
J'assume les cons√©quences khey dans mes bras je prend le mektoub
Oui j'aime pas les poulets et je ferais recette sans eux
Une impression m√™me jaloux de ma m√®re √† 700E
Ils m'inventent des vies, le mythe ils veulent casser
Hum j'en ai assez, les traquer, les chlasser
Quand j'allais tu revenais, dans ta t√™te √ßa ne rentre pas
Je le ferais tout les jours, je compte l'oseille me d√©range pas
Bien sur qu'on s'est fait tout seul, je sais tr√®s bien que tu sais
J'ai braqu√© des bijouteries quand les autres allaient sucer
Sans t'manquer de respect, dans l'rap dit moi ce qui est facile
Fr√©rot on viens de la rue c'est des filles faciles

J'ai roul√© ma bosse, j'en ai marre d'bouffer d'la merde
Coup d'crosse la vie t'assommes pire qu'un joint d'herbe
Tout ce qu'on a on finit par l'perdre
√âtoile de mer 10 000 kilom√®tres
Perdu sur la lune verte
J'sui tellement loin des ""je veux √™tre""
Berad d'aatay j'allume un Jaabouq √† la fen√™tre
T'es dans l'paraitre moi j'vais disparaitre
Les kheys passent au dispatching, une m√®re qui pleure c'est la faute d'un traitre
Y'a plus que des bras cass√©s dis-moi √† qui serrer les coudes?
Six pieds sous terre quand j'me ferais bouffer par l'doud
Noyer dans le doute, j'suis toujours dans le hood
Les yeux rouges, oui dead casa negra j'suis pas un l'blood
Passe moi des feuilles ce soir j'fume mes derni√®res illusions
Sers moi un verre que j'tourne cette trag√©die en d√©rision
11.43, Mortuaire sera la saison
Maintenant j'marche avec des r√©tros, dis qui va m'sauter l'caisson
Y'a y'a y'a plus d'rage que d'la fashionnerie
J'enterre l'espoir dans un parloir √† Fleury
Ghetto youth langage, du whisky, les chicos pourries
Bonbon sauvage 0.4 roya sourit

Heh-hep-pep, Dieu seul est maitre de ma destin√©e
Moi j'me verrais bien √† La Mecque avec mes rents-pa et ma dulcin√©e
La vie c'est pas un clip ni du cin√© ou une bande dessin√©e
On va peut-√™tre finir √† Clairvaux, on va peut-√™tre s'faire assassiner
C'est clair gros qu'on peut tout perdre sur un coup d'ker-po
J'te parle d'une boite ou pour rentrer y'a m√™me pas besoin d'se faire beau
Le cercle est vicieux bienvenue dans le cerceau
Quand j'ai f√™t√© mes 16 ans c'est pas du plomb que j'avais dans le cerveau

J'ai 28 ans j'habite dans l'zoo je m'appelle Eddy Chabard
J'veux r√©ussir, j'veux m'en sortir depuis que j'suis tout petit je chabarde
J'ai bicrave, j'ai fais plein d'conneries dont j'suis pas du tout fier
Comme les aller-retours √† Fleury pour battre le fer faut du fer
Pour faire du flouze faut du flouze, des couilles et d'la gamberge
Surtout quand t'es seul contre tous y'a personne pour te tendre la perche
Moi Alhamdulillah j'suis pas comme √ßa j'pr√©f√®re aider mon prochain
Car j'sais que Dieu me l'rendra ici bas ou dans un monde prochain
Lah yaalem bi kolchi, hata tkoun labes Gucci
Lmout tji ou tadik

J'arrive dans l'game avec You pour √©craser tous ces chiens
M√™me s'ils sont plein on les baise tous kalachnikov √† la main
Ca va p√©ter dans l'quartier, dans tous les ghettos d'France
Ayat-al kursi 11.43 pour me souhaiter bonne chance
M'en bas les couilles de c'que tu penses, depuis ma tendre enfance
J'laisse la concurrence en transe lourde sera la sentence
Brulux on the flux toujours dans les bacs
Hier ils m'boycottaient maintenant ils veulent faire mes bacs
Prochain clip j'appelle Fredo il m'pr√©pare le Maybach
Cette fois ci j'ferais pas l'gamin promis j'cacherais tes blacks
Ils m'ont pris pour une blague, des mesures il m'en reste quatre
Pour ma m√®re j'veux du 2.4 pour moi qamis, un RS4
D√©dicace l'Alg√©rie, le Maroc, la Tunisie
Faudra bient√¥t retourner chez nous car y'a trop d'crapules ici

Parce que tu manges du lion le matin devant moi tu veux rugir
Approche j'te mets une claque de roumain tu vas rougir
Plus tu vas monter plus les rumeurs vont surgir
Personne ne se fie d'personne √©coutes bien tout ce que j'vais te dire
Tout ce qui est autour de moi, j'vais te l'exploser
La j'p√®te les plombs j'ai retir√© la goupille j'fais exploser
A ma droite les fr√®res mus' d√©barque pour nous faire des rappels
Pas la quand j'suis (?) les appelle
En primaire j'te frappais ouai j'me prenais pour l'king
A 10 ans au comico voiture p√©ta dans un parking
Le quartier c'est une plaque tournante, √ßa d√©fouraille de partout
Dans mon escalier j'tombe sur un sac remplis d'billets j'garde tout
Assis sur un banc toute la journ√©e sa bibi
Dans les bois √ßa fais bep-bep ou cric-cric bim bim!
Au coll√®ge, lyc√©e voil√† les (?) moi j'casse des dents
Avec (?) ou pas leurs uppercuts te rentre dedans
On sais que la police nous surveille mais elle ne sait pas tout
Les malins savent tr√®s bien que l'argent ne fait pas tout
On a des avocats mais ils n'arrangent pas tout
Les m√©decins sont la mais il ne soignent pas tout
Pas de chance cette nuit la juge s'est fait mal bais√©e
Donc forc√©ment des chance d'√™tre acquitt√© on baiss√©es
T'es press√©, t'acc√©l√®res risquer sont les raccourcis
Kazou dis leur que cette est pute est plus de soucis que d'surcis

Pos√© √† la tess j'ai rien vu, rien entendu
J'ves-qui les histoires tendu
Des fois c'est tes potes qui t'enculent
Avec du recul
J'ai fini par devenir solitaire
Pour l'Etat on a pas les crit√®res
Donc on a fini sur le ter
J'vois des p√®res, des m√®res qui travaillent dur pour ceux qu'ils aiment
Wallah √ßa m'fait de la peine d'les rentrer pour rien dans nos probl√®mes
11.43 c'est le th√®me
La c'est Tirgo sur l'antenne
Poto d√®s l'd√©but de l'enqu√™te c'est possible que tu perds la t√™te
Envoie la frappe de Ketama d√©dicace √† Khadama
J'suis oblig√© d'faire du sale y'a toute la cit√© derri√®re moi
Y'en a qui braquait des tabacs nous on bicravait du taga
Ouai continuer √† taguer nous on √† pas l'temps on tabasse
On va t'laisser aux aguets d√©-ter comme l'arm√©e du Hamas
J'savais pas que sur ce banc ouais j'allais fumer des kamas
Toute l'ann√©e tu fais des phases poto, c'est pas comme a-√ß
Dans l'ar√®ne j'ai toujours la faille, flow qui tire comme un Fa-mas
Nous on est comme des hommes, on va toujours √† la chasse
Y'a du biff' et des liasses oblig√© on s'd√©place
Sa bicrave au fond de l'impasse
D√©sol√© si √ßa d√©passe
Dans ton bigo y'a les vrais et les boloss que t'effaces

We-wesh la racaille, les raclures la police en a ras-le-cul
Ma vie c'est un texte de rap remplit d'ratures
Nerveux l'sourire aux l√®vres dot√© d'pouvoir c√©leste
J'ai perdu l'nord ma direction √† moi c'est l'est
J'√©cris des textes de fou, beaucoup m√©taphorique
L'histoire d'un braqueur qui finit par taffer au Ritz
Rosny-sous-Bois, la Sambuy, les braquos, les sous-salles
Les sous-sols, les mouses, ceux qui moussent et qui s'd√©bat ainsi qu'les douzes
J'rappe, je pense comme un mec de la ur
J'aime la pure qui branche les clients sur mon terrain tout les jours
J'ai pas d'bonnes habitudes j'descends et j'traine
J'truande j'ves-qui la justice d√©dicace √† Fresnes
Les sir√®nes retentissent, les criminels se repentissent
La pisse du she√Øtan, mes repentises, ma hantise
C'est vraiment pas la mort mais c'qui s'en suit
J'aime quand √ßa va que dans un sens (Oui!)
Quand c'est class√© sans suite
Moi j'ai ram√©, ramen√© la merde √† mes rents-pa
Et j'donne tout √† mes fr√®res marlich s'ils me le rendent pas
La justice on s'la fait nous m√™me, I'm so Hood!
Un dialogue de sourd entre moi et ma bouteille d'Absolut
Me parle pas d'la gloire n'y m√™me du sommet (Nan, nan, nan)
Pour l'instant j'me bas pour finir la semaine
Mais guette moi j'suis la j'rappe sale vas-y acquiesce
De nos jours tu peux rater l'grand amour si t'as pas d'caisse

Sta-ive c'est du v√©cu
On comprend que chez moi le sang c'est vid√© √† cause du manque d'√©cus
Oui c'est l'cercle est vicieux bienvenue dans le cerceau
√áa va p√©ter dans l'quartier, dans tout les ghettos d'France
J'sais c'que c'est d'avoir la dalle, j'en connais les vertus

Aujourd'hui, c'est le premier jour du reste ma vie,
Gr√¢ce √† Dieu j'ai grandi et j'suis m√™me devenu le prince de ma ville
L'amour √ßa fait du bien mais des fois √ßa fait souffrir
Je me suis noy√© dans ton regard en plongeant dans ton sourire
J'arrive m√™me plus √† r√©fl√©chir j'comprends pas ce qu'il m'arrive

Oh je te suis et je te suivrai, ici l'amour commence √† s‚Äôessouffler,

J'te laisserai m'dire je t'aime

Yo, te amo mi amor, car j'sais bien que c'est r√©ciproque
J'ai envie de te prendre dans mes bras, j'ai envie de te serrer si fort
Je veux sentir ton c≈ìur battre contre ma cage thoracique

Toxicomane j'avoue, j'p√®te un garde √† vue

Aujourd'hui tout ce que j'souhaite, c'est d'arr√™ter l'alcool
Le shtar, les assiettes, les perquis', les maux de t√™te
Ce qui faut c'est des hebet, sans que les cond√©s nous arr√™tent

Le savoir est une arme, mais la richesse rach√®te l‚Äôintellect
J'veux partager ma tristesse, pour √ßa faut que j'me d√©connecte
Moi quand j'regarde le ciel, non, j'contemple pas les com√®tes
J'pense √† mes potes qui sont partis, au Seigneur j'demande de l'aide
Pour accomplir ma mission, sans que personne me compromette
Je m'en vais toucher l'horizon
Faut plus que les keufs me passent les gourmettes
On joue pas √† la Playstation, gros y'a ni start, ni select
C'est pr√©cis, c'est clair, c'est net, √ßa fini sur la sellette
J'sais qu'on va tous dispara√Ætre, ho ho
J'ai du wari maintenant ce qu'il me faut c'est des hassanats
Et j'dois remercier mon public, de m'avoir √©crit toute ces lettres
Voil√† un jeu de mot tr√®s utopique, √ßa t'fume pour une cigarette
Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Phillip l√† o√π il est il barette
J'crois bien que j'suis allergique aux flics
J'sais pas ce qui se passe dans ma t√™te

J'vous laisse au bord de la merde

MisterWives,"I gave my hand for you to hold
I gave my love that you went and sold
Exchanged our song for another
Can't blame, is that flame that once glowed like no other.

How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins?
We were so alive
Only to see us wither and die.

You say you stand even if this is our fault
You're earning, you'll dare when you will hit the wall
I shot your ears, tried to make you hear my call
But you were long gone, hoping this song is done.

How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins?
We were so alive
Only to see us wither and die.

I saw your hand dry
And I never ever thought I'd hear these words be said
Now I lay here in an unmade bed
Empty stomach, Sunday bowl to be fed
Your ego swallowed and from there you fled
So far away, could not find your way back
Walked down the path, wet feet slip through the grass.

Wet feet slip through the grass
Could not find your way back
Wet feet slip through the grass
Could not find your way back.

How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins?
We were so alive
Only to see us wither and die.

Oh, why? I saw your hand dry.",Coffins

I'll be dreaming of you if that's alright
I like you better in my sleep
There in my thoughts I'll keep things right

Can't find this like in real time
But in my dreams this crime is crystal clear

That's got it's claws tightly grasped in my skin
I wake up to find nothing there
I'd tell you this but you already don't care

Keeping low never wanna play
Wandering far, disappearing
Feet stuck in place, not moving

You've been up and down down
You've been low low low
Troubled sea so deep, troubled none no sleep
You've been flying so high
Avoiding the road

Pretending to not feel alone
Pretending to not feel alone

Where to fly? who knows
Winds rapidly, blow
From branch to branch you go
When you see the sun dear friend let it glow
Don't shun it all, don't let it fall
From your hands how you used to crawl
You're walking tall, no need to hide
Behind the clouds in the sky

You've been up and down down

Troubled sea so deep, troubled none no sleep
You've been flying so high

Pretending to not feel alone
Pretending to not feel alone

If the sun goes down too soon
Embrace the starry eyed moon

You made it, made it through oh

Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Mistress Bawd,"Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow,
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

Misturada 4,"Hoje foi que a perdi
Mas onde j√° nem sei
Em Vera me larguei
E deito nesta dor
Meu corpo sem lugar
Ah, quisera esquecer

A mo√ßa que se foi
De nossa Vera Cruz
√â o pranto que ficou
Do norte que sonhei
Das coisas do lugar
Dos mimos me larguei

Correndo sem parar
Buscar Vera Cruz
Nos campos e no mar
Mas ela se soltou
No norte se perdeu

Se ela em outra mansid√£o
Um dia ancorar
E ao vento me esquecer
Ao vento me amarrei
E nele vou partir
Atr√°s de Vera Cruz

Ah, quisera encontrar
A mo√ßa que se foi
Do lar de Vera Cruz
E o pranto que ficou
Do norte que perdi
Das coisas do lugar

Of a dance with illusion

I am surrounded by beauty that will never be mine
As regret like a wave came crushing over me
If I had only known that such beauty was available
If I had only known but now it's too late

And the accuser of the brethren was pacing back and forth and back and forth and to and through
As he spilt out his words he was going back and forth and back and forth
He was listing off my sins one by one

Guilty guilty guilty guilty
And the great count of witnesses and the angels o the angels
Looked on the scene
As the accuser of the brethren was going back and forth
Glee in his eye guilty guilty guilty guilty
And resound to the corridor of eternity in time like a thunder in my soul
He was right I was guilty guilty to eternal damnation for my soul
And there was nothing I could nothing I could do
Face down, face down, couldn't even open my eyes, the regret was so strong
There's a hand on my shoulder, a hand on my shoulder
And I hear a voice, like music in my ear
Dare I look up ? , I couldn't lift my eyes but all I saw
That beautiful feet, and I heared that voice like music, music to my soul
He said , Father I desire that she will be with me where I am, show her my glory
Father I desire this one, this one she is mine, she is mine , she is mine
He was praying for my soul , he was pleading for my behalf
He was praying for me, I couldn't comprehend it, I couldn't understand what was going on

Mine
Father Father I desire this one, this one, she's mine she's mine she's mine

And I opened up my eyes
And I watched in wonder
This beautiful one stood to his feet
I looked up and there was a great trone and there was the father
And he had a cup of wrath with my name on it
It had my name on it
And I was just about to rise to drink
Guilty guilty guilty
But I watched in unbelief this beautiful one, he walked on to his father
And drank of the cup
And before I knew what was going on he drank of the cup
He drank of the cup
He drank of the cup of the father's wrath
He drank of the cup of the marriage wine
He drank of the cup with my name on it
He drank of the cup and all the blood..
I jumped to my feet and I ran over to him and it was too late
I tried to stop him but I didn't know it was too late
And all the blood all the blood , and all the blood
It should have been me, and I was weeping and weeping and I ran over forgetting where I was
And I fell down face, down down and o pleased Father crush him
But it was too late , I began to plead it should have been me , it should have been me
But it was too late, why did he do it but it was too late
And all the blood, and all the blood, and all the blood, and all the blood
I was weeping weeping and crying it should have been me, it should have been me
Face down, why did he do it? face down, why did he do it?
It should have been me
Was weeping and weeping, why did he gave his life, all the blood
Was weeping and weeping
And I heard a whisper like music
""what's yours is mine and what's mine is yours""

I looked to the left, I looked to the right, and I was on a sea of glace like crystal
There was a great great congregation dressed in white
From every tounge, from every tribe, from every people
And the music began and a celebration erupted
And I opened up my eyes, and there was the lamb, although he was slain
And I was at a wedding and I couldn't believe my eyes
And I was dressed in garments, garments of beauty
And the music erupted and the angels sing halleluja halleluja the chore has broke out
And I looked out and saw the lamb with eyes like fire radiating radiating with desire
And he said what's yours is mine and what's mine is yours
Arise and sit on the throne, prepare for your beauty, rise beauty rise, beauty rise
And we say with one heart and one voice, worthy is the lamb of God

But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with eggs eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans pinto or navy
Put 'em on the side put 'em in the middle
Put a home grown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life that I lead
I'd be Johnny tomato seed
Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better
I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes

Mitch Greenhill,"I, I, I, I can paint a picture with a pen 
But a song will only scratch the skin 
And there are still places I haven't been 
Because I know what's in there 
Is already in the air
Oh yeah 
There's a storm on the way 
There's a storm on the way 
All right
There's a storm on the way, yeah

Oh

Here I come, I come, I come, I come

Hey, hey, hey
There's truth in the thunder 
Love in the lightning 
The feeling is frightening 
But isn't it exciting 
I'm something like stormy weather 
If I weren't we'd never 
Huddle together 
Do I have to tell ya 
That I'm also the sunlight 
That shines shortly after 
I just rain 'cause I have to 
On to other chapter 
I wish you lots of laughter 
Till the next time you see me 
Just remember you need me 
I'm the storm coming, coming, coming

So here I come, I come, I come, I come
Well come on!
Here I come, I come, I come, I come
Ah come on!

Run towards the hills 
To avoid the high floods 
I can do a dance that'll make the sky cry blood 
Skills provoking 
Seals to be broken open 
All that's left to do is try my love 
Woah

An I'm singing in the cyclone 
I'm writing a raging sea searching 
For a sign of the times 
Is it safe to say it's me 
Listen to our lives 
The wind will whisper the way it is 
I'm going to happen what a lovely day it is 

Don't ask why 
Just live

Mitch Harrell,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

And it's startin' to settle down
Here among the shadows of the evening
So I'm startin' to wonder about
The shape my soul is in
And they say only time will tell
But I say time will never take me
To that secret place I love
Where my mind is free to play with
Just what I might become
If I let go of everything that I've been holdin'
And I reach out for help

Because I, I can't get my broken heart to mend
The tears I cry, they never wash away my sin
All the strength I might find, will never heal
This soul of mine, only love will
Only His love will

So now I'm hopin' that the spirit
Will hang me out to dry
That I will listen and I'll hear Him
And He will draw me to His side
And when I press my heart to His
I will find my room to breathe
With the breath that comes from Heaven
And the peace we find in prayer
From a Grace that's oh so ancient
But still I know it's always here
To lift my mind above all I've been doubtin'
And move me toward belief

Because I, I can't get my broken heart to mend
The tears I cry, they never wash away my sin
All the strength I might find, will never heal

Often I feel so far away
And though dreams and wheels move me on
I pray my heart will always stay
Well within the sound of His voice of love
And my doubts come now and then
But peace has come forever more
And when I feel my faith is wearin' thin
He picks me up from the floor
And gives me strength to stand, when I think I can't

That's why He is the only thing I want to see
That's why I pray, I pray His love takes

There once was a farmer who took a young miss
In back of the barn where he gave her a lecture
On horses and chickens and eggs
And told her that she had such beautiful manners

That suited a girl of her charms
A girl that he wanted to take in his
Washing and ironing and then if she did
They could get married and raise lots of

Sweet violets
Sweeter than all the roses
Covered all over from head to toe
Covered all over with sweet violets

The girl told the farmer that he'd better stop
And she called her father and he called a taxi
And got there before very long
'Cause someone was doin' his little girl

Right for a change and so that's why he said
""If you marry her son, you're better off single""
'Cause it's always been my belief
Marriage will bring a man nothing but

Sweeter than the roses
Covered all over from head to toe

And started in planning for his wedding suit
Which he purchased for only one buck
But then he found out he was just out of money

And so he got left in the lurch

End of the story which just goes to show
All a girl wants from a man is his

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see

Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

With a corncob pipe and a button nose 
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know 
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic 
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head 
He began to dance around

Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play 
Just the same as you and me

So he said let's run and we'll have some fun 
Now before I melt away

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square 
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler Stop
For Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day

Mitchell Ayres,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Mitchell Ayres,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine

Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise

That day is past, you've gone away

Mitchell John,"Before you go walk out on me
Take a look around tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked
'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself a while
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
You could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart

So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best
If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake

If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake",For Old Time's Sake

What's really going on below

And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

Looking in yours 

And did you know the liberty bell is a replica 
Silently housed in its original walls 
And while its dreams played music in the night 
Quietly 
It was told to believe

And we're not going back 
And I've tried sharing and I've tried caring

But the boys boys boys keep coming on for 
More more more 
And change change change is gonna come, but 
When when when?

Dej√°ndome aqu√≠ solo
Regresa por mi, yo juro que te adoro

Y me dejas aqu√≠ solo
Yo te juro mi amor
Yo te juro que te adoro

Mi Sentimiento
Amarte y despert√©
Amarte y despert√©

He venido a pesar
De que duele
De tan solo pensar
Que me hiere saber
Que tu me enga√±asteis por primera vez
Despu√©s que yo, jure
Amarte y vine aqu√≠
A decirte adi√≥s
Y que los sue√±os solamente son
Sue√±os, y so√±√©
Amarte y despert√©
Vine a decirte adi√≥s
Y que los sue√±os solamente son
Sue√±os, y so√±√©
Amarte y despert√©

Yo dorm√≠a pero ya no duermo no
Yo tenia sue√±os contigo
Pero ya no
Y estoy buscando la manera de olvidarte
Qu√©date sola sufriendo sola, sola llora sola
La pagaras sola yo que no pens√© dejarte sola
Hoy te dejo
Me voy lejos

Vine a decirte adi√≥s
Y que los sue√±os solamente son
Sue√±os, y so√±√©
Amarte y despert√©
Vine a decirte adi√≥s
Y que los sue√±os solamente son
Sue√±os, y so√±√©
Amarte y despert√©

Lo serio
De tu amor se volvi√≥
Misterio
Y esta perdido
Todo cambio y estoy buscando la manera de olvidarte
Qu√©date sola sufriendo sola, sola llora sola
La pagaras sola yo que no pens√© dejarte sola
Hoy te dejo
Me voy lejos

Vine a decirte adi√≥s
Y que los sue√±os solamente son
Sue√±os, y so√±√©
Amarte y despert√©
Vine a decirte adi√≥s
Y que los sue√±os solamente son
Sue√±os, y so√±√©
Amarte y despert√©

Despertaras del sue√±o
Y te dar√°s cuenta de todo lo que has perdido
Es incre√≠ble saber que compartiste tu cuerpo estando conmigo

Don't hold back, baby throw it don't front it
Give it to me good like you friend, girl touch it
Run it, straight down the center like a sprinter
5-4-3-2-1 enter

[Verse 1]
They talks a lot about ya vibe, ya makin' me feel ya inner thoughts
MJG, want to dip in the sauce
Knock it off, fantasy scenes of me and you
Plenty other women that dream of being you
Cute face, good attitude, small waist
Girl ya number one in the race the rest chase
Baby first of all ya look at me close searchin' for lines
Thankin' that you can get in my mind, thankin' that I'm
A lightweight, left fly straight in one wait
Lay it down over the world in one date
Pure P-I-M-P-I-N-G
Both of us grown no need to pretend we
Ain't prepared for the houses with the marble floors
Three staircases with the antique doors
All day, valet hit the place your ride
With thirty-five rooms just in case you tired
Amazon, let's have a marathon in the bedroom
Come stout, 6'3"" with any leg room
I know what to do if ya know how to act
Now say it to yourself baby don't hold back

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
As we begin ya perfume clouds the room, Soft Rain
Sprinkle down homie massage away the pain
I been standin' here scopin' ya girl from across the club
Suave House outtas for real, show us some love
We can peel  off into the night and do it right
And leave two streaks in the street and we outta sight
Space-age, still don't nothin' move but the hits
So baby shake it to the front and the back right quick
Last call for alcohol, what do you prefer (Baby I don't drink)
Well that's cool what about hers
Swang it over to me sugar I don't need no slack
Let me see it, let me see it girl don't hold back

[Hook x2]

I see you lookin' at the ice
Thankin' bout a way to be my wife
Dollars signs in ya eyes, not tonight, skirt tight
To the hip, bend over bust a whole to the slip
Now mesmerized gauging at the lips on the tip, of that thang
Shaved down lookin' high hay
Freaky thoughts travel through my brain all day
Listen baby, when I saw you in that mini-skirt
It made me want to really go to work
Wonderin' could I get them legs straight up in the sky
Lay down and watch the silly fed blaze roll by
You and I kick back when we through gettin' high
Intoxicated folks don't lie, don't try
I can picture us posted in the bed buck wild
Humpin' like it's goin' outta style, stay awhile
Now smile, naw better yet say ahh
Do it in the back of a car like a star

MJG,"Ahh yeah mic check 1, 2

[Eightball]
It was some what early, I was on my way
To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I'm full of them trees
A dog want to hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please
These H-Town freaks be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin' on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin' machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin' grinnin'
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin'
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain't you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be
Imagine it, you and me, in the middle of the night

[Hook]
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really want to hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really want to hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night

[MJG]
I was chillin' at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I'm bored I ain't did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That's a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what's up
She said (What's on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We straight ya ain't gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin' at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin' there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she want to romance, did she want to hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin' on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin' on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I'ma be a lil' late gettin' in)
Now I was feelin' kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these windows is around
Let's me and you do what we gotta do to get through
The rest of this episode, hold on tight
Let's re-write in the middle of the night

[Hook]
[MJG]
I'm on late night mission top let down
That's the way I gotta flip when I be
Feelin' 'ike I want to take a dip in the wind
Night-life livin' all the way to the end
It's just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin' in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I'm gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin' in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin' in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin' out the few tail I'd like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin' out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees in a fresh set of keys
Now I'm fixin' to break em' to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I'ma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin' me off from my flight

I come and go and chill as I please 
160 miles per hour on Greentrees 
Really ain't no reason to try and pretend these 
Hoes ain't down and willin' to bend knees 
I ease 
Up off of my gas to smash brakes 
I'm gazin at a stout piece of ass at high stakes 
To make it to the top of my game what will it take? 
I gots to get some glue in my life  before I break 
Shake rattle and roll hold the dice until I can't 
It's time for G to toss up in the paint 
Pimpin' ass real nigga 
I squeeze big ass and big trigga 
And leave hard weak ass niggas in big rivers 
Who in the fuck got stuck you bucked and outta luck 
Lookin to find trouble with me, now that's enough 
Muthafuckas 
I torture yo ass and make you suffer 
I'm spittin real shit you false niggas can smother 'cause

T makes the beats that heats the whole streets 
If you got the time 
Fine I got the rhyme

I be the nigga who really don't give a fuck man 
Rough and tough I'm puttin strain on your weak game 
Hard and real dammit I never knew another way 
Rappin bout the shit that happens round a nigga everyday 
Life is hard and hoes ain't free, believe me 
Ask them real G's dying in the penetentiary 
Old and cold, ain't no love in the steel cage 
It's all about your freedom in this muthafuckin space age 
Some got chosen, some choose and lose 
Some pay dues, snooze, and lose what they choose 
I, be, PIMP NIGGA SUPREME! 
Invest some cream and straight sell a ho a dream 
Bust on wax and rip tracks by T-Mix 
Hated 'cause I talk real shit bout a freak bitch 
Peep this I don't give a fuck about what 
Somebody say they can die & suck a nigga nuts 
Cornbread fed south women luva 
Money-makin black fat muthafucka 
Can't no other duplicate mine 
It's all fine while we shine and recline 

[Chorus (2x)] 

[MJG] 
I'm pimpin hoes till they mind gone 
My rhymes on now where my money bitch? 
How many suckas you trickin and who you runnin with? 
Some stunnin shit you layin down with plain fools 
Her nigga want to send alumni back from school 
Who you rule? 
Not shit but yo mouth I brings proper shit to the ring 
But shit you wear straight stops muthafuckas 
Lookin for reason to start trouble 
You come with that shit 10 shots gonna bust yo bubble 
Like a teardrop 
I can't feel the pain, just my ears pop 
The bullet just an inch from your brain 
Live and he'll stop 
You talkin cash shit but you writin' them rubber checks 
And still don't know the way to commit with a brotha yet 
God Damn! 
Is this shit ham or is it Spam 
I thought I had a bottle of jelly and got jammed 
In the blender a million degrees 
Deep in December 
The flashbacks weakened your mind so just remember 'cause

Maybe them niggas don't let you slide, maybe they will
I'm sending back slugs to niggas that want to creep
The killer tried taking me thinking I was asleep

You think you livin' large you livin' a slim day
Ain't no motherfucker takin' the shit I worked fo'
See that's the reason niggas get killed and hurt though
Occupation is none, that nigga want to get a gun
Run up and try to get me lay down and get done
Weak bitch, I ain't got no time for cheap tricks
I'm looking through ya shit, I'm able to peep quick
Don't say that, dribble the niggas that try to fade me
First fucking possible chance they want to blaze me
Niggas who real and want to continue living
Put a cap in they ass if they try to catch you slippin'

They want ya money
They caught ya slippin' baby
They're gonna take it away from you, it's true
They saw ya coming
They got ya running and
Pulled out they're weapons, what are you gonna do

Damn baby it's raining harder than a motherfucker
Hurry up and open the door
Alright baby just don't slip
Shit, ooh it's wetter than a motherfucker, where's ya restroom
First door to the right
We still on for tonight baby
Yeah baby we still on
Oh damn baby, this is a beautiful home you have baby
Thank you baby, let me go get some music on
Come on out of the closet baby, he's in the restroom
Ahh, shit, I'ma beat the shit out this pussy tonight
Oh shit, nigga fuck you, fuck
Give me that motherfucking piece you got on nigga
Oh shit it ain't even gotta be like this brotha, fuck that shit
Nigga I want the motherfucking Rolex
Nigga I want the motherfucking Nikes you got on, ho
Ah shit, nigga fuck this bitch you fucking with ho
Nigga give me, nigga give me what ya got

I beat em' like they daddy never did
The same punk who took it too far when we was kids
The knife got stuck in his back, slick move
You robbed another brother so what did the shit prove
You breaking down killers in bushes when they be hiding
They make a sound, one hundred rounds, I'm landing five
In they chest plates, staying at home
It would've been a niggas best place
Shame to find they in a hurry for a death day
Stopping the heart of any attacker
Got his bitch want to ride with me, don't have to ask her
Bringing action to the field whenever you niggas ready
When you hear the rubber burn, I'm hanging up out the Chevy
With a straight aim, nigga I blew em' up out the frame
Street tops scattered with tricks with false game
You can't pull me off of my toes, I'm still tippy
Now play with ya life, than try to catch a nigga slippin'

That girl, that girl, that girl...

Say look at me baby, I've been looking at you too
Trying to understand the thing that you want MJ to do
Ain't it funny how the time easily slips away
I've been thinking about you sugar every moment every day
And we lay upon the beach we can each get cosy
On the other end where the people don't know me
Show me, any little thing that you feel like
Let me know the spot that gets you hot and make it feel right
Introduce some plans, to the elementary game
We can be connected with a number and a name
Strange how women make you chase them for awhile
Then when you approach them they get timid like a child
Ain't no sugar in my tank, no deductions in my bank
Never never, mad mad this steels to clever
But I'm trying to get her on a trip of my world
Seven days, six nights -- that girl

That girl, that girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

Take a nigga baby can we get out, go oversea
Don't mind at the house bring you body with me
I've been really taking notes on the way that you maintain
You're one out of akind entitled to the same thing
Opportunity knocks for you girl let it be
Yet it don't stop to the ?
I know you've wondering how long could it last
But trust in the future and let the day be the past
I'm taking you dancing, you've just got good legs
But all I vision is some real good times
That we could be having in the blink of an eye
Impossible dream we can achieve if we try
It's the brother who cut for youMentally and physically
What would it take for you, do you really want to get with G's
My mission to hold my angel my pearl
But we still live as strangers -- that girl

That girl, that girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I should surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

You look marvellous in your jeans, that queen
Thinking about the entrance you made at the club scene
You know you're looking goodSo I just let it ride
Too many in the hood that have already tried
They said you be looking for things I can't produce
Like a fast life, and quick dreams
To tell you the truth, competiton is blowing my hustle about position
Concidences keep us apart
It's hard to listen to somebody that you don't even trust
you don't know
Places that I want you to come, you don't go
Half all playing the game of cat and mouse
But before you start running your mouth or getting out
You don't want a man, you want somebody to play with
Knowing it's impossible for you to stay with
So real don't forget that I said
Probem is went to her head

That girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl) x2

I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)
I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
Girl if you don't want to (don't want to)
I won't force you (force you)
I want to find someone who wants to be right here right in my world
I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)

MJG,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

MJT + 3,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song
MK,"When I look back to before
We were together
There was no pressure
No blame, just pleasure
We were young, you took my breath and
Filled your lungs up
I held my tongue in
Swept up all your poison

You get high, act like
I need rescuing
You're walking on thin ice
You don't realise

I'm alright tonight, live your life
You can keep that piece of me
I've come through, I'll prove, don't need you
It ain't how it used to be
You lost out, and now I've found
That I don't need that piece of me I've lost

(You can keep that piece of me, yeah. You can keep that piece of me) 

Falling into emptiness
I've forgotten my mind
Faithless tears that I cried
I lost my whole life
Everything to live for now
I've shed my old skin
I thought I'd give in
But loving isn't losing

You get high, act like
I need rescuing

And the mighty fall

She was fresh off the plane
She whispered in my ear
‚ÄúBaby, come here. I‚Äôll do anything to make a name‚Äù

Honey, take my hand follow me ‚Äòcause
I don‚Äôt wanna hurt you but he does
I just wanna give you some real advice

Never take candy from a stranger
And keep your eyes open for danger

Never slip and nerver falter
Maybe that is just the power of love

Sit right there.

Picture you and me in a six four
In the back seat smoking on some bud
There some freaky little things going on in my mind
It's another crazy night in the N.O.
Girl I'm really not trying to make you rush
But picture you and me making love sometime

I've been digging on you since the twelveth grade
Kind of shy, didn't know what to say
You turned me on like a light girl
Yes you did, yes you did
You were a friend but you became part of me
Back in the day I know that it was meant to be
Time's have changed, now I'm a grown man not a kid
So what I'm saying is

Picture you and me in a six four
In the back seat smoking on some bud
There some freaky little things going on in my mind
It's another crazy night in the N.O.
Girl I'm really not trying to make you rush
But picture you and me making love sometime

Girl I'm on another level everyday
Making money, everybody knows my name
There ain't no limit to the things I can do for you
No, 'cause you've been down when I didn't have a dime
And on these streets you were my partner in crime
It's only right for us to do what we supposed to do
And if you, twose you have it all
Me and you baby ball until we fall
All you have to do is promise that you keep it real
Keep it real girl, I'll die for you, you die for me on everything
I'm your tomorrow, girl you'll be my destiny
Think about it, don't you doubt it girl do what you feel
And in the meantime

Picture you and me in a six four
In the back seat smoking on some bud
There some freaky little things going on in my mind

To a new pair of boots that she chewed in shreds.

Took half of my savings to save her, and I didn't think twice.

Just an old mutt riding shotgun, getting my seats all muddy.
Just the one who I come home to, just my best fishin' buddy.

We were walking that spring in the sand on the beach.
You know she was the reason, Amy walked up to me.
She lost her place on the couch, but she kept her cool.
She was crazy about Amy and she knew I was too.
And the night that girl left me, she kept me from losing my mind.

Goin' for the cash, and dash first chance available

Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane
Bone, II Tru, Hustla'z, and Shifters (We are the soldiers!)
Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets
Where they playin' for keeps, so fake soldiers...

Late hours of the eve

Gotta alleviate the problem before it even start
Sit relax and never losin' my composure
Brotha done told ya, better beware
'Cause this Mo Thug click got plenty of soldiers
Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die
Never esitate don't flip
I can pin you all in them disguises
So if you want to come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

[Jhaz]
why'all want no lovin' to a sister flowin'
Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

[Souljah Boy:]
It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)
With a MAC-10, reactin' like you really want to know what's happenin'
Down with buckin' why'all with me strap and best a be duckin'

I'm ridin' real; Mo Thug is where I be
I'm down with Ken
So put 'em up as I cock the pistols
Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many want to roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go
So let's make our dough, for sure

And handlin' them demons makin' me crazy
Knowin' that Gates can't be fucked with

Family never divided
You heard it before, but this time you can buy
Some bustas fell off, we leave 'em behind
I'm mean we tried, but they could not fall in line

Niggas is sure we got the real shit for ya
Never respect 'em ready to blow 'em out ya town now
Come on why'all we take a pow pow
That gauge that gauge we spray they lay they lay
What a wonderful day
Get up buck and fuck 'em on up
When they pull you to side and they tryin' to put the cuffs on
That's the perfect time to get it pump
Then you reach up in the glove
Hold your breath then get ya buss on
Let 'em feel the round
Or hear the sound
Of the twelve gauge eruption
Destruction we've made
Now the peelin' is through and we got your pay

Let me lean on in your mind
Hit you one time
See, here it's Ken rollin' off this Hen
I got to do this shit again for these niggas
Who didn't think Ken was bringin' work
But now I got your eyes open, now, busta, stay alert
Prefer to smoke that hitter
Yeah, wig splitter, take two hits and pass
'Cause it's that two hitter quiter
Did I hear a busta hatin'?
'Cause he's violatin'
Why I got playas all around in my face fakin'
Mistakin' me for a fake?
Playa knowin' I ain't
I can't do that type of sucka shit
'Cause I'm 'bout bank
Rollin' with a click that's straight puttin' it down
Playa get your smoke on to that Mo Thug sound, right

Nuthin' but the playa in me
It's nuthin' but the playa in me

[Ken Dawg]
You heard me puttin' it down from the see-Town
Playa, we heatin' niggas up, roll with click of playas
We're real street figures
Beat hustlas down if you ain't got my paper
And if there's no intention of payin' me
I'm a have to fade you, that's real
So, gon' and take it for what it's worth
Playa hatin' fellas on the outskirts
Mad a nigga done came up and did his thing
Now the topic of conversation is Ken Dawg
Now, playa, if you lookin' tight
Then I'm gonna give you P's
I wish all of the playa haters would follow me
Rollin' high, passin' by, my mind will fly
The stress is far behind, and don't ask why
I'm Ken Dawg, my brothers, don't I'm trying to deal
Every time I hit ya, I'm spittin' real shit
Real hits, so, why'all, go on and relax, (y'all)
All laid back in all them Cadillacs, right

Nuthin' but the playa in me
It's nuthin' but the playa in me

[Ken Dawg]
It's nuthin' but the playa in me at all times
I'm floatin' through the city in the droppin' twenty-five
I know why'all feel me
Don't spill the Henessey
'Cause then you're gonna have to see me
Naw, I can't get like that about no drink
But I can get like that about my bank
And I be sayin' shit to make these niggas flip the script

I'm in it to win it, don't be P.O.in' on me
Rollin' through this madness all lonely
Niggas is actin' phony
Don't be like them regular competitors
Stressin' 'bout them tricks on the regular
I'm Ken Dawg, I'm doin' it to you right (right)
Every time I put it down
It's all tight (it's all tight)
We all high, we all high

Mo Thugs,"[Intro:]
Two blocks from the war niggas die for that infantry
If I lay me down to sleep, I die for that S-see-T
Mo' murda's jumpin' on that Clairside for the late night
Rumors and war just cannot fuck with them soldiers, boy

[Verse 1: Tombstone]
Boy tried to ride, yeah he died
The trigger just slipped up under my fingertips
Now, another nigga dead
Cause that lead speak for itself
And murder be said, the nigga had me in red
But I be damned if the murder (...?...)
These warriors and rebels, we never failed to slug yet
Don't get get until we get the snitches that's hatin' the playas
Never knew Tombstone worked to slay ya
Trick ass niggas, we comin' to lay ya
Don't think po-po can save ya
The Yard's ready to grave ya
Snap, cripple, then I popped his ass, to whom it's concerned
The lesson to be learned
You'll get burned to a crisp
They cleanin' your urn
And you're about to achieve
But I'm sick and tired of you niggas talkin' shit
I'm sick and tired of you niggas startin' shit, rumors and war
Just cannot fuck when them soldiers, boy

[Verse 2: Gates]
Put 'em all in the dirt when my glock pop slugs
I'm slippin' up out this chamber
When my glock cocked, danger
This hustla, just givin' on up to the gangsta shifter
Clair soldier, gonna stalk ya, pulls the lever
Do a homicide, a murder,
That's the way Mo Thugs gonna serve ya
Ya takin' a buck and closin' that trunk
I'm sendin' that body to Hades
I'm slangin' mo slugs 'round Mo Thugs, bitch
These niggas, them crazy, insane, see
Is this nigga when I handle that chrome
We stayin' home to escape the murderous game
We pray them soldiers live another day

[Hook 1]
Hello, hello, infantry
You niggas can't fuck with the S-see-T's
This click too muthafuckin' strong
My niggas be thuggin' all year long

[Verse 3: Sin]
Straight for destruction, pray they comin' for eternal torture
Mental forces cold deformin' and then distortin'
Set a nigga up for a slaughter
Wicked illusions keep confusin', dilutin' my (rage...?)
Try to duck and dodge, don't never want to be a casualty
So, stop, take a breath
Brought a gauge
Cause a nigga be damned if I go back in that cage
Pump 'em off with a slug, I'm a thug
Got to buck 'em, coppers off in that grave
And it's much too late, I can't be saved
I tried to pray, so death is the only way
Deep in hell is where I stay
I suffer tortures, all them wars and stompin' soldiers
Infantry movin' in, then we come to destroy ya
Lure ya into a trap and snap that back
So ya better be equipped and pack that gat
Don't slack
Them skulls they crack and work in the dirt
Now my [party] laid back

[Hook 2]
We are Mo Thugs
Mighty, mighty warriors
Gauges loaded
Ghetto bound soldiers

[Verse 4: Flesh-N-Bone]
(Credit hustlas, them bouncin' the top)
I'm chillin' off on my block, feelin' nasty
Droppin' down to them SCT's
Pullin' triggers on bitches stay down on Double-glock
Me kill ya
Murder plots for the money, servin' em bloody mo redrum
Wet 'em in a battle, had a little nigga gun gun blast
Buckshot blows you too with a forty-four magnum
And it was laughin' at you
Mad for the dash for safety
Bet you this spray on this one in his head and gone
Runnin' through this Mo Thug town, dumpin' bullets
[check the time]
What the fuck? they want to test Flesh Bone
And I make 'em all bow down.
(?) givin' up (?) praise to the Wastleland
You see its so shitty when the people keep deep in the creep up
And make it, man
And if you claim you untame us, stay down for your shit
Let your nuts hang
Better believe a gang of Mo Thug-ass niggas
They true to this shit, let us reign home
My chrome, decapitate a playa hater, pap, pap
Peelin' is life, and I'm rollin
Always remember soldier boys

The word ""love"" is a hell of a word to be sayin'
You don't know how to use it with caution
It's a death-defying game to play
And when you're thinking of the one you want to get next to
Be sure it's a mutual feeling
'cause these are the words they'll say

""Hey, baby, you're the only one I'm on""
They kick a few lines from a slow song
having you thinking you got it going on so strong
And can't nothing in this world go wrong
They say, ""Baby, I'm yours
So go and close the bedroom door
Make sure the binds are closed""
Yo keep you comin' up out your clothes
The next day they don't know you no more
So, baby, take your time
Help me, ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you want to do me
It's so hard to find a one-of-a-kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled

Who do you love? (You have to ask yourself)
Is it someone you can count on?
Someone who's there for you
Someone who will be true
No matter what the situation may be
And are they sent from above?
This question is asked for a reason
'Cause some of them want to play
And then go their separate ways
And hey, these are the words they'll say

Ain't never had game, I shot real, shot real
'Cause complications in your conversation
So you know it ain't real, gotta be real
So why you keep fallin' for lames and games?
Shame shame shame
How many strippings you want to take
Until you learn the game's another definition for play?
So, won't ya ease-a your mind and block out all distraction
Take your time
Take your time
Slow down [slow down] your action
Ya see, 'cause that's your disaster

Take your time
Ease my mind (Baby, won't you take your time?)
