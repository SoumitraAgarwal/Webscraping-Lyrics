Madonna,"Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell 
But most of all because I love Thee, 
And I want so badly to be good

It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them eight o eight drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

The room is spinning
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But i'm a bad girl, anyway
Forgive me

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild

Madonna,"When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can’t get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
I’d write it again on the back of my hand,
And I know it sounds tragic

Feels like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love
(I’m addicted to your love)
(I’m addicted to your love)

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind
It’s like MDMA and that’s OK

Your name's like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don’t care if you think that I’m strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I’m ready to take this chance
I need to dance

Your name's like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

Madonna,"If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move
It seems to me is what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
Stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible

From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light
It seem to me is what you're like
The ""look but please don't touch me"" type
And honestly it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece

Madonna,"Dark eyes on a dangerous face you are a beautiful killer
We pass by the same old place you are a (beautiful killer)
You don’t have a life, you have blood on your hands
You can sleep at night and I don’t understand
I don’t know much about you are a wanted man

You can call my name and I’ll be a around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
'Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Do you know the reasons why you are a beautiful killer?
Hurt yourself but you never die, you are a (beautiful killer)
I like your silhouette when you stand on the streets
Like a samurai you can handle the heat
Makes me wanna pray for a haunted man

You can call my name and I’ll be a around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
'Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Can’t really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that’s what you been dreaming about
'Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

(Beautiful killer)

You changed the past
Good guys always finish last
What happens now?
I need to know how the story goes
Are we together?
I love you forever

You can call my name and I’ll be around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
You can call my name and I’ll be around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
'Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Can’t really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that’s what you been dreaming about
'Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

You’re a beautiful killer, but you’ll never be Alain Delon",Beautiful Killer
Madonna,"I miss your brain
The way you think
But I don't miss
The way you used to drink

I miss our talks
The Universal Law
You had a way
Of seeing through my thoughts

It's so confusing I thought I met my match
An intellectual would telling for a catch
You always said we be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forever more

Still I have no regret
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

I miss the country side where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times, I don't miss all of it

You wrote me poetry
You had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forever more

Still I have no regrets
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Yet I have no regrets
'Cause  I survived all biggest tests
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that had to end
I lost my very best friend (lost my very best friend)
Not gonna candy coat it
And I don't want to pretend

I put away your letter
Saved the best ones that I have
It wasn't always perfect
But it wasn't always bad

Still I have no regrets
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Yet I have no regrets
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I will not lie and I can't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that it had to end",Best Friend
Madonna,"When I move a certain way
I feel an ache I’d kept at bay
A hairline break that’s taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold

And pure so sure I’d struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark

See our hearts are intertwined
Then I’m free, free of mine
I’m falling free

And see our hearts are intertwined
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine

When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love

And when you lift you raise the sail
And then I’m free, free to fail
I’m falling free

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go

When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down

The face of God that stands above
Pouring over Hope and Love
That all of might, and life, and limb
Could turn around and love again

When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, free to go
I’m falling free

I’m falling
I’m falling
I’m falling free

I’m falling
I’m falling
I’m falling free

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go",Falling Free
Madonna,"Wake up ex-wife
This is your life
Children on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messengers, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass

I could take a helicopter

Who’s got custody
Lawyers suck it up
Didn’t have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on

All of this to impress
Ride my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone

Gotta get my money back

Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah we can run and we can hide
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we should travel all together

You tore me into pieces
You didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess

I curse the day we met
The memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

You sad I was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

You had a few secrets
I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know


I'm in the middle of hearbreak city
Now I'm in the middle of a world not pretty
I'm in the middle of heartbreak city

Madonna,"I live my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say ""told you so, told you so""
Why can't you be like the other girls
I said, oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever me
Thought I'd belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, oh no, I don't want it more
That's not what I'm looking for

So I took the road-less
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Deep down in the dust of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say look at you, look at you
Trying to be so provocative
I said oh yeah, that was me
All of the things I did, just to be seen",Rebel Heart

Madonna,"Life was so crazy
You've been through a lot
I tell you stories some times you know

Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize, my every single move
But then I realized, I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise, when I became the news

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark

I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

(Talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say your little prayer
Had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowing
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
And I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule of two 
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just you humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybpdy
And trapster, and rappers
Any politicians, beauticians, a musician
Anybody, so I'm anybodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, we either dead or in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messaiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

I hear you when I feel your touch
Whisper in my ears, make me blush
Feel the chill when we kiss, don't forget

All you had is dreams, don't hold back
All the fantasies you ever had
Just do what you like, go ahead
Close your eyes, make a wish, no regrets

I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

Surrender to the pleasure (wanting)
When we breath in together (waiting)
It's either now or never (for you)
This feeling will take over

No sex tapes, no camera (wanting)
Just you and me together (waiting)
Repeat it like a mantra (for you)

Life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
I'll tell your story sometimes, you know

Seem like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower East side
I threw my tag around, let b-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became my muse

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go)

Ooh I came, I saw, I conquered

I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I know I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (music saved my life)

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go)

Ooh, I came, I saw, I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowing
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
And I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule of two bigaloos
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just you humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
And trappers, and rappers
Any politicians, beauticians, a musician
Anybody, so I'm anybodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, we either dead or in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go)

Ooh I came, I saw, I conquered",Veni Vidi Vici [*]
Madonna,"In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between

Life is like a desert
An a oasis to confuse me
So I walk this razors edge
Will I stand or will I fall?

Turn a blind eye, try to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay or running away from all this madness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me

Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me

All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You could thread a needle with a teardrop from my eyes
It's a cruel injustice to be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer when it's right in front of me
From the Tower of Babylon where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me

Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me",Wash All Over Me
Madonna,"I'm under your spell
Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watch me burn with a fever that I love so much
You're watching me crawl
You get your kicks, take your fist
Put it right through the wall
The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil
Watch you slither away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But oh so divine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to a flame, I'm addicted to pain

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted, I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted, I'm, I'm addicted to the one that got away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark

You were gonna be the one who broke my heart

Madonna,"Just take me with all my stupid flaws
Changing me's like shooting in the dark
Patience please, I'll never be as perfect as you want me to
Believe me I want it just as bad
Forgive me, wish I could change the past
Take it 'cause I'll never be as perfect as you want

I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars

I love you the way that you are
With all my beautiful scars

Don't judge me, just gotta let me be
Accept me, although I'm incomplete
My imperfections make me unique that's my belief

I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
With all my beautiful scars

Never say never
Anything is possible
Always been a rebel
Overcoming obstacles
I can't give you perfect
But I can give you forever, oh ohoh

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars

Made me feel like I was born again

Built me up and I can do no wrong

I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble

I deserve the best and it's not you

You've broken my heart, but you can't bring it down
I've fallen apart, I was lost, now I'm found
I picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no

Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Sempre no mês do trigo

Que não fiquei Igual

Que em mim um país construí
E assim foi melhor porque
Não senti o medo

E a minha canção lá deixava ouvir
O vento no mar o mar a bramir
À minha canção
Chegava esse mar que eu canto

Lá por onde andei
Nem julgo saber a viagem é
Um só lugar mas onde eu cantei
Ficava um sabor a sal

Houve até um dia em que imaginei
Que sempre que eu vinha cantar
Vinha a maresia boa
Para me ajudar

E a minha canção lá deixava ouvir
O vento no mar o mar a bramir
À minha canção
Chegava esse mar que eu canto

E a minha canção lá deixava ouvir
O vento no mar o mar a bramir
Na minha canção

i falter in despair
i perish away in my taint of shame
lost, astray again...

lapsed in the enchantress mind
submissive, scorned with no will to find
she strangles me again...

asunder of the painful theft
theft of all i had
i feel so ashamed, embraced with hate
as death leaves me to wait...

and she makes me cry
and crumble like a child
i will no more endure
this rape so wild

lapsed in the enchantress mind
submissive, scorned with no will to find
she strangles me again...

i pray this stair to end
i can't go deeper

Hey, did I wake to find you cry, by my side
We'll never said that it would be easy
Just that the way love grows, we have to go to.

Oh well, hunny you, tonight
I'm here, tonight
Oh no, fall like a star
Oh in time, you and I, we'll shine

Oh now, hold your hand on running water
and now, wipe the black out of the blonde
Well now your head falls down on me

Or start it off again
There's no sign of weakness in me
Do I compel you like you compel me?
And nothing stays the same
And no one said it would
I would not think of such things if I could
If I could help myself,
If I could

So put your warm little hands where I can see them
Put those hands on my face
Tell me you love me
And no one else
Or close those little hands
Now they're fists
Now they're little fists

Punch a hole in me with those fists
If you ever wanted to punch a hole in me
And find out what's in me
There's really nothing in me

And nothing stays the same
And nothing ever happens to you that will happen to you again
Or is this the way it was?
Was it this same room, this same fight, this same scene?
With us dancing on the kitchen floor
And the wind climbing in through the open window

I used to hear distant cracks out in the city night
I could swear some one was being shot down
Now we hear that all the time

So do you like where we're headed?
Does it make sense in your eyes?
Do you miss me, baby, when I fall asleep?
Do you reach out for my arm?
Do you find it's too far away?
Do you?

Now tell me I'm handsome
I will tell you we are really not old at all
There's no use to complain

Still you and no one else

So put your warm little hands where I can see them
Put those hands on my face
Now if you get any out of this
Then that's the thing that makes me sleep all day

I try to pass just out of reach
To reach conclusions that can't be concluded

Adjust to what it takes

Madvillain,"As luck would have it, one of america's two most powerful villains of the next decade is turned loose to strike terror into the hearts of men

Who shock women into uncontrolled hysteria

""don't touch that!""

The villains themselves were ultimately responsible for much of the popularity
Audiences loved to hate
The importance of the villain was not overlooked, of course one of the worst of all was madvillain
They had no code of ethics

""what's the matter, a guy was only tryin' to have fun-""
""get to work on these boys, anybody bring a gun for me?""
""yeah here's one.""

Not one but two - typical villain releases included

""I know they wanna kiss me, but don't let anyone see me like that - please doctor help me!""

And a sequel

""master of all-""

Both the villains were to meet in

""your mother was the lightning!""

Two historical figures, outlaws and desperadoes if that
The villainous pair of really nice boys who just 
Happened to be on the wrong side of the law
Three hundred and sixty degrees
Similar sequences could not be defeated
Villains who possess supernatural abilities 
Villains who were the personification of carnage
Madvillain, more accurately, the dark side of our beings
Perhaps it is due to this seminal connection 
That audiences can relate their experience

Then it's last down, seven alligator seven, at the gates of heaven

The wind, it blows colder now, colder now,
The clouds are raised,
The rain, it falls harder now, all around..

You come over unannounced,
Silence broken by your voice in the dark,
I need you here tonight, 
Just like the ocean needs the waves
Fall around me now,
And like stars that shine and brighten the way,
I need you here tonight just like this night it needs the rain.

Over unannounced, silence broken by your voice in the dark,
I need you here tonight,
Just like the ocean needs the waves,
Just like the stars that fall around me now..",Ocean
Mae,"I read the news today 
Oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the house of lords

I saw a film today 
Oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I love to turn you on

Woke up
Got out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, and somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four-thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small, they had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I love to turn you on",A Day in the Life [*]

Mae,"These lights and numbers are a bright sign
Smoke-filled casinos, but what do we know we'll take a chance
Looking for cheap thrills and fast rides
Spin till we're dizzy, the gamble, the sleep and now we dance

We stumble up and down the concrete
Led by distraction, the empty attraction keeps us blind
Never intending for the complete
Like shadows and alleyways, the unknown continues biding time

We're chasing heaven as it fades into black
Can't get it back, no, we can't get it back
It's like we're running crazy 8s around the track
Can't wait to come back, can't wait to come back

[Chorus]
Could you stay with me tonight?
We sleep for dreaming and away it goes
And I'll make you believe one last time
And let you feel it as my heart explodes

We sit and drink up on the cop car
Playing illegally, the boredom of fantasy, we're done
I've never, ever loved you so hard, but is that reality
We can't face the battle in the dark

We're chasing heaven as it fades into black
Can't get it back, no, we can't get it back
It's like we're running crazy 8s 'round the track
Can't wait to come back, can't wait to come back

[Chorus x2]

We sit, we think, and we figure out just right where to start
As these waters rush together, we keep ripping them apart
Is this truth? Is this real? Is there something more to feel?
Do we chase the sensation of lying uphill?
Have we now reached the end...just to find the beginning again?

[Chorus x4]",Crazy
Mae,"Now I've been sneaking out your back door
Since I can't remember when
And thinking about the world I didn't know
But now I find I'm in the thick of it

And feeling so alone
I'd take a chance
Just one more chance
To get me anywhere
Been running down any road but home

[Chorus]
I know I'm running and I'm moving too fast
So we will go home
And where I'm headed to it's nobody's guess
So we will go home
So when we go home

I saw the map like any other one
I cannot find and follow lines
That led me to question

But I can see it in the symmetry
It's what was really always meant to be
The singularity is clearer from the distance
So I'd die here to fall in love with home

[Chorus]

Staring into mirrors
Lost in the design
Believe in dreams 
And wait for signs

You will always find me
When I run away
But I will not slow down until I make it back into your arms

[Chorus x2]",Home
Mae,"Tonight I dreamt we found a fair of wonders
Where the future and the past cannot contain
We were greeted by a spell that took us under
And laid down in a field that revelades 

To meet you in this dream we share I believed a perfect pair
Oh but I was wrong
This fair comes with a price because tonight I'll wake up twice and
Both times find you gone

[Chorus]
Reflection 
Is all we have and when it's over
Reflections 
Of the path that sends us searching over and over again

Too quick to fall asleep again to find you
I'm rushing through a dream I can't control
This house of mirrors beckons us to walk through
But instead again I have to let you go

Stuck here in this stare revealed beyond the glare
Again you're gone
So throw a stone through these reflections scatter light in all directions
And sing this song

[Chorus]

Where does the physical meet with the spiritual?
Is this the typical question?
But down below and up above
It looks the same so I'm not sure of anything
Where will love come from again?

[Chorus x2]",Reflections
Mae,"Once alone and too afraid of strangers knocking on my door and
Well you came in I knew you'd win 
I was sitting on the front porch swinging
And waiting

I tried walking with you in mind
But looking down saw my feet were tied
Got to thinking that how easy it could be
But then the fear and the chains became a part of me
And waiting

[Chorus]
Always waiting
For my ride to pick me up on my time
Seems I'm staying 
As the others cross the finish lines
I could break into day I could set into speed
But to tell you the truth I'm always waiting
Always waiting

Caged in like the beautiful view
And I was waiting for the night when I could soar with you
But when you picked me up released me to fly
I found I couldn't hold my own wings dry
And waiting

[Chorus]

Don't want to fly

[Chorus]

Always we must find our ways
Always
All I could do was drive away
Always",Waiting
Mae,"I'm not supposed to miss you, cause you're not coming back. And I wish I never kissed you, so what do you think of that? What did I get myself into? 
In the back of my mind there will always be the catch and throw away.
But this moment's got me thinking I could reach you. And I'm waking up alone and echo the song sung yesterday and begging you to come back home.

Cause you're my boomerang. My repititous twist of fate. But unexpectedly this time you don't come back to me. Still you go on and on for someone else.

This back and forth gets me going around and round. And I'm so worn out and dizzy while you knock the good ones down. Now I want to know the truth- do you even miss you?

Cause in the back of my mind I could always feel the push and pull away. And now I can see that you were leaving me. 

When you're my boomerang and I tried so hard to make you stay. Without a doubt I see this time you won't come back to me. 

So fly, fly, fly like a bird in the atmosphere. Glide, glide let the breeze you're feeling take you there. Fly away from me. 

In the back of my mind there'll always be the catch and throw away. But this time I'll let it fly and not try to reach you. Because getting up alone will help me grow my own pair of wings and the time has come for me to fly. 

Oh boomerang,I'm down to let you go, cause you're my boomerang. And the fun we had was all in vain. But unexpectedly this time you won't come back to me. Still you go on and on for someone, go on and on for someone else. 

Fly, Fly, Fly like a bird in the atmosphere. Glide, glide let the breezed you're feeling take you there. Ride, ride on the wind the gets you out of here. Fly away from me.

Mae Barnes,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Mae McKenna,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away

To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love

No hell below us

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

But I'm not the only one

And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

Mae McKenna,"You think you know me pretty well,
But how can you tell,
You never get inside my head.
The times we talk, we never speak,
We play hide and seek
So many things are left unsaid.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Sweet thoughts and dreams,
Like drops of rain on rippling streams
That wind and bend,
Rivers with no end,
Flowing on the other side of me.
 
It seems I always get unstrung
I trip on my tongue
With words that come out something else.
I'm so afraid the things I say
Might chase you away,
I have to hide behind myself.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Why must I hide
These feelings that have been denied.
Only you can set me free

Mae Moore,"Like driving rain on parched dry land
I fell hard against your grace
Nowhere to run, no hiding place
Hard as truth having to face you
I've drank so much from the glass of life
Made up my mind this time to do it right
I'll save it all for you, I'll pay your price
Some things you just don't sacrifice

If I could see, into the blue
I'd still give everything to you
And it would be, yes it would be because of love

There have been times, I know I've moved too slow
But I'll cover the distance, now here we go
Watch me fade in the afterglow
Where it ends, I don't know
But we've got a chance and that's all we need
We only need one thing if we really believe
And I do, you know I do
Could you believe it too

If I could see, into the blue
I'd still give everything to you
And it would be, yes it would be because of love
This mystery wrapped up in you
When it begins to all come true
Then it will be,  yes it will be because of love

I may be wrong but that's alright

Mae Moore,"I missed the bus, yeah, I did it again
That's when I first me the Parisian
Poet, angel it was his idea
I take my place in Bohemia
I've got a view nobody's seen
I read Burroughs but I keep it clean
I go places inside my head
With an eye on tomorrow to keep my soul fed
I came here of m own accord
I came to witness the unexplored
Green valleys and a fertile sea
I came to rediscover the real me
I like it here at least so far
I've got no plans of saying au revoir
Elevated visions when I close my eyes
Stretched out underneath these amaranth skies
Make me feel...
Closer than I've ever been to being alive
Since I've arrived in Bohemia
Late afternoon is a time to dream
I like to listen to Coltraine's ""A Love Supreme""
Then I leave my rented room and I walk
Through the fading light down streets that talk
I always meet someone I could call a friend
Prejudice is something we must transcend
Coming into season this world will flower
With the power of love, not the love of power
And I feel, closer than I've ever been
To being alive since I've arrived in Bohemia
Independent spirit... temper us inside
With the strength to live a life fulfilled
And not denied.",Bohemia
Mae Moore,"Remember when we walked along down by river's end
Past the shops now long closed down, walk with me again
Wrap this night around your memory and close your eyes
Can you feel the Russian wind blow through the city sky?

Fall with you
(High above the ground)
Leaves spiral down and I
Drift and fall with you

And when it rains a grayer canvas, you have never seen
Stand beneath this canopy of crimson laden green
Wait inside the shadow cast by summer's long retreat
Walk with me back along this late September street

Fall with you

Leaves spiral down and I
Drift and fall with you

For I'm always so alone

And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,

I want to see what it feels like to be without you
I want to know the touch of my own skin
Against the sun, against the wind

I walked out in a field:
The grass was high, it brushed against my legs
I just stood and looked out at the open space
And a farmhouse out a-ways
And I wondered about the people who live there
And I wondered if they were happy and content
Were there children and a man and a wife?
Did she love him and take her hair down at night?

If I stray away too far from you
Don't go and try to find me
It don't mean I don't love you
It don't mean I won't come back and stay beside you

To a place where I used to always go

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Mae Robertson,"Once upon a time in a far off land
Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand

Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash these tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles

Bands a make her dance, molly make her lose them underwear
Booty cheeks, I'm geeked, (you know it) all her friends are freaks (you know it)
And I think she love me, I've been hitting it for a week (swish)
I drill it, slap it silly, need a super freak like Ricky
I'm Rick James bitch, I slip myself a mickey
Got so much money in my pocket
With a real bad chick from the tropics
With silicone racks with a real big ass
Make her bounce it like hydraulics
Kevin Hart, I got purple on the plane (we smoking)
Let's call a bull (let's go), let's run a train (trippy)

Maelo Ruiz,"Regalame una noche
Donde te entregues toda
Que solo sea la luna
La que acompañe la pasión

Que el fuego de tu cuerpo
Caliente aquí en mi pecho
Y con tus furias ganas
Perdamos la razón

Regalame una noche
Que no termine nunca
Donde el cansancio sea
Solo el vencedor

Saciandonos de ganas
De pasion y locuras
Cumbriendonos la piel
Solo con el amor

Que el dulce néctar de
Tus labios me embriague
Y añejes como el vino
Tu amor para mi

Y te entregues
Como una fiera salvaje
Y rompas las cadenas
Del amor con loco frenesí

Regalame una noche

Regalame una noche
Que solo sea derroche
Que el tiempo se detenga
Solo para los dos

Y cuando nos amemos
Y todo allá acabado
Sellemos con un beso
Esta entrega de amor

Regalame una noche
Que no termine nunca
Donde el cansancio sea
Solo el vencedor

Saciandonos de ganas
De pasión y locuras
Cumbriendonos la piel
Solo con el amor

Que el dulce néctar de
Tus labios me embriague
Y añejes como el vino
Tu amor para mi

Y te entregues
Como una fiera salvaje
Y rompas las cadenas
Del amor con loco frenesí

Muchacha me regalara una noche mas",Regálame una Noche
Maelo Ruiz,"Desde esa noche
Cuando fuiste mía
No tengo vida
Sin tocar tu cuerpo

Tomo el teléfono
Intento hablarte
Pero repica
Nadie me responde
No se donde estas

Tal vez haciendo
Lo mismo con otro
Haciendo cosas
Que jamas soñara

Y mientras tanto
Me vuelvo loco
De pensar cosas
Me pongo nervioso

Y al final, mi deseo
Me brota por la piel
Deseo tus besos
Con sabor a rosa

Deseo tenerte
Aquí una noche mas
Y hacer maravillas
Con tu cuerpo, sin parar

Deseo la prisa
De esa noche loca
Deseo el perfume
Que quedo en mi piel

Y este amor prohibido
Me desata, mas placer

Sacame de esta locura
Ven desatame
Con tu ternura

Deciframe este
Sentimiento
Que has dejado en mi

Siento que
No es solo sexo

Deseo tus besos
Con sabor a rosa
Deseo tenerte
Aquí una noche mas

Y hacer maravillas
Con tu cuerpo, sin parar
Deseo la prisa
De esa noche loca

Deseo el perfume
Que quedo en mi piel
Y este amor prohibido
Me desata, mas placer

Maelo Ruiz,"Que es lo que estoy pidiendo 
Que tu no puedas darme 
Dime si no merezco que me quieras, 
Como te estoy queriendo 
O talvez no tengo razones para merecerme ser tu dueño 
O dime si es que a mi me faltan requisitos 
Para romper el hechizo estar de este mundo 
Y robarte un beso 
O dime si es que a mi me faltan requisitos 
O no tengo derecho a quedarme preso sumido en tus besos 
Que yo soy buen muchacho y tu no te das cuenta 
Lo que estas perdiendo 

Siempre espera y espera déjame pensarlo 
Ya no va ese cuento 
Y juégate a la suerte conmigo, 
Juégate a la suerte

Que yo nací solo para quererte, 
Hay juégate a la suerte conmigo 
Que estoy desesperado tan enamorado termina tu juego

Que al fin de cuentas 
Nadie sabe lo que es bueno hasta que lo pierde

Se que algún día
Te hará falta mi amor

Te equivocaste al elegir entre el y yo
Pero te vas arrepentir la vida entera

Te va doler, tarde o temprano ya veras lo que te toca
Cuando tu piel ya no le existe y te abandone
O al descubrir con amargura
Que tiene a otra

Te va doler como me esta doliendo ahora
Que me dejas
Pero este amor no ha de durarme para siempre

Sobran las palabras y grita mi ser 
Que es obvio el amor que está dentro de mi 
Estas ciega mi amiga y no lo puedes ver

Contigo aprendí a vivir 
Este amor en silencio cada anochecer 
No ves que de rodillas estoy diciéndote 
Tu beso en mi mejilla desgarra mi piel
 
Amiga te pido que te quedes un poquito mas presiento 
Que voy a decidirme a decir la verdad amiga 
Más late el corazón si estoy cerca de ti 
No miento y él sabe que yo a ti no te podría mentir

Que este amor se crece y tanto me hace daño 
Me duelen tus besos como tus abrazos 
Yo te quiero amiga como una mujer 

Para poseerte y para acariciarte 
Y hacer el amor contigo cada instante 
Si miran mis ojos verán tu reflejo 
Y esa indiferencia a mi me va a matar

Maelo Ruiz,"Y por qué? 
Preguntaste nerviosa cuando me aleje

No lo se 
Respondí sin saber y en silencio llore

Y viví
Lo más lindo de todo aprendí
Emociones, amor, desamor 
Penas y alegrías todo disfrute

Regrese
Porque a pesar de lo lejos serias para mi 

Al final
La distancia no importa si he vuelto por ti

Un día más

No, si te vas yo me muero no
No, por amor de Dios quédate a mi lado 
No, tú eres lo mejor que yo
Te encontré en la vida 
No te dejo escapar

No

Que en mi ausencia de otros labios ella puede beber

Pero se
Que mi nombre en su pecho grabado deje

Que lo nuestro lentamente iba terminando 
Hace tiempo lo sabia pero no quería creerlo
Yo decía que sin ti no viviría 

Llorare por si te vas un día 
Llorare por si no estas mañana 
Quédate al menos en mi mente 
Quédate un día en mi presente

Llorare por si te vas un día 
Llorare por si no estas mañana 
Quédate al menos por un día,un día
Un día solamente un día 

Anda tu a saber que cosas tiene el destino 
Que cuando menos lo piensas rompe un cariño
Y que frágil es la vida no consigo comprenderte
Por que sigo de ti estando enamorado 

Llorare por si te vas un día 
Llorare por si no estas mañana 
Quédate al menos en mi mente 
Quédate un día en mi presente

Llorare por si te vas un día

Si alguien te lastima debes pensarlo dos veces
Y al final de cuentas paga la misma moneda

Olvido con olvido se paga (nanana)
Amor con mas amor se devuelve

Me diga ya no manda
Pero si ami me duele te duele
Me entrego hasta que el corazon me diga
Ya no mas, pero si ami me duele te duele

Que a ti tenia que hacer pensar que si me lastimaste
Tenia que curarme solo las heridas super que el
Amor fue solo de mi parte como no arrancarte
Lejos de mi vida si tu amor me ah dicho basta el mio
Te hará la despedida

Hallo escondido algún recuerdo de los dos

Una carta con tus palabras
Y la canción que día a día me cantabas 
Cuando me hacías el café cada mañana
Un perfume sobre mi almohada
Tú silueta de madrugada
Y el sabor de tantos besos que me dabas
Están prendidos para siempre aquí en mi alma

[ VERSE 1 ]
As I walk into the room, it's easy to assume
A brother like me loves the girls with a boom
Coolin with my fellas, talkin how we makin ends 
Walkin through the 'valley of the skins' like my nigga Trendz
Seen a hot dame, I had to kick game
Not a regular type of hottie I be seein on the train
Voluptous, I was presumtuous
So I had to step up, step up, step up to this
She said, ""You can't handle this
I'm livin far from scandalous
I don't drink beers, don't smoke cannabis
Don't need a man for shit 
I'm an independent chick
Salt-N-Pepa type of heffa, yeah, I'm on my own dick
Never actin pompous, I'm strictly conscious
Got goals in life that I'm tryin to accomplish
A real good looker, far from a hooker
My first name's Brown and my last name is Sugar""

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 2 ]
You shoulda seen it, hops, she raised my eyebrows
The way the titties went bang and that ass went pow
She said, ""My hair's always done, nails always polished
Got knowledge, plus I go to a all-girl college""
I had to step in and started tellin her
""Baby look, all-girl college pussy ain't no better than the regular""
( Laughter ) She started laughin and said I was cute
But I ain't cute, you're cute with that skin-tight suit
You see what I'm sayin, I wasn't sweatin her
But my game was on point cause I was gettin her
Wettin her, lettin her
Check me out with her retina
Scopin that ass just like a predator
She said, ""Wes, you're a real cool brother
Damn, why didn't I met you earlier this summer?""
I asked why, she said, ""You got mad flavs
But I'm goin back to college and I leave in two days
But don't get me wrong, word to my moms
I'll be back for Thanksgiving, so you know I put you on""
You know I had a front like I was chillin
But deep down inside ""Let's hit in now, money, fuck Thanksgiving""
I said, ""Baby doll, don't play 
You know a brother like me gives thanks every day""
She said, ""Don't even try it, I'm far from a hooker 
My first name's Brown and my last name is Sugar

[ CHORUS ]
	No additives, no preservatives 
	Strictly 
	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)
	A granulated, often imitated, never duplicated brown
	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)
	No saccharin, no equal or sequel
	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)
	A granulated, often imitated, never duplicated brown
	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)
	That's right

[ VERSE 3 ]
She said, ""Wes, don't look at me as just sexual
I mean, I know I look good, but shit, I'm also intellectual
I caught ya peepin my behind
But we got so much in common, let our minds intwine""
""I hear what you're sayin,"" is what I told her
""And it seems like you got a good head on your shoulders
And yeah, I must admit that your style's slick
But fuck that Janet-Jackson-Let's-Wait-A-While shit""
She said, ""The more we talk, the more I'm with this
But don't get me mixed up with all these other bitches
I just met you, I ain't with it, but I'll admit it
When I come back I might let you hit it
I can't play myself and look soft
Cause in 1994 you know I'm comin off
I got my act down pat, proud of bein black
Don't need a nigga for jack, and my pockets stay fat
A real good looker, far from a hooker
My first name's Brown and my last name's Sugar""

Maestro Fresh-Wes,"[Chorus]
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock rock
To the beat that I drop when I flip my hip-hop
Put this in yo' collection
Fresh Wes without a rhyme is like certs without the retsyn

I'm coming straight out of Canada
Far from an amateur
LT's my DJ, Flex is my manager
I flow so nice so they're calling me the Maestro
Just pass the microphone
Fuck the light show
Real rap is in effect
And I'm out to get wrecked on the mic-mec
When I make a mic-check
Not on the sloppy tip
I'm harder than a hockey stick
Exciting niggas like Italian's in a Rocky flick
Adrian
Watch me flow slow or flow fast
I'll even make a Spanish brother say no mass
I'm wrecking you, disconecting you, disrespecting you
Hold your smoking ass cheap shit, it'll eventually catch up to you
I can make the phony retire, tendoroni perspire
She's on my back like my name's Jacobey and Myer,
(what's your name?)
It's Fresh-Wes with the sweeter beats
I make you smile like the brother on the red box of cream of wheat

[Chorus]

I got more rhymes than Brits in a cathedral
My cerebral is lethal
Nobody's equal, my people 
Want to hear a funky new style so get with it
No dibby-dibby-dibby MC's are permitted
I'm wrecking it good
(what else)
Collecting, injecting, and checking it good
(where?)
Lake Edna or your neck of the woods
I'm getting more blow than Chuck Mangeony
Not a phony
But Joanie wanted me for holy matrimony
Girls like my flavor cause I jam harder
Let's have a nice quiet date
You, me, and my camcorder
It's like a power-burst, I'm more than just an hours worth
I get down and dirty, but uh honey
Take a shower first
You can't tell me that the bro's soft,
I do the cabbage patch, butterfly, and boggle with my clothes off
But that's a different chapter
I've even got more rhymes than there's groupies of Jack the rapper,
On the microphone I slice you and make you say
(I knew his rhymes was phat, but his beats are kind of nice too)
Now is the apocolypse
MC's are clocking this
They say they got skills but all I'm seeing is a flock of lips
Acapella, or over a drum track
I'm funkier than a group of Jamacians after sun splash

[Chorus]

The word Maestro is teacher in Italiano
I'm from Toronto, causing drama on the the verazono
So come and check a real pro
Grab the piece of steal, yo
I make a Black activist say
(yes, that's my neigro)
When I said the mic's my piece I really meant it
So just like the Blue Jays, I'm out to win the pennant
So sucker chill, 'cause every head I struck I killed
Oh, I don't know, is it just me, or am I really that fucking ill

[Chorus]",Certs Wid Out da Retsyn
Maestro Fresh-Wes,"My rhymes are stinging like a killer bee
My cometition are wishing that killing me
For my similies and solioquies
They garbage, but I'm the largest
With the hardest style to disregard
Check your cartridge, on your tech-niques
Wes speaks, over the best beats
Fresh until the next week
I'm outlandish, I bandage the mic bringing anguish
I'm sturdy when doing the dirty language
And, it's time for me to raise my velocity
No animosity, my philosophy's a prophecy
Hipocracy, no that's the cameleon
How old are you evenin ?, they rhyming like comedians
They make me laugh because they styles are scrupulous
My body is my temple, my brain is my nucleus
A great exapmle of Allah's perfection
You're moving to the sounds of my fat selection
I'm simply spectacular, smooth like an Acura
Yo, check my vernacular

You need to devote more
Time into rhyming if you're hoping for dope scores of folklore
Creating a style and grow with it
Be prolific don't solicit
Be scientific, if it's wack go visit
The department of labour, the harder flavour
You can't savour, do rap a favour be a waver
In the front row, where the stunts go
'Cause the chumps know you can't flow
Plus, you're too gun ho
My rhymes are bionic, far from demonic
My phonics are supersonic, you're embryonic
I spray you like insecticide or pesticide
Let's decide the best vibe for Wes to ride
Cool, time for me to synchronize bass and highs (for my enterprise)
I'm simply spectacular, smooth like an Acura
Yo, check my vernacular

Break it down
I'm smoother than the Philharmonics with my killer phonics
And melodic, shit I'm fucking iller than a fill of chornic
On the streets I'm known, I use a sheet to bone
On the sneak, Dominique Simone
Thicker than Hagan Dasz, bitches stop and pause
Niggas stocking yards, pass me cars, I'm knocking jaws
Biter flee, recognizing me
Wrecking title gee, 'cause inside of me is like Hepatitis be	
I'm a whirlwind, fireballs I'm hurling and swirling
No discussion, I'm crushing walls of Berlin
Seen many thesauruses, pleny clitoruses
Ready to score with this, huh, packing punch like Terry Norrises",Check My Vernacular
Maestro Fresh-Wes,"Yeah, going out to all my peoples, you know what I'm saying
Now move to a higher level, I'm sprint
First I inhale, then I exhale Allah's name
You never see me pointing to the next male
Never seen me judge my 'cause, I'd rthter show love
'Cause poverty's got a grudge and the grudge won't budge
But nigga's gotta do what a nigga's gotta do
What's nigga gotta do to make dough and watch the zeros grow
I'm working hard, I make a beat I make a rhyme
Trying to make a dime, black man change your state of mind
Peace! to PE, BDP and X-Clan when I give a pound
It's never with my left hand
Styles are living long, you know my word is bond
'Cause my rhymes are cock strong
Like the fruit of Islam, word to God yo
Times is hard yo
I'm just a regular brother coming straight out of Scarborough
Fresh Wes'll never perpetrate and be a gun man
That shit'll be funny like Aaron Hall catching a suntan
I just be myself, maintain my health
Concetrate on my wealth, 'cause you know I go for delf
G-O-D's the only one who dictates
And before I plant seeds you know I got to get my shit straihgt
Concrete jungle's could trample
A little nigga without a father figure, or an example to follow
Young minds are getting swallowed by the devil
We got to help the youth, elevate to a higher level

No shackles on my mind, no shackles on my mind, no shackles on my mind
I ain't blind, I know the time
No shackles on my mind, no shackles on my mind, no shackles on my mind
I ain't blind, I know the time

Check it
I made a record hitting hard like a wall
I say without togetherness we got nothing at all
Progess will stall, the blackman will fall
And if you don't believe me, check the Final Call
I'm getting bolder 'cause I'm getting older
Some say I told ya, I known he had a chip on his shoulder
Nah, I love my people like a passion
Give me the opportunity, I write about unity
The community will prosper, or should I say grow
When brothers and sisters know the right way to go
I make beats and I'm all about peace
Refuge is what I seek from anxiety and grief
My mind stays focused, my vision stays clear
I concentrate on my career, successs is near when I say my prayers
I take a deep breath, I'm tired of being oppressed
I always try my best, Fresh Wes won't stress
I'm sharper than a shank, rhyme's heavy like a tank
I want to put my money in a blackman's bank
Point blank, I even met Queen Elizabeth
(You didn't bow did you Maestro?)
Money don't be ridiculous
That's some silly shit, you know she ain't significant
I only got to bow to Allah the magnificant
Through bass and treble, I never back peddle
Side step the devil and move to a higher level

""We be living in darkness""
""We be living in darkness""",Higher Level

Can you dig it? (I can dig it), can you dig it? (I can dig it)

You niggas can't rap, so I want my money back
Can you dig it? (I can dig it), can you dig it? (I can dig it)

Yo, I walk tall like Hanibal Adley
Hit a grand slam like my man Don Mattingly
Come prepared if you ever try to battle me (why)
I got rhymes coming out my anal cavity
Straight outta Scarborough
Ready to swing blows, niggas want to quit
Wash my nuts and my windows
I'm on your tape decks, rhyming to my apex
If a nigga don't like he can bite me with a latex
Because when I'm rhyming, heads are declining
Like Brian Mulroney, niggas are resigning
Competition ain't in front of me
Maestro where'd you get all these dope rhymes from?
I don't know, they just come to me
You fucking with a crazy brother
I don't kiss and tell, but I know your baby mother
I ain't bullshitting
Mmm, why did Gill cook a mean Curry Chicken
Time for me to get mad check(?)
So wack motherfuckers step to the left
I'm fat like a Cadillac, cut like a battle axe
I got crazy freaks, wash from BC to Halifax
Yeah, now the Maest is known
This beats alright, but now I thknk I want a xylophone
With my cipher grown, many mics are blown
You're in the Maestro zone
Now I gotta flow, hurdle any obstacle
Rhyme to show, and clock the dough
So many people try to stop the bro
But I smoke competition like an octago(?)
It's Maestro!, Fresh W-E-S big up to fly Ju(?) and my nigga big Jess
Yes, my peeps from 1-6-2
I met her last summer on Jamaica Avenue
Now every beat I made is a hit
But tell me, how many styles can one nigga flip?

Yeah, ha ha

From the lungs of the Maestro, hail the funk hail the phelgm
Niggas getting grim every time I begin
To bring the funk to radio stations to bump me
You should have never let my ass into your country
Word to God, I'm real hard
I'm even deadlier than Tony Montana with a green card
Fuck you and your demo tape
Instead of tryin' to imitate, innovate
I pull the mic but I don't pull cards
Bust your ass plus Julio down by the schoolyard
Don't try dissing me, because your style is history
I'm packing more flavour than the kernel's(sp?) rotisserie
I injure bone and I injure limbs
I've come a long way like Virgina SLims
I do a show with the Bandstand, never met the sandman
Chicks with the big tits give me a gland stand(?)
Older broads want to jock me, Elanor from Fox wants my rock
Let me stop, and burn styles
Chumps want to turn wild, you say you got dope
But why was your pops jumping turnstiles
You ain't got money 
I'm so dope, this shit's funny
All my jams is the shits
But tell me how many styles can one nigga flip?

Yeah, 1994 baby

[Maestro Fresh Wes]
First I learn to crawl, then I learn to walk
Then I learn to talk, then I learn to rhyme
Suckers try to hock my lines
But I'mma serve ya
On the microphone I murder
Killing chump rappers
Since the days of eating Gerber's baby food
The crazy dude with the pablum, the bad one
I grab the mic just like a Magnum
Fly girls was jiggling, clinging to my ding-a-ling
Wes, you was hitting skins as a baby
Yeah true but I was fingering
Yeah, check out shorty in the diapers
They're some big motherfuckers rhyming at the ciphers
Grown-ups knew that I be wealthy
They used to say
""that baby boy gots talent, but his mouth is so filthy""
I worte creazy rhymes to the beat
Had the, freedom of speech
But I still couldn't reach, the tall glass of milk
On the table, my lyrics were stable
But still I wasn't able to get it
I didn't sweat it, I paid it no mind
I wrote another fat rhyme at the drop of a dime
Now I'm hoping for the day to come
So I can hear my Dukes say, ""Wesley you son of a gun""

CHORUS X2
[Maestro Fresh Wes]
No time for chilling black
I wrote a killa rap, made an illa track
Knocking back the similack
Graduated from the formula, I had a scheme
Milk was calling me, just like the pipe to a fiend
But still I had to play cool, couldn't play a fool
So many MCs, are dropping out of pre-school
To get a record deal, forget it gotta hustle
Yo yo yo, how did money fall off?
Got lost in the shuffle
Ho thought he was a prankster
Every chick he'd meet he romanced her
Acting like a private dancer
But the music industry Hobbes, is serious as cancer
No place for a rapper, that still wearing papmpers
Even if you're signed, you'll still got to struggle
And making fat beats is just a piece of the puzzle
So props to the brother that made the Soul Clap
because my labels gave me flack money had my back
Forget the pacifier and your beachnut
Came out with three cuts
Now everybody's on these nuts
I got another rhyme, won't you check it
So fine tune the mic, engineer and I'mma wreck it

CHORUS X3
[Maestro Fresh Wes]
You know you got to go for self, support yourself
Like KRS said, you got to promote yourself
that's a fact not a fable, (word)
Get out the cradle
Or you'll be grippling with your record label
No time to play clown, if you want to stay around
Learn the business, and this ain't a playground
No time for Dr. Suess, or Mother Goose
You can rhyme and produce, but now you got to get loose
Just a piece of advice, now go your own path
And that allowance that you're getting money ain't gonna last
(What's this?) another fat beat that I build
You know It took a long time
But the borther's drinking milk

Be able to get a label to blast your procraster-
Nating the laughter, has to wait
After you pass the snake, stay awake Hobbes
That's the breaks
You want to make a record, check it
You need more than your boys around your way giving you credit
'Cause you can have a spectacular, vernacular
But take your contract to a lawyer to look after ya
'Cause labels have mastered the
Skill of gassing ya, after ya, dropped the flip like a spatula
Snatch your Acura
And all the bitches you wanted
Are flaunted your riches are laugh at ya
Cut you off like a dagger, support you like a laddere
Your pockets ain't fatter, you be sadder
So you better have a better strate-gy
Can't you see
It ain't healthy, nobody could tell me it's hell see
Takes more than a dope LP to be wealthy
Let me show you the path, you're going too fast
You're choking your promotional staff, ain't no knowing the half
They look and they laugh, and take time off
Cut ya off, no loss you're just a write off
Now you're feeling neglected and rejected
Check it, it's all about makin' records

You shackle and tackle by chicks, packing like Appleonia(?) six

Collecting your props, you think you're getting your nots
Forgetting black man attacks man's upsetting and sweating ya pops
Ringing the bell, ringing 'em hell
I'm telling them facts, black be clever you better rebel
You're outta here like flash dance
You and your wack stance
Regroup from your advance, fat chance!
You're say that you're only playing with your soul
You're innovative, but they got creative control
You're a puppet on a string, ain't got a fucking thing
You can sing so they cling, 'cause they know thay going to bring
Money with your rhyme but you're def dumb and blind
Don't waste time nigger, sign that dotted line

CHORUS X4
[Maestro Fresh Wes]
Now in the studio, you got the stupid flow
It doesn't matter tho, it's who you know
You think you got it bad, girls got it the harder way
Labels love to see a black woman in lingerie
What's a broad to say when a label say we'll make you millions
Buy clothes for your children, you know she hit the ceiling
They sing for me, we'll bring you G's
But injuries in the industry, could come instantly
I see the way they make a G a day, but what a fee to pay
Throwing and showing your T and A
You're taking a blow, your ass you shake it to show
Is raking the dough, but they played you and make you a ho
You're a piece of meat, between the sheets
'Nuff brothers seek to reach you, to freak or so to speak
Your Moms can't believe this, her daughter showing cleavage
She's speachless, and says oh help me sweet Jesus
Exposing the punanny, just to win a Grammy
But when that ass is flabby, you gone, word to daddy
Stop the degradation you're facing
This information I'm raising to the Queens of my nation
The shit can't prolong, goes strong
And when you sing a slow song (baby keep your clothes on)
Times are hard, many hearts are broken
Some start to smoke, Farrakhan ain't joking
When he said we're being setup
So black men and women keep your head up
When you're makin' records

I cut you up like a sharp machete blade 
Swear to god, only card you can pull if it's Medicaid 
Done with all this gun shit, fuck who you run with, son split 
The only thing you shoot is your dick, and it comes quick 

I'm like a bat outta hell tonight, niggas compell to bite 
I swell the mic when I like, fatter than cellulite 
I injure ears of engineers, sendin em into cheers 
Bringin my peers into tears, don't interfere 
Critics know I pack a wicked blow 
I put you in a clinic, so forget it like Riddick Bowe 
Nigga, go to hell, I flow so well 
Find another brother or mother or hoe to tell 
Or a bro to jeal', how's my jam gonna sell? Very well 
I send you back because you bring the wack 
I'm into rap, I interact with empty tracks 
Locked in, wack muthafuckas are blockin 
The Top 10 while the black radio jocks spin 
The calmer vibe, the modified 
I like the harder side, Jeffrey Dahmer tried, but died 
More words than a hour of scrabble, I got the power to battle 
Skadaddle or get devoured like the Tower of Babel 
Adversaries are snotty, some compare me to Gotti 
I bury a body, then carry a shotie 
The maestro rips the psycho shit 
Brain like a microchip, and I'ma excite you with 
The smoother rhythm, sendin mad crews to prison 
Who choose to listen while I use my you-4 missiles 
Collectin the pesos from a stage show 
Gettin fellatio from a h-o (why) because I say so 
My ratio expands as I wreck lands 
Makin def jams like Redman and X Clan 
I'ma nail the genitalia from Australia to Somalia 
Cause I'm smooth, just like a sailor 
I damage em all, bitches give me casual calls 
I'm slammin and jammin and rammin they vaginal walls 
Drums are fat over funky tracks 
Like Perce every verse could make your lung collapse 
I'm extra-nice, who's next to slice? 
Before you step to mics, nigga, check with christ 
You better 

Pray to the east, pray to the east 
Before you fuck around nigga pray to the east",Pray to da East
Maestro Fresh-Wes,"Yeah
Baby won't you let me hold you
In my arms for ever more
I conduct your fantasy
In a private symphony

Picture you and I
Way up in the sky
Flying over oceans, while the clouds go passing by
I kiss you on your lips, and taste your scented neck
We're going on a trip, we'll never ever forget
I'll take you on a voyage (voyage), traveling hand in hand
Yeah, I'm like an orchestra
Your body, I command
Conducting, instructing, you won't need to move
I'll tell you straight up girl, won't nobody disturb this groove

You've been my lady, a special friend to me
So take my hand and lets engage in a private symphony

Darling let me dedicate this
Moment to my love affair
Look into my eyes well can't you see
You and me
In a private symphony

We'll make love all night, and all through the morning
I'll still hold you tight (tight), while the beautiful sunset's forming
See, we don't need no band baby
Or no rhythm section (rhythm, rhythm, rhythm)
Cause in this symphony, harmony is made, from affection
We'll be rolling, squeezing, pleasing each other girl (yeah baby, yeah)
All over and over and over again, I could never ever love another
While the harmony plays, our love will never fade
Because from this day, 'til eternity sweet music will be made
Cause you've been more than just my lover
You've been my lady, a special friend to me

Maestro Jerard,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Maestro Jerard,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish Upon a Star
Maestro Jerard,"Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby says good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

Listen to the lullaby 
Of old Broadway",Lullaby of Broadway

Action packed nigga get your cassettes ready
It's about to go down like this here

Uh, uh, these niggas keep hatin', that ain't right though
I'ma throw it down like this here

Now I ain't trying to take over the game
I'm just trying to get a Range Rover and a couple of chains
I got a X-ed out college bitch giving me brains
Gave her my e-mail address and an alias name
And they tell me take it easy but I can't help it
I want more green than the Boston Celtics
Let a true nigga breathe don't be selfish
Bet on hot spitta competition getting dealt wit
Hollerin' bout you totin' guns
But I see you with no straps like low-top Air Force Ones
And you hollerin' bout money ain't got no funds
And you rappin' on beats using pots for ya drums
And you'll never see me with ya bitch
Oh I got the hoe with me, you just can't see through the tint
And I'm beggin' ya dog please don't quit rappin'
If you quit rappin' I quit laughin'

[Chorus: x2]
Don't want to see us with no paper ha (that ain't right)
Don't want to see us niggas make it ha (that ain't right)
I ain't gon call you a hater dog ('cause that ain't nice)
Just let a nigga breathe in the game aight

I got a flat so I had to leave the V in the garage
And X see the bar on his Bentley ??
Headin' to the spa for a weekly massage
Me, ya lady, and ya sister do minage trios
And I just copped two Porsches
And the dashboard got more wood than the Evergreen Forest
 
Pull up on the block, two glocks two torches
Shorty too hot like papa bear's poridge
Talkin' bout you pop caps to wet me
The only cap you pop is off a bottle of Pepsi
I got enough waves for you to ride on jet skis
And fuck a bodyguard I let the tech protect me
Hell in a black end male with white break lights
Known for spittin raps out like that on tapes right
Say you got skills ha bitch keep frontin'
And I'll carve ya face up like a Halloween Pumpkin

[Chorus]

I guess I ain't supposed to spit
You probably want me locked off in the back so you can hush my shit
You probably thinkin' is see wrong for this
But XL ain't just a name known for production and shit
If ain't nothing else, I'm never ya bitch
Lyrically I'm hot, like the different color paint on my six
And if y'all really ain't on my shit, it's cool
'Cause that ain't right
I guess I know you better than me
You probably a pimp who get the pussy wetter than me
You probably a thug with more ice and cheddar than me
Fuck that if i was you I'd be better than me
Ya bitch you, you better be better than me
You're probably right, that ain't right
Naw dog, not on your life
You're better off trying to fuck with a dike
If you smart why you sound so dumb on the mic
You can't fuck with my beats let alone what I write
My click, or the fact that we tight
It ain't us, y'all ain't doin' it right
I ruined it right
A producer that ruined your life
Aw fuck it they done gave me a mic

Maestro Jerard,"To the tables down at Mory's
To the place where Louie dwells
To the dear old Temple bar we love so well
Sing the Whiffenpoofs assembled with their glasses raised on high
And the magic of their singing casts it's spell

Yes, the magic of their singing of the songs we love so well
""Shall I Wasting"" and ""Mavourneen"" and the rest
We will serenade our Louie while life and voice shall last
Then we'll pass and be forgotten with the rest

We're poor little lambs who have lost our way
Baa, baa, baa
We're little black sheep who have gone astray

Doomed from here to eternity
Lord have mercy on such as we

Maestro Jerard,"Why did I wander
Hereand there and yonder,
Wasting precious time
For no reason or rhyme?
Isn't it a pity!
Isn't it a crime!
My journey is ended,
Everything is splendid;
Meeting you today
Has given me a wonderful idea 
Here I stay!

It's a funny thing;
I look at you,
I get a thrill I never knew,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Here we are at last,
It's like a dream,
The two of us, a perfect team,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

Let's forget the past, let's both agree
That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
Fishing for salmon,
Losing at backgammon!
What joys untasted,
My nights were sour,
Spent with Schopenhauer!

Let's forget the past, let's both agree
That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!",Isn't It a Pity

Instante da loucura

Meu galope
Minha rédea

Minha réstia
De luz intensa
De voz aberta

Do que sente a gente certa

Em ti persigo
Em ti percorro

Minha amargura
Minha coragem de correr contra a ternura

Por ti aceito

Quem à vida se nega. (2x)

Filhos de uma chama agreste
Astros que alto o céu revestem
E onde a tua história é escrita

Meus lindos olhos, de lua cheia
Um esquecido do outro, a brilhar p’ra rua inteira
Quem não conhece teu triste fado
Não desvenda em teu riso um chorar tão magoado

Perdões pedidos
Num murmúrio desolado
Quando o réu morava ao lado
Mais cruel não pode ser

Este fado que aqui canto inspirou-se só em ti
Tu que nasces e renasces sempre que algo morre em ti

Quem me dera poder cantar
Horas, dias, tão sem fim
Quando pedes só p’ra mim

Sa mère, c'est l'champ d'bataille sur l'ter-ter
Unités, char d'assaut, tanks, hélicoptères
L'état nous met un max de pression, mais on lâchera pas l'affaire
Car j'ai trop mangé la gamelle, côtoyé la misère
Le seum se libère quand les menottes se resserrent

La guérilla urbaine pour mes barillas
Guerrier 9.4, toujours en série A
Cruels sur nos ruelles, nos keufs, nos politiques que cherche le duel
Juste des larmes et des corps au bout du tunnel
Des halls s'enflamment en banlieue, en haut lieu
Ça s'liquide dans le milieu
Ca tranche dans les zones franches, ca en devient périlleux
J'm'entends même plus crier, ça tire, tous se déchirent dans ce brouhaha
Tellement de faits d'armes et d'faits divers dans tout nos trous à rats

On l'a pas souhaité, mais c'est la guerre
Grandir en cité, tu l'sais, c'est la guerre
Inégalités sociales mon frère, c'est la guerre
La France veut nous faire du mal, normal, c'est la guerre
On cherche à s'en sortir ma soeur, c'est la guerre
Faut construire un avenir meilleur, c'est la guerre
On s'bat pour nos parents, comprends, c'est la guerre
On veut pas qu'nos enfants galèrent, donc c'est la guerre

Issus de la classe ouvrière, on a les armes pour faire la guerre
J'me rapproche de la trentaine et toujours là sur le ter-ter
Mafia K'1 Fry, Black Panthers, 40 ans après c'est la même
Levez vos flingues, serrez vos poings, visez la tête si nécessaire
Que celui qui veut la paix prépare la guerre, croise le fer
Je démarre tellement vite, qu'évite de regarder de travers
Alors je m'habille treillis kaki avec une capuche sur la tête
On tire en l'air pour faire la fête, on tire sur toi pour faire la guerre

C'est la guerre, dans les rues les jeunes charbonnent
Pour un regard, ça s'cogne, corps à corps entre nous et les forces de l'ordre
C'est la guerre, y'a des pules-cra, des seuses-cra, et des cistes-ra
Dehors c'est la jungle, ça hésite pas gros
C'est la guerre, l'Etat nous donne des restes depuis tout petit
On mange des miettes, on a tant d'donnes mec, frotter dans l'assiette
C'est la guerre, on est souvent sur les nerfs, décidés, armés
A l'aube combien se lèvent pour aller jobber?

Dans c'monde d'opportunistes, Mafia K'1 Fry résiste
Hardcore pour qu'on existe, encore vivants, trop d'racistes
C'est la guerre, faut qu'on s'unisse, surtout pas qu'on se divise
C'est la guerre dans nos rues, jusqu'à l'industrie du disque
C'est la guerre du plus gros biff pour la mif', faut qu'on s'en sorte mec
J'suis resté authentique, j'veux qu'le fric frappe à ma porte mec
C'est la guerre, j'baisse pas mon treillis, mon quotidien n'est pas fashion
Sois déterminé, sois brave, ta gueule, mon pote réaction

On l'a pas souhaité, mais c'est la guerre
Grandir en cité, tu l'sais, c'est la guerre
Inégalités sociales mon frère, c'est la guerre
La France veut nous faire du mal, normal, c'est la guerre
On cherche à s'en sortir ma soeur, c'est la guerre
Faut construire un avenir meilleur, c'est la guerre
On s'bat pour nos parents, comprends, c'est la guerre
On veut pas qu'nos enfants galèrent, donc c'est la guerre

Demande au maire, d'Choisy-Le-Roi qu'est-ce qu'il a fait pour sa jeunesse?
C'est l'insurgé K'1 Fry du mois, si l'chômage est à la baisse
C'est la guerre, dans nos ghettos l'Etat nous a délaissé
S'en battent les couilles d'la situation, au Karsher ils veulent nous débarrasser
Même en GAV c'est la guerre, entre Chiraquiens et Sarkozistes
Baise leurs discriminations positives, leurs lois racistes
Ne parle pas d'intégration, viens dans nos banlieues c'est la guerre
Rappelle toi des émeutes, demain ça sera pire qu'hier

C'est la guerre, voilà comment on débarque nous
100% zermi, K'1 Fry Mafia c'est l'crew
Sache que on fuck l'Etat et Babylone
On représente toutes les familles nombreuses élevées par une femme sans homme
J'réponds à l'appel, j'ai la haine
Ils m'ont coupés les vivres, c'est ma raison d'être
Cette guerre c'est ma raison d'vivre, rien dans l'bide, c'est sec
Et les soucis nous creusent tous la tête, ici tout s'achète
Marre des dettes, TVA, impôts, taxes c'est la guerre

Un vide à remplir et une arme au milieu d'mes chaussettes
C'est la guerre, 3andek la policia yshoufek 40 degrés, cul sec
10.000 voyous, hauts vols, Audi Q7
Bras d'fer avec la guardia civile
Lit d'poudre, plaquettes, cachets, penser à sa famille, la nourrir
Y'a des causes pour lesquelles faut être prêts à mourir

C'est celle de la cambriole
Mon père était un courant d'air
Et ma mère une taloche
J'ai pas d'plombs aux ch'villes
Chacun m'appelle ""l'anguille""

Je suis souple et mince et je glisse
Entre les mains de la police
Pour moi tous les gens sont pareils
C'est du fric et des po-ches
Bouclez bien vos grilles
Chacun m'appelle ""l'anguille""

Parmi la foule
Je me déroule
Et je ramasse
Les portefeuilles
Que je recueille
Dans ma vieille paillasse
Je sais que c'est un paradoxe
Tant pis si c'est pas orthodoxe
Malgré mon surnom de poisson
Je m'en vais à la pêche

Planquez vot' jonquille
Voici venir l'anguille !

J'ai beau être un vrai spécialiste
Pour moi y a pas que'le fric qu'existe
Il faut que j'l'avoue j'ai du goût
Pour les brunes et les blondes
Un regard qui brille...
Aussitôt je frétille...

Les sous du voisin me passionnent
Mais le coeur d'une jolie personne
C'est l'coffre fort le plus fort
Qu'on puisse trouver au monde
Ca tient d'la Bastille
Mais on m'appelle l'anguille

Je me balade

En douceur je la fer-re

Ce mignon-là, c'est pour mon lit!""

Mais il était râblé comme tout
Il m'a suivie jusqu'à ma piaule
Et j'ai crié vas-y mon loup!

Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Envole-moi au ciel Zoum!
Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Moi j'aime l'amour qui fait boum!

Il n'avait plus que ses chaussettes,
Des belles jaunes avec des raies bleues
Il m'a regardé d'un œil bête,
Il comprenait rien, l'malheureux
Et il m'a dit l'air désolé :
""Je n'ferais pas d'mal à une mouche""
Il m'énervait je l'ai giflé
Et j'ai grincé d'un air farouche

Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Je n'suis pas une mouche Zoum!

Voyant qu'il ne s'excitait guère,
Je l'ai insulté sauvagement,
J'y ai donné tous les noms d'la terre,
Et encore d'autres bien moins courants.
Ça l'a réveillé aussi sec,
Et il m'a dit: ""Arrête ton charre
Tu m'prends vraiment pour un pauvre mec,
J'vais t'en refiler, d'la série noire.""

Tu m'fais mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Pas avec des pieds Zing!
Tu m'fais mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,

Son p'tit complet, ses p'tits souliers,
Il est descendu l'escalier
En m'laissant une épaule démise.

C'est bien la peine de faire des frais,
Maintenant, j'ai des bleus plein les fesses

Mais il était râblé comme tout
Il m'a suivie jusqu'à ma piaule
Et j'ai crié vas-y mon loup!

Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Envole-moi au ciel Zoum!
Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Moi j'aime l'amour qui fait boum!

Il n'avait plus que ses chaussettes,
Des belles jaunes avec des raies bleues
Il m'a regardé d'un œil bête,
Il comprenait rien, l'malheureux
Et il m'a dit l'air désolé :
""Je n'ferais pas d'mal à une mouche""
Il m'énervait je l'ai giflé
Et j'ai grincé d'un air farouche

Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Je n'suis pas une mouche Zoum!
Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Moi j'aime l'amour qui fait boum!

Voyant qu'il ne s'excitait guère,
Je l'ai insulté sauvagement,
J'y ai donné tous les noms d'la terre,
Et encore d'autres bien moins courants.
Ça l'a réveillé aussi sec,
Et il m'a dit: ""Arrête ton charre
Tu m'prends vraiment pour un pauvre mec,
J'vais t'en refiler, d'la série noire.""

Tu m'fais mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Pas avec des pieds Zing!
Tu m'fais mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
J'aime pas l'amour qui fait bing!

Il a remis sa p'tite chemise,
Son p'tit complet, ses p'tits souliers,
Il est descendu l'escalier
En m'laissant une épaule démise.
Pour des voyous de cette espèce,
C'est bien la peine de faire des frais,
Maintenant, j'ai des bleus plein les fesses
Et plus jamais je ne dirai:

Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Envoie-moi au ciel Zoum!
Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Moi j'aime l'amour qui fait boum!","Fais-Moi Mal, Johnny!"

He doesn't expect to pinch himself and wake up and that kind of thing...

On ceremony says, ""Hold my book for a minute, 
Would you, while i get the door open!""

For some reason the old man doesn't just put his book down on the chair

It all happens quite quickly...
He finds that he's made a decision and is already holding the old man's book...
As just about anybody else would have, But it seems a bit curious because...
In however small a way you like to consider it...
It is as if he's helping himself enter Hell...
The path of least resistance

Even as he finally grips the book...
""This is my chance for a reprieve...
the final test...
The straw which will tip the good deeds over the bad.""

Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun

Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence

Until you return I will never be free,
I hear you call - wait for me.
Do you still remember by the ocean,
Oh so blue,
As I looked into your eyes,
you said that you´ll be true,
The promises made
as we walked on the beach,
Like the moon and the stars
now so far out of reach.
I'm waiting for you
those words I still hear you say
But it seems like a lifetime
since you went away,
There's chains round my heart
and they just won't let me be
Until you return
I will never be free
I hear you call - Wait for me
 Lying in my bed alone
and whispering your name
Wonder where you are tonight
and do you feel the same
Letting my thoughts fly
to where you might be
Sharing the secret
that took you from me
I'm waiting for you
Those words I still hear you say
but it seems like a lifetime
since you went away
There's chains round my heart
and they just won't let me be
Until you return
I will never be free
I hear you call - Wait for me
I'm waiting for you
Because it's all I can do
But it seems all my life
I've been waiting for you
This ache in my heart
You know it won't let me be
Until you return
I will never be free
Still I can hear - Wait for me
I'm waiting for you
Those words I still hear you say
But it seems like a lifetime
Since you went away
There's chains round my heart
And they just won't let me be

Maggie Reilly,"The first time ever she saw him,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
He passed on worried and warning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.
The trees that whisper in the evening,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Four a.m. in the morning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night,
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to terms with me this night,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.

Maggie Rose,"There's a bottle on the shelf, talkin' to me
Sayin', ""Come over here, you can have a drink""
We can make it through this lonely night together

But that's a road I don't wanna go back down
And I hate myself for what I'm thinkin' now
Hey, it's just one night, it's not like it's forever
I just want to feel better

I just want to feel good, feel alright
Feel anything but what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life
And put the pieces back together
I just want to feel better

All these pictures running through my head
From the way he loved to the way he left
Not a single day goes by, I don't miss him

When the lonely gets to be too much
I try to kill the pain with a stranger's touch
Though I know I won't forget him altogether
I just want to feel better

I just want to feel good, feel alright
Feel anything but what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life
And put the pieces back together
I just want to feel better

I know there's gonna come a day
When he's still gone and it's okay

I just want to feel good, feel alright
Feel anything but what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life

Maggie Rose,"Looking back now, I probably should've let him run

He smelled like gin with a hint of her
Up 'til then I wasn't sure
But he swaggered by and said ""The boys said to tell you hey""
And I was kicked back in his easy chair
Holding a fifth tapping the barrel
Of a fresh cleaned steel blue polished up .38
And I was kind of hoping he'd at least look scared
But all he said was ""Okay, she was good and you don't dare""

Looking back now I probably should've let him run
Paybacks are hell where I come from
And any fool should know
You don't look a woman in the eye and smile
When she knows what you've done
And she's holding, whiskey and a gun

Uh huh
Well the sun shines gray in the prison yard
Life to go was going hard
When the warden started getting sweet on me
And he drugged me to his room one night
And poured me some 'skey gave me a light
And I smoked slow and waited 'til he was done
And I thought that was that 'til he got rough and I fought back
And when I grabbed his pistol he laughed and said
""Girl you ain't got the guts""

Looking back now I probably should've let him run
Paybacks are hell where I come from
And any fool should know
You don't look a woman in the eye and smile
When she knows what you've done
And she's holding whiskey and a gun
Whiskey and a gun

Their strapping me down and I'm scared to die
Now I ain't the kind of girl to cry
But I find myself begging God for mercy
My hands are cold as I start to slip
Sodium theopentol drips
The room goes black and I wonder if He heard me

Looking back now I probably should've let 'em run
I bet paybacks are hell there where I'm goin'
But any fool should know

Maggie Rose,"Pink blossoms on the Mimosa trees
Cicadas dancing soft and sweet
Sweat on his neck in the summer heat
Kissin' the preacher's daughter

Headlights flashing in their eyes
The shadow of a face they recognized
A single shot split the night
Footsteps in muddy water

And the sun came up like the day before
And her sheets hadn't been turned down
And the boy turned up downstream on the rocks
Two miles outside of town
She was leavin' church in a white sundress
Last time anybody saw her
Oh, what's become of the preacher's daughter

One-eyed woman with her tarot cards
Said she ain't comin' back but she ain't gone far
The devil's a liar and he drives a car
Somewhere in Catahoula County

Then the sun came up like the day before
And her sheets hadn't been turned down
And the search dogs barked on the day they laid
Her first love in the ground
The preacher's knees buckled in the heat
So the deacon took over
And said ""let us pray for the preacher's daughter""

Blue lights flashin' on the riverbank
They held their breath as they dragged the chains
Hearts all sank when her beautiful face
Came up out of the water

Through her tangled hair they could see
She was missing one earring
Found the other in the back seat of the car
Of the deacon that couldn't have her

And the sun came up like the day before
And her sheets hadn't been turned down
When they slapped the cuffs on the deacon's wrists
You could hear it all over town
And the headlines read ""Justice At Last
Up From The Muddy Water,
The Resurrection of the Preacher's Daughter""",Preacher's Daughter

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Que viva la Raza why viva the lovers
And I'm staring at the ocean but it isn't enough

Show it off bling bling then I'm gonna rock your world

Love is where it starts
It resides, often hides
Deep within our hearts

Pebbles make a mountain,
Raindrops make a sea,
One day at a time

Ordinary miracles
Happen all around,
Just by giving and receiving
Comes belonging and believing,
Every sun that rises
Never rose before,
Each new day leads the way
Through a different door,
And we can all be quiet heroes
Living quiet days,
Walking through the world
Changing it in quiet ways,
Ordinary miracles
Like candles in the dark,
Each and every one of us
Lights a spark,

And the walls can tumble
And the mountains can move,
The winds and the tide can turn,

Yes, ordinary miracles
One for every star,
No lightning bolt or clap or thunder
Only joy and quiet wonder,
Endless possibilities
Right before our eyes,
Oh, see the way a miracle multiplies,

Now hope can spring eternally
Plant it and it grows,
Love is all that's necessary
Lovin', its extraordinary
Why,
Makes ordinary miracles every blessed day.",Ordinary Miracles
Maggie Worsdale,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose

You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia,

Why stars in the trees hide when it rains

Will it sing you a song  
Will it say a farewell

Maybe I'm only supposed to stay in your arms a while

Prenda amada mi consentida con quien vivía
Con quien soñaba como olvidarte si mi cama

Nada cura este dolor como olvidarte, como

I'm from the ninth ward[Been there since the day I was born]
From the ninth ward[Got us coming up like a storm]
From the ninth ward[Niggas better sound the alarm]
Here come the ninth ward,ninth ward hard

[Magic]
Bitch,I was born and raised in the ninth ward
So you niggas don't bother me
You can say what you may about the ninth ward
But I bet you won't follow me
'Cross that canal where my niggas dwell
You know me well
Cause I sold rocks, upon my block
Till I was hotter than hell
Every nigga down here remember me
Nothin' really changed but my gold teeth
I'm still that same nigga from my Flood Street
Only difference now is that I'm on my feet
And I don't sell dope no mo'
Don't rob no mo'
Mane a nigga don't plot no mo'
Cause I'm performing in shows 
Shakin' off hoes
Smokin' on optimos
It'll be a World War 3 fuck with me
Now my niggas won't let that ride
I'm the only nigga out chere screaming 9th Ward
So people tryin' to keep me alive
Everywhere I go they see the nine on my arm
And they swear that I'm in a gang
But nigga this is a warning, I'm 'bout my hands
Like I'm 'bout them motherfucking thangs
I'm trouble starter just like my father 
He was raised in the nine
So if you cut my arm it still tated in my mind
No matter millions or which ever the situation might come
I'll never forget you niggas 
Never forget where the fuck I'm from

Chorus-2x

[Magic]
You know you could take the nigga out the nine
But you can't take the nine out of nigga
Pulling capers is my nature 
I'm addicted to making paper
Got my own way of living 
Bitch I'm from the see-T-see
Where niggas roam around looking for beef
Killing for free 
I take this ward shit to heart 
It's tated on my arm
So me and my niggas never part
I keep you niggas in my mind 
For every clucker that I serve
For every nigga that I shot
For every tourist that I robbed
To every god damn rock
For every cop that done chased me 
To the bitches that hate me
What have you done for me lately
For every neighbor that was peeking at four o'clock in da morn
It never helped to lock me up
You could've left me alone
We learned to improvise on my block
Never had a ball 
We played football wit' a concrete rock
Now picture that
I could never forget my mission
I'm a turn the nine into something bigger that yo' vision
Before I'm done the world'll scream

Damn it feels good to be a TRU nigga 

Not a worry on my motherfuckin' mind

And a cadillac sittin' on shine 

Damn it feels good to be the TRU nigga 

Every time I put this TRU around my neck (hah-hah) 

Every Tom, Dick and Harry want to watch my back 

And treat a nigga with the upmost respect 

Damn it feels good to be with TRU records 

I ain't gonna lie fifty dollars put me on the map 

Now I'm ridin' in limosines doing shows with Fiend

Damn it feels good to be a TRU nigga 

I won't stop until they put me on the wall 

See I ain't never had shit so it's my time to shine 

And I'm a ball 'till I motherfuckin' fall 

Damn it feels good to be a TRU nigga

Mi puta, this what it's all about huh, fucking and sucking
You piece of trash, every gimp like you needs a pimp like me ok
You get on that fucking block and you make my money you piece of trash
Make my money right now, you get on that street and you look good
And you work good and you suck good ok

(kane)
Dressed to impress like I'm slinging them birds
Put a bitch on pimp arrest as she keep her eyes to the curb
These ho's we don't need em, we let the welfare feed em
Hustlas pimp hoes for pussy let them fake bustas eat em
Mr. kane, mr. magic, dog a bitch quick
Hit that trick from the back and let her suck my brother dick
We don't sweat these hoes, we let these hoes
Find em, fuck em, duck em and forget these hoes
I need fresh money everyday bitch have my cash
Try to short game or run game get shot in the ass
Understand you da hoe and I'm the pimp
All paper comes to me, see you the gimp
Put some stretchmarks on that pussy and fuck till you limp
When the sun goes down you gonna do it again

(abel)
I started off two hoes on the block for me
Now it's two hundred hoes wanna shop with me

Chorus: (magic, kane & abel)

Look, I got a proposition every gimp needs a pimp
If you about gimpin' then we about pimpin
(repeat 4x)

(big ed)
It ain't nothing like black pussy on my dick
My tank dawgs said never put my faith in a bitch
All females ain't hoes, I love the ladies
But gimps get tag team freaks in backseats of jeeps
I'm that big dick nigga drivin up ya street
Big dick nigga got em going mouth to me
I'll hit ya in ya grill hole if you want it there
I'll even watch you eat your girl's pussy I don't care
I'll hit you from the back, slap your ass and pull your hair
Wrap around rub your clit through your pubic hairs
Women call me the assassin cause they know I'm gone kill it
I fuck your pussy so hard I make ya momma feel it

(mac)
Now where the gimps, I slam em like shawn kemp
I guess I'm a born pimp cause I never eat it, still I complete it
My name mac so motherfuckers know where my game at
I fuck em and duck, give em wrong numbers and what
Camouflage love all night making you moan
Yeah I get mine and I'm gone but I gotta go finish my song
Look you ain't gotta go home but you gotta leave
Now straighten up your weave
And call me soon as you make it to your crib please
And I'm gone give you a beep next time I want to creep
Wouldn't give a fuck if you sleep, wake up and greet it's me
I like them thug girls y'all can have them pretty hoes
Them giddy hoes ain't good for nothing but videos

Chorus 4x

No disrespecting my sisters, I'm disrespecting you bitches
Scandalous hoes sucking and fucking for a nigga's riches
Keep your hands out my pockets ho cause I'm a pimp
You can't play this fucking player that's why I treat you like a gimp
You ain't nothing but a fuck or two
So if you ain't got no cash then I really don't want your ass
I'm bout bigger and fucking better
If you really want me then bring the cheddar
And I promise you that you'll never need another fellow
Treat ya like daddy but be sure to call me magic
And if I ever catch you stashing, girl I'm gone let you have
When a nigga call you, call me and I decide (hmmm...)
Whether this nigga deserves the pussy...trust me
Sign your name on the dotted line and if you ever need this nigga
Just call me I ain't hard to find

Chorus 4x

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a

Fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact

We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers over exaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

[Chorus: 2X]

Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something

[Chorus: 2X]

Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

Magic,"I never bite the hand that feed me
I'm always on call incase you niggas need me
Never decieve ya, put to rest your enemies
You can depend on me, I'll never leave ya
You can believe that in your time of tribulations
I'll be that first nigga shootin without no hesitations
I ride with you niggas whether you right or wrong
I guess it's why us soldiers last so long

I wasn't born with none of you niggas but we be come from the same hood
Fifty dollars gave birth and y'all treated me good
Think I was family so if any nigga disrespect
I'm a grab him and shake him till I break his fuckin neck
Ain't no bottom to this love I go to the ends of the earth
To ensure as long as you with Magic you'll never be hurt
To mentally and physically prepared for gangsta shit
And I pray to my chances of survival rollin with this click
I throw myself in the line of fire to die with a good name
Fuck the fame, let it be said I was made by the game
Found a friend when you found me
And I'm dedicated to TRU so it's alright to put your faith in me

I never bite the hand that feed me
I'm always on call incase you niggas need me
Never decieve ya, put to rest your enemies
You can depend on me, I'll never leave ya
You can believe that in your time of tribulations
I'll be that first nigga shootin without no hesitations
I'm a ride with you niggas whether you right or wrong
I guess it's why us soldiers last so long

Picture the power I possess now with this tank around my neck
I wasn't shit before this so I thank the Lord cause I'm blessed (thank you Lord)
Now I can rest cause I know I'm on my way to the top
And a tank of TRU niggas that refuse to stop
I'm still a rookie but I'm makin more cash then Trump's bookie
Got my tank on shine so it's hard for you not to look at me
Face it, I'm legendary, I'm the first of my kind
I'm makin money nationwide, it's only my first time
I'm in a no lose situation with Beats By The Pound
Whole shit platinum cause no one around to fuck with the sound
No greater love then being affiliated with y'all
But we all stand together so together we fall
Mr. Magic

I never bite the hand that feed me
I'm always on call incase you niggas need me
Never decieve ya, put to rest your enemies

Verse 1: [C-Murder]

No Limit soldier for life, nigga give me my props
I come a long fuckin' way from pullin jacks (?) and slangin' rocks
7 digit figures can't make me soft
I be the same motherfucker ready to blow a nigga head off
Bury him, before he bury me
Become a memory, motherfuckers talkin' bout remember see
Nigga, is you crazy, I don't know what death is
The reaper don't fuck with a nigga like me, I'm a handle my biz
Like 4 more, I'm sick with it, you know what I'm sayin'
Don't play no games boy, you know see-Murder ain't playin'
I go to clubs, mean mug, ain't shit gon' happen
I'm a motherfuckin gangsta, niggaz know I ain't just rappin'
Can't stop a crazy motherfucker from doin' what he want to
I'm still facin' ten years on an open charge in California
So believe if you see me on the corner it really don't matter
And respect a real nigga, or watch your fuckin' brains scatter

Chorus x 2

Verse 2: [Soulja Slim]

Now see-Murder told you bitches don't play no games
And since I got a little paper bitch you think I changed?
? at all times respect my mind
I'd rather be caught with it than without it, I ain't lyin'
'cause soldier haters come in all shapes and sizes
They act like they your people wearin' them different disguises
You get a little baby and you get some fame
They be all in ya face just because of ya name
I'm worldwide, southside is what I claim
Uptown, magnolia, that's whose bringin' the pain
I'm gettin sick and tired, sick and tired of this shit
Life's a bitch, even when you bitch niggaz and hoes snitch
So tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do 
I run with real niggaz and trill niggaz that's bout it and TRU

Verse 3: [Magic]

It's Mr. Magic, I'm take my time, I'm a handle my business
Either thuggin or rappin, I refuse to leave a witness
Nigga, money don't make me, I make the money
And you niggaz don't scare me, that's why I ain't runnin
I was in the lower nine, its best you back up bitch
Kidnappers and killas y'all niggaz makin' me homesick
My mind is full of battle scars because I ball
And servin' time in the graveyard, times is hard
But my world still remains the same
Infested with anger, that's why I ride with probably one in the chamber
I'm with million dollar minded niggaz
Between the screen we worth more figures than the world got gravediggaz
We made niggaz, picture us for some years
Throwin a' finger to our foes, and givin' love to our friends

Chorus x2",Money Don't Make Me
Magic,"[Magic]
Yo see-Murder, you believe all these people they call me hopeless.
[C-Murder]
They say when your hopeless your not expected to do good, be successful.
And it's by all means impossible to accomplish any goals.

[Sons of Funk]
Ohh, like a bullet with a hole in it, oh yeah

[Magic]
Look here, it's not easy I struggled to get in this position
Taking my people out the ghetto was my only mission
I was jacking and strong arming accomplished i done changed
Making money living good I'm out of the game
See as I refused to see good in my accomplishments
All I ever get is dirty looks, never compliments
I figure jealousy, wishing that why'all could be me
Cause I'm living larger then life at the age of twentythree (ha ha)
a lot of pessimistic people is speaking about my lifestyle
So when I enter the center I look for the smiles
Many expected me to go down the tubes
Now the same people wishing that they could be in my shoes
But I'm the one they call hopeless
Lord forgive em for thinking that I was worthless
I forgive and forget
And I learn from every life experience
I hope why'all feel every word cause this is real it gets
They call me hopeless

And I'm up to my head in it, up to my head in it, oh

[C-Murder]
They said I'm hopeless and I never make it
They doubt it, call me an outcast because I'm bout it
Now why you want to label me and say I'm a thug
I never said I wasn't because this ghetto is in my blood
But I maintain through poverty and tears
My only wish was that I make it to see another year
I left my dreams up in the penn, feel my constant struggle
And one man against a nation, damn I miss my brother
I walk a path to a dead end cause I'm lonely
A childhood full of rainy days kept me homeless
I always wondered was I cursed
Since birth I felt I never had a fair chance in life on this wreched earth
My lonely memories of the past, they got me thinking
I don't want to see the future, but die in vain
I ask the Lord will he forgive me
Before I leave this world I want to live a better life because I'm hopeless

Sky is the limit
And I won't stop until I touch the top
And I won't stop till I reach the top

I'm thinkin' back on all the old days, so easy to reminisce
People pointed the fingers and said that Magic wouldn't be shit
Cause I hung out with all the wrong type of peeps
Five o'clock in the morning and I'm still in the streets
Just a bad motherfucker, my classroom was the hallways
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Only thing that ever mattered was that my peers respected me
Living fast at a young age so them hoes was sweating me
Thinkin' I'm a grown man
I'm holding rocks in my mouth, tryin' to survive in this crime land
I'm just hustling cause I never had
So these chips that I gained, I maintained, me and my pops past
I thank the Lord for blessing me, I owe you eternity
So I fall to my knees whenever I'm addressing him
You walked me down the right path
Even though my heart was in it
You made me realize that sky is the limit

To a house sittin on the acre with a lotta paper
Money market accounts, CD's and savings
Mutual funds, but I remember barely having ones
For real yall, George Washingtons
Had about five to get by for the whole week sometimes
Why, I used to cry to the lord
How a young black sister get it so hard
Two babies to raise all by myself, help wanted
I see the tank comin through so I jumped on it
And took a ride with some soldiers where the sky is the limit
No Limit, TRU for life and I'm a represent it
And now there's no more hungry nights

Ghetto flowers, your time is coming in a minute
So stand your ground and stay focused, sky is the limit

And I'm loving this life of luxury
I'm in the passenger seat of a 98 Navigator with my nigga C
Talkin' over another million dollar hit

I gotta do what I gotta do [gotta have money  gotta have game] 

And break you off [gotta have heart  if you want to have thangs] x2 



[Verse 1: Silkk the Shocker] 



See I'm that type of nigga, gotta do what I gotta 

Like send my girl on a plane ride, taped up with keys of narcotic 

But I ain't that type of nigga, that's gon' tell you what I'm gon' do 

You fuck up, I'm a kill ya, and I put that shit on TRU 

See I'm that type of nigga that ride with the rich, kick it with the poor 

Just 'cause of some shit that I used to do, and my rep 

Everybody see me, all of a sudden hit the floor 

Rest in peace to my nigga, go head and rest y'all head 

Nigga that killed ya, I'm torturin' him, the rest, they dead 

So Magic pass me them thangs and let me get 'em (let me get 'em) 

Nah I ain't lookin' for you dog 

But I'm a fuck you up if you wit 'em (so don't be with 'em) 

Now see, I'm that type of nigga, that's gon' ball 'till they fall (fall) 

Dollar bills will stay stackin' and gold and platinum on the wall (wall) 

Yeah, I'm that type of nigga but I'm wrong 'cause I know I'd hit her(hit her) 

Right before I leave and drop some of my flows 

So when he come on home, you can kill her 

Now either you with me dog look , or you oppossed to my shit 

Nigga like the ice up on my tank, so fuck it I froze my wrist (stupid) 

Now either way you want to do, choose, let's take it, a chance 

Now we can do it how you want to, what you want to do, we can dance 

So don't trip just drop the beat and I'm a drop the heat (heat) 

And if this rap shit slow down go to the dope game bitch and cop a key 

Whatcha want to do 



[Chorus x 4] 



[Verse 2: Magic ]


I got to be real with ya, I'm that type of nigga that really don't give a fuck 

My hobbies was totin' tecks Jack and my first words were give it up 

It was hard to maintain, couldn't see myself workin' this 9 to 5 

I'd rather be hustlin' on the corner with my niggas, gettin' high 

Chancin' my own life, I'm strapped, got a pocketful of bud 

But I wouldn't have it no other way, my daddy done raised a thug 

I never rooted for the good guys, I was always for the bad (bad) 

I guess that's why I got Master P's pictures posted around my pad 

My ghetto heroes was drug dealer, killers and cap peelers 

I didn't do too bad for myself 'cause, now Magic makin' millions 

Me and Silkk unbeatable team we can't be stopped (can't be stopped) 

We ain't got nothin' to prove to nobody (nothin') 

Fuck wit' us, you get popped 

It's a brand new generation, and we the children of the future 

So I'm gon' do what I gotta do because that's what I'm used to 

Either you with me or you against me, ball or nigga fall 

But I'm a No Limit Soldier, so I'm comin' for it all

(Look boy stop playing I said I'm not tripping) 
But look look 

Let me explain my situation before we even conversate 
See I'm involved with this female that just can't be replaced 
So I'm just looking for a friend are you interested? 
'Cause I would love to see you butt-naked lying in my bed 

You won't regret a mintue just tell me what you like 
And I promise to make this the best night of your life 
(Now would you dine on me?) sure baby only the best 
(Now would you treat me like a queen?) only if you can pass the first test

Well is you cold with it? (Oh believe me this is the best) 
It's just me and you and I won't tell nobody 
So put your hands on my hips and let your neck get rowdy 

If you suck my soul, I'll play with your emotions 
So at the point of pentration, your wetter than the ocean 
Getting aroused by my every motion 
As I'm getting aroused by your Victoria Secret's lotion 

I'm harder than an armadillian, can't fight this feeling 
If you get on all four, shoot that ass to the ceiling 
As I apply the pressure as she starts to moan 
Ohh if it's it's on...look 

Why is you biting at that pillow baby, screaming my name? 
(Because your working that dick, you got me going insane.) 
(Boy you'se a soilder) I told ya ( How you keeping your composer?) 
'Cause right before we started, I smoked three gards of dolja 

You getting the dope dick, I prepared for this 
Wanted to dick you down before I blasted 
The plastic got the bed down better than average 
It's only been an hour and she's speaking of marriage 

I get upset, but then I start to laugh and I can't blame her 
She's been exposed to Magic, 
No other man can make her feel like I make her feel 
(Shit I ain't trippin on your wife, I'm trying to keep it real) 

So what you sayin boo? Cause I'm hoping that I'm hearing you 
I told you from the jump there was no future in this 
(So what you sayin? Don't I fulfill your biggest fantasy) 
Nah to tell you the truth baby you bothering me 

I undressed you, only to sex you 
Gave you the dick and it must have impressed you 
(Man you shiesty ass niggas fucking make me sick 
I wish I would have known, I would of asked you to lick my clit 

Don't you recall the day that you begged for the pussy, paided for the pussy)

You just another lame nigga) 

Yeah Yeah Yeah

Bitch i'm a soldier (until the day that i die)
A No limit soldier (yes i am, yes i am) 
I thought that I told ya (and nothing or no one could ever change that)
Ain't no need to ask me why I'm a soldier til i die.

[Magic]
I'm a soldier see the tank on my neck?
Mr. Magic is my name y'all better give me respect
You might remember me from seein' me postin' up on the block
With a .45 Glock 
and a mouth full of rocks
Hustlin' like I didn't even care 
Wakin' up my neighbors poppin' pistols in the air 
Tryin' make a million pullin' all night flights I'm praying 'cause I'm
knowin that my life ain't right
Forgive 'cause I'm wrong but I'm begging or forgiveness
And now I'm hustlin' in a whole other business
Tryin' to do right for the people that I hurt 
in the process of growin up
I've change my ways i guess that's why I'm blowin up
I'm comin' back for all my peeps   
Just try to stay alive and keep your ass off the streets
For the ones that gotta hustle just to eat
Lord, I say a prayer for you before i fall asleep

Chorus

[Magic]
How man heard Sky's the Limit?
Shit i ain't finished this is only the beginning 
I'm with no limit
Just think I'm in my prime
If I'm not the best just give me some time and I'll change your mind
Niggas like me hard to find
Genuine I'm the only of my kind young black and full of pride
With a mind to teach the whole world
If you just listen to my words 
y'all can feel my pain
A lot of years wasted, buku friends died a lot of wet faces
The other half caught a bunch of fuckin' cases
So still a lot of tender spaces  
Wish I could erase the hate
Who said money makes you happy?
It can never bring back my daddy 
So fuck the Navi and Caddie 
I'm hopin' y'all could hear me
'cause I'm speakin' this from the heart
Me and my fans never torn apart

Chorus

[Magic]
And to the haters that be hatin' on my click
Find a spot in line or suck a nigga's dick
I'm gettin a lot of call now
Bunch of fake bustas I couldn't ever trust ya, 
fuckin blood suckers
Want me for the gift that you never thought I had
I saw your other side, but fuck it I'm mad
You say a lot of shit but you never ponit the finger
I'm guessin' that Mr. Magic gon' remember
Surprisin' a lot of so called superstars 
Passive comments but really don't want go to war
Not with me my reputation stands for itself
Just pull the disc out can't keep it on the shelf go and get it like
it's the last one left
I work the piss out the people who press 'em
I thank the lord for such a wonderful blessin'
Every word that I speak is a lesson 
hard to believe that this nigga is from the projects 

Chorus",Soldier
Magic,"Magic talking:

I'm that motherfucking nigga everyone asking about.

That nigga nigga Mr. Magic. (huh)
That nigga nigga Mr. Magic.

Chorus x2

That's me motherfucker that's me (Who that is be with P?)
That's me motherfucker that's me (Who that is be with see?)
That's me motherfucker that's me 
I'm the one they call Mr. fucking Magic

Verse 1: 

I treat the mic like a blunt so watch Mr. Magic get high
spitting lyrical fire 'til they day i die
y'all remember me as that shadow that jumped out of the midst
making hit after hit and got the whole rap game pissed
Got 'em wondering where I came from
straight from hell the first nigga to make Lucifer run
You underestimate my consistency
Look like you waiting a weak verse nigga you might as well get rid of me
Mad cause you can't trigger me
Which angle is I come from, mad cause you can't catch me son
I already won and believe the best is yet to come
I'll be flippin MC's until the day that I'm deceased
and got every record label waiting on my contract to be released
I mean all in the pentenaries, niggas is probably mentioning me
Give or take a couple of years, I'll be the man eventually
You can't stop what supposed to be
I'm the one, I'm the chosen man, That's ME

Chorus x2

Verse 2: 

I'm the whisper you can hear in every project hall
the conversation you can hear through every crack in the wall
the funny noises you can hear in your house when it's dark
the biggest upset in years cause I'm at the top of the charts
got niggas wondering why the fuck they struggling
I guess that's a fucked position that Magic put you in
But it's my turn so give me some breathing room
you ain't on a nigga's ass killer but that's cool
It's all to be expected shit you let me know I'm competition 
but there's a lot more to me that you niggas couldn't even vision
give you a run for your money and bitch I'll take your shit
I'll run your pussy ass home like a bitch
See ain't no studio up in me, better not offend me
I'll rape Barney and kill Officer Friendly
shoot at the sheriff and the motherfucking deputy
See I'm the one you looking for motherfucker that's ME

Chorus x2 

Verse 3: 

Just name a designated time and a designated place
point them niggas out and  I promise they be erased
Ain't a fake bone in my body, If I did I'd take it out
In front of the whole world so nobody would have doubt
that nobody could take me out, I'm just in a half-clout
Forgive me if I'm wrong but my money is what I'm bout
My dope is high coat, smoking po-po till I die
trying to make a couple mill 'fore the age of 25
I spin and been like a motherfucking tornado
cut your from nose to navel, now that shit gonna potato
It's kinda hard to believe that a nigga like me from the see-T-see
Went from serving fiends to posing in magazines
Nigga we hustled on the same corner
the only difference is my hustle was a little stronger
I say you should go and fear, you got the right worry
cause I was created to make end careers early, ya heard me?
That's me motherfucker that's me (huh)
That's me motherfucker that's me (nigga nigga what)
That's me motherfucker that's me (nigga nigga what)
I'm the one they call Mr. fucking huh what

You got me fucked up

Like them G.T. bitches, them Saint T. bitches, my No Limit bitches
Them boss bitches who 'bout they riches, and it ain't no secret
They want that soldier dick that you only get from that soldier clique

(Master P/Nino Brown)
Now when you shake that ass, I get rocked up
You got a boyfriend boo (Wodie, my man locked up)
Everytime you wobble wobble it gets me horny
So I can ride that ass from the night until in the morning
I could respect your mind, if you could respect the game
Is it cool to fuck, or is this about some change

hook

Got a nigga saying ""Ohhh girl""
Come a little closer, I'm trying to make you out my boo girl
Don't move girl, I'm on my way to the floor baby
Coming for mine, want to see if you can really shake it
Let's bump and grind, girl you did that

I'll be there for you baby, just beep me
Start paging soldier, when you want a freak male
I like freaking at your man's house, when he leave I toot
What would he say if he knew that I was sexing you

(C-Murder)
Let me see you wobble then shake it, then baby pop it, don't break it
You want love let's make it, I just can't wait 'til you naked

I'm from the city of the wickedest, cut throat connivers
We keeps it gutter, till the day that we die
We roam the streets at dark, all we got to survive
Is our hands and our heart, our balls and our word
Just for sitting in my hood, I be screaming until I'm horse
You ever touch one of mine, I'm coming for you and yours
If you ain't got to jack in the murder, you ain't shit
When you hear the blacka-blacka, you know somebody got hit
Hope it ain't none of mine, and if it's mine
I be coming to get you die trying, survival of the fittest
We the sickest no disrespect, but these boys got heart
It could be the dope, but these boys play the part
Murder capital, just a couple years back
In my city, itching to put us right back on the map
When you hear the click-clack, you know it's time to smash
Playa in chest-tolic, catch a bullet in the ass

I still hustled the block, I keep on cock the 17 shots
I'm a 9th Ward nigga, so I can't be stopped

With money on my mind, so somebody bound to die
Be careful what you say, cause if my people feel played
You bound to get sprayed, hole in your fade
I'm in between your braids, we love cracking domes
We love car jacking, and breaking in people homes
Love concealing weapons, illegal firearms
I'm a felon, ain't no papers on this pistol in my palm
Suicidal, murder mo' common than crawfish

Here come the ninth ward, ninth ward hard

Bitch, I was born and raised in the ninth ward
So you niggas don't bother me
You can say what you may about the ninth ward
But I bet you won't follow me

'Cross that canal where my niggas dwell
You know me well
'Cause I sold rocks, upon my block
Till I was hotter than hell

Every nigga down here remember me
Nothin' really changed but my gold teeth
I'm still that same nigga from my Flood Street
Only difference now is that I'm on my feet

And I don't sell dope no mo'
Don't rob no mo'
Mane a nigga don't plot no mo'
'Cause I'm performing in shows

Shakin' off hoes
Smokin' on optimos
It'll be a World War 3 fuck with me
Now my niggas won't let that ride

I'm the only nigga out there screaming 9th Ward
So people tryin' to keep me alive
Everywhere I go they see the nine on my arm
And they swear that I'm in a gang

But nigga this is a warning, I'm 'bout my hands
Like I'm 'bout them motherfucking thangs
I'm trouble starter just like my father
He was raised in the nine

So if you cut my arm it still tated in my mind
No matter millions or which ever the situation might come
I'll never forget you niggas
Never forget where the fuck I'm from

You know, you could take the nigga out the nine
But you can't take the nine out of nigga
Pulling capers is my nature
I'm addicted to making paper

Got my own way of living
Bitch, I'm from the see T see
Where niggas roam around looking for beef
Killing for free

I take this ward shit to heart
It's tated on my arm
So me and my niggas never part
I keep you niggas in my mind

For every clucker that I serve
For every nigga that I shot
For every tourist that I robbed
To every goddamn rock

For every cop that done chased me
To the bitches that hate me
What have you done for me lately
For every neighbor that was peeking at four o'clock in da morn

It never helped to lock me up
You could've left me alone
We learned to improvise on my block
Never had a ball

We played football wit' a concrete rock
Now picture that
I could never forget my mission
I'm a turn the nine into something bigger that yo' vision
Before I'm done the world'll scream

I'm from the ninth ward

Cross the canal, and the CTC

Ya heard me

[Magic]
Ain't nothing changed, still struggling trying to make an advance
I got a little loot, but I'm tired of spending hundreds of grands
I'm trying to blow a mill you feel me, never even missing
And me and my niggas have been rude, getting fitted
We destined to ball, we different from y'all
y'all like to shop, but we'd rather buy out the mall
Gots no friends, I gots to keep the fam with me
Has no pity gon bust bust, until empty
Out of love nigga, I...full of blood nigga
As somebody getting drugged nigga
I tried changing, but I guess this shit is deep in the blood
I guess that's why my mama calls me a thug, but still

[Chorus]
Take a walk through my hood
And everything seems to be a-o.k
See my niggas on the block still hustling
Living life, day by day
Don't get mad at us, just understand
That that's the way, playas play
Society done showed us the money
And the cars, and made us this way

We forever be some hustlers, don't trust us
Because we motherfucking hustlers - 4x

Now you can call me greedy
But I envy niggas balling harder
Then up comes, the 9th Ward shit starter
I'm the definition, it don't gets no clearer
Genuine, hundred percent, thug nigga
Full of fire, try me feel my flames
And let me prove, ain't a damn thang changed
Uh-huh, I'm thuggin' for my niggas, let it be heard
I represent the 9th no, disrespect to the Third
I got a obligation to show the world, how we thuggin'
How we does it, Orleans buzzers, I'll be there for you cousin
To smoke with you, choke with you, maybe crack a joke with you
Cause I use to be broke with you

I hustler harder than the average, kidnapping
And jacking, happens to be my favorite
See I did this on the regular nigga
I move swift like the Predator, nigga
To anialate my competitor, and to add to my decimals
See I ran with professionals, niggas
With big testicles, that's down for whatever
Put my life on the line, to keep my family straight
You niggas die when you in my way, motherfuckers

[Chorus]

(*talking*)
I did this here for my mo'fuckers, I ain't gon lie
I love you niggas from the bottom of my mo'fucking heart
9th Ward till the day I die, if a nigga can't respect that
Tell em stay the fuck out my face, cross the canal nigga",Hustler

Bout nothing, be my boo shh
You my main squeeze

I was wondering if I, could get with you
Then you, would be my boo
There's no limit, to things that we can do
You know I'll always be there
Go out with your boys, and run the streets
Don't care, bout who you meet
I know that you get hard, up on the ki's
No matter what, I'll be there

Come on and tell me, you gon' be there
And do the things, and let me know that you still care
You ain't tripping off, of knowing that I get around
That's why I'm digging you mama, because you still down
Yeah, we had our fuss and fights, but that's life
Leave mad, but I'm coming back home the same night
Say a couple things, to rub you wrong
It's make up time, baby tonight it's on
Something bout the way, that you making me feel
Keep me hustling, don't worry bout a damn bill
Just keep the loving coming, like when we touching stomachs
I get this chill up my spine, I'm so glad that that ass is mine
And just a sprinkle, of your voodoo
Got me hooked on, everything that you do
Yeah, that's why I believe in putting in over time
A fly precious the places, that gon' keep a nigga on your mind

Come on and scratch me, squeeze me
Tease me, don't give it to me easy
Sex games, keep the relations brand new oh
The way you dance in the dark, no way I'm leaving you boo
If you suck my soul, I'll play with your emotions
Belvedere on the rocks, will be the potion
The lust is getting greater, that I'm feeling inside
You like wine baby girl, you get better with time
I ain't satisfied, 'till you climax
It's all about you mama, is you feeling that
See I know, my woman's work
She's here when I'm happy, and here when I'm hurt
You make me want to stay home, leave my niggaz alone
'Cause you give a nigga the freedom, to go out and roam
You that twinkle, in a nigga's eyes
So I'ma do what's necassary, just to see you smile

When I'm out all times a night
Let me know girl (will you be there)
When I'm flying from state to state
Let me know girl (will you be there)
When I'm feeling like sexing you, from wall to wall
Let me know (will you be there)
When I'm feeling all down and out baby girl

Magic,"Listen, I wouldn't give a fuck if I get Ross Perot rich
You'll never catch me slipping, that's on the one, nigga
I keep shit tight 'cause I'm a solid nigga, you heard me
Even when I'm smoking on some doe-doe or sipping on some mo-mo
I always keep the 4-4, what, what

You fucking with niggaz, that's 'bout chilling
You fucking with niggaz, that's 'bout killing and digging a lot of holes
You playing with grown men, that'll beat you to mush
No matter the money or power, you could be touched

Ashes to ashes, nigga, dust to dust
You shorten your own life when you fuck with us
See, I was nurtured by the bosom of the block
That told me in a heated situation, grab the glock and pop

Until it stops and never turn back, you understand
Soon as you feel remorse, them niggaz got the upper hand
You'll never catch this nigga slipping
My peripheral vision, one big up on your own intentions so

So even when you catch me smoking on the doe-doe
Or sipping on a taste of mo-mo
I never leave the crib without the fo'-fo', that's a no-no
Somebody leaving with a bo-bo up in they go-go

So even when you catch me smoking on the doe-doe
Or sipping on a taste of mo-mo
I never leave the crib without the fo'-fo', that's a no-no
Somebody leaving with a bo-bo up in they go-go

Repetitive niggaz I go against, they don't have a chance
They won't survive, they'll tell you I'm a hell of a man
I devour the weak and dissesemble the strong
So called rappers with song after song

When will the world understand that I can't be stopped
It won't be as easy as it was with Pac
I'm smarter now, took a situation and learned
Can't trust a nigga 'cause niggaz'll get you burned

Watch paparazzi, a lot of stories'll turn
Trying to get you killed, behind the same money you earn
Shot my dog, scared of the power that he possessed
But it ain't over nigga, guess who's next

So even when you catch me smoking on the doe-doe
Or sipping on a taste of mo-mo
I never leave the crib without the fo'-fo', that's a no-no
Somebody leaving with a bo-bo up in they go-go

So even when you catch me smoking on the doe-doe
Or sipping on a taste of mo-mo
I never leave the crib without the fo'-fo', that's a no-no
Somebody leaving with a bo-bo up in they go-go

Give me a reason, I'll open fire like it's kill-a-nigga season
You heathens don't deserve breathing
I suck the life out of your body with every word that I speak
And when I'm finished, I'm hoping that that you deceased

I keep my enemies close, watch they moves, I ain't no fool
Just because I dropped out of school
It's called common sense and street smarts
Too much heart'll get you tossed in the park, nigga, lost in the dark

I live the laws of my land, where it's kill or be killed
So don't question if this pistol in my hand is real
Don't question if the stories that you heard are real
Just understand, nigga, this is how I was born for real

So even when you catch me smoking on the doe-doe
Or sipping on a taste of mo-mo
I never leave the crib without the fo'-fo', that's a no-no
Somebody leaving with a bo-bo up in they go-go

So even when you catch me smoking on the doe-doe

Magic,"What we gunna do right here is take a little smoke break...
Not the little white kind with the filters on it, 
But the kind that makes you high and elevates your mind. 
I'm talking bout...high.
[Chorus:]
Tell me which way is up 'cause I'm tryin to get fucked up. 
I want to get hiiigh (everybody knows I want to get high). 
If why'all could just leave me alone I could do this on my own. 
I'm tryin to get high.
That's all I want to do baby...Is get high
Roll it up blazed it up.
I ain't trying to get high I'm tryin to get fucked up.
Smokaholik.
I'ma fiend for the hizzerb.
Smoke anything green...Here lizard lizard.
I like to smoke til my eyes look chinese.
Fuck a dime bag give me four OZs.
Do you smell the aroma.
I'm about to fall in a Indonesia coma.
I fucks w/ snoop so you know what I need.
That's sticky icky with no stems or seeds.
I can't even drive, the smoke all in my eyes.
I don't give a damn, long as I'm high when I die.
Chain smoka I light a gook off of a gook.
I got it bad and I dunno what to do.
I inhale and exhale marijuana.
In church and all in front ya momma.
[Chorus]
When I'm sleeping...Ima blow be a gooky
When I'm hungry...Ima blow me a gooky
When I'm thirsty...Ima blow me a gooky
I'ma blow by myself or I'ma blow with my crew
This is my medicine
When I'm in pain no one makes me feel better than Mary Jane
I'm rappin just to make enough paper to gather up my shit and move to jamaica...Or Amsterdam where its legal
Smoke dogs that's my kinda people
Is there a rehab for niggas like me 
That's 25 and been smokin since 15?
I done forgot how it feels to be sober
Them days are over as long as I got doja
When its a drought I'm going out to Cali
Without a doubt 'cause that's what makes me happy
[Chorus]
Check this out
I love smokin that kiya
Long as a spia
And gets me higha
Its that stress free relaxation
No other drug is this elevation
So all my smokas it keeps me easy...easy...easy
And that's Fo sheezy
Let me smoke my, my marijuana
And stop harassin me-ijuana
I've smoked swisher sweets
Keep movin
You know what I'm doin(shit)
How many rappers you know brok as fuck?
I smoke weed like clockers smoke crack

And I watch you, until your vital signs stop
And walk off in the night, with no worries fuck the cops
This shit is real dog, play with us and watch how many pop up
In the junk yard scattered round, bodies all chopped up
If I flip out, I take a quick flight up out the country
Better ask somebody, Mr. Magic he acts a donkey
I spit shit that make the average, not stand a chance
And I keep spitting until the top dogs, know I'm the man
I'm running you back to the streets, go and hustle the corners
This time I'm playing for keeps, so I think you wouldn't want to

No trusting in one another, when the love not there
I promise thug life, niggas control this track
Since you niggas twisted the game, we just twisting it back
I'm related to hurting, hurting by material praise
Settle for less, and let the stress make us forget about better days
Have mercy, these demons wouldn't guide us right
We come if nobody's trying to make it, to the guiding light 
I'm a victim of living, pay me what you owe and hate
And let me die, with a smiling face
Just me and my people thugging forever, we no longer bleed no mo'
And who so ever approach us, don't wan breathe no mo' 
Give a blessing to every nigga, that held us down
My people issue in hell right now

I'm a ridiculous lyricist, you hear the fire in my vocals
You can't keep up, and oh well got me some more sales
Twenty five years old, but I'm young and I'm still learning
This shit just pours outta me, keep the c.d.s burning
Fuck gold, I'm trying to sell a couple of mill
If this ain't my year, then somebody is getting killed
Excuse my anger, but I feel like I'm being cheated
I won't be denied, I refuse to be defeated
If we broke we jacking, anything got cash
If I can't make it in this rap, y'all better kill my ass
'Cause I click off knock your dick off, and leave you stuck out
If I let you live, then pray nigga cause you been lucked out
Ahh I abuse you, and the shadow behind you
Beat you both to death, where they mama she couldn't find you
And them people that signed you, got to charge it to the game
Still the same, ain't a thang changed

Carry on the light, before the night is gone
the spirits of delight is free for everyone.
Carry on the light, before the night is gone
sing your song, for the princess of the dawn.

[1# Rap]
The journey's hard as I run to my castle,
the war is on, but the mind feels hassle,
of love and hate, bad and great.
My queen is there but still I have to wait.
For a woman, degree's a must.
360'..,Girl come with me.
Because the knight needs a life to lean on.
From morning to night until the break of dawn.
Full awareness, never careless.
Caress, oh yes, she has to have finesse,
So bring it on if you fit the picture,
then I'll get wit'cha and drop my scripture.
'cause the P-are-O-be	-L-A-see-K,
needs a queen to fit me today.
And if you're ready to let go,
then check the Swift as I start flow.

[2# Rap]
A hard day's job, has come and now gone,
step in the room, and what I feel is gloom,
'cause it's empty, no one to greet me.
Pain jumps in, only the mirror to meet me.
So I sit on back, write my text,
ink flows through out to I flex and plex
not a love letter, only a live getter,
pen after pen, as the paper get wetter,
the warrior, lyrical courier,
needs an amazon, and a strong type lover,
what's it gonna be, a simp or me ""G"".
Emotconal concept or a technicality,
not new to the game, so what's up?
Gimme your heart or else stay apart.
And I'll accept one or the other.
Princess or not, I'm still the true brother.",Carry On

Proven by the lyrics on the mike as I extend the cut 
Making music, as the girls move and shale their butts 
Suckers with the heart, try to battle even cheat me 
They can't compete, nor they defeat, or even beat me

Setting world on fire like a TNT explosion

Que era el hombre de tu vida y que me amas

No se lo que tienes en mente

Con tus amigas y todas me caen mal
Por eso te recibe la cartera
Un nombre de un hombre en tus letras
Y empece a temblar Nunca pensé que lo iba a esperar
Y empece a sudar pensando en lo que iba hacer y todo lo que yo te ame

Siempre e sido fiel contigo
Dime cuando no te demostré cariño
Solo quería tenerte ami lado
Sin saber q estabas jugando
Sabia que ibas a decir que don amigos
Pero ya no te creo como antes
Hay viene la salidera
Aquí viene el amargue

Y empece a dudar porque tu me llegas tarde a casa con una cara
Y empece a recordar de todo lo que hizo por ti y tu me lo desvuelves así

Y llorare, y moriré, y sufriré
Sin tu amor
Y llorare, y moriré, no quiero seguir sin tu amor

Me rompiste el corazon
Tanto que me hablaste del futuro cual futuro??
Abusaste de mi amor: cambie mi forma de ser tu no valías la pena mujer
Te vas arrepentir cuando recuerdes las cosas
Que te ofrecí dime quien te lo va a dar

Y ahora solo me puedes escuchar en la pista de una baile
Voy hacer el arte mas brillante que nunca
Y tu te quedas como antes con dudas fue tu decisión
Te deseo suerte y éxito",La Ultima Vez

[Verse 1: Magic (Ms. Peaches)] 
Let me explain my situation before we even conversate 
See I'm involved with this female that just can't be replaced 
So I'm just looking for a friend are you interested? 
'Cause I would love to see you butt-naked lying in my bed 

You won't regret a mintue just tell me what you like 
And I promise to make this the best night of your life 
(Now would you dine on me?) sure baby only the best 
(Now would you treat me like a queen?) only if you can pass the first test 

Is the pussy good? ( You just got to see for yourself) 
Well is you cold with it? (Oh believe me this is the best) 
It's just me and you and I won't tell nobody 
So put your hands on my hips and let your neck get rowdy 

If you suck my soul, I'll play with your emotions 
So at the point of pentration, your wetter than the ocean 
Getting aroused by my every motion 
As I'm getting aroused by your Victoria Secret's lotion 

I'm harder than an armadillian, can't fight this feeling 
If you get on all four, shoot that ass to the ceiling 
As I apply the pressure as she starts to moan 
Ohh if it's it's on...look 

Why is you biting at that pillow baby, screaming my name? 
(Because your working that dick, you got me going insane.) 
(Boy you'se a soilder) I told ya ( How you keeping your composer?) 
'Cause right before we started, I smoked three gards of dolja 

You getting the dope dick, I prepared for this 
Wanted to dick you down before I blasted 
The plastic got the bed down better than average 
It's only been an hour and she's speaking of marriage 

I get upset, but then I start to laugh and I can't blame her 
She's been exposed to Magic, 
No other man can make her feel like I make her feel 
(Shit I ain't trippin on your wife, I'm trying to keep it real) 

So what you sayin boo? Cause I'm hoping that I'm hearing you 
I told you from the jump there was no future in this 
(So what you sayin? Don't I fulfill your biggest fantasy) 
Nah to tell you the truth baby you bothering me 

I undressed you, only to sex you 
Gave you the dick and it must have impressed you 
(Man you shiesty ass niggas fucking make me sick

Don't you recall the day that you begged for the pussy, 
Paided for the pussy)

You just another lame nigga)

Came crashing down and turned us inside out

Help me Jesus I know what I am

I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

Almost a year now to the day
Since I was sent on my way
I got a place to stay
Down in that old suburban high rise
Where the first timer buys

Where every day is overcast
And the trains are always late
My head is somewhere in the past
So hang around and wait for time to pass

It's probably my mistake
And certainly no one else's heartache
I'm just another one to break
And a boy can get so confused
When there is nothing left to lose
I guess it's just my luck

When every lie I've tried to buy
Was never up for sale
These sour times weigh heavy
And have already tipped the scales

So come what may

We'll put on our best clothes
Bring only what we need
Douse the walls with kerosene
Drop a match from the mezzanine

Get into the car
We'll watch it from afar
As the flames kiss the sky
There's only you and I
Let it burn to the ground
Cause we're not hanging 'round

So in a voice so tender she asks if I could lend her a helping hand,
A hand that would end her strife
""Love is only for poets & dreams are for fools
And on all beauty you'll find time's always cruel
If you see what I see, then say after me
I'll fight my firight & do as you ask tonight""

Ever since my heart chose to choose her,
I've known I would lose her
But I will excuse her, I could never refuse her anything
Cause I'm not a poet, no I'm just a fool
And the beauty she speaks of keeps her as the exception to the rule
But I see what I see, so I know what it'll be
I'll fight my fright and I'll do as she's asked me to do tonight

All will be forgiven
It's from love that I've been driven
And time will skip a moment where it's perfect
And I'll kiss her lips as she slips away

You said you'd die for me
You said you'd die for me
So why can't you live for me

Try my best not to be scared

My darling curse
It's you and me versus the world
If I don't lose my nerve
And we'll get what we deserve

All this time I climb the walls
Never caved in ???
Broken heart won't restart
Whenever I'm around you in my ???

So take your time and don't be too late

Magnet,"For all that you breathe in, and all that you breathe out
You just can't breathe any life into something that's expired

Don't matter what you do, it doesn't matter what you've done

I'll be on your side
I'm on your side
You'll always find me on your side

I've seen your crazy eyes and I've heard your crazy talk
You can say it's just bravado, but go lightly where you go
Cause to see you dig that hole is piercing through my soul

Magnet,"I'm overjoyed and in the sun, the second time this year
I'm on a plane at thirty thousand feet, the only way from here is down
And that's ok with me
Cause I'm overjoyed and ready for the fall

It's no surprise that I've been forced to learn that bliss comes at a price
And here I am still mining gold from the soul I've sold like a whore
The finger of blame is pointing at me
Cause I lit that flame and now it's burning me
But I'm overjoyed and it's no surprise that I'm ready for the fall",Overjoyed
Magnet,"Please could you tell me why the hell you are so sad
Is it something I've said, something I haven't said
Or are you just bringing out your dead?
Don't worry baby, I'll be right beside you
I won't push you away, I won't push you to stay
I only wish I knew how to get you through the day

Please let me tell you, for whatever it is worth
I found the sunken treasure, buried beneath your perfect breasts
And like a lover should, I'm sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
So baby, smile to the world, although it never seems to smile back...",Smile to the World
Magnet,"At take off, my heart starts to race
Looks like everything is falling into place
But for this kind of miracle cure
It takes a lover's scorn to settle up the score

Breathe in, breathe out, it brings me closer
It's okay, it's alright, it happens every night
I've been chasing dreams all my life
Now life is but a dream

The chances are I'll never be the same
And it's a feeling I don't ever want to tame
'Cause I could spend the rest of my days
Watching her move with elegance and grace

Breathe in, breathe out, it brings me closer
It's okay, it's alright, it happens every night
I've been chasing dreams all my life
And now life is but a dream

Breathe in, breathe out, it gets me closer
It's okay, it's alright, it happens every night

And now life is but a dream

It's okay, it's alright, now life is but a dream

How he's going to give himself completely away to you
This time around
He says you will excel in a better day

But you will give a little more
And live a little less
You will give a little more
Just to find you'll live a little less than before

Please hear me out I am on your side here
Just like I've always been
B but to put things right, I need more time
'Cos I cannot think straight put it down to too much drink

But you will give a little more and live a little less
You will give a little more

To help myself out of this mess
And there's no need to worry, it was never my call
It was yours all along then I guess

Seems the damage has been done
Left a note and you were gone
But at least you said you loved me

I don't need you to be sorry and it wouldn't help me

Why it's so hard saying no, to a woman like you?

I came here today to tell what I now know
No secret, I guess, most already know this

But you don't call me no more
I still call you my love

It left you scarred and scorned

You're a terrible flirt
Cool and unfazed,
You're always amazed
When someone gets hurt
I live on the blue planet
That I saw in your eyes
But now I can't stay
Knowing it's made
Of beautiful lies

Like a long-lost lullabye
Will ring in your ears
Down through the years
Bringing a tear to your eye

Love can kill people, can't it
Well it still might kill me

Is a glass of champagne

When I drink I don't die

Whispering these familiar things
Talking to my little pet, smoking the same old cigarettes
I would have laughed

I saw you last in summertime
You said you hated long goodbyes
You said, ""There's nothing to explain, in every life a little rain""
Etcetera

And a long-forgotten fairytale is in your eyes again
And I'm caught inside a dream world where the colors are too intense
And nothing is making sense
There's a floating town of ire down in a mist of mystery
There's an old enchanted castle and the princess there is me
Decked-out like a Christmas tree

I guess you've had your little joke
But I have lost my sense of humor
My medication's wearing off, for it's just not strong enough
To cover this

Then you kissed me like before
I found myself wanting more
And you tell that little lie that kept me hypnotized
Another kiss

And a long-forgotten fairytale is in your eyes again
And I'm caught inside a dream world where the colors are too intense
And nothing is making sense
There's a floating town of ire down in a mist of mystery
There's an old enchanted castle and the princess there is me
Decked-out like a Christmas tree

If somebody told me I'd succumb
If someone said I'd be so dumb
After all the sleepless nights, when I turned on all the lights
I would have hit them

But I have turned the other cheek
My voice trembles, my knees are weak

And you beat me once again
And I know what happens then
You raise the ante

And a long-forgotten fairytale is in your eyes again
And I'm caught inside a dream world where the colors are too intense
And nothing is making sense",Long-Forgotten Fairytale
Magnetic Fields,"The moon was singing the blues
The stars in the sky harmonized
Singing it too
And I, far below
Was singing low and slow
For you
And I know
All the world was singing the blues
The Queen was singing the blues
The President played the saxophone
Sounded so along
It was on the news
And from Ursa Minor

In what looked like an all-night diner
Came lonely luminous creatures
Whose only human feature
Was singing the blues

And the gods in their caves,
They'd been waiting so long
To sing the blue song

And later and later

But I can't find the waiter
I really believe he's gone home
Oh god I wish I could go home

But it's infinitely late at night
Is this a blackout
Or am I losing my sight?

Otra noche sin dormir 
Recordando los momentos 
De mi vida junto a ti 
En la puerta del colegio 
Donde yo te conocí 
Fue un tropiezo y unos libros 
Que cayeron para que 
Mirándonos los dos 
Habláramos sin voz 
Yo nervioso y tu apenada 
Sentimos que el amor 
Se despertaba 

Cada puerta del colegio es 
Culpable de nuestro amor 
Cada puerta del colegio es 
La que me recuerda a ti 
Ahora que no estas aquí
Cada puerta del colegio es 
Como una mirada atrás

Donde vuelven a llorar 
Pensando que estas detrás 

Te sentabas a mi lado 
En las clases de Ingles 
Entre risas y caricias 
Planeábamos que hacer 
Cuando el año se acababa 
Me dijiste escúchame 
Tengo que cambiar de curso 
Pues me iré muy lejos 
Pero pronto volveré 
El mundo se me hundió 
Me rogaste que te esperara 
Pero están duro amor 
Te hecho de menos

And all before my life is gone I will try to understand

Will you remember me in the afterlife, will you show me where to go?

You were all that I know and I'm never letting go
You're forever in my heart and in my soul

Magnitude 9,"[Iron Maiden cover]

As the sun breaks, above the ground,
An old man stands on the hill.
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun.

We'll march 'til nightfall and scout a place to lie
Our enemy will not expect an attack, behind their lines
Send out the call to the ridings ones, to fall back 'til I give the word
By the sword they'll be dying here the price paid in an act of war

They better run for their lives, or stand and fight

Will we live through today, the battle will rage, on the attack
We will fight to defend all our own, no turning back
The plan has been made, tomorrow we raid
Knowing an ending is near
Despite of an outcome we fear, no turning back.

What is the cause for outrage, is there more than meets the eye?
Our sanity is displaced, by the choice to fight or die
I hear the cries of the dying ones
As we fight through the bloody war
Our enemies turn and run away,""It's not worth fighting for""

They better run for their lives, or stand and fight
They'll make the sacrifice, forever we roam

Will we live through today, the battle will rage, on the attack
We will fight to defend all our own, no turning back

No clues to how you will fare
The spirit implores you tread where you dare

The dust lies thick on casket rich or quite poor
Distinction disappears the worm both deplore
The candle burns out once more
But the spirit inside you won't be ignored

I give you freedom from your cares

Treasure is lost
Lesson is golden
Hearts have been crossed
So here's to the heros
Come one and come all
Without them well who knows
Well who knows at all

In these days of no trust
Evermore hostility
We're all living under the same old sky
We're all living telling the same old lie
In these days of no trust

And music recorded
Might influence dreams
But headlines are courted
By stretch limosines
Pictures of plenty
Are stuck to the wall
For heads that are empty
Brains on the floor
Can't take any more

Someone is shouting
Revolution is here
He'll climb any mountain
For his selfish career
The truth's not a curtain
To be drawn back and forth
It's a flame that keeps burning
Everlasting touch

We're all living telling the same old lie

A time for charity,

Magnus Uggla,"Där borta vid pilen har jag lagt min far 
En anonym urna är allt som finns kvar 

Av den som förstod mig, när jag var till besvär 
Trots all den kärlek fanns jag ej där 

Jag önskar jag stannat, jag skulle blitt kvar 
Den sista stunden, det borde vart jag, och min far 

Han lärde mig växter och dess namn på latin 
Om fideikommiss och Boursin 

Men följde mig gärna in glamrockens land 
Tog del av min kunskap om engelska band 

Allt från John Strummer till Johnny Mars 
Stod på agendan då det var jag, och min far 

Jag saknar hans humor, som var hans sigill  
Den som la grunden för att jag finns till 

Som präglat min uppväxt, ända fram till I dag 
Som gjort att min son är densamma som jag 

Jag får ta del av drömmar han har 
På samma vis som då det var jag, och min far 

Där borta vid pilen, har jag lagt min far 
En anonym urna är allt som finns kvar 

Fast jag fann aldrig modet till att säga adjö 
Trodde nog aldrig att du kunde dö

Vi ska enas I jorden jag, och min far

Su rostro jamás descubrió
Su nombre ocultó

En el tejado del tiempo
En el desván de los sueños
Se ahoga una voz:
No creas en todo lo que veas
Sólo haz caso a tu intuición

Y si albergas la duda
Nunca hallarás consuelo en tu interior
Lanza bien los dados
Porque el juego del camino ha comenzado

Agudiza tu ingenio
Sí­rvete de mancias
Sí­rvete del tarot
Lee en el alma del bosque
Y adivina dónde la muerte se escondió",La Cruz de Santiago
Mägo de Oz,"Cuanto más he de esperar
Cuánto más he de buscar
Para poder encontrar
La luz que sé que hay en mí
He vivido en soledad
Rodeado de multitud
Nunca he conseguido amar
Pues no me quiero ni yo
Cuando veas una estrella fugaz
Guárdala en tu corazón

Es el alma de alguien que consiguió
Dar a los suyos su amor
Cuando oigas a un niño preguntar
Por qué el sol viene y se va
Dile : porque en esta vida no hay
Luz sin oscuridad
Si eres capaz de devolver
Con una sonrisa una traición
Si eres capaz de dar tu mano a quien
Con la suya te señaló

No eches raíces en un sitio, muévete
Pues no eres un árbol, para eso tienes dos pies
El hombre más sabio es el que sabe que su hogar
Es tan grande como pueda imaginar
Cuando veas una estrella fugaz
Guárdala en tu corazón
Es el alma de alguien que consiguió
Dar a los suyos su amor
Cuando oigas a un niño preguntar
Por qué el sol viene y se va
Dile : porque en esta vida no hay
Luz sin oscuridad

El mejor día es en el que el alma
Tiene hambre y sed
No olvides lo aprendido
No dejes de comprender
Rodéate de buenos
Y tú lo parecerás
Rodéate de sabios
Y algo en ti se quedará
Cuando veas una estrella fugaz
Guárdala en tu corazón
Es el alma de alguien que consiguió
Dar a los suyos su amor
Cuando oigas a un niño preguntar
Por qué el sol viene y se va
Dile : porque en esta vida no hay
Luz sin oscuridad",La Danza del Fuego

Ni te apoques con la pobreza
Que ni la derrota ni el fracaso te impidan

Las más al Reino de Luz llegarán
Las menos al Reino del Mar del Olvido

Criticar mi oficio ¡que no es porvenir!,
Que alimento la hoguera de la imaginación. 

Puede que la lluvia caiga sobre el cielo, 
Que el mar, confundido, vaya a un río a morir, 
Que en la noche cante el gallo a la mañana,
Que con las ánimas se fue a divertir.

Entre estrofas encontraras mi hogar,
Ella espera a que regrese 
Y mientras yo guardo sus besos y su voz
En mi corazón.

Y me he dado cuenta que están en mi,
Comunicador de sueños quiero ser

Conductor de sensaciones a tu piel, 
Fabrico recuerdos que atas con nostalgia a mi canción.

Soy escultor del alma, 
Soy músico y amo en clave de sol
Hasta que aguante mi voz.

Somos trovadores que en tu ciudad 
Damos pinceladas de color 
A tu gris realidad. 
Somos mitad caballeros,
Mitad bohemios y embusteros,

Mägo de Oz,"Oigan la historia que les cuento,
Por testigo pongo al tiempo, que así ocurrió:
El dios de la lluvia gemía why lloraba
Why, por séquito, la niebla le acompañó.

Segundos antes de medianoche,
En la hora en que las brujas toman el té
Donde el horizonte del bosque se esconde,
En un claro, un posada a lo lejos se ve.

Su nombre era Kelpie,
La dama del amanecer,
En la noche de los difuntos
Se le puede ver.
Tu alma quiere poseer.

Atormentada
Que su príncipe era
De los de prometer al meter
Why una vez yacido olvidar lo prometido
Why los nueve meses ni el pelo se dejó ver.

Su nombre era Kelpie,
La dama del amanecer,
En la noche de los difuntos
Se le puede ver.
Tu alma quiere poseer.

Por conocer varón fue condenada,
Enterrada en vida entre muros, Kelpie murió,
Why desde aquel día su alma te guía
Hacia la posada donde le conoció.

No beses su boca
Si a medianoche tú la ves,
Pues si acaricias esos labios
Siempre morirás de pie
Entre los muros, ya hay ciento diez.

Su nombre era Kelpie,
La dama del amanecer,
En la noche de los difuntos

Mägo de Oz,"Quiero ser tu piel en el invierno 
Para que el frío en ti no pueda entrar
Quiero ser la luz en tu camino
Sol en la noche, agua dulce en el mar
Ser la puerta que nunca deje pasar 
Al largo silencio y a la soledad

Ser distintos cuerpos con un mismo fin
Ser, cariño mío, ser yo en ti

Y si he de romper cadenas que me aten 
A la costumbre, yo las partiré

Y si he de mover montañas que en mi mente 
No me dejen verte, mi amor, las moveré

Pongo por testigo a dios que no te fallaré
Yo seré consejo, nena, pero no tu juez

Que me quiten esta jodida cruz

¿Quién me vende un alma 
Y me presta esperanza? 
Pues es el fin del camino 
Y no sé adonde ir 

Más amargo que la muerte 
Es no poder volverte a ver 
Yo no he elegido perderte 
Hay un vacío que ha violado mi ser 

Padre, ¿por qué me has abandonado? 
¿Por qué siempre haces tu voluntad? 
Es tan cómodo el haberme enviado 
Y dirigir desde tu pedestal 

¿Quién me vende un alma 
Y me presta esperanza?

No por sobrevivir 
Se que llegará el día
En que llueva libertad
Y que escrito en la luna
Con la tinta de un clavel
Se lea “vive en paz” 

No dejes que la melancolía
De tu memoria sea el retrovisor
No dejes que una frontera consiga
Determinar el país de una flor

Me despido de la mar
En otra vida volveré

Se hizo la luz, y en su cama junto a él

Fue como aquel beso que no dio 
Como ese “te quiero” que negó 
Llego la hora de echar cuentas y el lloró 
Tu representaras a todo ese horror 
Que enferma y mata el planeta 
Al condenarme 
Abortaste también tu perdón

Sangra por vuestra ambición

Toda su vida ante el desfiló 
Vio su niñez, no se reconoció 
Su inocencia murió por su ambición 
¡la asesinó!

Aparecieron en su mansión 
Un ciervo anciano y un halcón, 
Un bosque quemado y un sauce llorón 
Esto un juicio y este el tribunal 
Que ha de condenar tu usura 
El ozono es el fiscal y una ballena el juez 
Un río contaminado en pie 
Hace pasar al jurado 
Formado por la justicia, el amor 
Y algún pez

Busca una nutria a su amor y ve 
Que lo acaban de asesinar 
Ha muerto a golpes de sin razón 
Solo querían su piel 
Y no entiende porqué, si ellos tienen piel 
Matan por otra tener 
Le intenta despertar, pues va a amanecer 
Y han quedado en ver salir el sol 

Has de pagar y este tribunal 
Te condena a un árbol ser 
Y cuando tengas sed, sólo de beber 
Lluvia ácida tú tendrás 
Y la nutria lloró, pues vio que su amor 
De nuevo tenía piel 
Y el sol se despertó y corrieron a ver 
Un nuevo amanecer
¡y el mar sonrió! 
Cuentan que tras una tormenta ayer 
El viento derribó a un árbol que su tronco, de casa sirvió a un castor 
Todo mal que me hagas, a ti te lo harás

Padre nuestro, de todos nosotros

De los desheredados y de los dueños de la miseria 
De los que te siguen y de los que en ti, ya no creemos

En la tentación caigo a diario 
No hay mañana en la que no esté tentado de crear un Dios humilde, justo
Un Dios que esté en la tierra
En los valles, los ríos 
Un Dios que viva en la lluvia 
Que viaje a traves del viento 
Y acaricie nuestra alama 

Un Dios de los tristes, de los homosexuales
Un Dios más humano 
Un Dios que no castigue, que enseñe 
Un Dios que no amenace,que proteja
Que si me caigo, me levante
Que si me pierdo, me tienda su mano 
Un Dios que si erro, no me culpe 
Y que si dudo, me entienda 
Pues para eso me dotó de inteligencia 
Para dudar de todo

Mägo de Oz,"Si crees que todo cuanto has escuchado
No tiene contigo nada que ver,
Estás amigo equivocado, párate a ver, párate a ver.
Todos soñamos con ser
Un caballero why tener
Algo por lo que luchar
why un amor que defender
Si tienes un ideal, un principio
Defiéndelo why aférrate a él,
Alguien escribió que la vida es sueño,
why los sueños, sueños son.
Sé rebelde cómo el mar
why sé noble porque al final
De ésta vida llevarás
Tu libertad.
No importa cuán loco te crean todos
Manténte firme, manténte en pie,
Buscar tu sitio,
Encontrarte a ti mismo
Es tu misión, es la razón.
Grítale al cielo que no
Quieres ser sólo uno más
Ancha es Castilla why el sol
Tu caminar guiará.
",Ancha Es Castilla
Mägo de Oz,"Cuánto ha de esperar
Para al fin poder hallar
La otra mitad de mí
Que me acompañe a vivir
Nadé tiempo en un mar
De apariencia, y ahogué el amor
No sé puede ocultar
El perfume de una flor
Cuánto me cuesta sobrevivir
Cuánto sonreír
Sin poder quitarme el antifaz
Que me disfraza de normal
Y volveré a buscarte
Allí hasta donde estés
Tan sólo quiero amarte
Y poder tener

Alguien en que apoyarme
Alguien en quien volcar
Todo el amor que cercenó el qué dirán
No más miedo a entregar
Mis labios sin antes mirar
No más miedo a acariciar
Nuestros cuerpos y soñar
A la mierda con
El armario y el diván
Y si hay que luchar
Luchar es educar
Que en asuntos del corazón
No hay regla de dos
Que somos distintos, somos iguales
No más guetos, alza la voz

Y cuando llegue el final
El otoño de nuestro amor
Yo te esperaré, mientras, vive
Y lucha por tener
Derecho a elegir
Con qué cabeza tu almohada compartir
Orgulloso de ser quien eres
Y no como deberías ser
Cuánto me cuesta sobrevivir
Cuánto sonreír
Sin poder quitarme el antifaz
Que me disfraza de normal",El Que Quiera Entender ...
Mägo de Oz,"De la noche de los tiempos 
De tu oscuridad 
He regresado a buscar 
Un don para la humanidad 

Y no pronuncias mi nombre 
Aunque bien sabes quién soy 
De tu soberbia y tu odio 
El reflejo alimentado soy 

Soy el eco de tu ira
El espejo en que 
Tu avaricia se refleja 
Y me da poder 

Fluyo a través de las vidas 
Que no consiguen saber 
Donde encontrar la salida
Que abre la puerta del mal y el bien 

Ven hacia mí 
Y déjame morar en ti 
Soy el deseo

¿Cuánto da? 
Soy el que soy 
El portador de luz 

Cubre tu manto, mi luz y mi amor 
Suave es el óbito y dulce este dolor 
Tómame y el viento hará una canción
Con el fuego eterno que sellará nuestra unión

Toma mi sangre, mézclala, bébela 
Quémala, arde en la llama 
Pues sólo así podrás adorarme

Mägo de Oz,"Hoy al ver la televisión como siempre ahí estás tú 
Luchando por conseguir llegar a la tierra de la felicidad 

Están haciendo que entre los dos hagamos muros de rencor 
Y así nunca conocernos tú y yo 

Me pregunto que podemos hacer, es tan difícil olvidar 
Quiero ser, si estás junto a mí, el primero en perdonar 

Hoy quiero creer en un futuro que no sea tan cruel 
Y quizás dejar a nuestros hijos un mundo de paz 

Se que no puede ser verdad la verdad de un dios tan ruin 
Que consiente el poder matar inocentes a su voluntad 

Creo que ha llegado ya la hora de enterrar 
A esos dioses que han hecho tanto mal 

Me pregunto qué podemos hacer, es tan difícil olvidar 
Quiero ser si estás junto a mí el primero en perdonar 

Hoy vuelvo a creer en un futuro que no sea tan cruel 
Y poder dejar a nuestros hijos en un mundo de paz",La Canción de Los Deseos
Mägo de Oz,"Érase una vez hace 
Hace mucho tiempo ya 
Un reino perdido en un lejano lugar 

La noche se rindió 
Al sueño de la eternidad 
Ritos, brujería, almas buscando la paz 

No duermas, no entres, no mires atrás 
No grites, no escuches, no reces no te servirá 

La noche da paso al ritual 
Despertando la maldición 
El bosque está hechizado por el mal 
Hay luna llena protégete 

Cada alma en pena 
Es un árbol condenado 
A convertirse en ser humano 
Y buscar la luz 

Difuntos, no muertos, con una historia que contar 

Sus ojos son pozos de dolor 
Madrigueras de pena y tristeza 
Embalses de estancada soledad 
Y cada árbol es su ataúd 

Bienvenido a la ciudad 
De los árboles perdidos 
Donde nada es lo que ves 
Donde nada es realidad 

Has llegado a la ciudad 
Al país de los perdidos 
Donde cada anochecer 
Se oyen árboles llorar",La Ciudad de Los Árboles
Mägo de Oz,"Siempre has soñado con poder salir 
De tu cárcel de cristal 
Y las paredes de tu habitación 
Se parten el culo de ti 

Hoy los barrotes que hacen tu prisión 
Son el miedo a fracasar 
Son invisibles, son un disfraz 
Con el que amueblaron tu hogar 

Deja de llorar 
Por lo que un día perdiste 
Deja ya de esperar 
Que el tiempo te calme 
La ausencia que causa un adiós 

Deja de llorar 
Tus lágrimas te van a ahogar 
Sálvate 
Y no te fallaré 

Echa a andar 
Y si la vida te pisa 
Desenvaina una sonrisa 
Y vuélvete a levantar 

Se que es muy fácil ponerme en tu piel 
Se que es jodido vivir 
Pero no existe fuerza motriz 
Más fuerte que tu voluntad 

Deja ya de esperar 
Y achica tus penas con risas 
No quita la soledad 
Las manchas de olvido 
Que deja un adiós al pasar",Deja de Llorar (Y Vuélvete a Levantar)
Mägo de Oz,"Soy la magia, soy la luz

Mägo de Oz,"Yo siempre fui lo que quise ser 
Y nunca me arrepentí, ¡no! 
A veces salgo fuera de la ley 
Y luego vuelvo a entrar 

No tengo fronteras 
Mi patria es mi nevera 
Mi himno es un rock’n’roll 

Tengo bragas por bandera y por casa tus caderas 
Cuando el sol se pone, yo también 

¡mi moto es mi uniforme!

Y cuando muera que se lea en mi tumba 
Mi nombre es rock’n’roll 

Nunca creí en la biblia, ¡no! 
Ni en la torá ni el corán 
Mi fe en un libro no cabe, es mucho más 
Está hecha de libertad 

Viviré, viajaré, moriré, vestiré 
Sin traje ni corbata que me ate a su ley 

El viento peina mis recuerdos 
Barre los malos momentos

Mägo de Oz,"Hay miedos que se acurrucan 
Entre uno y otro escalón 
De la escalera que sube 
De tus sueños hacia el sol 

Y te acechan y no dejan 
Que tú elijas tu lugar 
No queda sino batirnos 
No queda sino luchar 

Hay dudas que nos mutilan 
Hay deudas del corazón 
Hay días que nos estorban 
Hay “dioses” que van de dios 

Pero hay voces que no callan 
Si las sabes escuchar 
Son los gritos de tu gente 
Que te animan a luchar 

Y verás que en la vida hay que sufrir 
Y verás que en la vida hay que luchar 
Y al final si eres fuerte ganarás 
No queda sino batirnos 
No queda sino luchar 

Ten cerca siempre a un amigo 
Y al enemigo a tu par 
Para aprender como piensa 
Y cuando actue reaccionar 

Las traiciones que bien matan 
Son las hechas con amor 
Y no hay estocada más grande 
Que el acero de una voz 

Y verás que en la vida hay que sufrir 
Y verás que en la vida hay que luchar 
Y al final si eres fuerte ganarás 
No queda sino batirnos 
No queda sino luchar 

Y el sudor de tu frente saciará 
Tu sed de tener sueños y vivir 
Y la vida será tu mayor rival 
No queda sino batirnos 
No queda sino luchar 

Hay miedos que se acurrucan 
Si les cobija tu voz",No Queda Sino Batirnos
Mägo de Oz,"Hace algún tiempo que yo naufragué 
Entre la playa de su juventud 
A la deriva se me hundió un amor 
Y mi vida se encalló 

Hace ya tiempo que emborraché 
Todos los versos que un día canté 
Con el aliento que da una mujer 
Que ya no volverá 

Hice inventario de lo que perdí 
Eché las cuentas de lo que invertí 
Años de lucha, noches sin dormir 
Y ahora soy músico y te tengo a ti 

Quiero cantar quiero gritar 
Quiero vivir en libertad 
Quiero morir cerca de ti 
Quiero encontrar lo que perdí 

Por las esquinas de alguna canción 
Vende su alma a veces la ilusión 
Pero jamás la mía venderé 
Rockero moriré 

Abrigo derrotas y les doy calor 
Con una rima que cosí a mi voz 
Maquillo nostalgias y les doy color 
Con pentagramas que pinté 

Quiero cantar quiero gritar 
Quiero vivir en libertad 
Quiero morir cerca de ti 
Quiero encontrar lo que perdí 

Quiero cantar quiero gritar 
Para que entiendas que yo fui 
Solo un juglar que se escondió 
Entre canciones y una voz",El Rincón de Los Sentidos
Mägo de Oz,"Suelo imaginarme 
Cuando lo quiero dejar 
Que existe un mundo escondido 
Donde van a parar 

Cada lágrima que lloré por ti 
Y todo el veneno que inoculaste en mí 
Sus ríos son canciones que deje a deber 
Son desagües de mi ayer 

Seguiré caminando por la vida 
Sin volver la vista atrás 
Nunca dejé una partida 
Lucho siempre hasta el final 

Es el foro de la envidia 
Vertederos de opinión 
Donde se almacenan odios 
Cárcel de una canción 

Venderme es hacerte caso 
En vez de a mi corazón 
Y si es tan fácil, hazlo tú 

Seguiré caminando por la vida 
Sin volver la vista atrás 
Nunca deje una partida 
Lucho siempre hasta el final 

Viviré peleando con la vida 
Venderé cara mi piel 
Sin lamerme las heridas 
Y si molesto me quedo y que os den! 

Al menos tengo tu odio 
Tengo tu rencor 
Y si yo me pudro 
Te envenenará mi olor","Si Molesto, Me Quedo"
Mägo de Oz,"Desde que no estás 
El escenario duerme 
Sólo con tu voz despertará 

Si pudieras ver 
Lo mucho que me faltas 
Mi guitarra se ha muerto de pie 

Cada noche es un acto de amor 
Y el concierto se hace una cama 
Pero faltas tú, tu respiración 
Es la nana que me calma 

Sin ti sería silencio 
Sin ti se muere mi voz 
Sin ti tiritan de frío 
Los sueños de cada canción 

Porque si no estás 
Quien me va a curar 
De mi soledad 
Porque sin tu voz 
No me curaré, hoy quiero cantar 

Desde que no estás 
Los minutos se hacen horas 
La derrota silba una canción 

Dime dónde estás 
Necesito que tus manos 
Maten mis miedos al aplaudir 

Cada noche yo te imagino aquí 
Regalándome tu mirada 
Abrazándome con brazos de luz 
Tu sonrisa era mi almohada 

Dile a las estrellas 
Ahora que eres eternidad 
Que te busque un buen sitio 
Una buena localidad 

Necesito oírte 
Necesito que tu voz 
Nunca se borre de mi ser 

Sin ti sería silencio 
Sin ti se muere mi voz 
Sin ti tiritan de frío 
Los sueños de cada canción 

Porque si no estás 
Quien me va a curar 
De mi soledad 
Porque sin tu voz 
No podré escuchar a un ángel cantar","Sin Ti Sería Silencio, Pt. 2"
Mägo de Oz,"Ya no siento el amor 
No me sirve de nada 
Si me niegas tus besos 
No tengo tu boca 
Y se me parte el alma

Siempre confie en ti 
Ahora me siento solo 
Me dejaste tirado 
Tu acto, tu ausencia 
Y te fuiste con otro

Con los gatos me muevo 
Por todos los tejados 
Rogando a las estrellaz 
Pidiendo a la luna 
Que vuelvas a mi lado 

Y ahora voy a salir 
A beber en los bares 
Para olvidarme de ti 
Y volver a vivir 
Y pasarlo bien padre

Maldita sea mi suerte 
Mira que tonto e sido 
Me undo en mis recuerdos 
Como me arrepiento 
De haberte conocido 

Me busque a los colegas 
Los tenia olvidados 
Me apartaste de ellos 
Maldita pendeja 
Jamás me han fallado

Y ahora voy a salir 
A beber en los bares 
Para olvidarme de ti 
Y volver a vivir 
Y pasarla bien padre

Que me entierren aquí 
Envueltito en frijoles 
Entre aztecas y mayas 
Que viva la raza 
Viva mexico 
¡cabrones!

Y ahora voy a salir 
A beber en los bares 
Para olvidarme de ti 
Y volver a vivir 
Y pasarla bien padre

Y que chingue a su madre",Y Ahora Voy a Salir (Ranxeira)

Que los dioses dieran jamás a ningún ser vivo 

La brisa, el viento, el hermano sol y la hermana luna 
Campos y praderas donde ver crecer a nuestros hijos 
Amaneceres bañados con el perfume que estornudan las flores en primavera 
Puestas de sol decoradas por los sueños aun por concebir 
Y aunque parezca mentira inteligencia 

Pero el hombre blanco despreció aquel tesoro 
Y a medida que la vida le sonreía
El le contestaba dando patadas al destino 

Si alguien lee esta carta, no olvide que el fin de esta civilización 
Se debió al egoísmo, codicia e incultura de la raza humana 

Los hombres ya no somos mamíferos 
El ser humano no se convirtió en depredador 
La raza humana somos simplemente un virus 
Matamos, crecemos, y nos multiplicamos 

Por eso nos extinguimos 
Por eso las aguas se tragaron nuestra civilización 
La verdadera atlántida, éramos nosotros 

Y por eso hemos escrito esta nota 
Para formas de vida inteligente venideras
Cuando los hombres escupen al suelo
Se escupen a si mismos",Atlantia
Mägo de Oz,"Cuando cae la noche 
Es hora ya de curar 
Todas las heridas del vivir 
Y al abrigo de un fuego 
Con una canción 
Hacer la colada al corazón

Cuando muere el día 
Es hora ya de contar 
Las bajas que ha habido en la razón 
Y alicatar con susurros las paredes del ayer 
Para que luzca el perdón

Si el aire trae aroma 
De una pena 
Quebranto del alma 
Por una condena

Córtale a una estrella fugaz 
Un mechón de pelo
Y podrás volar

Doy ladridos a mi mala suerte 
Al alba yo tendré su favor 
Y el amor quizás me sea propicio 
Tal vez me regale su perdón

Cuando las lágrimas 
Den brillo a tu cara 
Y un manantial bañe tu mirada 

Cierra los ojos duerme y verás 
Atrévete a vivir 
Atrévete a perder y a ganar

Puede que 
Hoy no seas feliz 
Pero un nuevo día vendra 
Aun amanece gratis para ti 
Si buscas otra oportunidad

Busco un rincón donde abandonar 
Toda tristeza que hay en mí 
Donde la vida no haga pagar 
Impuestos por querer vivir

Puede que 
Hoy no seas feliz 
Pero un nuevo día vendra 
Aun amanece gratis para ti

Quebranto de grietas 
Entre tú y yo 
Despedidas y una canción",Aun Amanece Gratis

El cielo llora hace charcos y yo 
Siento que se me escapa la vida ante mí 

No te olvides de mí 
Ahora voy hacia un lugar 
En donde no existe el miedo 
Donde no vive el adiós 

Me marcharé 
Montado en la brisa del mar 
Yo viviré en tu memoria 
Y dormiré en tu corazón 

Ahora soy volcán, desastre natural

Ya nadie puede mis gritos ahogar 
Pues ayer aprendieron de rabia nadar 

No te olvides de mí 
Ahora voy hacia un lugar 
En donde no existe el miedo 
Donde no vive el adiós 

Me marcharé 
Montado en la brisa del mar 
Yo viviré en tu memoria 
Y dormiré en tu corazón 

Y al amanecer, al morir la oscuridad 
Yo regresaré, yo seré el huracán 
He puesto a secar mi venganza frente al sol 
Llegará al fin la venganza final

Las brujas son la voz, sortilegios de su amor

Un tentáculo nos cuidará
Velas negras iluminarán
Abre el libro de las sombras que 
La misa va a empezar

Llévame contigo al más allá, pues aquí no dejo de llorar
Llévame a otra realidad, no quiero despertar
Junto a ti por fin podré olvidar, que la pena siempre fue mi hogar
Llévame, no puedo respirar, quiero tenerte junta a mí

Invocamos a otra realidad
Conectamos con una deidad

Mägo de Oz,"Cuando ella se fue, le anidaron las despedidas
Su alma se murió y ahora solo queda la herida
“nunca te podre olvidar” susurró al despedirse de él
No te olvidare
Y una lágrima se ahorcó, harta de tanto llorar

Quiero morirme en ti sobre tu pecho, abrázame
Ella gritó: quiero vivir en ti, no me olvides, cuídate
Y ella murió, ahora es estrella fugaz

Desde que se fue la luna se ha deshecho en un charco
Lágrimas que ayer eran mares, agua de ti
Nada ya será igual, se despeinan mis días sin ti
Ya no puedo mas
Cuando muere una flor, se marchita de pena un jardín

Quiero morirme en ti sobre tu pecho, abrázame
Ella gritó: quiero vivir en ti, no me olvides, cuídate
Y ella murió

Quiero ser la brisa que despeine penas de ti
Quiero ser la lluvia que borre lágrimas de tu corazón

Y arropa tu labios en el

Hará de tu cuerpo canción

Seras soledad si estará vivir 
En el rellano de ti
Dibuja ventanas con tintas de adiós 
Deja escapar el dolor
Y vestirás de sonrisas tu despertar 
De caricias de libertad primaveras en ti

Dónde esta tu gran amor
Sácale brillo a una pena 
Y no dejes morar la pasión

Dónde están los sueños por cumplir 
Dónde está todo tu honor

Y que un beso te arrope al dormir

Deja que otros labios 
Se escondan en ti, no les dejes morir
Deja que la luna se vista de ti

Dónde van los besos a morir
Dónde va tanto dolor
Dónde están tus ganas de luchar
Dónde esta tu gran amor

Como el mar, tus ojos serán donde naufragar

La piel que hoy habita en mí 
Está hecha de besos, está hecha de ti
Tu pelo me recordó 
Que existen sogas de amor

Y esta carta llega a su fin
Me despido, cuídate
Aunque te olvides de mí, no te olvides de vivir

Si supieras las noches que robo al olvido pensando en ti
Si supieras lo roto que me has dejado el corazón
Y a pesar de que duele, te juro que trato de estar sin ti
Como el mar, tus ojos serán donde naufragar

Si supieras las noches que robo al olvido pensando en ti
Si supieras lo roto que me has dejado el corazón

¿Dónde estás? 

Pues mi recuerdo se ha echado a llorar",Si supieras...
Mägo de Oz,"Esta es al verdadera historia de mery

Ella era un volcán con cuerpo pa'pecar 
Sus cabellos rojos eran como el fuego 
Donde todos querian arder 
Y quemarse hasta el amanecer 

Despues de cerrar la barra era ornamento 
De varones jovenes para cenar 
El otro menú lo daban más adentro 
El pescado del día tal vez 
Y la almeja en su jugo pa díez 

Por condena soledad 
Y entre sus piernas un quízas 
De volver a sonreir 
De volver a ser felíz 

Dulce mery donde está? 
Quíen robo tú juventud 
Alquilando algo de amor 
Tú oficina era un colchón 
Extendiendo cheques de dolor 

Y asi conoci a esa bella tabernera 
Cuando estando hambriento yo pedi cenar 
Ella sonrio de forma le sugiero 
La comida ella me ofrecio 
De rodillas me comio la 
Pocas veces he cenado tán liviano 
Pocos sitios hay con menú tan especial 
Salimos sofocados y no era verano 
Aún conservo el cerco de carmín 
Rodeandome la otra naríz 

Por condena soledad 
Y entre sus piernas un quízas 
De volver a sonreir 
De volver a ser felíz 

Dulce mery donde está? 
Quíen robo tú juventud 
Alquilando algo de amor 
Tú oficina era un colchón 
Extendiendo cheques de dolor 

Pasaro los días, crecierón las flores 
Nunca la olvide pues ella sigue en mí 
Desde aquella noche aún tengo picores 
Y más bichos que en todo un jardín 
He dejado de cenar allí 

Por condena soledad 
Y entre sus piernas un quízas 
De volver a sonreir 
De volver a ser felíz

Mägo de Oz,"Cuando las estrellas vuelvan a brillar 
Cuando haya caminos y regreses a tu hogar 
Cuenta lo aprendido, diles la verdad 
Explícales que al cielo es imposible dominar

Diles que has vivido otra realidad 
Que era una locura de esperanza y libertad 
Donde tus demonios salen a actuar 
Donde una mano amiga sabes que te sostendrá

Y si vuelve el olvido y con él el dolor 
Date solo un momento, recupera el honor 
Para todas tus penas, si hay una solución 
Canta mi canción

Alza tus brazos, súbete 
Hoy las estrellas están a tus pies 
Vuela muy alto y suéltate 
Pues mientras cantes no puedes caer

Diles si has llorado lágrimas de mar 
Si has sudado penas del que quiere abandonar 
Diles si has huido antes de saltar 
Para tomar impulso es necesario un paso atrás

Y si el miedo aconseja cambio de dirección 
Tómate todo el tiempo escucha a tu corazón 
Si enlazamos las manos las estrellas verán 
Lo fácil que es volar

Alza tus brazos, súbete 
Hoy las estrellas están a tus pies 
Vuela muy alto y suéltate 
Pues mientras cantes no puedes caer

Podrán todas las flores arrancar 
Pero a la primavera nunca la podrán matar 
Se la flor más fuerte del jardín 
No habrá quien te arranque jamás de mí

I just think we could be much better
If you disagree then, honey go get her

Searchin' in the sun for another overload

But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

Mahalia Jackson,"Last night I lay a-sleeping
There came a dream so fair
I stood in old Jerusalem
Beside the temple there
I heard the children singing
And ever as they sang
Methought the voice of angels
From heav'n in answer ring
Methought the voice of angels
From heav'n in answer ring

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Lift up your gates and sing
Hossanah in the highest
Hossanah to your King

And then methought my dream was changed
The streets no longer rang
Hushed were the glad hossanahs
The little children sang
The sun grew dark with mystery
The morn was cold and chill
As the shadow of the cross arose
Upon a lonely hill
As the shadow of the cross arose
Upon a lonely hill

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Hark how the angels sing
Hossanah in highest
Hossanah to your King

And once again the scene was changed
New earth there seemed to be
I saw the holy city beside the tideless sea
The light of God was on the streets
The gates are opened wide
And all who would might enter
And no one was denied
No need of moon or stars by night
Or sun to shine by day
It was the new Jerusalem
That would not pass away
It was the new Jerusalem
That would not pass away

Sing for the night is o'er

Shining still

And we shall share

Because a star stood still
That night a star stood still

Praise God that star still

Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure;
Save from wrath and make me pure.


Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.


Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to the cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.

The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.


Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.


Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word,
But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,
Familiar, condescending, patient, free.
Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.


Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea.
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.


Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,
And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.


I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.


I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.


Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

The grocer and the butcher
And the people that I meet
The children in the playground
The faces that I see
All races, all religions
That's America to me

The place I work in
The workers at my side
The little town, a city
Where my people live and die
The howdy and the handshake
The air of feeling free
And the right to speak my mind out
That's America to me

The things I see about me
The big things and the small
The little corner newsstand
And the house a mile tall
The wedding in the church yard
The laughter and the tears
The dream that's been a-growing
For one hundred and fifty years

The town I live in
The street, the house, the room
The pavement of a city
Of a garden all in bloom
The church, the school, the clubhouse
The million lights I see
But especially the people
That's America to me",The House I Live In (That's America to Me)
Mahalia Jackson,"When you come to the end of a perfect day
And you sit alone with your thought
While the chimes ring out with a carol gay
For the joy that the day has brought

Do you think what the end of a perfect day
Can mean to a tired heart
When the sun goes down with a flaming ray
And the dear friends have to part?

Well, this is the end of a perfect day
Near the end of a journey too
But it leaves a thought that is big and strong
With a wish that is kind and true

For memory has painted this perfect day
With colors that never fade
And we find at the end of a perfect day
The soul of a friend we've made",A Perfect Day
Mahalia Jackson,"I think that I will never see 
A poem as lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed

Against the Earth's sweet flowing breast.
A tree that looks at God all day
And lifts her leaf-filled arms to pray.

A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair.
Upon whose bosom snow has lain,

Who's intimately lived with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.",Trees

Wherever thou lodgest I will lodge

That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King!""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

O ye beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When the new heaven and earth shall own
The Prince of Peace, their King,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing.",It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

The nature got to keep you can't get in
I told you I told you a long time ago
You wouldn't hear me you disobey me
Lord send the angel a warning to you
It began to rain and now you are through
Well it rained forty days
Forty nights without stopping
Noah was glad
When the rain stopped dropping
Knock at the window knock at the door
Come on brother Noah
Can't you take little more
No no my brothers you are full of sin
God has the key you can't get in
Would you listen how it rained
Didn't it rain children
Talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it fall didn't it fall
Didn't it fall my Lord didn't it rain

Mahmood,"Ho bisogno di partire per un po’
Tornare in quel vecchio coffee shop
Ho bisogno di svegliarmi in una casa non mia
Nel cesso di una discoteca o di vincere alla lotteria
Per gridare forte forte forte per volare via
E non scordarmi di me e non scordarmi di me

Trovare i tuoi cerchi, sembrare un alieno
Ti chiedi se sbagliare sia umano
Ma dimentichi le spade sul trono
Seduto davanti a un videogame
Senza il coraggio di premere play
Senza il coraggio di premere play, play, play

this is from a girl that told me
well she just walked one day and met this little boy he had
well she happened one day to meet this little boy
a face that you can't stop watching
a face that you will remember
a face that you want to hold in you hands carefully 

And she got the
feeling he was in need 
of what she could give
Cause she had it all ready to blow out of inside
So she wanted to say 
“hey I'm gonna take care of you yeah 
We're gonna be like a crew” but she didn't 
cause she couldn’t ever replace
Chrysanthèmes


The boy was going doubtless
She followed him walking on hills
nothing could have slowed him down
his schoolbag dragged on the ground

He opened an old rusty gate
and entered a flowery place 
So she hid behind 
a big tree and blind, she heard these few words from him cause he said

“hey you wanted me to do it,   
well, I am just the new champ!
For real, I just held my breath and all the children were all applauding!
Mum, they gave me a medal
Me and dad, we wanted to bring it
So you can keep it and be proud”
But she then realized he was speaking to
Chrysanthèmes


And she got the
feeling he was in need 
of what she could give
Cause she had it all ready to blow out of inside
So she wanted to say 
hey I'm gonna take care of you yeah 
We're gonna be like a crew but she didn't 
cause she couldn’t ever replace

Stop it I'm staying don't call me again
I'm staying
Mi cuero needs more until it's got a real tan
Don't know about you but I'm tired of the rain
Here we are being driven up the mountain
Watch it from the top this is our town
Now easy on this side as desert is a danger
I am gonna like it playing cow girls, won't ya ?

Nada Mama! no love in Arizona!
The state where all the outlaws got jacked
With a horse and a hat I became a chica mala
Mi weapon is a real one it goes paw paw!

This one parked inside with the blondest chick 
That was walking by his side and  moving her hips 
We look at him, freakin'him, what's that trick? 
Who do you pretend to be? Johnny in the Cry baby movie? 
Frenchies in AZ all the way 
Car keys in his pocket 
Now don't you worry 
Eat your veggie
In a minute

Well if it-f 'it comes we're gonna get yep ready to welcome it
This is an uncommon thingummy just ask them they can tell 

Ho we are the best best hunters 
Not afraid to go 
We made our wooden swords and hatchets
Strong from head to toe.
And now we come and whistle whistle
We are getting hot
It runs because we beat the bushes
We will spare it not!

In the woods at night they showed us two red lights in the darkness, Dahuuut!
They are two small eyes, we watched them pop, zigzag then go away
Well if it-f 'it comes again bang bang we are gonna catch it
We'll go hunt hunt it so it'll stop stop haunting our nights 
And in the woods at night ...

REF

With the top grade bunch yep, we went to make some observations, Dahuuut!
By the blue blue fence we found some foot foot prints behind the pond
So they said said that we should set set traps in each corner
And they told us told us “wait until the night”
And in the woods at night, ho! 

REF

It runs faster faster it's so scared
We're getting close
Then we will make it lose its balance
And punch it in the nose

All the cuckoos sing along with us they know it's gonna happen, Dahuuut!

All the things projected to do you still / you still never in them got involved
The clock tells you to get up and you say give me a few hours more

So fast that anyway now it's too late you'll never be on time to catch the train 
So you just stop running eating seven lunches, watching what is on tv and so until

No sign from there to tell you how to wake up
Wake up you don't seem so shy
Face your life, it's just a game / Face your life your turn to play

Some in the city
Can be jealous of me
They all wish they had him

This ain't for real

Main Source,"Man, I had soul since I was negative three months old
When it came to getting down I was bold
Kicking steps until you had to put my ass in a choke hold
And damn near wouldn't fold
Check the picture with the apple jack hat
My father even taught me how to skat
So I developed the skat into what we call rap
And get nasty at that
Getting loose is not a problem, it's getting back together
I pull girls like a lever, I get tired 
Bring the coffee to my lips and watch the Large Professor do backflips

He got so much soul, he don't need no music  (Repeat 4x)

I possess skills in the field of rapping
So get down cause I make it happen
Pop with a limp, low pro pimp
I make other MC's mope
Cause their skills ain't developed like negatives
Throughout the years, I've done mega kids
So don't fix your mouth you say I can't handle
I got more sole than a sandle
Cooler than a liter of digital soundproof
I raise the roof (Ain't that the truth)
Got money in the bank, baby pah, I'm a star

He got so much soul, he don't need no music  (Repeat 4x)

I rip rappers up like a card
(Yo Large Professor I want to battle)
Man, you're sorry
I'm part of the Main Source
And we eat DJ's and MC's as the main course

Or crew, your girl's stuck to me like glue
Cause I kick it like a class of kung fu
I use a pick in my hair without force
You use a lawn mower, you got peat moss
Growing on your dome, that's why you're so dumb
I'll eat you like a plum

Main Source,"Verse One:

[blam] Aww shit, another young brother hit
I better go over my man's crib and get the pump
Cause to the cops, shootin brothers is like playin baseball
And they're never in a slump
I guess when they shoot up a crew, it's a grand slam
And when it's one, it's a home run
But I'ma be ready with a wild pitch
My finger got a bad twitch, plus I'm on the switch --
-- side, and step up to the batter's box
Fuck red and white, I got on Black Sox
But let him shoot a person from the White Sox
What's the call?  Foul ball!
Babe Ruth woulda made a good cop, but he didn't
Instead he was a bigot, dig it
My life is valuable and I protect it like a gem
Instead of cops gettin me I'm goin out gettin them
And let em cough up blood like phlegm
It's grim [blam blam] but dead is my antonym
And legally they can't take a fall
Yo check it out it's just a friendly game of baseball

Verse Two:

R.B.I. -- real bad injury
But don't get happy you're in jail for a century
Just as bad as bein shot in the groin
To see who'll shoot ya, they'll flip a coin
And watch him run for the stretch
But you don't know the man is at home waitin to make the catch
So the outfielder guns you down
You're out, off to the dugout, underground
I know a cop that's savage, his pockets stay green like cabbage
Cause he has a good batting average
No questions, just pulls out the flamer
[blam] And his excuses get lamer
Once a brother tried to take a leave
But they shot him in his face sayin he was tryin to steal a base
And people watch the news for coverage on the game
Hmm, and got the nerve to complain
They need to get themselves a front row seat
Or sink a baseline for a beat
Cause television just ain't designed for precision y'all
It's just a friendly game of baseball

Verse Three:

A kid caught on, but I don't know where the brother went
The umpires are the government
I guess they took him out the game, and replace him
with a pinch-hitter, in the scam he was a quitter
So the cops usually torment, I mean tournament
Win em I was sayin
You can't let the umpires, hear ya speak and battle
like the other kid you won't be playin
Cause they'll beat you til your ass drop
A walking gun with a shell in his hand is their mascot
And when they walk around let it be known to step lightly
The bases are loaded
My man got out from three strikes
In the skull but the knife he was carrying was dull
Instead of innings, we have endings
What a fine way to win things
And hot-dog vendors have fun
Sellin you the cat rat and dog on a bun
And when you ask what is all of this called?

Rolling dice can help you or hurt you; your virtue
Is known when you quit cause you've hit your cash curfew
Even if you have to get swift and swindle
It's as long as you with, so close you're simple
I see people rolling dice with lives
Telling lies and cutting close like knives
For a sandwich and selter, so probablt sell the
Clothes on they man's back for fame and wealth or
Go with the next man's girl and hit the skins
Get in his face and say ""Yo, we're best friends""
Scared of a tattle, because his tail shake like a rattle
And then he'll kiss behind like a saddle
That'll be the reason why you'll bleed and grieve

You roll the dice reall fast to get nice
But gotta be more precise
Cause I keep looking, and you'll keep scheming
I'll start hooking, and you'll be screaming
Starting to tries in an alibi
Cause you keep rolling snake eyes

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

The person you least expect to slit your neck
Nine times out of every ten crimes is the prime suspect
It doesn't feel good, when you can't trust blood
And your neighbor's the neighborhood hood
Plotting the cut neck scam
You sleeping in the end, you get swept cause you slept
Yeah, the dice get blown on so step back
Snakes attack and move as fast as a Cadillac
But if found in my circumference
The next day you'll pay to get your fronts fixed
Rolling 11 is the opposite of heaven
It's craps, so start revving to make tracks
Once a snake, you stay a snake
When you're small you took cookies, but now you take the cake
And talk behind backs, and switch facts
And tax, and probably smoke cracks
Cause one minute my crib you're all in it
The next day you want to play self centered?
Just because you're in with the fake guys
And you keep rolling snake eyes

Yeah...

I watch people roll dice in the jungle of concrete
With venom, corrodes the streets
Where girls get foul on their guys, why?      (They're rolling snake eyes!)
Where the guys get foul on their wives, why?  (They're rolling snake eyes!)
False producers are telling lies, why?        (They're rolling snake eyes!)
Policemen are taking bribes, why?             (They're rolling snake eyes!)

Main Source,"We all know Roger, Roger lives in Queens
Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, and he fiends
For knowledge, and people try to diss him because of that
Surrounded by the ghetto plus the fact that the brother's black
But Roger gets high -- grades on tests
He smokes -- brain cells to rest
But brothers jel on him because he has a goal
And gold awards hanging all off the brain pain
Behold, Roger doesn't fight, his brain is his left and his right
But if tainted, he just might
So all you brothers flying with a broken wing
Watch Roger do his thing

Roger graduated from high school
But didn't advance or enhance no scholarship, cool
Flip, he did not, he got a job at a parking lot
Teased because he wasn't making G's at a crack spot
He started meeting the people with the high ranks
Attained a job as a manager at a bank
Roger started rolling a Benz
Had a bunch of rich friends and that's where his ghetto life ends
He rolls around the projects he lived in once in a while
Sees the brothers that was jelling and cracks a smile
They have rings, but he has a ring of keys
And D's, and now my man Roger is worth G's
He doesn't have to rap or sing
He has to think, so watch Roger do his thing

Roger has diamonds like I have lyrics
Always in good spirits, and money's never made
""Its hip to be suqare"" is Roger's main motto
Cash coming out of his ass like he hit lotto
He reminices on all the bad years
Remembers his fear and smiles ear to ear
Counts a knot and goes to ?Backa Jaluts? to eat
Hogo Boss on his feet smelling sweet
Gucci frames and all the high class names
Stetson suit clean on the scene laying down game
You can't cramp his style, he's as sharp as the tip of a nail file
You're going to fail, child
Check him out while he plays with his ring
Watch Roger do his thing

Roger's a Cassanova now, he's swimming in women
A symbol in sex messing with their intellects
Throws parties every week in his happy home
Out on the island and stays smiling alone
That's his style, macking skins and laying girls like towels
Not acting wild
Question: Roger's life seems complete, right?
That's what an education can and might do
It may sound corny but it's true
Roger does his thing and so can you
So get your head out the sling
And watch Roger do his thing, hit it

But all I get is gray hairs and strife
And I can play some ole stuck-up rapper role
And get foul every time you lose control
But that's not my order of operations
So I should win an award for lots of patience

You treat me like a burnt piece of bacon
It seems like just two years
Back when we were bonded and not pierced

Sitting' in the chair just to stare, set to sprint
Yo, sweetheart, you better take a hint
I say it now like I said it before

He was born in a jail cell, cause his mother was a con
And in his mother's cupped arms was a newborn timebomb
But it wasn't his fault he was in the cageed vault for aggrivated assault
On his eight-year-old sister
As Mr. Daddy stood there, instead he should have dissed her
And now mommy's found guilty
Cause she almost beat her daughter to death for spilling a glass of milk, 
see
Poppa was a boozer, momma was a drug abuser
They were no-win losers
And now Sonny's gotta struggle
And another day of life to him's another day of trouble
You gotta live this life for you to try and understand
The diary of a hitman

	The diary of a hitman

Sonny's making money on the norm and you know he's got another job
When you see him with the leather gloves on
He got a look in his eye like he wants to die
Packing the nine double murder near his thigh
10 G's a head, whoever you want dead
Will be filled with lead, and be buried in their own red
He don't sleep at night, cause he's just like an owl
On the prowl and his lifestyle's foul
A self-made boss in the ??? of his moms and pops
Is what really ticks him off
A flashback from the past, dad whipping mom's ass
For the cash, after that she hit the stash
And takes a blast of the trash she was hooked on
And Sonny felt helpless, as he looked on
You gotta live this life for you to try and understand
The diary of a hitman

	The diary of a hitman

Sonny got a call from the mob
It was 100,000 grand for my man to do a quick job
The contract was plain and simple
One in the mouth for talking, then two to the temple
The address looked kinda funny
But Sonny didn't care who was there, cause he was in it for the money
He made his way to the crime spot, the victim
With nothing on his mind at the time but to get him
He arrived at 10 o'clock and didn't even knock
He just shot off the lock
And he kicked the door open
Destined to smoke him, nope, Sonny wasn't joking
He made his way up the stairs, and there's
Mommy in tears, and daddy in fears
But he didn't give a damn cause he never had a fam
So now it's time to silence the lamb
Momma took the first three, so now she's living drug free
Cause she's put out of misery
And Daddy's on his knees yelling ""Please Sonny please""
But Sonny squeezed

Now I'm a flip the track and bring you back to reality
I'm like Wesley Snipes, I act without a salary
Cause I don't need nobody sayin ""Lights, Camera, Action!""
I act on reaction
Fuck what you see on television
Cause nowadays all of us live in the hellavision
On every single channel it's the same old sane
Brothers' poppin their brain
Or gettin wrecked at a soccer game
Six brothers fallin victim to the street
After mad ? tribe vibes rollin in the black jeep
Every other channel spent its money on the talk shows
From Oprah to Horazo, everybody in New York knows
But when a brother gets real
They make the story opposite
And try to offer niggas raw deals

(Chorus:)
Television tells lies to the vision
The world's a prison
We're livin in hellavision

(Verse 2:)
Every day your lie to me is drama
But not the type of drama that my T.V. shows
Because it makes the drama calmer
When a lady's caught cheatin
She sets with the next man
And doesn't even catch a ass-beatin
Reality check - that's what the T.V. said
Cause in real life it's two to the fuckin head
Samedy Sam fillin bugs with slugs
Wild  is cookin up these deadly drugs
Bart Simpson is cursin up for storm
And children love this shit man, come on
I see kids that say bringin guns to school
Ten year old crack heads and that ain't cool
My four year old daughter curses worse than Bart
Straight from my heart, it's tearin me apart
(Chorus)

(Verse 3:)
And now, hip hop is labeled as a violencer
Like everyone who rhymes packs a gat with the silencer
Every other ? hip hopper goes to prison
Over some dumb shit or for the real life livin
But who's to know what we've been goin through
When all you see is one side of us
The side the T.V. be showing you
You never hear about the stress or the work
Or the hard times we had or hip hop was getting jerked
You only see us in the limelight
But when the night comes, we're always linked to crime, right?
Man - what I've been through is strife
Yo - they could make fifty movies of my motherfuckin life
And there's a million like me
The people you don't see
When you watch your everyday T.V.

Man I rose from the bottom and it feels good

Swizz
Man I'm a introduce to you a new dance (new dance)
It's called the money dance (echo)
You pull the money out your pocket like this (like this)
You put your hands in the air like this (like this)
And you simply just um.
Bounce throw it all around
(Throw) throw it all around
(Throw) throw it all around
(Throw) throw it all around
A little more now
Throw it all around
A little more now
Throw it all around

Maino,"I think I might give away a million bucks
I think I might give away a brand new truck
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

Hey, I think I might take you on a shoppin' spree
You in the club, goddamn all drinks on me
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

Good Lord, look what a beautiful day
My enemies ain't here, they gone away
I feel good, everythin' is okay
I feel like givin' all my money away

'Cause niggas is broke and there ain't no bread in the hood
Look what they did, they sendin' Feds in the hood
I ain't going to change, I'm coming back through the hood
Do what I do then back to the hood

I'm blessed, went places I never been
I live to see a black president
I'm good, yes I feel good, drinks on me
Baby what's good?

I think I might give away a million bucks
I think I might give away a brand new truck
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

Hey, I think I might take you on a shoppin' spree
You in the club, goddamn all drinks on me
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

For the ones who got more than one mouth to feed
Gas so high got em' riding on E
Daddy needs shoes and kids gotta eat
They can have every last penny on me

Me and Swizzy rollin' in the Lambo
Sit back reminiscin' when I never had no dollas
Pride is well, poor dear mama
Stuck to the fight like a drained out boxer

So I know what it feels like to not have much
I should give away what I made last month
'Cause I gotta a lot to feel good about
I think I'ma give away a good amount

I think I might give away a million bucks
I think I might give away a brand new truck
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

Hey, I think I might take you on a shoppin' spree
You in the club, goddamn all drinks on me
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

One shot for my niggas in the state pen
Two shots for my niggas still hustlin'
I feel good, I'm so good
Man, I rose from the bottom and it feels good

I'm a introduce to you a new dance
It's called the money dance
You pull the money out your pocket like this
You put your hands in the air like this and you simply just umm

Bounce, throw it all around
Throw it all around, throw it all around
Throw it all around a little more now
Throw it all around a little more now
Throw it all around

I think I might give away a brand new truck

Listen, really what do you see, (See)
When you looking at me, (me)
See me come up from nothin',
To me living my dreams,
I have been to the bottom,
I done suffered a lot,
I deserve to be rich,
Headed straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block,
Look how I rep for the hood,
I get nothing but love now when I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame,
Money make all of us change,
The new Benz is all white call it John McCain.
How the hell could you stop me?
Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever,
That's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built
See the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me,
And I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me
But these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets
Till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters mad that I finally done made it
Take a look and you can tell that I am destined for greatness.

Y'all quickly to judge me.
Put your foot in my Nike's
Picture you livin' in my life
Picture you stuck in a cell
Picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge
Picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed
Picture you wearing the scars
Thank you for making me struggle
Thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle
Tell me the world ain't mine
If you ain't seein' me lately
I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose
This is what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father
Tryna hope for tomorrow
When I think that I cant
I envision Obama
I envision the diamonds
I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect
All my niqqas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it
That I'm making this statement
Take a look and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness
