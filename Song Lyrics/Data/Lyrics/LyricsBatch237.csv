Karen Clark-Sheard,"Mmmhmmmm.. mmmmmm..
Ohh yea yea yea
Ohhhh.. mmmm-mmmhmmmm
I'm movin.. higher ground..

(Ohh) I'm movin on (mmhmm) can't nothin stop me now
(Mmm-yeah) I'm pressin on (higher ground) to higher ground
(MMMM!) Each step I take (oooooh) is a new dawning of
(Ohh, oh-ohh) A brand new day (higher ground) for higher ground

Obstacles and situations, people places and things
I must overcome, cause there's a battle to be won
With my mind set on higher things
These things have become my footstool
I'm determined to reach my goal
I need peace for my soul

(Ohh) I'm movin on (that's why I'm movin on) can't nothin stop me now
(I'm pressin on) I'm pressin on (to higher ground) to higher ground
(MMMM!) Each step I take (each step I take) is a new dawning of
(For my higher place) A brand new day
(On my higher ground) for higher ground

I'm pressin on, the upward way
Brand new heights I'm gaining, eeeeeveryday
No higher place, that I really have found
(Lord plant my feet on) plant my feet on (On higher ground)
Forgetting what (forgetting what, is already behind me)
Is alread be, ohhhh-oooooh-ohhhhohwhoahhhhh
(I'm moving forward) Moving yahyeahh (for what's ahead)

I'm moving on.. can't nothin stop me now (nothing's gonna stop me)
I'm pressing on.. to higher ground (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Each step I take (ohhhh hohhhh) is a new dawning of (yes it is)
A brand new day (yeahhhh) for higher ground

The race is not given to the swift
Nor the battle to the strong only
But instead (??? ???)
But we gotta stay strong and fight on
Sometimes you feel like your foot might slip
Cause it's too much goin on
Just realize your goal is greater than your struggle
Just hold on and be strong

I'm moving on.. (I'm moving on) can't nothin stop me now
(nothing, no-no-no)
I'm pressing on.. (ooohooohooh) to higher ground (oahhyeahyeahh)
Each step I take (oh is the dawning of a new day)
Is the new dawning of (???)
A brand new day (yeahhyeahh) for higher ground

I'm moving on.. can't nothin stop me now
I'm pressing on.. to higher ground
Each step I take.. is a new dawning of
A brand new day.. for higher ground

Be strong, and fight on
But by all means, keeeeeeeeeeep moving

",I'll Be Right There
Karen Clark-Sheard,"Yeah, well, I wonder is there anybody out there been changed

Any other day, I wouldn't have dealt with this situation this way
There were a lot of things, I wanted to say but I
Thought about what would have happened if I let you get the best of me
No way and now I can truly say

I was a bird on the ground using my legs to get around
I was a piano out of tune but I've been turned around
Tell you how I know, places I used to go, I don't even go no more
'Cause I can fly now and the song, I play lets me know, I've been changed

Never mind what you've heard. I'm not the same
Somewhere, somehow, someway I reversed the way I do things
No it ain't worth all the tug of war with you to prove I'm stronger
I no longer stay to play and lose, now I am proud to say, it's true

I was a bird on the ground using my legs to get around
I was a piano out of tune but I've been turned around
Tell you how I know, places I used to go, I don't even go no more
'Cause I can fly now and the song, I play lets me know, I've been changed

Make no mistake about it, anyone could change
But it takes a strong mind to say that doing the right thing is okay
And now that I've decided to give up these ways
There's no turning back now
Now that I've found out I can overcome these things, oh

I was a bird on the ground using my legs to get around
I was a piano out of tune but I've been turned around
Tell you how I know, places I used to go, I don't even go no more
'Cause I can fly now and the song, I play let's me know, I've been changed

I was a bird on the ground using my legs to get around
I was a piano out of tune but I've been turned around
Tell you how I know, places I used to go, I don't even go no more
'Cause I can fly now and the song, I play let's me know, I've been changed

I was a bird on the ground using my legs to get around
I was a piano out of tune but I've been turned around
Tell you how I know, places I used to go, I don't even go no more
'Cause I can fly now and the song, I play let's me know, I've been changed",I've Been Changed
Karen Clark-Sheard,"If I can't say a word, I'll just wave my hand
If I can't say a word, I'll just wave my hand
I get so full, I would explain it if I could
God's been just that good

Sometimes I get so filled up
Like an overflowing cup
Can't seem to find the right words to say
Holy spirit have your way

If I can't say a word, I'll just wave my hand
If I can't say a word, I'll just wave my hand
I get so full, I would explain it if I could

When I think of His love for me
The way He looks out for me
Sometimes I find myself speechless
His favor leaves me breathless

Karen Clark-Sheard,"This world sometimes seems cruel and cold
And pain doth pierce my very soul,
But there's a place ,a secret place,
A place where I can go.

ooooooooooooooooohh.

A place of peace,
Where love abides,
Where justice reigns
And God resides,
There is a place,
A secret place,
A place where I can go,

For you shall hide me in your tabernacle
From the rain and storm
And even when my enemies pursue me,
You'll keep me safe from harm,

And when my heart
Is filled with pain,
No peace it seems
Ill find again
I find that place
A secret place
A place where I can go

Choir:
For you shall hide me in your tabernacle
From the rain and storm
And even when my enemies pursue me
You'll keep me safe from harm

there is safety, in your tabernacle
There is protection, in your tabernacle
There is security, in your tabernacle
There is sanctuary, in your tabernacle
Lord take me, to your tabernacle
I wanna go, to your tabernacle
Lord take me, to your tabernacle
Lord there you'll reign
Hide me-safely-in your-dwelling-place

To keep me from doin' somethin' that I might regret

Discipline and values I know you need to get
Even though your hard headed don't change]

Because I am a child [mama's baby]of the king

With all that you're going through everyday
From being tempted to resented and you need direction
Sometimes heaven seems so far away
With all of the money spent that you make
But the righteous won't be forsaken

VERSE: I might get personal so protect your toes
Cause I feel I need to let my heel down
For we do all that we can to
Treat our NEIGHBOR right but
Sometimes we wanna scream

And stay on our knees and keep our tempers under control, but you know
Every now and then you wanna tell somebody what they mean

VERSE: Working that Job so hard from dusk to dawn
To keep a decent roof overhead
But your debt is evergrowing
Even working over time
And sometimes you wanna scream
But God knows the pain is there and how much we can
Bear we didn't come this far to be left alone
That's why we gotta be strong for the prayers of the righteous will availeth many things

Grab onto his hand and live in fear no longer
Like a tree planted by the rivers of water
We shall not be moved

Too many storms have passed your way
And you're all washed out cause it rained on your parade
Seems nobody cares about you anyway
Now you're living your life like a castaway
Searched for strength inside was it all in vain
Cause the deeper you dig you find more and more pain
Don't let your tomorrow be like yesterday
Cause I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf, I just asked if He would be there for you
I want you to

Just let go, let God, He'll work it out for you
I pray that your soul will be blessed
Forever in his rest, Cause you deserve his best no less

Enter a place where you never have to cry
Never have to live a lie, never have to wonder why
Never want for nothing you're always satisfied
In the peace that his arms will provide
He will erase any guilt or shame, any bad habits you've got

You won't wanna do em again, Yes we all can change, I can testify
See I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf, I just asked, If he would be there for you
I want you to

So many stars

The wind is filled with songs
So many songs, which one is mine
One must be right for me
Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles
Which one to choose, which way to go, how can I tell
How will I know, out of, oh
So many stars, so many stars

Karen Gallinger,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Karen Gallinger,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Karen Gallinger,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Karen Gallinger,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart

Karen Giorgio,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Karen Grenier,"I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

Karen Jolicoeur,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star

Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but you ain't left the ground

Wait till you're locked in my embrace, wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place, ain't nothin' like it here

Karen Jones,"Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie away 
from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream

Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there

Karen Marguth,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

I've grown accustomed to the tune he whistles night and noon

I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to his looks, accustomed to his voice,
Accustomed to his face

If this isn't love, I'm daft as a daisy,
With moons all a-round and cows jumping over,
There's something amiss, and I'll eat my hat if this isn't love.

And time is never planned.
It's not on any chart,
You must find it with your heart.
Never Never Land.

It might be miles beyond the moon,
Or right there where you stand.
Just have an open mind,
And then suddenly you'll find
Never Never Land.

You'll have a treasure if you stay there,
More precious far than gold.
For once you have found your way there,
You can never, never grow old.

So come with me where dreams are born,
And time is never planned.
Just think of lovely things,
And your heart will fly on wings,
Forever in Never Never Land.","Never, Never Land [From Peter Pan]"

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Karen Mason,"O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Asleep on the hay

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine
(I've seen better days)
Passed by a statue of saint Augustine in prayer
Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered

(i've seen better days)
From hamilton i look the train

I regret i didn't turn
And run back home to you

Not for her but for me

Karen Mason,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye.

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past,
This world's waited long enough,
I've come home at last!

And this time will be bigger,
And brighter than we knew it.
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways,
So much to say not just today but always.
We'll have early morning madness.
We'll have magic in the making.
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye!!!",As If We Never Said Goodbye

Dreams can come true again,
When everything old is new again.

Tears are out of place in eyes that were meant to smile.
There's a way to make your very biggest troubles small,
Here's the happy secret of it all.

[Chorus]
Look for the silver lining
When e'er a cloud appears in the blue.
Remember some where the sun is shining,
And so the right thing to do,
Is make it shine for you.

A heart, full of joy and gladness,
Will always banish sadness and strife.
So always look for the silver lining,
And try to find the sunny side of life.

As I wash my dishes, I'll be following your plan,
Till I see the brightness in ev'ry pot and pan.
I am sure your point of view will ease the daily grind,
So I keep repeating in my mind.

Karen Mason,"The sound of applause is delicious
It's a thrill to have the world at your feet
The praise of the crowd, it's exciting
But I've learned that's not what makes a life complete

There's one thing you can do for the rest of your days
That's worth more than applause
The screaming crowd, the bouquets

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man you're ev'rything to

Fame if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to

Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found him, build your world around him

Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy, too",Make Someone Happy

There is work to do before we say good-bye

Though I hear them pleading with me, ""Don't let us die""
As I sit, I can hear the troubled souls wander by
And I feel them leaning on my shoulder to cry
Oh one more chance

Naked tree of winter seems to stand so proud
Lording the poor mortal as it goes
And the tears which well beneath the somber shroud
Will they fall with the shame of somebody who knows?
He can never be like the thought of a rose
Who beauty remains even when the bloom goes

And I must face a man who hates me

S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty

'Twas so good to be young then, with the sweet smell of apples,
And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time just for livin', a place for to die.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
Now the green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.

Karen Stachel,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so

Karen Stachel,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile

For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go

After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so 
Softly, as I leave you there

Karen Stachel,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

Karen Staley,"Well, I've always been a rebel
Gone against the grain
I tell it to ya on the level
Use my heart to guide my brain

I don't hold on to tradition
I don't follow nobody else
I'm makin' it my mission
To be strong enough to be myself

Yeah, I'm breakin' all the rules
Doin' it my way, anyway I choose
When the lord made me he only made one
Always walked to a different drum

I've fought the will so I'll find a way
Pay no mine to what people say
You can call me a dreamer, call me a fool
But this girl's breakin' all the rules

Well, I had to learn to be tough
I watched my dreams crash to the ground
But if you pray and believe enough
Nothin' on this earth can hold ya down

So when you tell me I can't do it
Well you better understand
When I set my mind to it
There ain't no doubt I can

",Breakin' All the Rules
Karen Staley,"I'm not the enemy
I'm just a casualty
Of this endless war of words
Cold anger and abuse
I always call the truce
No matter how bad it hurts

I'll wave the flag of surrender
If you'll just lay your weapons down

Just once, would you cross the battle line
Reach out and baby you will find
True love is stronger pride
Just once, would you cross the battle line

Respect is chipped away
By the heartless things we say
We're losin' more with every fight
When will this madness cease
When will we cherish peace
More than being wrong or right?

We can't go on like this forever
There's got to be a compromise

",Cross the Battleline
Karen Staley,"I don't like spiders and snakes
See a mouse and I start to shake
I'm terrified of height
Scared of the dark
Gotta turn on a light

There's only one time
I can rise above
It's matter over mind
When it comes to love

I'm fearless, look at me
A portrait of bravery
A love kamikaze
I'm fearless, yeah baby, I'm fearless

I've got a purple heart
For every time it's been torn apart
Lord yes, I've been shot down
But I pick myself right up off the ground

I'm courageous, like Geronimo
Armed only with Cupid's arrow

",Fearless

Karen Staley,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Hindsight Is 20/20

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ek is verslaaf aan nikotien
Ek hou van karre wat kan ry
Ek huil gewoonlik as ek baklei

Ek het gedink dat dit sou reën
Toe word ek stil en wag alleen
Tot jy kom klop het
Aan my deur

Ek het n dak bo-oor my kop
En in die winter like ek sop
Ek raak benoud wanneer jy luister
Net soos wanneer mense fluister

Ek wonder of jy sal onthou
Dat jou woorde aan my klou
As jy my insluk
Sonder om te kou

En ek skree ?n song vir jou my my lief
Bly nog n rukkie asseblief
Want as ek sing dan sing jy saam
In ?n droom roep ek jou naam

Ek is so dronk soos Koos Kombuis
Daar is geen swembad by my huis
My sussie bly in Potchefstroom
Die mense daar rook almal boom

Vier seisoene in jou traan
Hou my vas wanneer jy gaan
En ek weer alleen hier staan

So ek skree ?n song vir jou my lief
Jy is n engel en n dief
Want as ons sing
Dan sing ons saam
In n droom roep ek jou naam",Engel

Too soon, too soon,

There will still be dark days and..

I cry, even though I smile
Smiling through tears
Is something that I'll recommend
Sometimes, when you're near
Oh I sense you've been here
I know it has taken a while
For me to come clear

It's getting darker outside
I put on a coat
It's been a while since I felt cold
I do not walk fast
I'm enjoying each step
Then I see you from a distance
And I smile
Smile through my teeth

I cry, even though I smile
Smiling through tears
Is something that I'll recommend
Sometimes, when you're near
Oh I sense you've been here
I know it has taken a while
For me to come clear",Cry

While there is life, there is hope, I hear you say
I didn't want to meet your eyes
But when I do, they shine, I am not worthy
Of being shown for

Wherever you wandered, I followed you there
But nothing seems to last for a lifetime anymore
I cannot feel your touch, I am numb
When you speak I find it hard to understand your words

I never meant to cause you any anger or grief
We both agree that nothing is what it once was
When I look at you it hurts
When I hold you tight it feels like we only just met
When I hold you tight it feels like we only just met
When I hold you tight it feels like we only just met",Life

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

I would give it all up just to feel your touch

And all I know is when we're together
No one can make me feel the way you do baby
I wish each moment can last forever
It's hard to explain the way I feel for you

You got me loosing myself
In what I'm trying to say
And it's so hard to fight it
Can't help but feelin' this way
And every time that I'm near you it's like my heart gets weak.
Feels like I'm loosing my breath makin' it hard to speak.

I just can't find the words
Woo woo
Just can't find the words
Woo woo
I just can't find the words
Woo woo
I just can't find the words

Now I know I come off kinda shy
But it's hard to say what's on my mind

But to find the right words it's going to take some time

And all I know is when we're together
No one can make me feel the way you do baby
I wish each moment can last forever
It's hard to explain the way I feel for you
(I just can''t find the words)
You got me loosing myself
In what I'm trying to say
And it's so hard to fight it
Can't help but feelin' this way
And every time that I'm near you it's like my heart gets weak.
Feels like I'm loosing my breath makin' it hard to speak.

I just can't find the words
Woo woo
Just can't find the words
Woo woo
I just can't find the words
Woo woo
I just can't find the words

You got me trippin' over words u got me stuttering
And like a bad dream I'm callin' out but u don't hear me speak
And constantly I find myself in this predicament
So let me show you (show you) baby (baby) that actions speak louder than words

One time
Two times
three times

And what I feel you always seem to know
You find the words, when I need comforting
And dry my eyes, that's why I love you so

More than a friend, you're my first love
I can always depend on my first love

Feel like I, have known you all my life
I can't explain how close we are
When something's wrong, you know how to make it right
That's why you stay close to my heart

More than a friend, you're my first love
I can always depend on my first love

There's a star in my eye
A chill up my spine
A melody in my heart
You are, my very first love
You're the sweet lullaby
My first kiss goodnight
The beat in my heart,
Music, my very first love

More than a friend, you're my first love
I can always depend on my first love

With you in my life, I'm not lonely at all
And if there were tears, you'd catch them all
Cause you know my pain
And you know my joy
There's a secret between us
Only pretty piano chords

I sing because I'm happy
Cause music sets me free

Karina,"My heart he takes
He'll always be my baby
We may bend,Won't break
But we got no one else to take
He's the sun when my day is low
I'm his picture in front front row
His love is the center of my attention
See I don't know what he'd do for me
That guy is my everything
We argue,we fight
Then we make up by the end of the night
Don't even speak it speak it
We know what we got

[Chorus]
And I love him,he loves me
And this is how love should be
I'm down for the love that he got that, he got
And he stays down for the love that we got, that we got
I love him,he loves me
And this is how love should be
I'm down for the love that he got that,that he got
And he stays down for the love that we got, that we got

He's embedded in Myspace
Every time he speaks he blows me away
Don't care what people say
As long as hes in the same place where I lay
See ill be as that goes
I'm his princess hes my general
And no matter what you think about love
Time wont outlast us
See yall don't know what he do for me
And I'm tellin' you hes my everything
We argue we fight
Then we make up by the end of the night
Yall don't know what we got

The miles I'd walk for him are infinite
Ill run circles around the world
And everyday I'm beside him feels heaven sent
And all else is irrelevant

And I'm happy that we met.
Don't think that I'm not interested.
I'm just playing hard to get

So much about this crazy game they call love
That I'm trying to understand,
So could you be my best friend,
Before you call yourself my man

Why can't I love you in slow motion,
Take my time,
Take away the pressure on my mind
Really get to know you
But rewind
Wanna love you in slow motion
Why can't I?

You seem to know just what you want
And I like your confidence
Some things a girl should never rush
Cause If you do you hurt yourself

So much about this crazy game they call love
That I'm trying to understand,
So could you be my best friend,
Before you call yourself my man

Why can't I love you in slow motion,
Take my time,
Take away the pressure on my mind
Really get to know you
But rewind
Wanna love you in slow motion
Why can't I?

I'm too young for tears in the night
And it's to soon for this to be right
Don't wanna mess with your pride
The questions not when but why

Why can't I love you in slow motion,
Take my time,
Take away the pressure on my mind
Really get to know you

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Karina Zorn,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven

That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who has seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

And nothing's real but love

As we joke around like fools

All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Karl Boxer,"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

(Ooh) But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

Karl Drewo,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love

Karl Johnson,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Karl Schmidt,"Searching in the sky one night, while looking for the moon
I viewed a mighty light approching in a zoom
Need was there to tell someone of my discovery
Fifteen seconds later, a light appeared in front of me
To my surprise, there stood a man with age and mystery
His name was Jupiter and came to visit me

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet, from where I come

Keep your eye on Jupiter, such beauty in the sky
We will wait for your return in the by and by
Keep your eye on Jupiter, memories we shall fulfill
Just to view a brighter day, and do a righteous will

Watching and considering my visual state of mind
The flower fragrance help reveal to me the sign
The sigh of love, I had confessed to live and really know
The sign of love which I had failed my fellowman to show

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet, from where I come

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He was strumming my pain, yeah, he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I take back everything I said it don't mean nothing
Just a fight we had so many though
A ghetto love
I tell you that you gotta let me visit my son
But then you tell me no
A ghetto love
But shawty I can't take my eyes away
Even though we can't get along today
I made a promise to you that faithful day
So I say

I am the man who will fight for your honour
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together

She's so damn style I'm a witness
Let me tell ya whoa
Move that thing ya whoa
Let me tell ya
And then I take her to the parking lot
Jump into my car and straight to my spot say whoa
Then she started a fight as we stepped out the club
Only cause a fan trying give me a little hug
So I say

I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for this ghetto ghetto love

Ghetto for the ghetto for the ghetto ghetto love
Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto for this ghetto love

I can't think straight when I'm on her ghetto love
With a ghetto girl, every day's a fight now
We get to war, I gotta get away while the getting is good
And get top and gone, lemme think like I know I should
But a real woman needs a little bit more than wood
She expects that from me cause she know I would
Do anything, anywhere, every time for my shorty
Even though we bicker I came right back to get her
Pull her close 'till her body says hello

Karl-Heinz Steffens,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.","The Song Is You, song (from ""Music in the Air"")"
Karla Bonoff,"Youæ?®e taking all I got and now youæ?®e leaving
Ooh baby, donæ?° go.
I thought that love was something to believe in
Ooh, baby don't go.

I've seen it in your face
It's in your eyes when you turn away
You think it's all a waste
You're goin' today

I won't pretend
I won't say it won't hurt me bad
Won't you try it again
Whatever happened to all that we had?

You're taking all I got and now you're leavin'
Ooh baby, don't go
I thought love was something to believe in
Ooh baby don't go.

Don't fight, just hold me tight
Everything is gonna work out right
I won't beg,
But you heard what I said
I need you every day and night

You're taking all I got and now you're leaving
Ooh baby, don't go.
I thought that love was something to believe in
Ooh, baby don't go.

And if you close the door
I can't wish you well anymore.
You know you really turned on me,
So don't come running back æ?¶ause I know you'll never see.

You're takin' all I got and now you're leaving
Ooh baby, don't go.
I thought love was something to believe in,
Ooh baby, don't go.
And baby don't go
Ooh, baby don't go






",Baby Don't Go
Karla Bonoff,"Well, baby what ya trying to prove
By beinalone
And no one can get through to you
Is there anyone home?

CHORUS:

So don't say that it's love you lacked
I paid the price now we're paying the tax
I gave it all, and I got nothing back
Only a fool gives a heart like that

Well, I said that you never gave enough
And I know this is true
I see now that you never gave it up
So you'd have nothing to lose

REPEAT CHORUS

I know that I need you
And that made you scared
If I'd known how to reach you
But I'm giving up, it's too late to care

Well, I guess that it's really over now
This is where I belong
And baby you know it's kind of funny how
All the tears made me strong

REPEAT CHORUS






",Only a Fool
Karla Bonoff,"The water is wide
I cannot swim ore
and neither have I
the wings to fly
give me a boat
that can carry two
and we both shall row
my true love and I

A ship there is
and she sails the seas
she's laden deep
as deep can be
but not so deep
as the love I'm in
and I know not if
i sink or swim

I leaned my back
against a young oak
thinkin he was 
a trusty tree
but first he bended
and then he broke
thus did my love
prove false to me

Oh love is handsome 
and love is kind
bright as a jewl
when first it's new
but love grows old
and waxes cold
and fades away
like the morning dew

and fades away
like the morning dew 
",The Water Is Wide
Karla Bonoff,"I can feel a new expression on my face
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room
 
I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room
 
Baby it's a dream come true
Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel a something pounding in my brain
Just any time that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound I hear thunder boom
Every time that you walk in the room
",When You Walk in the Room
Karla Bonoff,"The whole worldæ?¯ blue
And nothing ever goes right
Words sound untrue
But you won't give up the fight
Turn your back now
To all those things that you've seen
Close your eyes
Now baby, dream

Well, they see you
Playing real good at the game
If they saw through
All there'd be is the pain
A reward's due
For one who is lost in the rain
Close your eyes
Now baby, dream

When you held me, I was so broken apart
I had nothing but that love in your heart
And the night came, all I heard was you saying
Close your eyes
Now baby,
Dream
Close your eyes
Now baby,
Dream

Karla Bonoff,"Oh honey, let's draw the line
'Cause I know you can't really be mine
I can see it's your own heart you need to find, not mine
And lately, I can see it won't turn out the way we
Want it to be
We should forget it, and not regret it
Oh no honey, don't tempt me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to miss you
I don't want to kiss you
Or hear the sweet things that you say
Don't want to know what I'm missing
I Don't want to listen
Just want to watch you walking away

I remember you and I
And we looked into each other's eyes
We could make the long, long night just fly right by
But love's illusions don't seem to last
Maybe we just moved too fast
So please don't call me
Don't speak softly
Oh no honey, don't tempt me

[Chorus]

Even though I know this is right
Can't stop dreaming about you at night
With or without you, it's still a fight every night
And me, I didn't know the way your heart could grow
So cold
But me, I'd let go, let my love show
Oh on honey, don't tempt me

[Chorus]",I Don't Want to Miss You
Karla Bonoff,"One life with one love
Are the things dreams are made of
Two hearts a world apart
The music stopped before the dance could start

[Chorus]
So goodbye, now please don't cry
For now, all the words have been spoken
Time heals the heart that's broken
My love just walk away

We played those long days
You thought that we saw it the same way
You love as blind and if I seem unkind
Oh I wish for you that I could change my mind

[Chorus]",Just Walk Away
Karla Bonoff,"I've been writing letters every day now
Since you've been gone
Talking to you by telephone
For what seems like a whole life long

But I've got something to give you 
That the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in 

I can't send it in
Even by your closest kin
The thing that I'm speaking of
Is a whole lot of love 
A whole mess of love

How long 'till you see that we're in this together?
How long?
How long?

If you weren't so far away
So far from here
I'd make your tears go away
And make you see clear

Oh, you'd see a night when two hearts were surrendered
How long?
I don't want you to be the one I remember
How long?
How long?

Oh, time goes by
In the blink of an eye
It's passed over you
There's no time to hide
Won't you stand by my side?

Now you're here
And hey
I'll spend all my life with you

And I never really knew how to love
I just hoped somehow I'd see

Daddy kept us warm
(and) What will I do when he's gone
How will I carry on

Yes I know when it's his time to go
That I'll have to grow up too
Oh can't I stay right here
And be daddy's little girl

So how did the years go so fast
Or did we just lose track
So now we can't waste any time
I'll make each moment mine

Yes I know when it's his time to go...

The time keeps moving
Life keeps passing
There's still so much to say
But I will go on
I will be strong
I will find my way

When I look in the face of the child
I see you in her eyes
And we're all so much the same
We'll carry on your name

Yes I know when that you have to go
And I have to grow up too
Oh can't I stay right here and be daddy's little girl
Oh can't I stay right here and be daddy's little girl






",Daddy's Little Girl
Karla Bonoff,"Traveling at night, the headlights were bright
And we'd been up many an hour
And all through my brain
Came the refrain
Of home and it's warming fire

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has it's own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still

The people I've seen
They come in between
The cities of tiring life
The trains come and go,
But inside you know
The struggle will soon be a fight

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has it's own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still

Traveling at night,
The headlights were bright.
But soon the sun came through the trees
Around the next bend
The flowers will send
The sweet scent of home in the breeze

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has it's own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still",Home
Karla Bonoff,"Oh baby, this time it's a good-bye
And you can be sure that I won't cry
Our love is just a faded story
I'm walking down the road
And you've just got to let me go

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on anymore

And what was that sweet lullaby
And were all those promises just lies
Well, I was just a fool to love you
I knew it all along
I can't look down, I know I'm falling

[Chorus]

When you act the way that you do
I want to scream and shout
You keep on playing games
I walk around the block
And think maybe you'll change
But just when it seems we've got it all worked out
You start naming names
I don't believe that I was the one to blame

Any maybe next time you'll cry
When someone like me says good-bye
You'll wake up when she's gone and wonder
How you could let her go
But look at me, I'm going under

[Chorus]",I Can't Hold On
Karla Bonoff,"Everywhere I look the sun is shining
But it's always raining here inside
I can see
You really had a hold on me
It's a mean old love
With a flame that never dies

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye

Everywhere I go you're in my shadow
When I turn around there's no one there
And it's a real bad sign
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye
Won't you tell me why

Ask anyone you know
And they'll say love fades away
But this hearts' cryin' just like yesterday

And it's a real bad sign
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

So won't you tell me why

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye",Tell Me Why
Karla Harris,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you",Where Do You Start

Too many people have lost their souls
Damned to a life of decay
Been a lover for far too long
Without the power to refrain

Karma to Burn,"""Hey! Hey! He was fine, just we sell out.""

They come to feast on purist man
They come to feast on mortal tan
Filling their bodies with disease
Swollen still like killer bees
For that lack from their prize
They fucked their children, staring eyes

Karma to Burn,"So this is permanent 
Love's shackled cry 
What once was innocent 
Turned on its side 

A cloud hangs over me 
Marks every move 
Deep in the memory 
What once was love 

Oh how I've realized 
How I wanted time 
Thought it too protective 
Tried so hard to find 

Just for one moment 
Thought I'd found my way 
Destiny unfolded 
I watched it slip away 

Excessive flash points 
Beyond our reach 
Solitary demands for 
All I'd like to keep 

Let's take a ride out 
See what we can find 
My newest collections of 
Hopes and passing times 

I never realized 
The lengths I'd have to go, 
All the darkest corners of 
A sense I didn't know 
Just for one moment 
I heard somebody call 
Looked beyond the day 
And there's nothing there at all 

Now that I've realized 
How it's all gone wrong 
Gotta find some therapy 
This treatment takes too long 

Deep in the heart of 
Where sympathy felt swayed 
I got to find my destiny 
Before it gets too late",Twenty Four Hours

I know you want it so come and get it, cheerio

Karmin,"I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it
When I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day
It's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
They don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
You and me were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, cause I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, but you're supposed to be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was you, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white girl, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up now I'm dyin', I need you, come back for heaven's sake

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time

I need a doctor, doctor

'Cause I'm killing every jigga that try to be on my stuff
Better cuff your man if you want him, I can get him
Cause he accidentally slip and fall on my crack
Oops I said on my crack
I ain't really mean to say on my crack
But since we talking about my crack
All of you haters say hi to that
I'm done
No really though, I'm not done

Ay ay ay ay ay ay, let's go!!!
'Cause I feel like I'm running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'cause you know I gotta win everyday day, day
See they don't really really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never stop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
Oh you ain't never gonna flop me
Every time I come a jigga gotta set it, then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that any little thing that jigga think he be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna dadadada
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, to make it clearer to a couple jiggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and again
And I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul
A jigga better call a ref, and everybody knows my style
And jiggas know I'm the the best when it come to doing this
And I be banging on my chest, and I bang in the east, and I'm banging in the west
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next?
See the way we on it and we all up in the race and you know
We gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
Cause we struggling and hustling and sending it and getting it
And always gotta do it take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Gotta know I gotta have it, have it

You ain't hotter than mine, nope, not on my time and I'm not even trying
What's poppin' Slime? Nothin' five, and if they trippin' forget 'em five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive, these jiggas as sweet as pumpkin pie

I know a place to go escape

And I don't really know just how to say it
We speak all day and never talk

So how'd we end up on the rocks

The tidal wave is forcing us to swim at a distance
So our love is washing away
With all the push and pull we're caught up in
Can we brave the tidal wave

Can we brave the tidal wave
Can we brave the tidal wave

I'm freaking out and sinking inside
I hope we find a ground that's high
Just know my love will never subside

I needed to know, why

Oh no
This can't be happening
Oh no
This can't be happening

This myth is meant to die
You're coming blind in this madness
I'll bide all of my time for your love
Come on, crooked man you'll die
Like excuses pouring out a child
Sing: ""S.O.S. you saint""
But make room for laughter
No man tried here

This water's dark and cold
God's not where you hoped
In this moment come and gone

It's too late, mayday
Call out: ""Mayday!""
While I'm still alive
Hey, no matter

I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't think this will end well

Hey
There goes my love again
No-one's
Coming now
Hey
Out on my own again
Fading face
Broken frown

Hey
I guess I'm fucked up again
No-one
Will find out
Hey
Stare at your feet again
Don't say
You don't know

This water's dark and cold
God's not where you hoped
In this moment come and gone
It's time we all moved on
It's time we all moved on
It's time we all moved on

Away!

Still I remind myself
How I define myself
Still I remind myself
(I needed to know)
How I define myself
(I needed to know)
I needed to know
I needed
I needed to know

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So if you like the sound of
The glass that breaks against the wall
I'd trade it all for several
Pieces of your anger
I am the interest of your heart
Say: ""This would wash away""
I'm climbing this rope, I feel God
Would I care to stare you down?
I portray you in different light",Deadman
Karnivool,"

I want you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better than what you make believe

All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs

I won't do it
I've rushed you
Patiently
Guarding the life that you deceived

I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream

You won't have to wait long
They'll show up again
Make way for the fall

Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who you gonna call when you wake up?

See now
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board

If this is entertaining
I hope you enjoy the view

Wide awake
And still asleep
I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it
Can you say?
Honestly?
Wide awake
And still asleep

Don't leave this too long
(It won't take long)
Tomorrow will come
(Hang around)
You won't have to wait long
(We'll rise up again)
It's your day in the sun

They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again

Please wake up!!
Please wake up!!

Karnivool,"Don't listen
Don't even hear a sound they make, it breaks you
Unspoken
Words that taunt you when you listen
Forgotten
Words that haunt you while you're sleeping

You seem afraid, don't be alarmed
It's only the face of things to come

Servant to the sun, we are beings, we become as one
Lighting every cell, every shape we will never form
And is it relevant?
Our fears, our faults
As foolish as it sounds

So lead us on (Only one way left)
Through the world of false promise
It's one thing to be forgiven (Only one way left)
Only you could learn how to let it go

So we are

Servant to the sun, let us see, we are still as one

Here lie my fault
I'd give up everything
To see what you see
And dream on

Why can't we dream on?

Don't listen
Don't even hear a sound they make, it breaks you
These words won't help
To save you

Servant to the sun, we are beings, we become as one
Lighting every cell, every shape we will never form

This babble from our mouth

Who we are I fear most of the time
Carry on shuffling in order and in line
Who we are I fear most of the time
Carry on whipping boy, stare into the light
Stare into the light
And it feels familiar for good reason

I want us to break the case we're in
With one of the tools of this catatonic skin
Remove all the parts
I want us to face the shape we're in
A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin
Lets reset it all
Lets reset it all

Well it stings and it hurts, is this how it's meant to be
Well it stings and it hurts, is this how it's meant to be
Well it stings and it hurts, a small price to pay to be
In control and rebirth what our future's meant to be

Who we are I fear most of the time
So carry on whipping boy, stare into the light
I want us to face the shape we're in
A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin
Let's reset it all (we are, we are, we are)
Let's reset it all (we are, we are, we are)

Karol Adam,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Karol Conká,"Vim pra ficar, chega e dá um confere
Sou o que o povo prefere, meu estilo é o que difere
Totalmente livre e leve ao mesmo tempo que ferve
A batida me causa febre, aquecida nada interfere

Me preparo pra embarcar, eu vou levar pra qualquer lugar 
Tudo que aprendi quero aproveitar
Sem desistir, sem medo de errar, 
Ganhando essência sem disperdiçar

A crença é vitamina, foi deus que me ofereceu
Vivo e transito na rima enquanto o bumbo me anima
Resultado me alucina, me envolvo, eu tô no clima porque

Tenho disposição de saber me soltar sabendo aonde pisar
Vejo que meu esforço só vale a pena mesmo se for pra alcançar 
Fazendo história trilhando uma trajetória

En cambio tu, mala actitud

It's not about what ya want to know

Is another girl better than me
Looks so pretty she's the kind I lead

I give you all you want and more
It's not tricky it's what it is what it is

Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love

Shy away from the deal
Ya sitting by something so real
You think your clever
But the other side is better

I give you all you want and more

Når ingen av de løp da de var på et fristed
Lærte at umulig betydde mere kanskje
Hvis ingen av oss turte så vil'ke en dritt skje
Jeg var kanskje'n minste og jeg bomma to ganger
Traff på det siste men ingen sa løp for
Ingen av de visste at vi kunne løpe sammen
Før jeg traff linja, men ikke var død
Nå spiller broren min det samme jeg spilte
Og han går på samme skole men drømmen er'n annen
Håper han var positiv, da hele laget tvilte
Og han tenker at det er bullshit og løper som faen

Vi inte vågar gå ut ifrån
Då kommer rädslan och tar oss (Då kommer rädslan)

Tråkk ut av ruta og få blåveis
Det er lenge sia blåveis betydde et jævla vårtegn
Håndflata under haka når jeg drømmer meg vekk til
Onde tunger sier hva som sømmer seg
Og du har tapt da, skjønner du ikke det?
Man, jeg er drømmen, jeg er alt du ikke ble
Kaster meg fra fjellet, ligger nå I fritt fall
Jeg ser deg I ruta di, du har øya til en tiltalt
Vit at du er skyldig I å følge regler
Jeg skylder ingen ingenting, men jeg kan si jeg lever, mafakkas
Jeg gjør steinen til grus inni neven
Eneste ruta jeg kan fanges I er bussen eller TV'n

She's gonna turn me down and say,
""Can't we be friends?""

Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry,
Heave a sigh,
And wonder why,
And wonder why?

I thought I found the gal I could trust,
Watta bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends?
Karrin Allyson,"When Charlie speaks of Lester
You know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician
In those days they put him in an
Underdog position
Cellars and chitlins'

When Lester took him a wife
Arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet
Love is never easy street!
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely!

Tonight these crowds
Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon
Every feeling goes on!
For you and me
The sidewalk is a history book
And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed
Day by day
Generations on down

We came up from the subway
On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
With the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music
To two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar
There's a sign up on the awning
It says ""Pork Pie Hat Bar""
And there's black babies dancing
Tonight",Goodbye Pork Pie Hat

Karrin Allyson,"Bye-Bye country boy
You've been a joy, a shiny toy
Glad we played your County Fair
I'm glad you came to see me there
I sang that song, looked right at you
You came backstage like I knew you'd do
It's a doggone shame our week is through

It's time to go, it's closing show
You still think that I'm a star
Just shows how hazy dumb you are
If you'd just say ""Hey, stick around""
I'd tell my Band I ain't leavin' town
But you don't dream I'd settle down
Do you country boy, sweet shy country boy

Bye-Bye country boy
I got to pack, I can't look back
Don't come 'round and say goodbye
You mustn't see a big star cry

Still wishing you had made me stay

Karrin Allyson,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

An' this is what I said

A grande ilusao do carnaval,

Numa pétala de  flor

E cai como uma lágrima de amor

Karsten Vogel,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary
Kartet,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",Y

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue

And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.

Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.

I see the girls and all of the lies you tell me. 
Just when I think things are alright,
no way my mistake you never change. 

Here comes the pain again.
Here comes that pain you bring to me. 
Here comes that same old pain again. 
Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain.

Call it woman's intuition. 
But I don't feel like your sincere no. 
Oh and I get these premonitions baby, 
one day you'll have me back in tears. 
Cause every time I give you my heart, 
you take it and you tear it apart so slowly. 
Just when I think love is alive, 
no way my mistake you let it die.

Here comes the pain again. 
Here comes that pain you bring to me. 
Here comes that same old pain again. 
Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain. 
Again, oh again, again.

Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain.

Why should I give my heart, to have it torn apart? 
I gave my best hoping someday things might change for me, though I can't foresee. 
I just know that you'll bring the pain.

Here comes the pain again. 
Here comes that pain you bring to me. 
Here comes that same old pain again. 
Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain.

Don't want to love you no more, 
I'm through with love for sure.
Well don't feel much like feeling that pain. 
Don't want to want to go around, tired of being let down.
Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain.

Kasabian,"Staring at the Sun (Lab Rat Mix)
Summer stretching on the grass
Summer dresses pass
In the shade of a willow tree
Creeps a crawling over me

Over me and over you
Stuck together with God's glue
It's going to get stickier too
It's been a long hot summer
Let's get under cover
Don't try too hard to think
Don't think at all

I'm not the only one
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you took a look inside

I'm not just deaf and dumb
Staring at the sun
Not the only one
Who's happy to go blind

There's an insect in your ear
If you scratch it won't disappear
It's going to itch and burn and sting
You want to see what the scratching brings

Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach
Will we ever live in peace
'Cause those that can't do
Often have to
And those that can't do
Often have to preach

To the ones
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'll find
If you took a look inside

Not just deaf and dumb
Staring at the sun
I'm not the only one
Who'd rather go blind

Intransigence is all around
Military still in town
Armour plated suits and ties
Daddy just won't say goodbye
Referee won't blow the whistle
God is good but will He listen

I'm nearly great
But there's something missing
I left it in the duty free
But you never really belonged to me
You're not the only one

Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you stepped back inside
I'm not sucking on my thumb

I'm staring at the sun
Not the only one

Keep this all in your mind
And get it inside my window

What do we become
Trying to kill each other?
You're faking it son
Gonna get you tonight
I suck another breath
To the hearts of the Revolution
Cause you still ain't right

Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know
I bet you can't see it
Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know
I bet you can't see it

Can't see the signs
Of a real change a commin'
Take another sip
From your hobo's wine
Get yourself a million miles
From this concrete jungle

This is a time
Full of fear full of anger
A hero's exchange for a telephone line
Whatever happened to the
Youth of this generation?
Cause you still ain't right

Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know
I bet you can't see it
Where did all the love go?
Now I don't know why
Oh why

The rivers of the pavement
Are flowing now with blood
The children of the future
Are drowning in the flood

Where did all the love go?
Now I don't know why
I don't know why

In this social chaos
There's violence in the air
Gotta keep your wits about you
Be careful not to stare
Oh oh oh oh

Where did all the love go?
I don't know, I don't know

Where did all the love go?
Now I don't know why
Oh why

With the nut job swigging his crystal meth

And the wind up merchants are out in force
Telling you my brother to change your course
And you won't be the first to think it's wrong
When all you really want is to band a gong
Cause it's all sawn up in our misery

We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again

Giving it everyone, now that's all done

And prayed for the mayhem to start

In pulling the stitches apart

I came incredibly close
Jumped in a swimming pool

Than live a life on your knees""

I find it hard to sleep

I'm sick of counting sheep

I have my bag and baggage
To keep me warm
I zip my coat up tight
As I walk into the storm

Oh, come on and save me

A wise man told me that we are born with wings
But never taught to fly
Doesn't that make you wonder why
Is it to prevent us from falling out of the sky
Or is it to stop us from soaring too high
So let me ask you this
Are you running around in a circle, going nowhere fast?
'Cause when you look at the man in the mirror
He's made of nothing but glass
You're never aware that mountains don't move themselves
Tectonic plates make them shift
That all it took was a staff to part the Red Sea
All it took was a bus to Montgomery
A single woman who refused to give up her seat
We fought an entire army with a bouquet of flowers back in the '70's
But now you're taught to remain without will until you run out of energy
Afraid that if you strive for an ideal you end up like a Kennedy
It's like being on a treadmill every day but never losing any weight
'Cause to see success the food before you digest has to change
We're stressed and high, get depressed and die
But still afraid to question why

When did we stop chanting?",Glass

We lost a few good men on the way
Started out as quite a crowd
Let tomorrow wait another day
Let tomorrow wait another day

Didn't we all have such a good time?
Didn't we all have the greatest night
The greatest night, the greatest night?

Knowing that you'll wander in through the door, door

There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads
Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never died

Summer is here once again
And there you are
I see you're alone so I make my move
Give me the eyes the ones that lit the fuse
The eyes that could lift up my feet off the ground, ground, ground

There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads
Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never died

Come on now, come on now
Come on let's get together
Come on now, come on now
Come on let's get together

There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads

Kase One,"Look what you're doin' to me
I'm utterly at your whim all of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
Automatic, automatic

What is this madness that makes my motor run
My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

My hands perspire and shake like a leaf
Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure, they tell me

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
Automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic

Kasey Anderson,"Somebody said State Street's covered in ashes
I didn't ask for a name, I knew it was you
In your bulletproof grin and your false eyelashes
You took a handful of blood and you painted the sidewalk blue
And they said, they said
You were out there raising the dead
But it looks like you covered up most of your tracks
They're sure they'll find
Something you left behind
But I know you a little better than that
You don't look back

I remember all the rules that you taught me
You said, ""step right boy, this city's just a game""
And ""stick to the sidestreets, you'll never get caught
But you left me on the boulevard, cold and screaming out your name
And you said, you said
The sky was spitting out red
But I just saw a couple shades of black
You moved like smoke
Left me holding your coat
And I know, wherever you're at
You don't look back

I heard your hair's a different color
That don't change how you look in the back of my mind
The older I get, the more I discover
You stare into the dark long enough
Something's bound to shine
And I said, I said
You left me for dead
But there was never any truth to that
I could breathe just fine
We both know damn well once you start lying to yourself
You're trapped
And you don't look back",Don't Look Back
Kasey Anderson,"I still miss someone
At my door the leaves are falling 
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
'Cause I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me

Kasey Anderson,"I had the carburetor cleaned and checked with her line blown out she's hummin' like a turbojet 
Propped her up in the backyard on concrete blocks for a new clutch plate and a new set of shocks 
Took her down to the carwash check the plugs and points 
I'm goin' out tonight I'm gonna rock that joint 

Early north Jersey industrial skyline I'm a all set cobra jet creepin' through the nighttime 
Gotta find a gas station gotta find a payphone this turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone 
Gotta hit the gas 'cause I'm runnin' late, this New Jersey n the mornin' like a lunar landscape 

The boss don't dig me so he put me on the nightshift 
It's an all night run to get back to where my baby lives 
In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy radio relay towers won't you lead me to my baby 
Underneath the overpass trooper hits his party light switch 
Goodnight good luck one two powershift 

I met Wanda when she was employed behind the counter at the route 60 Bob's Big Boy fried chicken on the front seat she's sittin' in my lap 
We're wipin' our fingers on a Texaco roadmap 
I remember Wanda up on scrap metal hill with them big brown eyes that make your heart stand still 

Five A.M. oil pressure's sinkin' fast 
I make a pit stop wipe the windshield check the gas 
Gotta call my baby on the telephone 
Let her know that her daddy's comin' on home 
Sit tight little mamma I'm commin' round I got three more hours but I'm coverin' ground 

Your eyes get itchy in the wee wee hours sun's just a red ball risin' over them refinery towers

Kasey Chambers,"Well I don't have as many friends because
I'm not as pretty as I was
I've kicked myself at times because I've lied
So I will have to learn to stand my ground
I'll tell 'em I won't be around
I'll move on over to your town and hide

And you be the Captain
And I'll be no-one
And you can carry me away if you want to
And you can lay low
Just like your father and if
I tread upon your feet you just say so
'Cause you're The Captain, I am no-one,
I tend to feel as though I owe one to you

Well I have handed all my efforts in
I searched here for my second wind
Is there somewhere here to let me in I asked
So I slammed the doors they slammed at me
I found the place I'm meant to be
I figured out my destiny at last

Did I forget to thank you for the ride
I hadn't tried I tend to runaway and hide",The Captain
Kasey Chambers,"Well I never lived through the great depression
Sometimes I feel as though I did
And I don't have answers for every single question
But that's OK 'cos I'm just a kid

Well I've seen pictures of my mother
When she looked exactly like me
And I've seen all my friends running for cover
Running from something they can't see

And it's not easy to get handle on my life
But I have tried it time and time again

But I still cry just like a baby
And I answer back to feel a little free
And I still fly even though I'm gonna fall
But I'm too far to let it get to me

Well I'm not much like my generation
Their music only hurts my ears
And I don't hide my pain to save my reputation
It's too hard to keep up with these years

And it's not easy to a habit disappear
But I have tried it time and time again",Cry Like a Baby
Kasey Chambers,"As you're disappearing I'm hearing
All I wanted you to say
I should focus more on the thought of
Letting you just slip away
But I get this strange feeling you're not revealing
Everything you wanted to say
So it's just a little harder for me to play the part of
Watching you walk away

So before you disappear again
Just think of what you're feeling and Don't Go
There's more to what you're telling me
I'm not buying what you're selling me Don't Go

Don't you understand that I'm stranded
In a feeling I can't shake
Don't you realize that I'm frightened
Of all the things you're gonna take
And now you seem so distant so much
More resistant
To ever let the feeling show
So it's hard for me to face it
Even less replace it
Everything you're letting go

So before you disappear again
Just think of what you're feeling and Don't Go
There's more to what you're telling me
I'm not buying what you're selling me Don't Go",Don't Go

That makes me feel I've gotta ride this road
I wouldn't change it if I could
And me and this road you
You know we've got an understanding
It won't leave me at home and I am
Too tired to do just what I should
And last night I asked if I could
Take comfort in the rosewood
The road said nothing at all 

Well cos it don't talk back unless the wind blows hard
I drive it all night with the wheel of my car
It won't leave me running for the door
And if the paints still wet I can just slow down
And it all goes away on the other side of town
And nothing is that easy anymore 

Well the hurt won't leave with the sight of white line
But it eases up my pain for a while
The only habit that I keep
And miles take time but the time is mine
And always moving suits me fine
I'll catch my breath when I sleep
And after all that I've done
I'm not half what I'd hope that I'd become
There's still a long way to go 

Well cos it don't talk back unless the wind blows hard
I drive it all night with the wheel of my car
It won't leave me running for the door

I wouldn't change a thing
I'd have you back the way I had you then
But one thing that I know
This time I wouldn't make you go
I'd have you back I wouldn't lose you again 
But I learnt the hard way
I can't have it back what I had then
Yes I learnt the hard way
And I know I won't have that chance again 

Some nights I sit on my own
With a feeling of alone
Wondering if your ever coming home
But I know why your gone
I'll be the first to say I'm wrong
But it's hard to spend another night alone 

Cause I learnt the hard way
I can't have it back what I had then
Yes I learnt the hard way
And I know I won't have that chance again

Just to pay my bills

But it sure won't buy me love 
Well I brought me a car
And I brought me a road train

On the highest hillside
Bigger then this town

Deprived was something we always heard

I don't have a heart

I call my baby just to hang up on the phone
I take a rain check and I never ever check the rain
I leave the carton out for hours on summer days
I took a course on how to break the most hearts

Crossfire doesn't burn you
It only hurts when it gets you in the heart
If you don't hate me, you'll learn to
I thought I had it clear from the start
I don't have a heart

I found the answer but I never liked it
I took my baby to the 10 step platform
I tied a reef knot on twice with the blindfold
I whisper 20 steps and point direction

Crossfire doesn't burn you
It only hurts when it gets you in the heart
If you don't hate me, you'll learn to
I thought I had it clear from the start
I don't have a heart
I don't have a heart
I don't have a heart",Crossfire
Kasey Chambers,"I've been crushed like paper
I've been washed like rain
I've been scared of sleeping
In case I wake up the same

I've been broken and battered
I've been lost in my home
I've been cryin' a river
I've been cold as a stone

But falling into you
It carries me far enough away
And everything you do
It lightens up my brighter side of day

I just hope that the wind
Doesn't blow you away
I've been left unattended
I've been thrown like a ball

I've been rolled with the punches
And I didn't feel a thing at all
I've been crossed by the wires
I've been blinded by the light

I've been burnt by the fire
I've been kept out of sight",Falling into You
Kasey Chambers,"I still cry for Baby Jesus
And I still pray when I'm alone
And when I'm lost
He'll come to find me
Because he died to save my soul

When I can't walk he's there to carry
When I speak he hears my words
When I wake and I have nothing
He sends me gold, francencene and mer

When I cry my tears of sorrow
When my heart will only ache
And if I'm troubled when I'm sleeping
He will hold me until I wake",I Still Pray
Kasey Chambers,"If I was good
I'd tell everyone I know
If I was free
I wouldn't be so keen to go

If I was wrong
I would take it like a man
If I was smart
I would get out while I can

If I was broken
I would probably let it be
If I was dying
I wouldn't go out quietly

If I was lost
Well my heart would feel the same
If I was honest
I would probably be ashamed

But if I were you
I would notice me
If I were you
I would wait for me

If I were you
I would easily hold me and say
It's all gonna be OK

If I was rich
I would spend it on my own
If I was dignified
I'd only smoke at home

If I was dark
I would only dress in black
If I was chosen
I would gladly give it back

It's not for you to judge
From all this kind of stuff
I'm only half of what you see",If I Were You
Kasey Chambers,"I'm a little bit lonesome
I'm a little bit blue
I can't stop crying
Since I lost you
There's a pain in my heart
Like a lightening bolt
I'm a little bit lonesome
It's all your fault

Well every time I wake up, I got you 
Rolling in my head
Your eyes are lookin' at me but they're 
Seeing her instead
I've got a big fat broken heart with a
Pain
Sharper than a steel-plated knife
We thanks to you these lonely blues
Are the best things in my life

Well the last time that I saw you she 
Had hold of your hand
You waved across the street at me so I 
Turned away and ran
When I got home I got a honktonk song
I played it til my eyes went red
I grabbed a glass I said ""kiss my ass""
I'm gonna drink you out of my head",A Little Bit Lonesome

Do you wanna ride in my car
Its parked out on the street
Or just stay with me a while
Before I fall asleep
Take these tears
Wash your skin
I'm havin' trouble breathin'

Kasey Chambers,"When the fire burns out here
It's brighter than the city lights
Warmer than a heart of gold
And dingo's howl just to break the silence

The sun comes up just to break the cold
Last night I woke
With the stars looking back at me
Swallowing the sky
I felt no anger, I felt no shame
I felt no reason to cry

If I'm not here in the morning
I'll cry a river of tears
But I'll learn to live in a new town
But my heart is staying here

When it's quiet out here
A hundred miles away
You can hear the train on the line
The whistle blows just to break the silence
I wave just to break the time
I close my eyes
I think of runnin' water
I think of runnin' away
But the fires burnt to ashes
And it's darker than before
But I can see as clear as day",Nullarbor Song

When hearts are breaking
There's not enough rain to carry

And when the sky gets whiter
And the air is colder

I set my camp against the wind
But don't come close to lover sin
I danced the edge of an avalanche
And lived to walk away 

I slept all night on a bed on nails
I've walked bare feet on a fire trail
I've felt hot needles under my skin
Since you went away

don't forget me 
I once lived to see your smile
Take a moment and add this to your pile
This dream is over and you want a change of style
Now Ill been lonely for a while

I've broken through your battle lines
Tampered with the hands of time
I walked for miles under desert skies
And still I've made no ground

Watched me beg with your stone cold face
Thrown me away while you kept your pace

Kasey Chambers,"In the year of sixty two the land received a soul
A baby cried, a mother smiles,
A hero made of gold
A heart like a burning flame
Beats like an old steam train
Bound to an other by chain
Silver lining

As the boy because a man
The child inside remained
High on life with wide eyes open
A smile that could dry up the rain
A name that would now ring true
Like a sun on a sky of blue
The khaki legend grew
Ten feet tall

With heart in heard
You bridge horizons
You paint the wild
Mother nature rises
You walk alone
But I will follow you home

Like a diamond from the ground

For a plastic way of living

I should've broke free
I should've known better
There ain't no guarantees

It shattered slowly
It's broken through
I should've known better 
Than to let myself fall for you

I've been paying less attention

It's complicated but so sincere
I'm saturated from living in here

I never wanted anything but to never be alone.",Saturated
Kasey Chambers,"I'm a little bit stronger,
I'm a little bit wiser,
It's a little bit clearer in my mind.
I can shout a bit louder,
I can feel a bit prouder,
But nothing makes sense to me this time.

I'm a little bit older,
I'm a little bit surer,
I can fight a bit harder against the tide.
I can make it sound better,
Much better than sadder,
But nothing makes sense to me this time.

I thought it was good, I thought it was fine,
I thought it was just a matter of time,
The sun would shine.
I held my breath, I covered my eyes,
Thought I was just clearing the skies,
The sun would shine.

I'm a little bit braver,
I'm a little bit wilder,
I can stand a bit closer to the light.
I can stand a bit taller,
Like I wouldn't fall over,
But nothing makes sense to me this time.

I thought it was good, I thought it was fine,
I thought it was just a matter of time,
The sun would shine.
I held my breath, I covered my eyes,
Thought I was just clearing the skies,
The sun would shine.

If my collar fades to white
Should I hold my head up high

I thought it was good, I thought it was fine,
I thought it was just a matter of time,
The sun would shine.
I held my breath, I covered my eyes,
Thought I was just clearing the skies,

I come to hover by your side
So close your weary weathered eyes

Leaves you weaker leaves you tears
Hold my hand much tighter

Kasey Chambers,"Sweet hallelujah, I can just see the light
I can see it down in a hole
Crawl, baby crawl, we can do this together
Take my hand, take my heart and my soul

We gotta roll with the branches and laugh like a clown
Cry like the driving rain
Ask for forgiveness and drift like the wind
And love like a hurricane

I can see it from losing my way
Your words are all fading but the closer that I get
I can breathe in as clear as day

Kasey Chambers,"When I was a little girl
I had the biggest backyard in the world

It went on for miles and miles, was wide as it was high
Down to the horizon, all the way up to the sky
And every now and then
I heard a vile tree cry my name

When I was a little girl
I had the biggest backyard in the world

Covered up with red dirt as far as I could see
I shared it with the railway and the Aborigines
Southwest of Adelaide
All the way down to the sea and back

When I was a little girl
I had the biggest backyard in the world

The sun would shine until the day I asked for it to rain
Countdown the sleeps until the tea and sugar train
Ten cents on the track for days
Before it never came and went

When I was a little girl
I had the biggest backyard in the world

Sitting 'round the campfire that started from a spark
Rolling down the Gun Barrel Highway in the dark
Making sure that I had all the room here in my house
For me and all of the world

When I was a little girl
I had the biggest backyard in the world",Nullarbor (The Biggest Backyard)

You're the light shining down
You're the mansion on the hill

You've got it all
But the only thing You need is me
You need someone like me

You're the water coming up through the sand
You're the one who makes me wanna be
Just the way I am

Somewhere a voice is calling

Waiting for the day to come

Hoping that my own looked better

Kasia Kowalska,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

Waved goodbye now a faded line,
This memory, isn't all that I get?
