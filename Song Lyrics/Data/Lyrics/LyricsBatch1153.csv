Sax Gordon,"have horn will travel
me and my horn we live on the road
ain't no place too far to go

and when I'll get ther baby everything will be alright
I've been from Paris to London to New Orleans

and when I'll get ther baby everything will be alright
and when I'll get ther baby everything will be alright

To 
rio de Jenero, to Istambul, I'me going Kansa City

and when I get to you baby everything will be nice

Sax Gordon,"Melancholy serenade every time I hear it played
Right out of space your haunting face appears

There were other serenades broken promises we made
Why must I pay day after day with tears

Alone in my room I watch the ghost of you
Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear

Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear",Melancholy Serenade
Sax Gordon,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

Sax Gordon,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Sax-of-Praise,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow

Saxon,"Out with the boys
Testing my virility
The booze and the music

Saxon,"Far below the valleys
Hidden deep beneath the snow

Of the frozen rainbow

Holds the power of life

Far below the valleys

Saxon,"If you're taking a flight 
At the speed of light
If you're shaking your heads to the band
If you're there in your hordes
But you're not on the force
We're taking this place to the ground

In the heat of the night 
When you're fists are alight
Forged on anvils of steel
If your body's on fire
About to expire
We go through the threshold of pain

Pull your head back 
Hold your hands high
Shake your body
If it's too loud
And your brain hurts
Fill your heads with heavy metal thunder

On the wings of an eagle 
You're hoping to fly
Holding your hands to the sky
On a blue sea of denim
Checkin' the band 
Your banners and scarves held on high

If your backs are embroidered
Come down to the front
Don't sit there and do as they say
We're an army of thousands
Surrounded by lights
Nobody stands in our way",Heavy Metal Thinder [Abbey Road Mix '09' [Bonus Track] [Remix] [*]
Saxon,"Ride the silver eagle out of JFK
Up the eastern seaboard destination Portland Maine
When we saw the people at the concert hall
The seats were for five thousand it made us feel so small

Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA

Stopped off at Niagara taking pictures of the falls
Tried to cross the border were accosted by the law
People down in Texas from the red hot burning sun
They couldn't stand the heatwave but we just kept rollin' on

Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA

Driving into Nashville on the highway interstate
Had a holdup on the freeway we end up being late
Flew into Chicago but we never heard the blues
Played some rock 'n' roll there then down to Batton Rouge

Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA

Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States
Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
Right on through the USA

Fought the vigilante at the end of our first tour
We made a lot of friends there we'll see them all next year
As we fought the big deadline, oh, we won't forget the days
We rode the silver eagle right across the USA

Midnight rider keeps on rollin'
On our journey 'cross the States

Saxon,"Breaks away the chains that bind me
Gives me sympathy
Keeps me running on the high road
Keeps me living free

Helps me through the night

We came out of the night
A great expectation from the man who ran the show

Twice the speed of sound

Sharper than steel
I'll race across the ceiling of the world

They're waiting for the tide
The sails are open wide
They're sailing to a better place to dwell

[Chorus]
They're sailing to America
Fly the banners high
They're sailing to America
Set the rigging high

The quayside's full of friends
A farewell in their hands
No-one knows if they'll reach the shore
As Plymouth slips away
They'll not be back again
They're sailing off towards the promised land

They're sailing to America
Fly the banners high

The Mayflower's on her way
Set sail for many days
The lookout searching for the distant shore
Anchored in the surf
Their journey's at an end
The pilgrims set their feet on virgin land

They're sailing to America
Fly the banners high
They're sailing to America

Hands on the wall

Mauled by a hound
Hanging around
Is this for real
I don't know when I'll be found
Set me free

Set me free
Set me free from you

Taken by force
By you of course
Far from my bed
I know I'd rather be dead
Set me free

Set me free
Set me free from you

Fire in my brain
Burn me insane
Making your mark
Don't leave me here in the dark
Set me free

Inside my head
Maybe I'd feel better dead

Stood a peaceful island basking in the sea
No one knew the danger lying deep beneath the earth
That Mother Nature's victim would sooth the monsters ..?..

Krakatoa
The earth...was .. Sunda with a deadly roar
When the dust had settled Krakatoa was no more

With a scream of fury the power was released
The biggest known explosion the world had ever seen
The shockwaves traveled 'round the earth to smash the Richter scale
The tidal wave that followed left death and desolation in it's trail

The earth...was ....   Sunda with a deadly roar

A thousand scarlet sunsets the land, a sea of fear

But the deadly cloud was high above
Taken by the wind
Spreading like a plague across the land
A threat you couldn't see
Nothing you could feel
Something evil floating in the air
Look towards the East
For the danger yet to come
For the Earth
We make a silent prayer
Red alert, red alert
Screaming in my head
There's something I'm not sure of going down
Red alert, red alert
Screaming in the night
That fallout seems to follow me around
We were on the Russian border
When the news began to break
Of a nuclear reactor melting down
Sending deadly clouds of dust
Into the atmosphere
Falling down like rain upon the ground
Red alert, red alert
Screaming in my head
There's something I'm not sure of going down
Red alert, red alert
Screaming in the night
That fallout seems to follow me around",Red Alert

In the unforgiving sea
Steaming into legend

Saxon,"Emma stands alone tonight
Staring at the stars
Trying to find the reason why
Her world was torn apart
She's sick and tired of trying to keep
The wolves back from the door

She couldn't stand the pain (*)
She tried to come in from the rain
She was a victim of her heart
Is no-one to blame

What happened to the dreams she had
Visions of her life
Now they're only shadows
Fading in the night
She's given up believing
Turned her back and slammed the door

(Repeat *)

Emma weeps alone tonight
Passion was her crime
No-one hears her cry for help
Her back's against the wall
She's standing on her very edge
She's waiting for the fall

We will survive
We are strong

Maybe today is the day
You'll pull through
Everyone's chasing their dream
At the end of the rainbow
You gotta follow your heart
That's where you have to go
 
We are strong
We will survive

Break through the clouds of night
And head on home

Standing on the precipice you could be leaving soon the life you know

Will you live or will you die
Your fate depends upon the surgeons knife
Detached from all reality
You let yourself be pulled towards the light

I'm living my fantasies
At twenty thousand feet

That makes me feel so good
I can see the world below just shooting by
Twice the speed of sound
That's how I like to ride

At twenty thousand feet

Sharper than steel

Move the stone unleash the past
The one you seek you'll find at last
The boyhood king he walks the past
He hides behind his golden mask
Deep inside his tomb of gold
The greatest story ever told

Dig my friends set him free
Read the words the prophecy
Death will come on swiftest wings
Whoever moves this sleeping king
Carved in stone the book of death
The pharaos curse wil take your breath

Death will come on swiftest wings

Say Anything,"I wake up in a room and realize I'm insane again
This is the fifth time straight in a year I've ended up in here
Eating p.b.j's and watching the church channel nightly
I didn't mind what I did
I fell behind on my nightly four-course meal of rainbow pills
And now I'm wondering what is fake and what is real

But who's that ghost who keeps walking by my door
I've never seen a girl look so good in thick-rimmed glasses before
And I feel her gaze on me during sleeping hours and when I shower

They let us play with markers but I keep trying to draw infinity
And I read the bible to pass the time
But one day out of nowhere, she sits down and looks over my shoulder
I'm shaking harder then I've ever shook before

She sings
""Oh, do you remember me? is your mind that worn?
We both were born to be one with that which the public scorned
Though you were forlorn in despair
With your drugs and your hardcore porn
Trust me, those days won't be mourned""

Pupils painted blue
You haters know it's true

You say you hate the breadth of my nose for my daddy's earlocks
Shunned before you pierced it and sold it and called it ""punk rock""

Like Judas the traitor we are both favored and deeply flawed

I think I'm fine the way I am

So I'll go out and get crunk with my friends
My own brand of medicine
Defecate on the lawns of the barbies and kens
She made me want to take the blade to my skin
And tear out the machine she installed from within
I'll blow her love away

We roll in as a pack we will roam and regress
So many standards to suppress

Seduced by a priest she was out to destroy me
I'll drink her love away

Now it's shitty, shoddy cheap
Sell it in my sleep for the fakes to eat
While they kiss my ass and tell me what I need

And the words you said, still ringing in my head
Wonder where the love they stole is hiding

All I want to do is be mended by you
I don't want to be confused, I just want to find you
All I want to kill is that which keeps me ill
Underwhelmed and unfulfilled

They're in denial of the knowledge
That they're living in a lame excuse
They're in denial of what you are to me
My heart, my love, my guide
It's not alright with me, the love I lack, I need, I want you back
The circle torn apart, I used to have a heart

I used to know a girl with the deepest trust
That a man could ever know
I broke her neck from the lack of respect
I learned as an embryo on the west coast
Where the dead paint Hollywood red
The facade is well-fed with the blood of the capulets
Spread like jelly on bread across the doors of the first-borns
Weaned from birth on meds

All I want to say is this could be ok
I don't want to be a slave, I just want to spend my days

It's beautiful and valid
Go tell the false friend, who doubts your art

A closet corporate ballad
Compose the theme, compose the theme
That seems to haunt the sultan's dreams

Yes their truth is a lie, a sickly, sober sky
Don't you dare lie down your sword and die, oh small fry
Crime of the century, know what it meant to me
They'll label us what they can never be

Hate me but I am in your heart pulling it apart
Burning up a black hole

All those magazines and stifled teens
Whose trite teething is outdated
Have minuscule minds of clay in need of chiseling away
This war's been reinstated
So spit a wad in the face of their fucking flawless race
And all they've consecrated
I won't believe the twisted web they weave

They can stitch you silent now, or bitch the violence out
I'm disavowed, I'm proud to shun their know-how
The wolf beget the lamb, now it's in his hands
I'm reeling from a feeling that they've banned

Our last stand goes, hallelujah, love lost

I've got an empty wallet and a record cover
The stage, hot and worn like an aging lover
So I spew a comet of verbal vomit
Sac religious, of Christ or Islamic

Say Anything,"Failure is angular, it isn't circle shaped

I laid a curse on her, another wasted verse on her, gave birth to her

Oh God, forgive me Moses, Jesus, Allah
I have made such an awful regret of today
I have made such an awesome regret

I could be more than this
With all the time I have I am an insult to the dead
You should be over this, the infidelities are on account of me
And so I cheat on you, I beat on you with words and with actions
I will never tell the truth, in debt, aloof
Without you I'm a fraction

Oh God I have made such an awful regret of today
I have made such an awesome regret

Too bad this won't come easy where I stay
Where I lay in my bead of needles, where I play
Like I'm a bad child on a baby's birthday

I'll take a permanent vacation, I've got two months to live
And all the mental masturbation is just too much to give

diapered, desolate middle-aged doom
On your knees in his downtrodden shit-eating grin of a room

If only you'd start breathing, I'd court you exclusively

out to take your revenge for the crime
filled with fire and finally mine.

Paraded you around like a second place prize,
hair done up, black holes painted on your eyes
Held a book burning in your back yard
while your parents observed from their window, slightly scarred
And I've watched with my shovel in hand
I have in faith in you, child
From his nightmares I've plucked a plan
where that prick, to the world, is revealed as a wicked man
This is a prayer from your biggest fan

I'll photograph your decent, your fall
When you bitch, and beg and crawl

Sit and trade wit, and smoke and we cuss
Talking about our friendly border drug bust.

Record like mine, give up or go gay.
You're looking down at me with blue and black eyes
Pissing down a storm from purple night skies.

That all that is large and all that is slight
Is flowing in the stream of holy flood lights
Writing holy books, lord knows we bite.

But if this is your will and my testament
I will bow to no belief that they bent
Still I'm just a sperm begat from your love
Basking in the bread, the blood of your dove

Can I lie with you in your grave?

There's a crack in the edge at the end of the world
Where I will sit with my love in this fluorescent swirl
Eat us up, break it down, to the tiniest cell
In our room with a view and a window to hell.

Where those who buried bodies in their barrels of fun
Will be marched through museums that display what they've done.
They'll be shot up through the sky by a cannon of sin
Where we'll reluctantly let them in.

Like snake skin, my collection
Acquired through shallow misdirection
And as I drive tonight

Daring me to try
I feel alive tonight

Though I suffer from dyslexia,
Mild man-orexia
And my hair cannot commit
To one popular genre of music

That a girl can't take a boy's last name
Or end up divorced and estranged

Tiny diamond in his stroller with his first step chasing the hearse
Sippin' at a cup that's half way filled
But looking forward to the day he pays that drinking bill

There's no peace, there's no quiet on this earth
He confided, nestled tightly in that womb beneath the dirt
Hurt no more and when he turned 24
He wrote a note to nail to God's front door that said

I want death
Death for my birthday
I want death
Death in the worst way

From the high paying job and the love of his life
He rode a roller coaster ride of lust on their wedding night
They made a baby in unmentionable ways
He was ungrateful as a man could be on that blessed day

And underneath he thought this is all a phase
Just a blip in the existence of a structure vast and great
Pray each night to his cross of a charm
For the one thing he couldn't afford just to buy the farm

Or watch them start a war that's fought for ideals that are dead
I'll never have an argument again

Will be your salt
My blood will hydrate you off
My heart will be your meal
And I won't ride the cycle of the way it kills to think and feel

Nothing ever will

That voice inside my head, belongs to me
Now everything is pros, and cons

Everything gets stock, in black and white
Everything is ups, and downs

And we took everything for granted - for granted
And we were wild, and we were young
We bent the rules, and took our chances - our chances

But I'm not really close, to giving in
I'm fighting every pound, and every inch
Losing every day I live
Every single day

But I don't wanna feel, the way I do
I don't wanna say, the things I do
I just wanna stay right here

There's only one bridge left for me
My heart is almost free
Beautiful by my side
But all I think about is you
And tonight I'm letting go
About to give in

I surrender myself
Into the arms of a beautiful stranger
I surrender myself to you - to you
I surrender myself
Into the arms of a beautiful stranger
I surrender myself to you - to you

Who really loves me
You really love me
My beautiful stranger
You really love me like I love you



",I Surrender
Saybia,"
Caught in a well
Between heaven and hell
It's getting lonely out here
Highways and hotels
And headliner shows
It's all just making me sad

Sorry if I ever let you down
I never meant to
Stayed inside the only world I knew
'till I forgot
That nothing is as beautiful as when
I am with you
And life isn't life out there
Without you here

Just when I thought
There was nobody out there
No one who quite understood me
I glanced to the side
And I found you there smiling
Patiently holding my hand
Saying over and over
It's ok love
Easy love
I'm here

So finally I'm ready to reveal
What my heart tells me
Bring out all that's good inside of me
And let it shine
Knowing that I'll never be alone
While I'm with you
And that life isn't life out there
Without you here

Just when I thought
There was nobody out there
No one who could quite understood me
I glanced to the side
And I found you there smiling
Patiently holding my hand
Saying over and over
It's ok love
Easy love
I'm yours



",It's OK Love
Saybia,"United nations
Divided countries
Good intensions
With hidden frailties

What does it take?
To bring back sanity
What can I do?
To bring back me and you

Stayed together
Through stormy weather
Still divided
But soul united

what does it take?
To bring back sanity
What can I do?
To bring back me and you

Saybia,"I took a life for granted
Until it slipped right through my fingers
Although forever parted

I feel your presence more than ever
There's no return from where you went
And it leaves me stranded

It's written in my heart
It's written in my soul now
All the memories torn in me

A constant overload

It's written in the sky
It's written in the stars now
I'm haunted by the things I know

I should've done
All the time we should have had

Is gone

Tonight

In me
Your light will shine

And with a beautiful sky above
I was reduced to being human
I feel I'm ten feet under
And I long for your embrace
In the absence of your love
I pretend to be alright
But it's written in my heart
It's written in my soul now
All the memories torn in me

A constant overload

It's written in the sky
It's written in the stars now

And all the time we should have had

Solitude
In a world of loneliness
Thoughtful thoughts
In a world, that's moving on
We're leaving home for good
We're leaving home for good

Day by day
In a thousand different ways
Got no time
To realize, what's going on
We're leaving home for good
We're leaving home for good

(Chorus)
In the end we almost made it
At the point of no return

Scream...

Scream for help
When nobody is around
Who is to blame?
Us? For being partly sane
We're leaving home for good
We're leaving home for good

(Chorus)
In the end we almost made it
At the point of no return

Dressed in misty autumn blue
Found their way
To a bright, and sunny day
We're coming home for good
We're coming home for good

And made an MC like me
(What, what?)

Who came to conquer everything
Within the breeze, man, woman, disease, please
You looking at me in a dumb and funny way
But come to find out your crew was some 12 year old runaways

Mentally, I am of the 23rd Century
Technically microphones and drums are my specialty
Cloud 9 to catch the scent of my rhymes
I'm stomping through the streets rapping
(Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
While you're marching for dimes

It's like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
Sports trivia, Who's head coach is Bobby Cremins?
Georgia Tech Yellow jackets, Iller by the millisecond
I be kicking like Tekken, check out my record collection
It's kind of fat, this is why I rap like that
I be oozing out the funk like a case of the clap

Here is something you can't run from
So stop look and listen, you take your position
We do it like this son, the illest prescription
A lyric incision into you eardrum

Hey, is you smoking something there?
Contraire, mon frere 'cause in my verbal contract
To give niggas instant convulsions, experience eternal seizures

Tongue got you chokin', rollin' down your throat
And, and leaving you to believe
That planet Earth gave birth to a deadly disease
We'll never freeze even at the point of a handgun

Swallow the bullets and spit 'em back random
Holdin' motherfuckers for ransom
Thinkin' they handsome
Stick they family for all they own and some

My life is based on tantrum
Is that why yo ass be steady rappin'?
You know, fuck a platinum Finagler philosophy
Y'all player haters ain't understanding my verbosity

Constantly off lots of weed
It costs to be the boss don't take a loss
No double cross hater back off of me
Feel animosity in high velocity both prodigies

Your ears are rung, my noise

And they don't know my brother's in her belly
And all I really want in life is the average
Ain't no luxuries to fuck with me I'll manage

Playin' tunes, I'm wonderin' if you'll be home soon
But if you ain't, that's aight cause I ain't bout to lapse
I win awards, catch acclaim while I'm makin' stacks

I can't pretend that it don't affect me

Ooh, it keeps me up, I say my goodbye

I know my brother loved his homie Ben
So your turn, man, this I let you flow on one more beat
I make it shine and I'll see you when I live on your street
This is my path now, I had to split town and do it fast now

I passed out and woke up with a whole new rationale
I kept it to myself, you couldn't accept it
So I left it alone and let it roll on my records
These are the airwaves of Evelyn

See, everything ends, it just takes a little longer
Don't forget I'm your friend
And I'll remember everything live, I'm no pretender

Scarface,"I'm on a rampage been forced to look at darkness 
Brought up being heartless 
And with a gauge is how I'll guard this quietly I sit plotting
Hits like a lunatic waitin g
For a bitch to start some shit so I can hit 'em 
With a string of bullets 
Coming from a tech 9 
Warned you not to test mine 
And if you make it you'll know next time 
That if you fuck with me I'm gonna get ya 
And when I catch ya 
You'll be a victim of the the call the body snatcher

Many claim to be a gangsta 
But that gangsta ain't a gangsta 
That gangster is a prankster yea a pranksters
How I rank yea at the sight of blood u hold ya 
Stomach then your running hands over ya eyes 
And like a ho ya start to vomit 
But I ain't never backed up rack up as they sack up 
And giggle and these niggas when they die while bodies stack up 
Like I said before the DJ akshens my identity 
A homicidal maniac with suicidal tendencies 
The judge'll try to sentence me to 10 I'll never blink 
He'll change it say I'm psycho and just send me to a shrink 
20 months I'm in seclusion and my heads filled with confusion 
Got a feeling that I'm loosing so I've come to this conclusion 
I gotta get the fuck out I cant take it anymore 
Caught a watchman at his post so I rushed him to the floor 
I was thinkin to myself what if his posse comes t get me 
I know if I'll die I gotta take some niggas with me 
Put my hands around his neck began to choke em 
Grabbed his pistol out hit holster then I smoked 'em 
Waited a second and heard motherfuckers coming 
Grabbed an extra box of shells and started running 
Now in the nigga cops are running 
After its time to snatch somebodies cause I'm the body snatcher",Body Snatchers
Scarface,"I'ma born killer, you're face to face with scarface
You tried to ice an x, but that's a motherfuckin waste
Your schools fucked up g
And your momma shoulda warned ya about a nigga like me
Cause I don't weep and I don't sleep
Save that motherfucker black, cause talk is cheap
And uh, since you got beef
Lets take it to the streets and I'mma bring it to your ass g
I'm commin from the heart son
And I don't take no shit, but I'm about to start some
Now which one a you hoes wanna jump
If you got static, then get it off your chest punk
Cause I ain't bar none
If you're feelin lucky then go ahead and get cha some
I ain't with this fucked shit
If ya ain't in trick, then get your ass in ya trunk bitch
Cause I'm about to square it off
Hit ya ass in the chest with the tech and try to tear it off
Send you back to mommy, it's a plastic
And hadda bitch out huntin for a casket
I'm on the for realla tilla my nilla
I'm a born killa

(chorus)(2x)
I'ma born killa
Born
Killa
""don't fuck with me""

My momma did her part
But it ain't her fault that I was born with out a heart
In other words I'm heartless dude
I don't love me, how the fuck I'mma love you?
That's right, you guessed it
I'm legally insane, marked mannick depressive
I'm takin all types a medication
To keep me out the mood of premeditatin
Yo, the log around my lone is worse
I'm havin thoughts of killin me, but I'm killin you first
Mr. kindness talks but I don't listen
A victim of society fucked by the system
My whole life's been a see saw
I'm up one day, down and out on tomorrow
Right now I'm even more upset
Some shit that happened to me that I don't think I'll ever forget
You think I'll let it die, but I ain't
It ain't because I want to, it's because I can't
I'mma getcha but I ain't goin into it
Cause ain't nothin to it but to do it
See it ain't no sweat to me
Cause in the fo place, you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
I'm not your average dealer
I'mma born killa

(chorus)

Now I'm livin where I can cause I'm homeless
Can't make point calls cause I'm phoneless
I ain't, I'm starvin duke
I can't go to mommas house cause mommas starvin too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause that's the only way a niggaz gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushin that panic switch
I'm gettin paid and you're gettin killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dyin ho and can't nothin save ya
I'm doin bad, so I'm goin bad
Huh, and you never expected that from brad
But there's a lotta things pressin me
And ain't the nigga to let the mortredresser dressin me
So I'm comin out winnin
100,000 in the case now I'm comin out grinnin
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pulla hoe move
He reached for his pistol
The 12 gauge went ""boom"" shoulda heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one a you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth
And that's how it is nigga
I spared a couple a lives, but I'm still a born killa

What, fade me how?
(Sheeit, on this rap shit)
Come on, nigga..

I brought my chopper and my hard hat
The shit's fucked up now show a nigga where the war at
Cause I'm about to clean house
Stick this a.k. up your ass and blow that fucker clean out
Cause you niggas in the wrong
You came up short and now we fin to get it going on
I ain't your average motherfucker
You step out of line and watch a motherfucker bust ya
Cause you done came at me the wrong way
I ain't no Clint Eastwood, nigga, and you done picked the wrong day
So bring your ass to the battleground
Rat-a-tat-tat, like that is how my gat'll sound
Avoid no niggas cause niggas be human
I squeeze the trigger and niggas be moving
Cause I don't point it in the air and pull the trigger (why?)
I'd rather point it at your ass and watch the nigga die
I gives a fuck about your team mates
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish you never seen 'face
You shoulda seen that lil nigga Brad
James through here, seen Dave and, yo that nigga bad
And your homies better stand still
Don't make my brother Warren bust one of you bitches cause the man will
Don't bring your ass to my picnic
Cause I done had it up to here with all you niggas talking that bitch shit
So you better get your shit right
I'm from the state where you rarely see a motherfucking fist fight
It's all about the gun blast
So you can miss me with that bullshit you spitting with your punk ass
It's the diary of a born killer
Don't have to worry about me falling off this thang cause I'm a strong nigga
Doubt my regard of the hard
With niggas behind me from East Oakland to the South Park
I've got the mind of the man right behind ya
You can run, you can hide but I'll still find ya
Like I say there's no getaway
And I'm gon' have it where your family'll have to throw your shit away
It's the return of the real niggas
I'm prejudiced to a certain extent but still I kill niggas
I'll bust that ass on the fucking double
So push on with that ho shit, bitch, cause you don't want trouble
So get your ass up of my shoestrings
And let your shermed nigga do things

Ay, ay, ay where you fin to go, fool?
(I can't fuck with it, you got it, man)
Come on, man .. you wanna rap, nigga?
(I can't do it) Come on
You see, you see! That's how motherfucker is, dogg
That's how motherfuckers be, punk ass hoes
You motherfuckers better quit fucking with me like this
That's really doe",Diary of a Madman
Scarface,"Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why..
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
Till a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabbling with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again, cause he's in a grave
I always think about it killer
""My daddy was a dope man, so I'ma be a dope dealer""
How will the family explain it?
""My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!""
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid living foul fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizing life is hard
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation's got me guessing
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die

It was crazy how it happened
Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera capping
All I could see was a pistol spitting rounds
And the boy was just screaming as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled, get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You should've seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up
Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher
But if he survives, I'm willing to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by ? on Scott Street
School was letting out,
""Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?"" ""watch me!""
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun
He shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just staring at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullard
His brother was just dazed in a shock, ""Why you do it?""
""Why you shot his moms Jay? Shit""
""haha man fuck that bitch""
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, ""Hey yo J.D. homey""
Hung it up and rolled down Dagger
Heading for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of being taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven niggas all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray,
And a second to die",A Minute to Pray and a Second to Die

Deep in the heart of South Park lurks a stalker
S.A. fool, native Houston South Parker
Born and brought up to be a heartless motherfucker
No one else to blame, fuck it blame it on my mother
When I was growin up nobody seemed to give a shit
And that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either
Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's
Learned the game of hustlin, fuckin dopefienders
Sellin niggaz beat, in other words amphetamines
My game was more advanced, sellin speed I'm goin broke
Got em up with Floyd and Floyd had fronted me some dope
Learned to rock it up, now I got it sold
Time to go for broke, motherfuck who I owe

Bought me a Caddy, 30's and vogues
Brand new crib, brand new clothes
Mom would ask questions, and often pitch a bitch
Where am I gettin the money? Mickey D's ain't paid me shit
I'd make up a story, just to get her off my back
Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin hard, stackin paper like Trump
And I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word em up a nigga sprayed em
Momma told me shoot first, and ask questions later..

There goes 21, and still stackin 30's
Brought my brother Warren Lee down from New Jersey
He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin Lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause Ac'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers, to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggaz stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggaz up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin noise

Scarface,"So Brad, tell me what's going on in your world?

It's fucked up, I'm looking at myself in the mirror
I'm seein' something scary, it's slowly comin' clearer
I had a funny feeling that today will be the day
That someone tries to blow my motherfuckin' ass away

But hey, I'm running out of time to be blunt
I never had the nuts to make the motherfuckin' final cut
I've been depressed for no fuckin' reason
But every problem's got a reason

I'm kinda havin' trouble breathin' somebody help me
Hear my plead, my battle cry, my psychic told me
That it's gonna be hard for Brad to die
She told a lie, I think I oughtta shank the bitch

I got my pistol, thinking if I should shoot the shit
Click, bang, I jammed it, I slammed it aw shit, goddammit
I'm havin' a fucked day to begin with
I lost a bitch, a bird, and then this

My homies tend to think I get too high
I'm doing fine, now pass me the formaldehyde
The only thing that seems to help me cope
Is when I'm drunker than a motherfucker puffin' on the chronic smoke

And then I'm able to deal with the woes
The friends, the foes, the bitches, the hoes
I gotta gang of niggas, but none of them I'd fuck
I gotta gang of bitches, but none of them I'd trust

Trust a bitch, nope, uh, uh, never
I'm havin' too much trouble tryin' to keep my damn self together
They got me by the balls so please, help me
Break these motherfuckin', these motherfuckin' walls

I scream, there's no one there to hear me cry, I guess
It's hard to scream, to motherfuckers when you scream inside
I see my future and it's coming in in plain view
I blame myself, but mommy dear I blame you

'Cause the world was fucked from the first
And havin' me only made the matters worse
Now look at what they did to me
That's some fucked up shit for a kid to see

Motherfuckin' dealin' after dealin', killin'
After killin', I'm tryin' to check a million
The world's going straight to fuckin' satan
A fuckin' shank's about to blow my fuckin' brain

Shit, damn I'm dead, I'm finally through
Hearing all these voices in my head
Somebody finally got me, I'm looking at myself
Outside of my fuckin' body

So now I'm standing face to face
Mr. Scarface versus Mr. Scarface
We were two different people from the start
One nigga's too smart the other too fuckin' hard

We both refused to be outsmarted
Dearly departed, the battle's already started
Fuck it, it's on, I duck, I weave, connect, oh shit
I'm struck, caught me with the piercing lead

And realized to myself I shot my own fuckin' self
Damn, suicide is quicker
I try to break the wall, the wall keeps getting thicker
I really start to miss my mother

I try to climb the wall, it's higher than a motherfucker
I wondering what that sound is
I'm having major trouble tryin' to walk around it
There ain't no getting up I'm trapped

I really should've dropped my motherfuckin' strap
'Cause when I think about it now
I shouldn't have tried to climb the motherfucker
I should've broke the motherfucker down",The Wall [Screwed] [Version]

But it's on, 'cause you up against a real nigga.
I steal niggas and kill niggas, I'm the real nigga.
You up against a motherfucker with a quick temper.
I'm a born killer, in case you don't remember.
I got my pistol, but I got a different clip in it.
Click-click, motherfuckers, can you get with it?
You ain't the nigga that you thought you was, fool,
And now I'm after that ass on the cool.
It's all about survival of the fittest,
Nigga, you shouldn'a did this.
And now I got's to handle my business;
I got to get your ass up out the picture.
I ain't the nigga you want to fuck with,

Whenever I bucked my knuckles up on a nigga's head.
So you can sling 'em all you want, but I be slingin' leg,
Cause like I said before, I'm a motherfucking dreadlock,
Putting fools in headlocks, giving niggas head shots.
And everybody in your motherfucking area
Is trying to scrape up some money, so they can help to bury ya.
But I can give a motherfucker about your family,
Because your family ain't my fuckin' family.

Nigga in black, standin' right here, next to ya.

Just gimme a reason, and I'ma be squeezin'

From these motherfucking gunshots,
And leave your whole fuckin' family sad.
Don't fuck with the Brad, motherfucker,
Cause Brad's comin' agg

Where the cocksuckers at, where the cocksuckers at?
(Where they at?  Where they at?) (There they go,) at my gat.
Cause I'm about to heat up, like a vet.
Chop shit down on your set and then jet,
And smash off in my soap box.
Cause I'm down for the dirt, and motherfucker said it don't stop.
Now, which one of you hos want to fuck?
Make your way to your truck,
I want to see the way that you jump.
Cause by the time you get your keys
I'm letting loose, motherfucker, lay 'em down, nigga, and get these.
It ain't shit for me to watch 'em fly.
So die, motherfuckers, die, motherfuckers, die, die.
I ain't no motherfucking good guy, dog,
And I don't give a good guy damn about none of y'all.
I'm from the state of the motherfucking, gunslingers,
Knockin' dicks in the dirt with just this one finger.
So get your ass caught up in this gangsta shit,

Every time I pull my Benz-o out, you pull me over
I'm sick of motherfuckers who be jocking Whitey's coattails
Blacker than a motherfucker, sweat me 'bout my dope-sales
Niggas just take your cut and get your ass up out my face
The only thing you probably get from me is a cock-sucking pistol case
Unless you plan on plantin a lil' something in my shit

That they can fuck with a million dollar nigga

And end up getting hit with the fucking kitchen sink

If they got some unsolved murders, then give him some of them
Just because we're niggas and they figure we're no smarter
We'll sell each other out, and start rattin' on our partners
They start bringing up shit that happened back in '85
And then comes the largest jury, bitch, they fuckin time!
You might as well play the state cause you gon' do day for day
And selling out your homeboys ain't the shit
Cos y'all gonna have to die in this bitch, bitch!

Give it to me, baby, let me show you what that Deuce like
Let me hit the swisher and let me show you what my juice like
Ripping up shit in '93 like a chainsaw
Making niggas say, ""Goddamn, that little nigga raw!""
And I can square the shit off right
I'm straight from ?Warm Cloth? where these niggas don't fist-fight
They got they motherfucking pistols shooting shit up
Just enough to get your punk ass lit up
It's not about the set I claim, cause I don't bang
I'm just a nigga from the hood who let his nuts hang
And I can give a motherfucker about a nigga if he's bigger

Once upon a time there lived Lucky
Lucky got fucked because Lucky tried to fuck me
(Tried to fuck you how?) Hey yo, I gave the boy some shit
He came up short, then he got his ass sidekicked

(Is he dead?)

You can run but you can't hide, I find ya
Just when you think the shit is over, I'm standing right behind ya
You crossed the wrong motherfucker, now you paranoid
Cause I'm a nigga these niggas just can't destroy
I'm on the hunt, so keep your shit low
But yo, I'm kinda slacking up, I should of killed you from the get-go
Nigga, but this is it
We could of talked it out like players, but now I'm on some gangsta shit
What possessed this motherfucker to try to punk me?
What possessed this motherfucker to tell me fuck me?
Guess he thinks that I'm a light weight
Hey yo, your shit's fucked up, so let me help you get your life straight
Cause niggas get they ass dunked
For fucking with me, I ain't no motherfucking punk
Punk, I got some good hands, but I prefer my gat
Now where you at, cause I'ma slit your cool-Aid pack
See, niggas got it all wrong
Some niggas fake the gangsta shit, so niggas think we all songs
They come up to a motherfucker joking, man
They want to test a motherfuckers boxing game
That's when they get they ass trunked
Cause when you're fucking with me, I'ma tear this motherfucker up
You're fucking with a dread
You're taking two to your head, I'm coming fed
(Is he dead?) Yeah, he dead

""It had to be a murder""
""Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature""
""It had to be a murder""
""I looked him in the eye -
Then I shot him in his face""

See, niggas make mistakes, black
They shoot, but they don't shoot to kill, so motherfuckers stray back
But I nip it at the bud
Because I'm not down for dying, motherfucker, so I go for blood
And let em know I'm on some real shit
Not with these fake motherfuckers on the team who won't kill shit
I scream it like I mean it
I mean it like I scream it, cause, niggas, I done seen it
Motherfuckers with the false nuts
Come with the static and they get they funky ass shot the fuck up
So I give they ass a big blast
Instead of turning the other cheek, I get dead up in this bitch ass
Cause yo, this shit is real life
I'd rather be piped up in a box than be running from a steel knife
So once I put your ass in the red
I'm going for the head
Just making sure you're dead

""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""You're dyin, hoe, and can't nothin save ya""

It's over, I'm smoking on some sweet leaf
Ready to put my dick up in this bitch named Charisse cheeks
A dick-sucker's nightmare
I'm wanting some action, so I'm rolling through your hood and I be right there
I blew my horn cause I don't knock
The only thing that's on my mind is fucking this bitch and putting her ass out
But yo, this shit is breaking up
She's telling homie she don't want to fuck, so homie loc is breaking up
It just so happened homie see my low
And now he's madder than a motherfucker, especially when he see me blown
And now he's got some beef, too
But yo, I ain't gon' squab my partner over this freak, do
So I cut the shit quick
And said, ""Yo, we ain't gon' have to come to ? over this freak bitch
If you want her, you can have her
Because I got what I wanted, she sucked my dick, so, money, you can stab her""
But I said this to myself up
If I told homie I fucked his gal, then homie nut the fuck up
So I kept it on the down-low
And just laid back and watched the fuckin reaction of this clown hoe
But this nigga is a real trick
He's talking shit and wanting to jump off into some ill shit
So I told him fuck him
And if he came a little closer, then I would have to buck him
He came a little closer, so I gave him one
And left the motherfucker stunned
And right before I mobbed
I gave him one more for the road, just to finish the fucking job
So off with your head, bitch
Cause I don't fuck around with that 'return from the dead' shit
I'm making sure I get you good
And if you twitching like you still alive, homie loc, I wish you would
Cause that just gives me one more reason
To grab the trigger of this motherfucking pistol and continue squeezing
I don't believe in second ghosts
You only get one chance, and if you slip, then yo ass is smoked
Some niggas say they feeling this
But niggas ain't real with this
Cause niggaroes ain't killing shit
But yo, I guess it's dead
And I be giving you 2 to your motherfucking head
Making sure you're dead

""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature""

This is going out to
All those fake motherfuckers
I ain't gonna say no names

""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""

Scarface,"They try to take advantage of a nigga cause I'm black 
They lookin' at me strange so I'm lookin' at they ass back 
I got a little problem so I'm writin' you a note 
A letter to the KKK from the black folks 
I'm tryin' to get it on  tryin' to check the grip 
And there goes officer cracker tryin' to sink my fuckin' battleship 
Turnin' on his flashers  callin' up the dogs 
Now my Lexus Coupe is flex surrounded by the hogs 
Snatchin' out my seats, tellin' me I sell dope 
Am I on probation or parole? I tell 'em fuck no! 
Tell me mister officer, what's the problem? 
What's the matter? 
Why you gotta treat us like scum? Is it that a 
Nigga's doin' a tad bit better than you? 
And brutality is all that you crackers can do 
And mark me up for resistin' yo ass 
When in reality officer friendly kicked my ass, damn! 
You over flex your authority too 
Put your foot in my shoe, and let me try on your boot 
So I can run it in reverse 
You can treat me like god, and I can treat you like dirt! 
The 22 years I been here I saw 
Motherfuckers disrespect god before they disrespect the law 
But yo I gots ta diss 'em 
Cause I refuse to be mislead by this ungodly system 
Mister president I beatin' on yo back do' 
I make yo mind doin' rap but I'm black doe, nigga 

""We are United States of America. You honestly believe 
Just because you wear bags that means you care? 
You have the right to abuse and treat my people like 
They're animals on the street? I'll be damned you're 
Bloods will flow with the hands of the black man 
In the same streets that you killed me and my brothers in.""

Mister mister officer, mister officer, mister sergeant 
Just because I'm young and I'm black I'm a target? 
You say I'm sellin' dope but you fake 
Cause young dope dealers flash cash and make mistakes 
And besides we ain't dealin' no mo' 
Look at my hood, we ain't killin' no mo' so 
Everybody's yellin' peace 
The only war that's goin' on is goin' on with the police 
Cause they ain't stoppin' with the bullshit 
If they could they'd lock us up with some chains and swing a bull whip 
Cause they figure they're the master 
And they can take you to jail or take your life's 
Them sorry bastards 
That makes me wonder why 
The five-o can determine if we live or if a nigga dies 
And to me that shit is bull 
Only god can take life but I still gotta watch the law 
It's bad enough I watch tahe next G 
But even worse I got's ta watch the motherfuckers who protect me 
They fuckin' packing gats yo 
They serve and protect, they don't respect 'cause I'm black hoe 

""Every black man that is a car jacker will start jackin' 
Police cars and watch jaw brains shad on the dashboard. 
Why when you pull us over you show us your pistols before 
You aks us for our drivers license? Somethin' is not right!"" 

Rollin through my hood in my motherfuckin' dropper 
Gettin' tailgated by a motherfuckin' copper 
But I ain't got respect for you motherfuckin' dickheads 
'cause y'all was straight hoes back in school nerdy shitheads 
I finally figured out why you bitches roll in packs 
Cause niggas who ain't shit talk loud and pack gats 
You got a fuckin' pistol, now you think you're a VIP man 
But you can get cut because you'd be just like the next man 
Holdin' me for nothin' 
Runnin' my fuckin' license plates 
My plates come clean 
You call the DEA 
The DEA 
Says I'm a known drug dealer 
Straight born killer 
A motherfuckin' wig splitter 
He don't know shit about a nigga but I'm black 
As far as he's concerned all niggas push crack 
And plus I'm 22, that really makes 'em check 
A drop-top Benz, Lexus Coupe, no respect 
I gotta be doin' long I'm hidin' somethin' from the demons 
He gotta be stringin' yale, let's play someone that's pregnant 
Cause niggas can't have shit but I'm a motherfucking troop 
You come to us like Luke 
Undercover David Duke 
Mister David Duke 
Mister officer 
Mister mister master 
I'm pickin' out your coffin sir 
Die motherfuckers, I'll send your folks my worst 
A breast of pig in a motherfucking hearse 
So fuck you motherfuckers, punk bitches take that 
Cause I'm real with the shit that I speak 'cause I",I'm Black
Scarface,"It's jumping off in H-Town, baby

Strictly for the funk lovers, give it to me

And we really want the whole world to see
How it goes

We want your mind to blow, baby
When you free your mind and let it float
Let me roll
We want your mind to blow
Just let us hang with you

Hanging in the hood, just shooting the breeze
My partners on the cut smoking swisher sweets
Tripping on the hoochies rolling by in they rides
Guzzling up a forty ounce of cold St. Ides
Jamming to a tape to my partner had made
""Growing up in the Hood"" being mixed with Face
Swisher sweet's a killer, feeling nothing but nice
Reached in my pocket for the old school dice
Pulled out a knot and dropped the dice on the floor
And asked my partner Mike what they hitting for
Pulled out a yard and said, ""We betting a dove""
Tee Lee Baby, show your partner some love
Kicking back fading, put the flame to the joint
3-2, drop baby, 3-2's your point
Back in the do' with a fo' and a ace
Picked up his ends and waved the dice in my face
And then he hollered out ""School house!""
Schooled em again, now d's come in ounce
And walked away from the crap game broke
But it ain't no thing, yo, just let a brother smoke

Let me roll
We want your mind to blow
Just got some things to do

Back on the creep after losing some change
Seen my partner, Big Chief and James
Creeping on the boulevard, acting a fool
Tripping on the broads at the old school
Music bumping hard, never turning it down
Trunk super tight with surround-by sound
Paint job cracking cause the punch ain't fade
Jamming that brand new 2Low tape
Windows all smokey, blowing coke-laced seed
I'm throwing up the deuce to the HPD
Now they looking crazy like I sold the hay
Just another day in the heart of S.A.
Roll a little further there, I seen O.G.
With his brother named, S.A. O.G.
They chopped up the hood, so I'm chunking it back
And then they pulled out a $200 sack
When I saw it I almost choked
Twist your partner one, big baby, just let your partner smoke

Let me roll
We want your mind to blow
We got some things to do

Smoking on some lovely, now I'm feeling fine
It's jumping off at the 9.9
5th Ward in the house with the S.A. fools
Ain't no set tripping cause we all so cool
Drinking up the bottle, getting drunk as a skunk
That 151 just ain't no punk
Hit the stage and grabbed the mic and started flexing styles
A stage full of tight MC's goin buckwild
Now throw your hands in the air like that
On the wheels of steel is my homie Lonnie Mack
Getting down on his own
Now I'm finna pass my partner Jay the microphone

[Lil' Jay]
Throw your hands in the air like that
Northside where you at, where you at, where you at?
Throw your hands in the air like that
Southside where you at, where you at, where you at?
Throw your hands in the air like that
Eastside where you at, where you at, where you at?
Throw your hands in the air like that

We want your mind to blow
We got some things to do
Just let us hang with you

My partner Jay's",Let Me Roll
Scarface,"Yeah nigga
Back in this motherfuckeronce again
I'm just letting a nigga know
You know

S.A. and 5th Ward forever, fool

Niggas watch your back cause here I come again
Rapping funky shit for the 199-trey
In 1989 I sold dope for a pastime
1991 they called that nigga Scarface
Started on the team when a nigga turned 16
Stacking that green selling dope to the dope fiends
Daddy seen a scheme, thou so it seem
Cause he hooked a nigga up with a nickel-plated triple beam
Had a lotta game with the beam, that's what it came with
Taught a nigga how to get to funk when it jump
If static jumped off, then I was down for the dirt
When putting in work I ain't no motherfucking punk
Down with my partners that a nigga fucked around with
Hunting for some shit to get up into and we found it
If you had a problem with a nigga we was down with
We rolled by your set and shot your whole click down, bitch
Niggas play for keeps in the city that I come from
Niggas talk shit from out of town, but they don't want none
If you think you want some, then go ahead and come
It ain't where you at, you stupid bitch, it's where you from
And coming through my hood is where you finding all the thugs at
Looking for some dope and they gon' show you where the drugs at
Looking for some trouble, well, a nigga's gonna plug that
Niggas keep they pistols up underneath they rug mat
Show your little ass, go ahead and let your ass show
Talking that shit, punk bitch, you better dash, hoe
Once I get it on it ain't no motherfucking holding this
Kinda fucked up that I'm a nigga that be chauvinist
Niggaroe, the heater want this fool to let the trigger go
But bitch, I got's to give you one to let you niggas know
I'm letting you bitches know

Front, back and side to side
I'm letting you bitches know

How a nigga back in the game I used to start shit
Mopping up the hood, making mtherfuckers squab
You fucked with one nigga out of the motherfucker click
You had to fuck around with the whole fucking mob
Cause niggas rolled thick and they didn't take shit
Quick to put that ass up in a muthafucking lynch
Whip it on your ass, then tie it up to a fence
And since we began it's been that way ever since
My niggas used to kick it up around the fucking pikes
Smoking swisher sweets, drinking Miller Lites
Taking turns heating up the motherfucking mic
And maybe beat a buster out his motherfucking bike
Crackerjacks kept a motherfucker on the hustle
Making sure my business stayed stead' trump tight
Hoes sell flippers, gave two for ten
And even gave up shake to keep my clientele tight
Before long I had customers out the ass buying flippers
Bearskin coats, tight ropes and fat slippers
Fresh fade daily, I had my own fucking clipppers
And all kinds of hoes on my cock sucking zipper
Hoes came in handy, but my money came first
Cause bitches get a ghost when they see a nigga's hearse
So if I ain't have shit I had a motherfucking ?
And could pull on my dick if worse came to worst
So if you got a problem with the way I run my business
Let a nigga know, so I can put you in your place
9 times out of 10 you ain't man enough to deal with
The born killing, dope dealing Mr. Scarface
Rougher than a motherfucker, taking no shit from a
Busta motherfucker who be flexing off the bullshit
Got my bull pump on all you bitch-made niggas
So let a nigga know when you bitches want to flip
I'm letting you niggas know

Front, back and side to side

I had to let you know I ain't that nigga you should toy with
So don't come in my face with that motherfucking boy shit
Never coming soft with that 'love, peace and joy' shit
Mr., Mr. Scarface, the real deal McCoy shit
Sending out a shot to all you busta-ass one times
Suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Cause you don't get props for what you doing for the cops
Except a swift kick and a mouth full of dick
Letting motherfuckers talk ass about your game plan
Just because you got a big gat you'se the same man
That used to get your ass kicked daily back in the neighborhood
Finally got a nigga back pushed like you said you would
Fuck it, I'm a nigga getting down for his cash flow
Down to down a hoe, I'm letting you niggas know
I'm letting you bitches know

Front, back and side to side
I'm letting you niggas know
You know I'm saying?

This is for the
Front, back and side to side

Sending this out to all my motherfucking partners",Lettin' Em Know
Scarface,"It's a new day, ya know what I'm sayin'? 

A new day  brings a new problem to a brother 
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother 
Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke 
Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope 
The lord he had a plan for me 
And with his help  my mother made a man of me 
Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in 
Taught me how to save my little dividends 
So when I graduated I'd have a little school money 
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy 
And flunked outta school with the flag pole 
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul 
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone 
Cause we was alone, and me I bought a death home 
My real pops he broke out with the style 
So I respect my step dad, for raisin' another nigga's child 
So now we livin' comftable 
Taught me the game and how to be responsible 
But back then I couldn't see it 
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin' 
And ended up in a big fight 
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right 
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home 
My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own 
And keepin' me ain't no big deal 
But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels 
Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no 
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke 
And now the money's low 
And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go 
Or either try to find a job so I can help out 
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out 
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way 
So my family can have a better place to stay 
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short 
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope 
And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong 
She just prayin' for me heavily 
Take care of her grandson 
And the lord must of heard her prayer 
Cause he made me get a grip 
And got me on up outta there 
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya 
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then 
But now I feel ya

I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun 
My baby's mother just had my first son 
May eleven, I never will forget the day 
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface 
My first born and yo I'm a proud father 
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father 
And selling dope ain't the way that I can get ahead 
But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed 
I buy him milk, and pampers trying ta do my part 
And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard 
I buy him clothes, and jewelry not the Tonka toys 
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy 
And I don't want my son to look at life 
Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like 
But yet and still I let my son be a kid 
Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did 
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate 
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate 
And now my son is four years old 
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role 
Because these years he'll remember most 
So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close 
But I got a bunch of obstacles 
If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle 
Now everybody's got my baby 
Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy 
""It's your daughter, don't she look like you?"" 
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do 
Because my mother knows the real deal 
All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal 
So now we in and outta cope 
Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support 
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me 
Now everybody knows, that she was just fakin' G 
Come to find out, the girl never had me 
She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy 
And biological tests can prove 
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude 
But now I finally got a real daughter 
No need for the testin' 
I know that I'm the baby's father 
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya 
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then 
But now I feel ya

I feel ya

Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life 
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife 
And got a bigger stick to fight with 
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick 
Because we livin' in a concentration set 
And everyday, we face to face with death 
I seen my homies go and come 
And judgment day is just something we can't run from 
So I know my number's comin' up 
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up 
And even though I hate killin' off my own kind 
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine 
My brother corners trying to keep the neighborhood at peace 
Don't fight each other, we got's ta stand and fight the beast 
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick 
Because we always trying to take another brother's shit 
And the cops is in the same vote 
Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope 
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods 
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood 
And now the story's all twisted up 
And if they gave the cop the chair 
I really wouldn't give a fuck 
Because she left my partner's family with memories 
And after hearin' this I know you don't remember me 
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch 
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up 
Because I know what you did was wrong 
But you won't realize until you dead and gone 
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning 
You straight up shot him from behind 
But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back 
You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act 
But you gotta tell your story to the judge 
Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves 
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness 
Then in reality you took care of your business 
But regardless I know you want to kill me 
But I ain't going' out like that 
Ya feel me? 

Yeah",Now I Feel Ya
Scarface,"So Brad, tell me what's going on in your world?

Its fucked up, I'm looking at myself in the mirror
I'm seein' something scary, its slowly coming clearer
I had a funny feeling that today will be the day
That someone tries to blow my motherfucking ass away, but hey
I'm running out of time to be blunt
I never had the nuts to make the motherfucking final cut 
I've been depressed for no fucking reason
But every problem's got a reason, I'm kinda havin' trouble breathin'
Somebody help me, hear my plead, my battle cry
My psychic told my that its gonna be hard for Brad to die 
She told a lie, I think I oughtta shank the bitch
I got my pistol, thinking if I should shoot the shit
Click, bang, I jammed it, I slammed it
Aw shit, goddammit
I'm havin' a fucked day to begin with
I lost a bitch, a bird, and then this
My homies tend to think I get too high
I'm doing fine, now pass me the formaldehyde
The only thing that seems to help me cope 
Is when I'm drunker than a motherfucker puffin' on the chronic smoke
And then I'm able to deal with the woes
The friends, the foes, the bitches, the hoes
I gotta gang of niggas, but none of them I'd fuck 
I gotta gang of bitches, but none of them I'd trust 
Trust a bitch, nope, uh-uh, never
I'm havin' too much trouble tryin' to keep my damn self together
They got me by the balls 
So please, help me break these motherfucking...
These motherfucking walls

I scream, there's no one there to hear me cry
I guess its hard to scream to motherfuckers when you scream inside
I see my future and its coming in in plain view
I blame myself, but mommy dear I blame you
Cause the world was fucked from the first 
And havin' me only made the matters worse
Now look at what they did to me
That's some fucked up shit for a kid to see
Motherfucking dealin' after dealin', killin' after killin'
I'm tryin' to check a million
The world's going straight to fuckin satan 
A fucking shank's about to blow my fuckin' brain

Shit, damn I'm dead 
I'm finally through hearing all these voices in my head
Somebody finally got me 
I'm looking at my self outside of my fucking body 
So now I'm standing face to face
Mr. Scarface, versus Mr. Scarface
We were two different people from the start 
One nigga's too smart the other too fucking hard
We both refused to be outsmarted 
Dearly departed, the battle's already started
Fuck it, its on, I duck, I weave, connect, oh shit, I'm struck 
Caught me with the piercing lead
And realized to myself I shot my own fucking self
Damn, suicide is quicker
I try to break the wall the wall keeps getting thicker
I really start to miss my mother 
I try to climb the wall, its higher than a motherfucker
I wondering what that sound is 
I'm having major trouble trying to walk around it 
There ain't no getting up I'm trapped
I really should've dropped my motherfucking strap
Cause when I think about it now 
I shouldn't have tried to climb the motherfucker

I should've broke the motherfucker down",The Wall

So I guess that nigga D is up to hit again
I kicks the funky shit and coke, and stupid like I'm Gilligan

You tried to test the wrong nigga, be a tested
Straight from St.Paul but clocking G's down in Texas

But I ain't the average motherfucker, I do the shit that niggas won't do

Then after that I gate and grab his bitch and do the samething

Cause I'm about to clean house
Stick this a.k. up your ass and blow that fucker clean out
Cause you niggas in the wrong
You came up short and now we fin to get it going on
I ain't your average motherfucker
You step out of line and watch a motherfucker bust ya
Cause you done came at me the wrong way
I ain't no Clint Eastwood, nigga, and you done picked the wrong day
So bring your ass to the battleground
Rat-a-tat-tat, like that is how my gat'll sound
Avoid no niggas cause niggas be human
I squeeze the trigger and niggas be moving
Cause I don't point it in the air and pull the trigger (why?)
I'd rather point it at your ass and watch the nigga die
I gives a fuck about your team mates
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish you never seen 'face
You shoulda seen that lil nigga Brad
James through here, seen Dave and, yo that nigga bad
And your homies better stand still
Don't make my brother Warren bust one of you bitches cause the man will
Don't bring your ass to my picnic
Cause I done had it up to here with all you niggas talking that bitch shit
So you better get your shit right
I'm from the state where you rarely see a motherfucking fist fight
It's all about the gun blast
So you can miss me with that bullshit you spitting with your punk ass
It's the diary of a born killer
Don't have to worry about me falling off this thang cause I'm a strong nigga
Doubt my regard of the hard
With niggas behind me from East Oakland to the South Park
I've got the mind of the man right behind ya
You can run, you can hide but I'll still find ya
Like I say there's no getaway
And I'm gon' have it where your family'll have to throw your shit away
It's the return of the real niggas
I'm prejudiced to a certain extent but still I kill niggas
I'll bust that ass on the fucking double
So push on with that ho shit, bitch, cause you don't want trouble
So get your ass up of my shoestrings
And let your shermed nigga do things

Hey, hey, hey where you fin to go, fool?

Come on, man, you want to rap, nigga?

Now, when you're rollin' through yo' motherfuckin' hood
Tell me what you see
(Some motherfuckin' G's)

Roamin' in my motherfuckin' hood and thangs
Seems to me my motherfuckin' hood done changed
'Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs
But now we gots to deal with them survival thangs
Forty-five in my lap when I'm on the creep
Niggas livin' shife, so I roll one deep
'Cause now they see me flippin' in the 1-9-9-4
C.S.I. nigga, black eight-fifty
And now they lookin' at me crazy
But off-brand niggas can suck a dick, because they can't fade me
And if it came down to the gun, black
I never cracked up on the pressure, 'cause I was trained for combat
So get yo' motherfuckin' boys together
I represent S.A., nigga, and we makin' noise forever
And gettin' paid at the same time
So you respect a muthafucka when a muthafucka claim mine
'Cause if you disrespect, you ass out
And they be rolling through yo' shit in the glasshouse
Actin' bad with the flashers on
Makin' niggas get they asses on
'Cause ain't no mutherfuckin' love for fools
Who come around this muthafucka trying to scrub, you fools
It ain't no haps on it, hops
We snaps on the cops
And straps on the glocks
And take the law into our own hands
'Cause you ain't fucking with a rookie, nigga; you fucking with a grown man
And we gon' show you what we mean by funk
Muthafucka, you ain't see my trunk
I got a (SK) and a (AK)
And a (12 gauge) that'll fuck a nigga whole day
So recognize a real nigga from the streets
When you rolling through yo' mutherfuckin' hood, what do you see? 

[Chorus]

Hollerin' at my homie at the swisher house
Scope a forty bag, and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park, and got up under the tree
Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to three
Rapped us up a fattie, and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red, 'cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin', 'cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't want to see it that way
But all I got to say is: you don't want to see that S.A.
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin' don't make us no different
And dyin' don't make it no different
'Cause I done been to mo' wakes in this past year
Than the motherfuckin' Bingos lost last year

To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me

Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scoping, hoping for you to fuck up and slip

'Cause we never had a motherfuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get 'em with game
And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thing
'Cause it's kill or be killed; never cut slack
And if you cut slack they bust back; fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
'Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one
And that's the one that can close the shop

Where my motherfucking kids at  bitch 
Fucking bitch  punk ass bitch!"" 

Hey  today must be my lucky day 
I turned the corner  hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away 
(now where's she staying?) She must be new in the hood 
But I ain't trippin' on that shit, cause it's all good 

I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name 
ain't a damn thing changed , ain't no shame in my game 
She said, "" Used to go Thomas"" 
I slowed my rope, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas 

Now where you headed, she said ""Going to work"" 
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinink, ""Going to flirt"" 
My homies women ain't no thing to me, 
Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me

Super clean with the discus in full

Sorry if I'm being rude, but I've got something to say to you 
Hoping you won't lose your cool 
I want to sneak you out to play with me, 
You can spend the day with me 
And we can ride and see the sights 
Its going down tonight 

Reminiscing on the bitch that I had back in the day 
Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face 
Now that's the pits 
She didn't have to put up a front 
I stuck that ass back in there 
And haven't called her for 3 months 

I guess they send me to be doggin' a chic 
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch 
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master 
Let he take a ride with the braster 
It cool, don't front, ooh, no sex 
No sweat-not even on my mind-we just met 

And furthermore, we can get to those 
But for now I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to ho's:

Now cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped 
Parked my Ferari, now I'm back in the coup, I knocked her boots- 
Your baby's mama put me to work 
I dragged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt 

She wanted me badly so I put it inside 
She got the (front and back , side to side) 
Back and forth with the gangster glide 
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9 

Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the day 
She was asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick 
(now that's sick)And plus she got you staying at home 
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on 
So believe me when you down in the brad 
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass 
So player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose 
I'll be mobbing in my 'Benz spitting this to ho's:

Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the man's child 
The world is different since he's seen it last 
Out of jail been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last 
All he had was his mother's worth 
Now she's gone and he's gotta make a change and make it for the beddah 
But he's back so he's got one strike against him 
And he's young plus he came up in the system 
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen 
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean 
So he's calling up his homie who dun came up 
Livin' like this now they dealin' with the same stuff 
And had that attitude that who he was was worth it 
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first mate 
Now it's different, he's in dead dirt 
And realized that the name ain't coming up but it still hurt 
And can't nobody change this 
It's nineteen-ninety-four and we up against the same shit 

I never understand why 
I could never seen a man cry, 'til I seen a man die

Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy 
Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief

And when your number comes for service then they send it in

How much longer will it be 'til it's all done? 
Total darkness and ease be in all one 
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate 
You took his life, but your memory he'll never take 
You'll be headin' to another place 
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face 

I still got to wonder why 
I never seen a man cry, 'til I seen a man die 

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong 
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on 
And you keep on blacking out, and yo pulse is low 
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go 
Because there's no way you can fight it, though you'll still try 
And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die 
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here 
You start your journey into outer space 
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place 
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light, 
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life 
Make the choice let it go but you can back it up 
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up 
But if you're ready close your eyes and we can set it free 
There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace

Scarface,"So what you gonna do cat daddy? 

I don't know dog
Juss trying to live it one day at a time. 

I hear you man  live it one day at a time

Let me get up outta here man my ride waitin'. 

Aight cat daddy stay true 

Aight man peace 


He greets his father with his hands out 
Rehabilitated slightly  glad to be the man's child 
The world is different since he's seen it last 
Out of jail in seven years and he's happy that he's free at last 
All he had was his mother's worth 
Now she's gone and he's gotta make a change and make it for the beddah 
But he's back so he's got one strike against him 
And he's young plus he came up in the system 
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen 
And this goes to get on top and try to stay clean 
So he's calling up his homie who dun came up 
Livin' like this now they dealin' with the same stuff 
And had that attitude that who he was was worth it 
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first mate 
Now it's different and he's dead as dirt 
And realized that the name ain't coming up but it still hurt 
And can't nobody change this 
It's ninteen-ninety-foe and we up against the same shit 

[Chorus]
I never understand why 
I could never seen a man cry, til I seen that man die 

Imagine life at it's full peak 
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy 
Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief 
Imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace 
Cause everybody's got a different way of endin' it 
And when your number comes for service then they send it in 
Now your time has arrived for the final touch 
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath 
How much longer will it be til it's all done? 
Total darkness and ease be in all one 
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate 
You took his life, but your memory he'll never take 
You'll be headin' to another place 
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face 

[Chorus]

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong 
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on 
And you keep on blacking out 'cause yo pulse is low 
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go 
Because there's no way you can fight it but you'll still try 
And you can try it til you fight it but you'll still die 
Now your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here 
You start your journey into outer space 
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place 
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light, 
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life 
Make the choice let it go but you can back it up 
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up 
But if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free 
There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace 

I still got to wonder why, 
I never seen a man cry til I seen a man die 

Hope you feel better",I Seen a Man Die [Version]

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future.
But through whatever you see,
Through all the rain and the pain,
You gotta keep your sense of humor.
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit.
Remember that.
Mmm, yeah.
Keep ya head up.Yeah.
Verse One: 2Pac
Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now

[Chorus: Johnny P (2Pac)]
Smile for me , won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smile (smile), smile for me
(What ya looking all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smile
(And the next generation)

[Scarface]
Now as I open up my story
With the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly
Up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Fuck the world as we ? and witness furious speeds
Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' 
Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
 
[Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outer space 
May the angels help to lead the way
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac
Smile

Mad at us cause we on top

Better get it while the getting is good
Get it while you can, man
And stop hating me, fucking with my shit cause I got more hustle than you
Get yours, get yours baby

Stay in the mix like Alezay
V.I.P., my shit parked valet
On the prowl again to get honies familiar with the smile again
Some try to assault Dre, its still cavi
I'm eating steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality
I giving living definition long as my hearts ticking
I fought and made the world listen
Whatever fly Dr. Dre invented
Turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on 60 inches
I push a rover, shit platinum before the sessions over
Rap master with the Houston heat holder
These players best to get they shit in check
Cause when I get my hustle on ain't no playing with a full deck

[Chorus: x2 Ice Cube]
Lord please, murder my enemies (Yeah)
Burn em at a thousand degrees
And lord please let me make mo cheese
Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No)

[Scarface]
Buck the whole world
Meant that, gotta stay strapped
Cause 99.9 a niggas, carry they gats
Super fist fighting shit might come down to dying
When the time comes down for the trying I got nine
Reasons why niggas shouldn't step in my face
With the nonsense, cause I'm always heated and you can taste this
Audi little something out the seams a my trousers
With no hesitation I got a team to come clown ya
I down ya, so let your people know what they face
With the type of individual that'll bomb a sub-station
Kaboom! and everybody dies outside
There ain't no escaping the Reaper so don't try
Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step?
Face down, hit, bleeding on the steps a death
Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers

Smoking weed I never trail, I lead
Spending dough, tripped the cost of a ride like it was pocket money, Gs
But these are the things real players do
Talking shit is real things that the haters do
I'm naming you
Shit's thick, its time to run for shelter
I kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter

Dear diary, I'm running outta pages
Fading, in and out, taking purple hazes
The dazes, Revelations in the last stages
Red sky's institute, the silent horns playing
I'm praying with tears in my eyes
Cause I'm trying to make it into eternal peace without dying
But they eying my bank account with beams on my rover
The killer failed to launch his attack (the game is over)

Deep in the mind that wide opens
Right here we stand alive, we live focused
We open-minded, still we die hopeless
With our pride broken and bullet holes covered where we stay at
And everybody's playing for keeps, most people pray that
We all make it up out this godforsaken place that we've been all faced with
We take our chances but they all wasted
And once again you see me (marching, mobbing)
But how long must I continue to see my homies dodgin these marksmen
The whole nine put on the line but never in mind to become the head sergeant
We all targets, the votes are in, but they ain't ours
We got these politicians running their game to regain power
While our whole black community sours
Crime rate towers, plagued by white powders
And they claim to helping us to clean up our community
But ain't no open opportunities, impunity
Is what these demons use to regulate
We keep in mind we can run but we can't hide cause the streets we walk are never safe
Still all my shattered hopes and dreams remain scattered
Broken into thousands of pieces, smashed and tattered
But it don't matter, hipocrisy in your democracy
Is stopping me, so I'm retaliating properly
Theologically, society has got me pressured by the hate
And Heaven knows I have faith, I have faith

Now I'm that nigga trying to find out where his mind's at

My mind crack, slide back, look at all the time gone
Rewind back, comeback, understand my life gon' make these cuts that won't change
But things look so strange, the plague 
I gots to get myself up out the frame
Try to maintain the same game flipping 10 and flame Jane
A damn shame, people gots to always check your background
To jack now, come jack now and I'ma leave you flat down
Come back now or back down, homie, this is always all day

Cause all they wanna see is all us brothers boxed up in caskets
With plastic bags in every bathroom getting blasted
It's drastic, mama help me calm down cause your son's sick

And adapting to the everyday struggle's got us stressed
Cause the fact we know we here one day and could die the next
You've insisted to take equipment to the solar system
Trying to ensure your sole existence
Now tell me: do you think that when the bang goes boom
You can pack up all your things and aim for the moon?
It's unlikely, but you might be equipped with with proceeds to save lives
But you die when the King say die
You can race it but you can't shake it, stop trying
Try to hide it, cause you can't face it but you're born dying

And the devil try to fronting but it's not working
How can we all sit suspended in space
Just spinning in place and ain't extended in faith

Scarface,"Verse 1:

I got this coffee pot of white soap
Stuck my hanger down the center
When I entered I spent it cause it was like dope
But on the real-a he was jackin' me for scratch
Cause out of 36 ounces this motherfucker brought me 20 back
I'm slanging 20 sacs cause I done lost 16
And these goddamn streets ain't going to bring me back
Now could it be the southside big baller
Bolo rock slanger stones done got slaughtered-damn
I'm going up on my whole thangs
And stepped on don't go runnin my clique cause it's a old game
And all I ever wanted was some hundred stacks
I went from slangin' o-z's to movin' hundred sacks
Gotta make my money back
Cause I done came too far up in these goddamn streets
To get my money snatched
I'm so for real about this motherfuckin skrill
That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin' killed
For real

Chorus:
(scratching and mixing)
All I have is this small skrilla

Verse 2:

I know this nigga run this game of life
So motherfuckin sheist that at night he got to sleep with lights
Cause he done come across with shit so shade
That mutha fuckers comin with clips to locate him
Ain't no waitin and once they spot him they gon' sure face him
And once the got him they gon' sure waste him
This ain't no mutha fuckin joke nigga it ain't worth it
And even if your mother gets in it you can't surface
It was all purpose
Just like that bullshit you was serving it was all purpose
We all chipped in nigga and we all hurting
I gots to grind just like in eighty-nine
When a niggas 25 cent pieces look just like baby dimes
I'm on the corner selling whole eights
I don't remember being this fuckin paranoid since I sold weight
I went from 50 sacs to 50 packs
And all because this motherfucker got jipped he wants to jip me back
But when I find him I'm gon finalize him
Just to let a nigga know I'm for real and down to die for mine
And I'm for real about this mutha fuckin skrill
That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin killed
For real

Chorus

Verse 3:

Game made to be swift since eighty-six when I started
Seems like niggas with hustle got outsmarted
Cause now they wanna analyze they homies for scratch
Catch them when they sleeping come down and up scrap
And even though I plotted hittin' niggas for ends
I never took out straps and shot gats at friends
It was all about being for real where I was from
Where very few niggas came real but I was one
I dedicate this to my homies stuck in battle
Living life being caught up in this mutha fuckin' gamble
The game made to be changed but the niggas still started
Cocaine seems to be blamed for the niggas gettin slaughtered
How many times you had your homie shot
By the same mutha fucker whose game came from your homies block
Niggas get caught up in the paper chase
And lose respect for the game
That was honored before the cake was made

Hang with my homies smoke weed drink brew
Ride down Belford one deep and ? crew

Living in a mansion one day with my wife
Stack me up some papers these days one night
If wind stop blowing these days than my sight
Winds start blowing I'm paid trump tight
Got to have papers these days in my life
I got to have paper these days of my life

Money makes the world go round

Without a doubt
They all want to see about a clout
They don't know
Don't want to know or see what its about
We faced with danger do any thing for the paper
Scarred for life of the street mentality done made us
Watch out for the snakes and fakes
Out to take what's yours so prepare and beware
Money makes the world go round for some niggas
Money makes the world kill all niggas quicker
Its reala, the haps
The cheese, the scraps
The cheddar, whatever you call it its all ?

Money makes the world go round

Some people gots to have it
Some really need it
A lot might even sacrifice their life to retrieve it
I see that money's good for me
Money's good to me
Money can't buy me love
But it can rent me some pussy
You get your hands on a little bit of it and before you know it
You go crazy without, do strange things for it
Although its made of paper, it don't grow on trees
Unless you coming up blowing weed, while you smoke on tweeds
You see money makes the world go round
Makes the price of living go up
Chances of living go down
You see money makes the world go round
If you ain't got it you nothing
But when you come up than they hound you

Money makes the world go round

I take me a shit and try to gather my thoughts
But where the southwest be, that's why I sip on a quart
You see my mind is on a whole lot more than just rap
You see you got to be something, until this rap shit happen
Its been a long time since I got my hand on some cheese
Its been addictive, my daughter can't get what she needs
Shit is fucked up, you wonder why we rob and sell dope
I go days without eating, it ain't because I snort coke
Fool I'm broke, what's a good way to get paid these days
Flip burgers, or lay your ass down and get sprayed
Hey man I got to reason with ya
No, fuck trying to reason
I'm tired of struggling so now its hunting season
I hope you understand by now what I'm thinking
Get a bag of that dank, of the hemp and I'm steady drinking
Contemplating on what should I do
This nigga got G's, I'm talking about a hundred or two

What you thought this was nigga some studio gimmick
A motherfucker talking that shit but couldn't spend it-shit
I come around this motherfucker bending beads
And dare one of you hoes to come and fuck with me
I'm real with it I'll warn you motherfuckers again
That if you step to me with ho shit I'm turning you in
Shocked-and shot with five holes in your memory
And when you headed for hell you gon' remember me
The one MC who told you niggas once 
And after that he gave no warning he straight done him- punk
I got my mind all made up to go off
When bitches start to threaten my life I go off
Take a walk on the wild side 
And all the coloreds go whoop whoop
When I come down in my coupe
And motherfuckers hating me come give it a try 
But 99.9 of the times you gon' die
With no warning
Dealing with the killer with the strap out 
No warning, then
All of a sudden homie blacks out
With no warning
And now your dealing with your outer body energy
All the pain you left in your life you still feeling me

If any nigga at the top of his game then you can't hate him
Just watch for niggas who thinking they game but they can't fade him
I'll cross spray you you making your moves and I'll spray you
I promise the same promise that the game promise
When motherfuckers step on my turf I bring drama
How dare you niggas flip the grip check 
I'll leave you shipwrecked in the valley of death dry wit your shit wet
I'm down to die for my shit I'll put the hood on it 
I got my balls on this shit that puts the wood on it 
I got this strap I call the mind changer
I'm more for realer than the shit that I kick when I feel that I'm danger
I'll leave your family wit a fuck you note
Where the fuck you wrote
You pay wit your life now fuck you broke

[Chorus: x4]",Ya Money or Ya Life
Scarface,"[ verse 1: scarface ]
It's been a long time comin
But now I'm back up in this bitch to hit these niggas with this gangsta shit
I keep the strong rhymes runnin
My shit don't switch, I'm 10 years in, and ain't changed one bit
It's all about the real, nigga
I keeps it real, nigga
And won't sell out for ? ? ? with tommy hilfiger
Fucker, I figure niggas wanna see
The side of society they don't see on tv
So when I bring the shit, I bring the shit like I seen it
And when I scream the shit, I sing the shit like I mean it
No secret, these muthafuckas figure I'm a threat
Cause I ain't fallin short to the traps the demon set
Now sweat, cause now I got my head in your books
And when I think 'cracker', my definition read 'crook'
Now look, we're livin under laws that they set
Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit
And slowly but surely the shit changed
>from they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed
A damn shame, that means this muthafucka's one-sided
And blacks, we get lost in the sauce, because we unguided
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
Get what they can get and rip they assholes apart
They smart

[ chorus: devin / (tony 'scarface' montana) ]
They smart, man
(those guys...)
You niggas better watch yo ass
(..they're the bad guys)
Them bastards they smart, man
(those guys...)
It's up to us for how long we gon' last
(..they're the bad guys) (2x)

[ verse 2: scarface ]
I declare an all-out attack
Let's take our minds behind enemy lines, so we can see how the demon acts
And how he set us up for failure in the first place
And why the fuck did we just settle for a birthday
You see, I'm hip to the games that you run
Like the games you run unfair, we can get no fair one
Cause we was dealt the bad hand from the jump
And we can't deal, so we jack and get drunk
And might end up locked down or six feet
But in these streets a muthafucka gots to eat
You can't sleep, cause if you're caught sleep, you gots to pay
And just like everyone left you got your day
And these days were meant for all to keep tryin
But we can't relate, so we fall and keep dyin
Open your muthafuckin eyes who your enemy
The muthafuckas dyin or the muthafuckas killin you?

[ chorus ]

[ verse 3: scarface ]
You put your crack on my table
I turn my axe on my neighbor
And my back to my savior
You had me thinkin you were almighty
But to the almighty you're just a man that's really all tiny
The maker will open up our minds to see
That heaven ain't a place here on earth, you gots to leave
And once we leave, we stand between eternal peace and eternal pain
And you the beast shall meet eternal flame
So let it rain, wash away up all my bad things
And put some laughter in our hearts again
Now black men, stand up, let's come together as a whole race
And don't be fed up by the old days
They try to do us like the indians, killin us like wild beast
And show more love for the chinese
And kept us trapped up in a small room
And made decisions on our life we accepted that left us all doomed
They sabotaged and they camouflaged
But if these niggas came to crank up some shit, then I be down to ride
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
The only way to beat em is to think, cause they smart

(Bun B) 

I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin 

had to find my place 

But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue 

had to dodge a case 

Had to dodge a bullet 

And the nigga that tried to pull it 

The streets is throwed 

If I don't get lean and blowed everyday 

I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive 

All my life this drive I tried 

I seen a lot of good niggas die 

Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched 

Or somebody's a bitch 

I wish I could change the past 

But I gots to live in the present and pray 

that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast 

Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me 

But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself 

I found out she had to told me 

Just to show me just how good I had it 

I guess I couldn't see it 

Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it 

But that was just the way we used to G it 

One of the wrongest niggas I see 

Or one of the strongest niggas I know 

Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know 

So I put weed in the bong and I blow 

Stay cool calm and collected a neglected 

Child that grew into a man that's widely respected 

Too real 



(Chorus) 

I feel no pain 

I can't complain 

Stuck in the game 

Tryin to maintain 

Cause I'm so real 



(Pimp C) 

We blow big everyday 

But that don't stop our pain 

Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game 

Got niggas doin 40 

When you 25 that's life 

I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price 

These bitch ass niggas shife 

Niggas might snitch out they momma 

That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama 

Cause we ain't promised tomorrow 

But nigga you promised to die 

Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry 

At night I talk to God and try to understand 

How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man 

I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back 

So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks 

I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones 

But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun 

I guess that's true for some 

But them hoes will never win 

Out here just hustlin and grindin 

Tryin to change from niggas to men 



Chorus 



(3-2) 

My nigga you a ho to me 

Boy you done went off on me 

Runnin round with the fakin and hatin 

I'ma blast if you run up on me 

I'ma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch 

This matter coulda been resolved 

if you woulda came clean and paid my shit 

See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last 

Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass 

And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up 

No respect for your family that's dead 

don't write yo peoples locked up 

Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game 

Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name 

You boys is funny 

I'm bout my money 

And oh so true

I'm too real

Scarface,"(Devin) Walk up in da session wit my dick in my hand
Fat sweet in my mouth,a 24 ounce can
Got no time for all that yesterday, he say, she say
Pull out da beat tape
Give it to da DJ
My eyes are tight and shinin'cause I'm smokin' some kill
Don't look at me, go buy some drinks, call up some hoes if you will
I see it nothin' but a party ya'll, I guess I'm the host
Ain't nobody got no mo weed, it time to smoke it
Keep that beat rollin', you see everybodys holdin' their own
You know I gotta bust atleast two or three before I'm gone
But there's always one in da crowd, rappin' loud
I'm in the nigga's mouth after all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow, West coast body language
Don't know nothin' bout da South and tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when ya finish flowin' or whatever da fuck you doin'
Holla at me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n


(music)


(Devin) Had to get away, needed some time to chill
So I bought a 59 and got behind da wheel
Scooped up a fat sack of kill 'cause I'll be drivin' a while
Takin' two or three pulls every five or six miles
I can't wait to see my roaddogg, you how we do it
Just like a case of beer, piece of cock, we run right through it
And all da bitches know me, I hit quite a few
They be glad to see me, niggaz don't give'em dick like I do
I bust bout two, then they tell they friends, and then I'm in
Wit my French tickler, makin' they pussy lips grin
But there's always one in da crowd, talkin' loud
Found out I fucked her cousin, now she runnin' her mouth
Leavin' notes on my windshield, I'm a bitch, I'm a hoe
Early in da mornin' bitches knockin' at my mama doe
Mama please, when you finish whatever that you doin'
Who ever that is, tell'em I'm in da bathroom boo boo'n


(music)


(Devin) I gotta visit from a old friend, fresh outta county
He said came up on a lick and he was glad that he foind me
He had some niggaz wit him, full of drink and lookin' sweaty
Cockin' gats back talkin' bout ""c'mon Dee man you ready?""
Its a house down da street, about two does down
They sell weed and they least got two whole pound
Man all we gots to do is hit this ride, we cool
Lets fuck his wife and take his weed and bust on that fool
We can all come up, whatever we get, we split
Ain't nobody sayin' nothin', ain't nobody seen shit
So lets pile up five deep in ya lac
He'll know that it is you Dee and won't think its da jack
Man you must be smokin' crack, you don't know who dat is
That nigga work for HBD been sellin' weed round here for years
So when you finish plottin and schemin' whatever you doin'
Wait fo' me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n

Till these muthafuckas bury me

Gun slangin, bangin southside
Heat bringer, heat slanger

Head banger, thought re-aranger
The bitch strangler, a total stranger
In your face with this thing aimed at ya
Your facin danger, 16 with one up in the chamber
I'm bout to stain ya, with this muthafuckin handgun

And fuck dem laws, dey got my brother already
Dey can suck my balls, average nigga have no luck at all
But because I be in my 'Lac chillin
They stereotype me, thinkin I'm into crack sellin

Man I'm windy city 2-20, anybody chin checker
3rd floor lake grove, 35th in leather gloves
With the snub nose, complex born and raised
And under siege every day

The definition, of a gaurilla
He is a killa, robbin for scrilla
Not your average every-day nigga
The laws at me, better off dead 'cause I ain't happy
Kill or be killed, Id rather go to war before they catch me

Arrest me, I told you before I wears vest's
A born legend by the way of .357
I'm an automatic with static its tragic Mr A-l-K-a-p-o-n-e
The last man standing

Rollin, ridin, slowly slidin
Creepin up in da corners where you hoes be hidin
Takin you over in ways you never even thought of

Ghetto birds hover over southside Chicago
Ellis park killin fields, gang war rival
Bigger than the sears tower, I was a pain in the smoke
They found his body floatin the lake shore

8 holes filled up his body full of hot ones
Shot one, two, three, four, down like dominoes
Cop killin columbian 'nect ?
Split, grown snitch, its over with

I said a hip-hop, pour a cup of coffee
And then I sip and stop
Because we gettin watched by some new group
New brood mc's walkin round like you and me
But all they do is listen shit only a fool'd believe

275, big fat and nasty, fuck bein classy
I'm straight ghetto, chuckin beer bottles out da window

I'm drinkin MD 20-20

Trying to make money so I can make honeys blow on mah dick
I go on a quick mission to find some kil'
Ain't no big deal, just hop in the Seville
Mah homey put me down quarter pound for a bill
Wake up in the morning and I have weed still and I chill

Scarface,"Man I met this chick so fine
So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

[Chorus]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

[Too $hort]
I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch

Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my

I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces

I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through

As twice as ship advice to my homies who write me in te pine
Now the sale is hell but kids keep sending me mail
With their liberty bell, so I can tell you about the half
And who got cow for riches, and sending bithces, 
I'm making bitches
I remember when I just to get beat with extension cars
And we slanged by to see were my house was
Started stealing out of my mama's perce
Now that she's gone
She lives thrue my songs
And it sure hurts
I couldn't have treated her worse then in the ghetto
And turn our women's into widows
Sick to see my homie that I ain't with, trade with, payed with, laughed with
Dead in a casket.
To my pumps we can reach the top
But you got a chance to get of the pop
If you see your chance baby take it
I was the last mothafucka in the world who thought I would make it
But look at me now, a six on the beach in greeze
Check from the motherfucker streets of the ghetto

Them niggas don't wanna see me when I got weed in my system
Catch another victim, capture bodies
Bring a shottie to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit cause it's wrong but we were born right
And to the niggas in my zone we do it long ways
Till these bitches understand nigga my song pay; cause I'm the man
Now these are my homeboys, we outlaws till the day we die
Keep this shit rough and raw my 45
Make sure that I survive to another day
To bust rhymes which from I get paid

Hit your block, increase props as we dismantle

With elegant bitches, plottin' riches
On quick-to-get-rich niggas full of liquor

We gon' have to take the heat to the streets

It seems like what? They hate to see us havin' lavish things
Pictures in magazines, nice cars and diamond rings

I hang with these thugs.
Whut?

I gives a fuck. (I gives a fuck.)

Since I was little I been hangin' with these niggas.
And till I die I gon' remain with these niggas.
St. Paul in
The M-P-L-S, I hear you callin'.
I put it down, yes.
Now, Chris Rock, where you at?
I heard you say some shit about some blacks,
Nigga, this been your ass back.
Come see the real deal.
Stay in the fields, nigga.
These niggas will kill.
This ain't no cap-gun shots, nigga.
This a glock, pah, pah.
It's death on your block,
Knock, knock.
Whut's up nigga?
These sirens start singing.
It's me and Yuk with the L-G in the makin'.
It's stinkin', freakin',
Bowlin' on the weekend.
Creepin, seekin'
Me, till the currency
Gimme stacks up on mo' stacks.
I'm double parked for the train.
Even your moms know my name.
I be the D into the M, and the M into the G.
And I bring the B-O-M-B,

And fuckin' wit' these thugs, nigga.

You wonder why us niggas be hustlers,
And out there slingin' drugs, nigga?
That's in my blood.
That drug money, stuff that shit up under the rug,
And make that nigga bug, nigga.
It's in my blood.
Niggas like me, turn niggas like you into hustlers.
Fucking with us, fucking wit us!

It's in my veins,
Like a chain-reaction.
How it all happened.
Paps is slangin' crack in the mid eighties,
Back in the day, when shit was crackin'.
Niggas pay thirty-eight for a package.
Tightly rappin',
For shippin' and handelin', taxes was added.
That's where the A-rap's headin'.
Even when I sleep, they in cavage,
Lavage shit.
Do automatics, with scopes, under my mattress,
With the dope and the drugmoney.
Stuffin' that shit up under the rug money.
Thug hungry.
Takin' drugs only 'cause we love money.
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga.
Would you like to be a nigga too?
Makin' big scrilla, like these niggas do.
You probably be a drugdealer too.
Scan and tuned, into the boys in blue.
Listen for clues.
In the kitchen, bakin' up Peruvian flake.
It takes twenty-eight grams,
Multiplied by thirty-six zips to make
A triple beam brake, a triple beam shake.
A hundred grams on the triple beam flake.
Two point two pounds, to be straight.
My niggas just flew in from G-A,
Ready to buy 4 kilos,
Then drive slow back to Youngstown, Ohio.
So fuck these rhymes.
Let me stick my dick in your ear,
And fuck with your mind,
Nigga.

[Chorus]

Niggas portray themselves as low key.
Broken down and fabricated,
Easily ejaculated, table with, and halfway faded.
Ain't no wars, 'cause they made it.
That type of bullshit is outdated.
But I played it like I laid it.
My partners have always said that.
It was set me up 
For life.
Money, clothes and hos, but road I chose was
Nothin' nice.
Niggas know just what it's like to be hustlers.
Governors from strugglers.
Bitches lovin' us.
Blindly chasin' that life we lust.
I blush.
Bottles, havin' thoughts and iring dreams.
Goin' down and roll fast.
Tryin' to get what my eyes have seen.
Fried of me, huh.
Nigga for a hand that got me through these eyes right to see.
But part not I was blind to the point,
Not even I could see, or that I could be,
Obviously.
I wasn't meant for me this type of trickery.
Hit me with the type of mystery.
Lay it down like history.
With the intent of me, myself, and I.
Street desire, easily.
Piece of mind, I was least to find.
Some sassiness.
Hossisiless, it gets to shit and praise to the farmer innercist.
Nobody was meant for it, it was deadly,
And I was discontent
With the shit that life once sent.
Government depend, now most of my time is spent
Escapin' what I love.
It's in my blood.

Got a whole army, so bring it on muthafuckas
You gets no ends, fuckin with interface, nigga
Your facin death, cause it's a whole clique of killas
And cap peelas, niggas that don't give a fuck about they damn self
You'll get your ass heated up, beat a nigga blue
And now we wanna get his crew, I take his whole crew
And I go through em like the flu
I finish niggas
Got more clan than menace niggas
I pull triggas, bring the pain to bitch niggas
And terrorize, and I could see it in they eyes
I capitalize, when it's down to krunch time, it's krunch time

Got a gang of dope, except I sell it from the shelf

Schemein and plottin, and then they asses smell rotten
Lost and forgotten, they shoulda known there ain't no stoppin
Niggas be floppin, releasin shit when I be droppin
Some try to copy, bullshit be sounding sloppy
But they can't get me, them niggas suck like a hickey
The rhyme sender, drop your shit and surrender
You're no contender, make niggas fall like November
In the fuckin rumble, you'll see the biggest nigga crumble
Tryin to tumble, I make the widest nigga humble
Big as mutumbo, stepped away for 44

Your ass die quick

I'm so drastic, pullin the trigger back like elastic
And blasted your whole area, hoe I bury ya
For layin your mouth ahead of ya

So muthafucka make my day
There's no escapin from this full blooded ape and

For the rooftop snipers snap a lot
Putting down with rap-a-lot

Had to control the fight
Had to make sure my dough was right
Had to make sure my boys was tight
Noise and lights, stalking from the end of my ? gonna spook ya
Horror type of tactics, you bet the snipers ? knew ya
Stressed out, had me feeling left out
Stuck and I gotta get my self out
But when I was kid then crept out
Fuck all the ones who never helped out
Stepped out with grams and plans to be an overnight achiever

But do or die and snipers , represent chi-town
Took a life and get lit up quick

Used to be on some sell ass shit
Or mail that bitch back home in a box
And leave no trail of this
Now won't witness this and this is
How's it's gonna fall
All of y'all gonna battle
Leave this life, all shells goin' drop tonight
You say that you want a spot
Better they hit like the shit from rap-a-lot
So pack that glock or AK stops your clock, my straps get hot
Even though it's hot it ain't hot enough to stop this entourage
Rain, do or die, pick a piece snypaz, one big mob
Better stop that heart

So flex that shit cause down in Texas, everybody talks

I swear I feel so all alone, back down on my knees again
Hopin you can keep me strong, 'cause I can't hardly sleep tonight
I took too many sleepin pills, I drunk too many Miller Lites
And I can feel the Reaper near, so please forgive me for my sins
I am just another man, sorry for the pain that I've caused
I know that you'll understand, these demons'll drive me - insane
I've been goin mad, rightly oughta blow out my brains
'Cause I'm hurtin bad but I'm fightin... blast, on the other day
These problems got me usin more drugs, along with the other things
I'm slowly fading into my thoughts, (come against me, bring it on!)
And I'm driftin in and outta space, and I don't believe I'm wakin up
With the alcohol, them drinks, drift me to another world
Where the sunshine stay shinin, I think I was finna url
Mom, can ya look at me? This ain't what I used to be
Tomorrow, I'll be somebody else, 'cause I ain't been me
I can't seem to shake these, I'll put that there on every day
Boy tryna figure me out, is like Lamar changing
But my childhood was fucked up - raised rowdy by a single moms
She told me my daddy didn't give a fuck, she ain't let him do his job
Seventh grade; failing, and I don't know my next of kin
These days in these fucked up ways, who the fuck are them?
My daddy had three other kids, but I ain't never seen 'em
So, ain't no sense in coming around now, you ain't been here befo'
It's sad but I ain't feelin nuttin, my whole life's been a fuckin maze
And when I tried to locate my siblings, they were gone away
Lost inside they other things, fucked me then, fucked me now
Quick to tell me ""Show you some love"" nigga show you Hell
Ain't no love I'm feelin here, I ain't never felt this vile
Momma - did you really love me, or was I just a child?
Said it, outside, I knew you seen it in my face
I wasn't really happy here, but I was forced to lead the way
Copped me a Cheverolet, drift away to the other side just to think
If I get to see Heaven, I can thank you for the ride
And thank you for my other kids and even though
They mommas won't admit that they can't make it but bad,
Low on the child support - always been bad boo, tryna make me out to be
The bad guy that I really ain't, bitch so quick to hassle me
'Cause I don't see my kids enough, but I make the time to pick 'em up
But you find somethin to stick in my face - it ain't me fuckin up
It's bad enough, face to face, always wanna catch a case
So bad, they'll try an get me they make me - and what takes the cake
Is the whole world is fuckin up, daddy know where the weankess at
And you spoke lies to ya old mans eyes, how could you sleep wit that?
Jepordize everything, just for searchin for larger life
Sacrificin the whole family, with no regards to Christ
Funny how people can take this shit for granted, right?
But then reality strikes, and changes things overnight
I thank the Lord for watchin over me, though I'm prone to doin wrong
I repent religiously, hopin that the weak get strong

How the fuck is you gon' live on these streets?

From a state where we stole weight, and dough mind dine
And we don't tote six-shooters, we tote glock nines
And we don't smoke a peace pipe, we smoke fat dimes
It's a place where it's a common site to see the 5-0
Hit the other side of sixteen and get ya mind blown
Fo sho', it's a different vibe from being downtown
then when ya come into the ghetto and ya can't come back out
I seen the ghetto shut down, seen niggas shot up
Seen niggas get knocked the fuck out and never got up
The neighborhood paralyzed, crack drive-bys
It's evident we hurt, you ignored our cry
On the outside the ghetto just another mind state
And import more minorities to help the crime rate
I ain't looking for a job, fuck working the part-time
when we could come up on some dough, with good combs and slang dimes
I see this all the Goddamn time, it's fucked up and it's the truth
Never mind the shooter on the roof
It's a war going on right here, where we at
I can't complain about what I can't change, so why dap?
Dropped outta high school in tenth grade so I rapped
But still, can't seem to get this monkey off my back
Fuck it, I pulled a few moves and ride for the streets
And when I start to feel like this, don't fuck with me!

Scarface,"The conspiracy theory...

[Scarface]
I knew this nigga who sittin, on the dock on the bay
Had plans of gettin rich so he was plottin with Jay
This motherfucker had the street game locked
Had the blocks all sold up,
And always saw the cops when they showed up
He had the rep of being murderous too
The type of nigga, with the mind of a God-damn fool
But he knew, to get off in this crew, he had to change
So when James went to church this nigga did the same
So he's steppin back away from the cut
But his vengeance of livin, had his braincells start to fuck up
Steady callin his shots, but steady leavin a trail
So sit back peep my game, I got a story to tell

I came from a gang with niggaz who do crime
They didn't rat they niggaz out when they came to do time
No snitchin nobody out when ya facin a life sentence
For death, you do it by yo God-damn self

[Scarface]
He gettin clean, so we gave him a job
Had the whole entire city on they knees, recognizin the mob
Took the cash that he was makin, in this seat
And compared it, to the cash off in these God-damn streets
As luck gon' be, the scales didn't break even
So now he's out to go an get the cash that he needin
Some wise man once told me
(?) but I didn't believe him, so he showed me
Gave an example; the piece of a pie
Said if you eat to much it's gone at the blink of an eye
This for these niggaz out here hearin me
Hypothetical conversation, the rest of that shit, is a conspiracy
I got the word and heard he back on the grind
Ran across and met a nice spot, runnin his mob
I love the nigga, so I gave him some dap
He said he loved my work efforts,
And he said he liked the way that I rapped
Wanted to show me what he was rollin outside, but
Little did I know, he was the FBI
I heard a rumor that this nigga got knocked...
A few months past and he was back on the lot
And shift the plot, I'll teach you niggaz conspiracy theories
I spit this shit in code, but I pray that you hear me
'cause see he know him and, he meets you
They get popped and, you do to
Illegal taps and undercover surveillance
Tapin conversations, tryna duck the years that he facin

[short phone conversation]

Better yet gonna get me facin, 'cause we know he's the back-
Bone - if ya crush the bone, ya alter the mind
And thought process is vital at this time
And I heard, you was out to get the niggaz that's rich
But I'ma tell you motherfuckers like this

I came from a gang with niggaz who do crime
They didn't rat they niggaz out when they came to do time
No snitchin nobody out when ya facin a life sentence
For death, you do it by yo God-damn self

How the fuck is you gon' stop a train
You set your fires on your forest to burn it but then it rains
It's like Babyface and them Jay
We all got lies and RAM, you motherfuckers own they grave
We need current situations, in due time
Train 'em to do the business in 20 years down the line
So I stand firm on ""We can't be stopped""
Reconcile our disagreements, and I'm still down with Rap-A-Lot
Murder ya boxers tryna break apart what God made
And regardless to what you boys say
Seek and destroy, fuck the opposition
When you for real it's in yo bloodline, not in yo motherfuckin mind
So feel it like the holy spirit, and remember
When ya face to face with the demons, you can't fear it
You fight until the battle finished
No matter what the end is, when you attack you strike with vengeance
And always judge a man by his deeds
And never buy jealousy 'cause it breathes...

Grab the Swisher, kiss her, get my lighter and spark it

Average niggas get nervous around the bitch
Lick between her legs and run circles 'round her clit
Fall in love, she'll make your mind a wreck
When she lay on her back, and put her legs behind her neck
Sperm drinker, come in her mouth, she keeps suckin it
It's too sensitive, have a nigga sayin 
'fuck this shit, bitch, can I have my dick back'
You don't wanna hit that, you don't wanna be inside that kit-cat
She's too nasty, but I like that

Predictions of the end of world, and after
Life, wit no beginning, as the world stops spinning
? a journey that's never ending
I glance at my baby boy, I can see this in his eyes
The little nigga glad to be alive
And as the days go by, I thank god for watching mines
Praying that I remained in fire
The same man that I was, which starts from the other mind phrase
Was it the cash I think my time came
For me to venture off into different dimensions

Will I ever be born again

In my time, I try to stay true steps on the game
And if you niggas thinking like me, do the same
Which is one minute ya smiling, the next ya start crying
Cause we can't accept we born to die
And I, ease my edge, and be a nigga to the end
But it's more to life then me and my Benz
When my mama told to speak to my friends
I kinda took that shit to heart
So don't fuck up your life, 'fore it starts
Some niggas want to be like Mike
I'd rather be like Christ (like Christ)
So at the end, I'll see bright lights(bright lights)
I save a prayer for the fallen soldier's
Too many niggas died young, for trying to to hang
On the slaim's of our slums
And outcome, as mommy neals, sitting on the front row
Hoping god will accept your soul
The new millennium, and as I sit watch the distance
Ships walk the horizon, I'll stare into space while I'm driving
And pray for me, all the ends of my sins
The beginning, the end, of my time, till I'm born again

[Chorus]

In my time, I've seen life born, and I been blessed
Enough to see life lost, it's just the price life cost
And shortly, explain my born, I know I'm born to do it wrong
So when I'm gone, life goes on
Tell my mother, when she on the front row, hold her head up
Shed no tears, and dred those years
Smile, and even though my whole life's been a po'ball
You did yours, and it's not your fault
Tell my grandmother those words too
She knows I'm headed to a better place
That'll put a smile on my wife's face
God's graced the evil spirit that surrounded me
And pass me, and anytime it could of had me
But when it all went wrong, sung the same ol' song
Now it's peace after the storm blew on
And ? it's the better life, security for yours and mines
What the evil lies, and not so guide
In my time, it's been times, I would've stopped and called the quits
But I might as well sit until it's over wit
Earth to earth, and ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's the lord I trust
The territory where I come from, so I guess it'll be when I return
No sorrow, it was just my turn
And in those, last trumpet sounds, put me down in the ground
But I'll probably be at home by now
And it's help will change(these helps will be changed)
Blinking of a eye, but I don't think I'll get to see that
In my time, till I'm born again

It's changed, when we born
And how we born from woman
We born, from the spirit, of life
And all our flesh remains
And not, by the flesh of man
And not by the flesh of man
Do not believe that

[Chorus]",In My Time
Scarface,"[Scarface] 
Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see 
Do you think I'm cra-zy??? (AAAAAGHHH!! Just bein me) 
Sometimes I wanna die, maybe I'll be free 
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin me 
(I can feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep 
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed 
Look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes) 
And tell me what you see (and tell me what you see)
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line? 
Is it just my test, or is it just my time? 
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did 
I forgot to be picked off, when I was just a kid 
A poison in my mind, tryin to find relief 
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin me 
Tryin' to set me up, bustin down my streets 
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me 
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what niggas say 
Fuck Ronnie Carbone(?), and fuck the D.E.A. 
And fuck these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese 
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang 
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane 
I know you crackrs pissed off, I can see it in your eyes 
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die
(Until the day that I die) 
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie 
You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my guy 
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth 
Listen up my niggaz: ""The F.B.I. been watchin' you"" 
Especially if you black, and tryin to leave the streets 
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib, makin niggaz lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule 
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school 
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
But not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me? 

[Chorus] 
Look me in my eyes! 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!) 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee? 

[Scarface] 
Look me in my eyes, I've told all I could tell you 
And now you know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill you 
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged? 
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain 
What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
That leads me to the same place I started from;
Right before I left home
(Look me in my eyes!) I thought you was a shrink 
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think 
OK your time is up, now analyze my life 
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes) 
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa 
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over 
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks 
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back 
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked 
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find 
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes 
Looked me in my eyes 

[Chorus](2x)
",Look Me in My Eyes

Boppin' to fame, a crooked nigga droppin' in pain

Rockin' a cain, back up bitch, you blockin' my lane
Tryna foul on a nigga 'cause you hot in the flame
Fuck you, and them ho ass nigga's you run wit'
Fuck your whole street, you ain't no motherfuckin' O.G.
'Cause O.G. means, means you a original gangsta

Don't smile in my face, when you see me get the fuck on
Dope fiend ass nigga, tryna to get a free check
Talkin' that shit, but you's a motherfuckin' bitch

Finish fuckin' face and leave ya clean cut shirt wet, and jet
'cause I'll smack the shit outta ya bitch ass you wanna run to the one's
Tell 'em about the cash and the stash, and were I got my guns

And you know I'm the bird man 'cause I sold so much coco
Beware of the crack pipe, that's by far in ya life
I got heroin by the balloons, kabooms and mushrooms
And my 38. specialist puttin' banker's in they tomb's
I'm one, shot, killed, and these bullets all go
And you takin' finger print's, and mugshots photo's
I use to beat bitch nigga's till they face turned blue
But they get weak in dice water, and pedal you in the sue

Smokin water by the pearl, runnin' the street wit' double earl's
I did it all 'fore I can see, walk, and crawl
Made it out the ghetto, bustin' a male, so I can wet y'all
Took a while 'fore I ball
Wanted for eight or nine murder's and spoke came
For cocaine, raw game, another die for what he claim
And where I'm from they know my name, I 'cause lot's of static
Automatic's and canic's, and nigga's start to panic

Ain't no ruler's or leader's runnin' the set

Fifteen, sixteen in a chevy we roll
Get you full of hole's, god dog, you scream echo's in fo-fo's
Who dare to mack wit' the tarantula and scorpion
Brought you in the depth's of danger when I tortured it
I love it when the bustaz squealin'

Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... you better watch ya step...

[Verse 1]
And ya don't stop, so I guess it's on once again
The Natural Born Killaz in a zone again
I'm different type of special men not known to man
I refuse to loose, I was born to win
A street nigga, the stand up type, never to fall
I've been programmed to run in and get it, take it all
Sit back and capitalize off mistakes you made
Beat yo ass into submission, and make you pay
I got battlescars from fuckin with this, I gotta have it
What's my reason for quotin this shit? I gotta have it
Like the Roy Jones - you see this money get me hungry like a wolf
And when a nigga hungry I'm a wolf
That's when I start my rage, and attack from the neck up
Catch you being careless, make these hoes respect us
Survival here, that's the name of the game
It's the jungle in this bitch and ain't a damn thing changed
Watch ya step

[Hook]
Let's get it on y'all, to the beat y'all
Fuck a bitch y'all, I'm from the streets dawg
So what it is huh? What it look like?
I'm a G fool, you the bitch type
You got yo strap dawg, I got a strap too
I'm from the Southside, we act a damn fool
You ain't the real hoe, youse a real hoe
I keeps it real hoe, for real though

[Verse 2]
Listen close to the story I'm about to tell
Niggaz is sellin they soul for an ounce of yell'
And a few leave, but this is a house of jail
Twenty-five year bids, without the bail
I know some niggaz in the tank, stuck, lost and thowed
Still boss turnin ya status from false to hope
Only a few niggaz stand up strong and don't whine
When the time get passed around huh?
I'm tellin you dawg, that even if you gettin released
How the fuck is you gon' live on these streets?
You got that jacket on ya back
You a rat and you done spilled ya guts
You a bitch and now you live to fuck
And you a nigga I ain't even gotsta feel to touch
I got some niggaz on the inside to stick and seal you up
It's all good for you out here, gettin yo mail
But the minute you get popped you gonna snitch in jail
Watch ya step

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They say that music is a therapy to ease the mind
But see therapy to me, is to squeeze a nine
Right between ya eyes, while I squeeze ya throat
Chuck you off the side of my boat and watch you float
The animal they sent here to seal ya fate
Tie ya hands behind ya back and feel ya face
Ain't no hope for ya partner Joe, he broke the rules
In the jungle if ya weak, we gotta smoke ya fool
Ain't no love for motherfuckers who done crossed the line
Cocked dice don't pay nigga, now roll ya five
You wanna play the gun game with me, then pull ya shit
I know you'd love to try to punk me if you could ya bitch
But I'm a diehard nigga, I was sworn to silence
And if I got to go, then I (?)
So fuck you, and them niggaz that you run with fool
I'll do the same shit to them, that I did to you
Watch ya step

Now what you niggas know about the dirty South
Nigga you spit the wrong shit you gettin' spurred in the mouth
Southside, let the spotlight shine, heat 'em up
Introduce 'em to the glock 1-9, beat 'em up
Who in the muthafuckin' house y'all, the Gulf Coast
Sippin' blurbs, we perb on, serve and get a smoke
Eyes bleedin' from the brown shit
The porch thick as you could ever fuck around wit
And shut you down, bitch
I represent from all angles of the south
From S.A. to M-I-A, we in the house
Knockin' busta muthafuckas out
So what you sayin'
If you for real about this Goddamn game
You'd say you playin'
So what you claimin'
Peep the game that's bein' spit
Tell dem niggas who ain't listenin'
That Southside's the shit

While I'm chuckin' up my deuce
Dedicated to my down ass niggas

Bitches come a dime from outta town
With they mouth wide open
Scopin' out the popped trunks, trippin'
Off the candy paint, drippin'

Lookin' for sumtin' to happen
And thinkin' that these streets are cool
And I'm the fool to show 'em 'round
'cause I be rappin'
That's when I let 'em know
Hoe, there's no southern hospitality
'cause when dey get here
Then the southern fatality
I ball
Wit a group of niggas when it's time to do a job
Fuck these groupie bitches smokin' drankin' with the squad
Because it gets crazy after dark
They keep they hands on they gun
From 5th ward to South Park

Bitches and hoes, jewelry and clothes
Money to fold, afterparties and shows
That's how it goes in this dirty hole

Even our bitches be bouncin' in bubble Lexus
In the 'llac, in the back, wit yack

Love my Southside niggas

Straight from the oven with it, came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth, for the shit she instilled in me

Shit she made me milk this game for all it's worth

Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake dawg
Give niggas a break, nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang fo', to go against the grain (no)
I'm out here to grind mo', rapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine hoe and candy paint the 88
Don't got no wholesale, cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta see my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fa' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, then I come by with the fizzle
And make fa' sho' I get to work mines, for part of the time
We go to war and you ain't making a dime (ha ha!)
Cause I got, shit to lose, a nigga out here payin his dues

Get outta line and I'ma give ya the blues, whoa!

A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gasket clicked
You can make ya chips swell up, ya don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like on box-spring
Pissy Mack and shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like a quart of water
Shit I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Till like deuce in the morning, with the old heads
Slanging loose quarters, this Philly cat back gatted (had it)
Still fucking with them crack addicts
Still busting with that black-matic

That's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there be no crime
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punchin' the clock
No need for screamin' at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My own homeboy was robbin' me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is schemin?
And every other corner, you're passin' a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm rememberin' this
Your families your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was sayin ""Back in the days""
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's sayin'

My angel
My sunshine
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend
My good time
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl

Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, just ain't no song
I'm hearin' niggas makin' up scriptions, and playin' along
Probably sayin' I'm the hypocrit, for judgin' these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everbody, hopin' that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shootin' outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Who changed your life, when you hear it?
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feelin' first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life
And it was like (heaven, heaven)
But I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't workin'
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And tryin' and get to heaven
America the Beautiful, don't be so cold
How do you expectin' our seeds gonna grow?
When you trap us in the ghetto
And show love, to the other muthafuckers
While we right here starvin' at home
I'd cry, if I thought, that me sheddin' a tear might help
Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself, we all sinners
Facin' the winter, with no socks, and no shoes
In a position, where we all gon' loose
Tell the penitentiaries, we gonna need more schools
Or what the fuck is we gonna do?
Sit around and let the world pass us by?

It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid, be one a' your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us

I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well ya'll see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But I'mma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, well I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggas know I
Don't believe in letting shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
Where the homeboys are meaner, but let the bullshit come between us

But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change
Motherfuck bein a lame, I'm ten toes in the game - deep
I can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps, cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his, and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin in the way of that is dyin

So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me

You can cheat the rules of the streets, and not leave stinkin?

I can squeeze without blinkin, I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta

I got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
But the whole while I'm cookin I'm like, ""Fuck this dude""
It's on, thirty-six zones of my own
Keep the money fo' myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone (ay) I just got knocked
And the cops was askin bout you, come get me hot
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin on the dope
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block

But I'mma die standin up cause I'm a stand up nigga
Fuck dyin like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry cause I was destined to get it
Just remember, I'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
And pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day
A trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality, with a fuck you mentality
Silencin all these niggas in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin from they loved one's mortality
He ain't got a reason to die then kill him, it's a tragedy

Got the neighborhood about to blow up, but hold up
I see this van sittin', this old cat in a fitted
Trying to get your little homey tore up
Yo bruh, we ain't working on this corner take your ass on, dog
Before you make me feed your ass to my hogs you fucking faggot
I know you want to catch me with this bag so you can hide me
Or with my .44 so you can 45 me
You put this shit off in our neighborhoods and sweat us
And when you finally catch us up you give us letters

Than a person that do work with his hands
It's bad enough I gots to deal with all these pressures that stand
You tryin' to make me stray away from my plan
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm from the gutter, where all we had was one another
No wheat bread to butter, from one bed to the other
All uncles and no brother
My mother's at work
My grandfather was my dad
And when he died it hurt
And as I hold back the tears my eye-wells swell
I been praying for heaven, I been living in hell
And these niggas in my age group is dead or either locked up
The bitches no better, they smoked out or knocked up
But I still love my hood, that's where it started
Ain't no hard feelings, we partners nigga, regardless
That's why you always see me coming around

Now get out on your own, stop depending on your homes
To chuck you a bone, and stop throwing stones

And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On yo' block you prolly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B.I., ya homeboys from knee, high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dogg, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was Creepy, if Black June could see me
He'd be tripping, and I'd bet he still try to tease me

My block, we probably done it all homey believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

On my block, we duck the nigga, haters and the cops
Fuck a hotrod, we race Impalas, chromed, out

And when you wake up on the couch you going right back at it
On my block when ya that fucked up they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes

On my block, ya had to have that understanding
Cause if ya told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once ya mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set yo' ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets shell, shocked
Who never quite got right, now they inhale rocks
On my block, , it's like the world don't exist

Somebody shoulda told him ain't no life in these streets
You only out here 'til you touch it, when you touch it you eat
Niggas done took too many chances shovelin snow
And ended up facin a lifetime for tryin to sco'
I'm givin livin definitions on the subject of dope
One week he back on his feet, the next he's WHOA
I was a 70's baby, raised in the 80's
I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember in the 80's, me and pop would ride
Now we conversate on acres we's about to buy
He had already been what I'm about to go through
Told me ain't no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
If you made twelve dollars, you put seven away
And lived off the five, and never ever fuck with ya safe
But when

When he hustle and he robbin
That's when niggas start plottin
And when you niggas start plottin
Us country niggas start mobbin - mobbin

I'm bout my paper, these other niggas slang for the sport
Like unaware tommorrow ain't promised, the game is too short
I've witnessed niggas get it all and give it away
Gettin back was out of the question, they lived for today
Then the hunger pains start up, then the murderous plots
To set up, they fuckin homeboy to get what he got
I mean the ones he broke the bread with, the ones you don't want
To be the ones fuckin your girlfriend the moment you out
I know the street game backwards, forwards, sideways
It used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
It's cutthroat, that's fucked up, niggas want they come up
So bad they'll take the .357 and smoke they brother
A damn shame; but, that's the way the game go
A chance niggas is takin especially if they slang dope
I've been in that position, back in the day
And feel my homey, hittin my head to crack in my safe

So listen up my niggas, and I ain't tryin to preach
I'm just tellin it from my side cause I'm in the streets
I done been there, done that, seen a whole neighborhood
Destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
He caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
He get his own fuckin people jammed and he take the five
That's the shit there; they ain't even catch him with dope
But they gave him thirty-five years cause the nigga done spoke
Snitchin, that's a motherfucker, watch what you say
You don't know no-motherfuckin-body, nigga you lame
Watch your so-called homeboys, keep to yourself
Stay away from niggas gettin caught that get out of jail
Don't talk about your business, keep yo' thoughts in yo' head
And this game it got a paper trail, watch where ya spend
Don't write down names and numbers, it's a memory thang
Never shit where ya sleep, keep the crib out of range
And plus you never let these niggas know where you stay

And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

I wanna walk with you, follow in your footsteps
Talk with you to find out where my good's kept
I been gone away from home for so long
Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong
I'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my fate
So I'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
See I'm a sinner in the 3rd degree
Ain't afraid to admit it, cause I seen niggas worse than me
Who am I to judge a man when I'm a man myself
In the dark, trying to get me some help
I went from pawn to king, king back to pawn
Doing my best to try to ease out the storm
I know that every tunnel's got an end and a light
And I prepared a new beginning in Christ
My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
And as I'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine

I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday

It seems like every other Wednesday I'm attending a wake
But I don't question you, I know that's your way, ok
I know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
We've got to leave here, cause that's your design
And nothing lasts forever, not even spirit, only your word
That's what I live by, cause that's what I heard
I wasn't there when you rose from the dead or parted the sea
I never seen you, but still I believe
How you explain the moon, the sky, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea, the earth without form facing the deep
In darkness challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seas, to make up the trees
So why we turn our backs on the truth?
It's heaven or hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth
And I was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit
So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it

I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday

Lord I know that I've been wrong
They say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song
So I'm singing on my knees cause I believe you'll keep me strong
Until it's time for me to bring it home
But until it's time for me to bring it home
I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray, cause when I pray it's understood
That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself
I need the heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to god cause god towers
Over all, and in that I save this prayer
For all my homies that's been trapped out there
That's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days
So fuck what they say, cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about

I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

I just want to be your solider
I just want to be your best soul, woo lord",Someday
Scarface,"What can I do?
What can I do, to make it better?
Yeah, yeah

I thank the Lord, for every morning, he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining, there's a cloud in the sky
Lettin' me know, that at any moment, there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is, there still can be pain
Down the park, I hear the sirens, just screamin' away
And then the unevitable happens, the end of them days
As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away)
I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash, it remindes me of the now and the past
I say a little prayer, cause eventually I'll stand in the path
Of the souls and dark rows that lead to rest

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone like you and me)
Take away their fears

And then a child is born
Bloody naked, clingin' to life
Unaware of his surroundin's or breathin' is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time, another mother, murders her kids
And the unbarable thought of this here just brings me to tears
It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls
And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself
But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I can't help
All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds ‘cause dealin’ with that
Would be the hardest thing, I’d ever have to do in my time
I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't climb
The stairway that you hear me singin' bout it in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time
I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die
But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky
Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did, before you had to go

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(Someone to dry their tears) Take away their fears
Can I make it, better? (I want to make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through? (they're through)
What can I do?
What can I do?

I say goodbye to you cruel world, I see peace in the red sky
I see the beast when the dead die, relief when my head’s high
Hear the streets up ahead cry, when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye, before the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table, the tale of this tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John doe’s that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb, but I’m cool, I’m cool

Do you hear me?
I'm cryin'

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(Someone to dry their tears)
Take away their fears (take away their fears)
Can I make it, better? (gonna make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through?
(Everything they're goin' through) What can I do?
What can I do?",What Can I Do?

It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day.
It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day.

What it is?, nigga!
You don't wanna get involved with this here, nigga!
Is you a bitch nigga?, you a bitch nigga!
Look at yourself and then analyze me!
This motherfucking G
I can see the flaws in you, you got girl drawers in you
Girl flaws in you, a broad nigga!
I peeped your whole hand when you came in
I'm a man and I hang men
Play the game to win
All men should play on ten
Scarface 'finna do it again
Mash you nigga, smash through niggas
Don't make me upstrap and blast you niggas
Once again, it's only, its a must that I do it
Lock you in my scope and blast your ass through it
I'ma ruin
The image and the style that you used to
'cause you don't keep it real like you used to
A O.G., esa, fool to the hole fa'sho
So niggas slow your motherfucking roll
'Fore I come through with the same M-11
The Feds took from me, and shoot you in yo motherfucking stomach

[Chorus: Scarface]
You a Snitch Nigga, when you rat on yo friends
Bitch Nigga, when you steal cash from your kin
You'z a Snitch Nigga, running when the drama go down
You was bumpin at first what happened to the manly sound
You a Snitch Nigga, specializin' at bumpin' ya gums
Bitch Nigga, countin' all your bricks but all I see is crumbs
Snitch Nigga, ain't you tired of running your mouth
Can't even go home, cause a jacker might run in your house

[Verse: Z-Ro]
Now snitch fellas get up under my skin
That's why I don't mess with friends
Unless it's my Mac-10
I'm the king of the ghetto, Z-Ro the crooked in the flesh
Looking for head shots, 'cause snitch fellas get the bullet-proof vests
What you scared for?
What happened to all the tough ass talk
The way you was bumpin', I thought you had a taste for asphalt
Look at momma's baby out here starvin' for an ass-
Whippin', beefin', with a magician then drippin' now his ass missin
I'll be damned if I pull a rabbit out a hat
Well pull my 40 out of holster, and put a snitch fella on his back
WHOA!, look how I handled this .44
My conscience be screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these snitch fellas on ""How I'm Living"" try snitchin' on ""BET""
But got a restraining order against ""Murder I-N-see""
This how we ride, and ain't never gon' make a switch dude
Z-Ro the Crooked, I'll be damned if I be a snitch fool

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
It's Bun be I go back-a like ""Atlanta Black Crackers""
I back-slap a, back-packer, from here to Cakalacka{Carolina's}
Wack rapper, short stopper or dope kicker-inner
Bitch I ain't ya chicken hitter, bring the heater get you wetter(get you
Wetter)
With the 50 caliber magnum handgun
Step a bear off in his tracks, you better hope I don't land one
If I cock that bitch back..aim it at your chest
It'll be weeks before they even find the pieces to your vest
We releasers of ya stress..ease ya pain
Put this pistol in your mouth, you'll never need them trees again
The one ya momma warned ya about
Bun-why he's insane
Kill a kid over a quarter, (???)
(???), boy you fuckin with the triller
Z-Ro the young guerilla
And Face the born killa

[Tanya Herron]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Scarface]
Hopeless again, and the more I stick around the shit get more fucked up
That's why I'm back on Holloway gettin' fucked up
Thinkin' back on how it used to be when it was all good
We wasn't trippin', this was our hood
I had your motherfuckin back
And when it was time to go to war, it was like ""where these niggaz at?""
Fuck rackets, we ain't never been the type to hold out
Or, let a motherfucker show out
No doubt, we put it down for the 9-0-triple 4
Droppin tops, fuckin fine hoes
These other niggaz is finally catching up
Listening to rappers ballin and gettin touched
Wasup? You done forgot about the street rules, splurgin
Is you a motherfucking fool?
Money ain't a thing to a nigga out here rappin
But to a nigga out there cappin?
That's they downfall

[Chorus: Tanya Herron}
Dir-tayyyyy, yeah
Dirty money
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Scarface]
Now the whole neighborhood silent
Got the fed-e-rals hangin (Shhhh)
While these young niggaz steady sangin
I need a motherfuckin law-uh-yer (Why's that?)
I'm in a state of paranoia
How many niggaz in the six-by-six
Fin' to get, some time behind some loud mouth bitch
Fin' to snitch, trapping niggaz up in they downfalls
Taping motherfuckers phone calls
Ay, I've been in this shit for two deep
From moving ki's, pushing weight was too sweet
An 8-ball will cost you 75 (Dirt cheap)
Back in the game that shit was live
And all you had to do to survive was get a whole click
Of niggaz, down with they business and stack chips
Savin up for hard times
Do the time when you do the crime
You niggaz tryin to ? your downfall

[Chorus]

[Voice with effects]
Nothing lasts forever but love
Money comes and goes
But for those ?? it surely goes

[Scarface]
You rollin over in the joint, trying to get your time dropped
Puttin niggaz up forever, cause you did the crime hop
Turned fed, and know they got indictments for real
Runnin in niggaz houses, niggaz fighting appeals
Offering 50 years to innocent motherfuckers
All because of the game, niggaz run outta hustle
Feds be showin pictures, you got to give 'em somethin
Time make a nigga forget it and start bumping
And saying shit, jeopardizing the whole thang
Niggaz run out of freedom, niggaz start to sang (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Laughing in your face, chuckle and produce
Avoid they conversation, them niggaz the dudes, fool

[Chorus]

[Outro - spoken as Chorus repeats]
Thing is, when a motherfucker is doing dirt
Don't come moving it, ya know what I mean
Ya know, that won't get you no Rolls Royces and shit like mine baby
Your money dirty, wash your shit
Them motherfuckers out here, yeah

""dirty money"" [scratched to end]
",Dirty Money
Scarface,"Is this how you made it, or is this sickness out of control
Is the beginning of the end right now? Let me know
Do the saved souls travel the road of the souls lost?
How come the dead can't talk?
Through horrified eyes I can picture the other side
And though my heart shed tears outside I couldn't cry
Watched my homeboy die, day by day body tired
Remember, I finally accounted before he expired
They tell me there's a peaceful place, I want to see it
They say I gotta leave it to see it, so it be it
And though I appreciate being alive
Sometimes I want to see how it feels to just die
Come back and tell my story to the ones who really know me
Converse with the angels and elders that went before me
And satisfy the hunger for those who want to know
If there's life after death, and if so, where we go
I often find myself involved in deep thought
I want to see is heavens a place like we thought
And Christian science seems to think it's just a mind state
But before I put my trust in a man I'll just wait
Or better yet, I take the journey for myself
Put a bullet in my own head, it's my death
So when twelve o'clock jump on eve of 11/9
Suicide
Just as I thought, a bright light
Greeted by friends and family, so life-like
Black and in between screams and then peace
Lookin' in the eyes of the grieved and deceased
Father please, send me back, I don't want to die
I'm not as strong as I was and I can't lie
And during all the mayhem somehow I remained calm
And I woke up singing this song

[Chorus]
I been a pawn and I been a king
And I been down since the beckoning
I try to look beyond the sight of sound
And the lights come from the underground
Rarely got questions but I found myself somewhat astound
And through my quest for the answers, know what I found?
I found that regardless to what people say
The shooters gotta do it day for day
So make your peace

Open your books to the first chapter, verse four, page eight
And link to my thoughts as my intents are to initiate
And enter the minds of the ones who are blind
And shed light to all the mankind written in rhyme
I preach to each to get off your ass, stand on your feet
Cause everyday it's niggas lying dead in the street
We stuck in our ways, it's different now than back in the days
Fuck what they say, cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about
I had a dream and seen a double sun, a different world was in the making
The ruler of this new world was Satan
The sky turned blood-red, the silent trumpet started playing
Then I woke up, my imagination
Running wild but then again the coming of Christ
Could be the moment of any minute, now or tonight
So make your peace, cause 666 is the mark of the beast
It's dark in these streets
And some might see it hard to believe but God is in me
And yea, though I walk through the valley of the wickedness
I know I'm protected cause I'm convicted
Anybody believing in the Big Bang Theory
And thinking that thyself is the God, you need to hear me
How do you explain
The skies, the moon, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea
The Earth without form facing the deep
Darkness and challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds
Didn't make up the trees, so why we turn our backs on the truth?
This heaven and hell part we seem to hide from the youth
I'm telling what few tongues of the evil will despise
My intention's to revitalize, still I revive
And I've read the Books, and I heard the lessons
And I'm on my knees steady stressing
You make your peace

[Chorus]",Make Your Peace
Scarface,"I don't really remember, feelin' like this

I wish they can see they need Mary

In a great day and I'm on it

Dang, they said the number still is the same
Wouldn't let my friends kill her
Take ya penitentiary chances to be with her, go deep with her
chief with her, sprung on the number lawn braud
Once she get you hot in her clutches, you can't run
In the dark, hearing footsteps, and you can't sleep
You find yourself so in love with this bitch, that you can't eat

I'm the first one to tell you I need Mary

Look at your face all frowned up
The only thing you got goin for ya is your fake tits and round butt
You're a rich nigga's worst mistake
You're just a trophy, and what make matters worse you're fake
A mall broad tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Whatever they wear in the videos, you want it
You tryin to find the nigga with the biggest contract
To get you pregnant, so you can ride around and get fat
And collect big money, with the baby all sharing
Got a 18-year career from child bearing
And only God knows what this kid'll go through
Got mixed feelings about his dad cause of you
The dollar signs popped up, that's what did it
And dude, he was just as fucked up cause he hit it
And now you out there buyin champagne for the club
To me that's kinda fucked up

[ CHORUS: Devin ]
Only your mother could love you
Much too freaky, you're easy
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I ain't never had to pay for mine

Much too sneaky, you're freaky
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I wouldn't give a broke bitch a dime

[ VERSE 2: Devin ]
You used to turn up your funky-ass nose before I even stepped up
I guess fuckin with me just wouldn't keep your rep up
I used to think about you when I'd go sleep, even dream
Of fuckin you without a rubber, fillin your pussy with cream
But when I wake and see you again, it be the same old shit
I finally realized you just a plain old bitch
Started gettin my shit tight rockin shows every night
Gettin my dick sucked, fuckin hoes left and right
Workin hard to blow up, now you wanna show up
With your stretch mark titties and pussy lips all towed up
I heard you got married, that was it you thought
Until he kicked your ass and took back all the shit that he bought
Now you're lookin for a shoulder to lean on
Bitch, I sho' hate it, cause my shit is dis-located
You was the only one I was thinkin of
But now you got a face only your mother could love

[ CHORUS ]

Break it down

I can't do nothin for ya
Only your mother could love ya
I can't do nothin for ya

Aight, check this out

Look, Young Tela a pimp by force, not a pimp by choice
See, these bitches ain't playin when it come to the courts
They'll fold you like some foil when it comes to support
And you niggas out here trickin like nature takes its course
I'ma spit it till you're fitted, it's your main employ
See, I was trained and I was taught that a pimp keeps a choice
But you lames gotta change when you gave the whore a port'
One weekend at the Allstar and the bitch bought a Porsche?
I ain't mad, girl, flip em, you can get em, look we did it
Cause his mind was all twisted off the aether from the clinic
Now hit it, oh lawdy, look at shawty
Mission hit your boy for a four and a forty
Miss done get your Ford for a house - ""Help me homie""
See, I can give a fuck about your loss cause you're phoney
You'se a lame and she seen it in your heart from the start
Why she ripped yo ass apart? It was lying in her cards
But eh, she'll only come up with another, I don't trust her
But she got one hell of a hustle

Everybody in the North gotta love us down South 'cause we blindin'
And we don't trip the big diamonds

And I been around the world in one day
Chucking up the deuce for S.A.
I'm a hood cat, and that's for searching me a hood rat
With good cat, something beautiful to look at, fa sho'

I kick it for my niggaz in the ghetto
And all my homies in the federal
Lock up, behind the wall setting shop up
They beat the block up, yet and still they couldn't stop us

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta back at it
'Cause I'm the last of the Dons, goddamn it
I hear ya talking, but I don't cater to the chit-chat

Be surrounded by a mob, and not get robbed

Considered to be a savior and not be God

Southern [unverified] baby, the last of a dying, we born again
The vicious life religious, I was born to win
The closure after the greatest hit the sofa
When I still ride for Prince like a soldier

The two-thousand millennium comes
Since I'm the son of the father, that makes me the Don
The next up to bat, the Jordan, Larry, cousy yo of rap
And I ain't gotta walk around strapped

J don't tolerate the mack dirties
You in our motherfucking way, we tryin' to stack 30s
Now back it up, for he send something back to you, ain't plan to defend

Fuck a history test, I'm more concerned about respect
I make my moves in an L like a night nigga check
It's on 'til the break of dawn, I keep it on
And on and on, and on and on and on and on

Like clockwork, we hit these niggaz where it hurt
Knock they dicks in the dirt, now you the bitch that's in the skirt
I'm passed the motherfucka out here paying his dues
Not the average nigga out here rapping claiming he true

I just stick to the script and take it in stride
Get my daily dose of game from James and take it and ride
Yes, yes y'all, funky fresh and in the flesh y'all
This time I'm aiming at the neck dog

It ain't no ducking when I'm bustin'
I'm a leave you a nice little whole in ya throat, releavin' ya life

Can I spend the night with you
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you

These niggas is fuckin with a dangerous game

Hey Joe, what's up baby?

Yeah, I like the beat

Hahaha...
Hey, when you drop drums I'ma drop rhymes, aight?
(Drop rhymes)
Nah, I don't need no count-off
Just drop the beat and I'm on it, aight?
(2-3-4)

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
I took my chances when I did my dirt
And my advice to any nigga if you crimin, you do it worse
Just get enough and step the fuck back
Cause in this game when you get fame
You gotta start dumpin these agents off your nutsack
I'm just a nigga out the hood tryin to have things
But when I got up on my feet you're screamin ""Brad changed!""
And your excuse was that the money came
But my excuse was that you missed the plane, simple and plain
I got to show my homies love, though
I just don't fuck around with niggas that I don't know
And you can take that how you wanna take it
I'm from these muthafuckin streets
And the same rules apply in this game, don't ever break it
Ain't my muthafuckin luck I'm all alone at the crack
And you niggas don't wanna try to attack
We steady dyin over dumb shit, and me, I'm steady losin my sleep
Cause niggas ain't familiar with the rules of the streets
You're stuck

Stuck at a standstill

On the beat one time, come on

It don't stop

Give it to em
...3

[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
And to my niggas on the streets crimin (watch for haters)
Stop sittin on the sidelines and (get your paper)
Too many niggas complainin pointin fingers at the problems
""That's why I hate my baby mama""
I'm just a nigga from the very bottom
Skippin classes, goin 8 balls or the white powder
Tryin to get it while the muthafuckin gettin good
The possibilities of movin out my neighborhood
Don't get me wrong, I had them dreams too
But the only thing you do is get your cream, fool
Get your muthafuckin green, fool
Niggas ain't knowin 'bout the ins and the outs
First get in, then you get out
Don't be stuck at a standstill

(You know...
To the 2, ah 2-1
(...I was thinkin)
Rock the mob shit for niggas, come on y'all
(...need to, I don't know, maybe findin new hustles
Like niggas is runnin out of hustles, you know?)

[ VERSE 3: Scarface ]
When it's over don't nobody cry
Just enjoy it while you live life cause everybody gotta die
So when you see me I'll be hella high
Bendin corners with my top down checkin out the changes in the sky
Shootin paper clips at Jupiter
The mo' I learn it's like I'm gettin stupider, and stupider
Tryin to make the best out of a fucked up decision
I'm just a nigga with a vision, which is
Gettin up, gettin out, gettin my profits
Tryin to stay away from these bitches that jock dick
Movin up to move on, gotta stay true to it
That's just the way you gotta do it
And these niggas here is renegades, don't give a fuck
But if you're real, then you like it rough, nigga what?
You know it, you know what I'm sayin is real
Now step the fuck off all those standstills
Cause you're stuck

Stuck at a standstill

Stuck

To the beat one time

Yeah
My nigga Mike Dean



",Stuck at a Standstill
Scarface,"Ghetto niggas remain violent while the killers remain silent
Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all warrin'
The lake we build houses but its the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggas do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makes music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause its deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
He came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggas

[Chorus: x6]
This is for my homies and my thug niggas

Face, picture us working at McDonald's
And me and you selling fucking toasted up
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggas
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
We ghetto niggas can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake its for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you want to
Cause I be dumping niggas off from New Orleans to California
Rowdy like a hurricane
Independent, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see see in a suit and tie
But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

[Chorus: x6]

What do you get from boosting?
Niggas coming out from California to represent them niggas from Houston
And now we rocking keep this shit popping
And all my niggas across the bay know l.a. keep the shit hot
I keep my glock inside my pants , don't give niggas a chance
To put me inside a casket you dirty bastards
Until the day I die you catch a nigga high off weed the police can't
Find me
My shit will drop and I'll sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game get caught up in drug dealing
How can I fall? how can I ball, how can I catch my enemies and murder
Them all?
My word of flame burn niggas inside their brain
Niggas can't hang with me, and like it changes, uh
Scarface got me on this shit
We laced it motherfuckers in their body and face, uh
Growing thicker, liquor made me daddy and nigga
Niggas don't want to see me world wide mob figure
M.o.b. and the leaf keep me weeded
Them niggas don't want to see me when I got weed in my system
Catch another victim, capture bodies
Bring a shottie to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit cause its wrong but we were born right
And to the niggas in my zone we do it long ways
Till these bitches understand nigga my song pay, cause I'm the man
Now these are my homeboys, we outlaws till the day we die
Keep this shit rough and raw my 45
Make sure that I survive to another day
To bust rhymes which from I get paid
Now that's the end of my freestyle but it was left for dead
But the shit away you can hear it playing, west side

[Chorus: x8]",Homies and Thuggs
Scarface,"Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see 
Do you think I'm crazy? (I! Yo, look at me) 
Sometimes I want to die, maybe I'll be free 
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin' me 
(I can't feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep 
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep 
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed 
Look me in my eyes(Look me in my eyes), 
and tell me what you see(and tell me what you see) 
Do you see my future, and what lies down the line? 
Is it just my test, or is it just my time? 
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did 
I forgot to be picked off, when I was just a kid 
A poison in my mind, tryin' to find relief 
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin' me 
Tryin' to set me up, bustin' down my streets 
Blockin' up my door, seekin' into catchin' me 
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what nigga's say 
Fuck runnin' ???, and fuck da D.E.A. 
And fuck these undercover's, that lock me up for weeks 
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese 
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang 
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane 
I know you crackas pissed off, I can see it in your eyes 
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die(Until the day that I die) 
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie 
You just want to destroy me, just like you did my guy 
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth 
Listen up my niggaz: ""The F.B.I. been watchin' you"" 
Especially if you black, and tryin' to leave the streets 
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin' me 
Runnin' in my crib, makin' niggaz lie 
Nigga get escaped opened, take this 25 
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule 
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school 
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed 
but not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me? 

[Chorus] 
Look me in my eyes! 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!) 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee? 

Look me in my eyes, I've told 'em all I could tell you 
And now you know too much, if you lead a word I'll kill you 
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged? 
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain 
Whatsup with all these nightmares, there's more rewind the road 
It leads me to the same place where I started from 
right before I left home(Look me in my eyes!) 
I thought you was a shrink 
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think 
OK your time is up, now analyze my life 
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes) 
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa 
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over 
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks 
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back 
? 
But he stopped the reverberations, and then he spoke the truth 
And told me all my answers, I was findin' in his book 
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked 
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find 
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes 
Looked me in my eyes

This ya boy Young Hova, yo turn the motherfucking noise up

Welcome to New York City, it's ya boy Young Hov' chea

Lemme talk to these motherfuckers, uhh

Guess who's bizack?
You still smelling crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them roads
When I was hugging it, niggas couldn't do nothing with it
Straight from the oven with it, came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth, for the shit she instilled in me
Still with me, pain plus work
Shit she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling guts every time, drag my nuts every time
Homey, we make a great combination don't we?
Me and the Face Mob, every time we face-off
Face it y'all, y'all niggas playing basic ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall
Homey, I'm in the drop with the AC on
That's why the, streets embrace me dawg, I'm so cool!

Guess who's bizack?
Back on the block with the old Face Mob
Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse
Back to the block with the fo'
Cuz this street shit is all I know

From the womb to the tomb, a hot pot of joy and a spoon
Trying to make me forty thousand and move
Motels, star-studded, rock stars and goons
Plain clothes wanna run in my room
But nigga guess who's bizack? It's ya boy Face Mob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake dawg
Give niggas a break, nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang fo', to go against the grain (no)
I'm out here to grind mo', rapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine hoe and candy paint the 88
Don't got no wholesale, cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta see my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fa' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, then I come by with the fizzle
And make fa' sho' I get to work mines, for part of the time
We go to war and you ain't making a dime (ha ha!)
Cause I got, shit to lose, a nigga out here payin his dues
My baby walking gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game doing, lemme give ya the rules
Get outta line and I'ma give ya the blues
It's a new game doing, lemme give ya the rules
Get outta line and I'ma give ya the blues, whoa!

Guess who's bizack?
The boy B. Mizack, a.k.a. Mr. Crack-A-Brick
Turn a whole one from a half a brick, look I mastered this
You can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gasket clicked
You can make ya chips swell up, ya don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like on box-spring
Pissy Mack and shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like a quart of water
Shit I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Till like deuce in the morning, with the old heads
Slanging loose quarters, this Philly cat back gatted (had it)
Still fucking with them crack addicts
Still busting with that black-matic

Guess who's bizack?

Deep in the heart of south park lurks a stalker
S.a. fool, native houston south parker
Born and brought up to be a heartless motherfucker
No one else to blame, fuck it blame it on my mother
When I was growin up nobody seemed to give a shit
And that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either
Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's
Learned the game of hustlin, fuckin dopefienders
Sellin niggaz beat, in other words amphetamines
My game was more advanced, sellin speed I'm goin broke
Got em up with floyd and floyd had fronted me some dope
Learned to rock it up, now I got it sold
Time to go for broke, motherfuck who I owe
Business started boomin, started movin powder
Motherfuck the bitches I want money and the power.. yup!

Brand new crib, brand new clothes
Mom would ask questions, and often pitch a bitch
Where am I gettin the money? mickey d's ain't paid me shit
I'd make up a story, just to get her off my back
Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin hard, stackin paper like trump
And I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word em up a nigga sprayed em
Momma told me shoot first, and ask questions later..
Six hundred bucks a motherfuckin hour
And I ain't fallin short cause I got money and the power, yup

There goes 21, and still stackin 30's
Brought my brother warren lee down from new jersey
He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause ac'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers, to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggaz stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggaz up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin noise

Niggaz forget about the streets but when they rap they songs
They claim they tote the heat, they quick to clap they guns
In interviews be braggin bout the crack they slung
But when it's war, these cowards never blast, they run
The fuck you think you foolin dog? I live this shit
I know it when niggaz fake it - I live this shit
You can front it all you want but when yo ass gets hot
Then you can rest assured nigga - yo ass gets got
I'm sayin that to say this - I can plot those hits
I'm connected in every city on capo shit
I ain't even gotta say these niggaz know my ties
A nigga made, therefore whoever cross gon die
Money changin motherfuckers, makin hoes grow nuts
You a bad motherfucker, you don't give no fuck
Let me snap you back to reality dude, shit's real
You a target, niggaz in Houston want you killed
Facemob until it's over, Southside the pipes
Dirty Third in this bitch, J. Prince for life
Dedicated to these niggaz live and breathe that shit
Let the real niggaz shout it out, scream that shit

Fresh out the pen, once again I'm here to grab my nuts
I am hell for real - you doubt it nigga? call my bluff
Only respect men that's real, you coward rat-ass fucks
Who raised you niggaz? Yo father probably hate yo guts
Mad he didn't double up, and that Lifestyle bust
Ya lifestyle fucked, ya duckin, every corner tryna clap at you
Plus fuck ya mother, the bitch ain't shit for havin you
What? If you don't like what I'm sayin, fuck ya attitude
Same lame probably showed these rap niggaz gratitude
Huh, happy they ain't snitch on you
Must I remind yo monkey ass what a bitch might do?
They act like they got yo back to infiltrate yo rest
Then have you talkin (Through The Wire) like Kanye West
To all my real niggaz trapped homey, mind yo tongues
'cause these cowards comin home after firin they ones (?)
I never snitch

Snitch niggaz, bitch niggaz, they all the same face
No matter what hole you crawl in, nigga you ain't safe
All you niggaz is rats, nicknamed Jake
Sam, Curtis or Alpo belong in the same place
A penitentary cell block gettin gang raped
Coward motherfucker, now tell me how my name taste
I leave you bleedin like ya period came late
Red bandana on, call that my Game Face
Niggaz come in all shapes
Some snitches wear Reeboks, some wear Bathing Apes
Sometimes they Crip niggaz, other times Piru
And some snitch niggaz look just like you
I promise to never snitch, like some of my homies
G-Rock, be-Mase, and O.G. Tony
Before I have the police run in ya house
I kiss my son on the cheek and put the gun in my mouth, motherfuckers

Unlike these other hoes in ya crew you don't jock me
I'd like to get ya phone number just to see what you about
Call you for breakfast to get you out
And see if you just some eyes without a face
Let me see ya crib - take me to ya place
I wanna show you that it's mo'to me then fuckin on my mind
'cause in yo mind I bet you fuckin all the time
Come to find you only out tryin to go to school
And tryna go to school and pay bills is hard to do
I see you fool so go on and do ya thing
But when you tired of showin ya titties give me a ring
I like a woman gettin hers cause that's better
Then her tryna come up off mine I can't let her

Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 2 - Z-Ro]
Go on and let a nigga peak, go on and let a nigga poke
Give me some assistance as I manuver my long stroke
I hope you don't think I'm payin'for it that's the wrong hope
'Cause I know you wanna be Z'Rollin over chrome spokes
Bitch I know you wanna tell ya girlfriends how it was
To get hit from the back, in the back of the 'Lac by a thug
And to get ran through until you get carpet burns off the rug
And to get nutted on by nine niggaz with diamond grills and guns
And how you got on my microphone and sung a sixteen
Ya performance deserves a grammy check out my big screen
Most bitches don't know but you know what suckin a dick mean
Yeah the head was fed but what up with that in them jeans
I can see the pussy (?)lookin like a big bee
Make ya cycle start early my shovel be diggin deep
I don't wanna relationship, I just want me some relations
Go on and let a nigga poke hoe, and stop shuckin with my patience

Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

Bitch get down on me at the drop of a dime
Fuck all that are & be singin shit I ain't got the time
I'd rather bust yo'ass up with some screwed and chopped
Let me test ya jaws and let me stretch out ya cotton
I'm still Pimp see bitch, the name ain't changed
Puttin stick up in these hoes don't remember they name
'cause we tired of playin games with them booty lickers
'cause we jumped up in ya life, cause I'm a true dirt digger
So go on hit the streets, break them lame tricks
Then bring it back to daddy that's how you can get this dick
I need the cash first - and the ass last
And we can blow dro in the Benz while I smash on the gas
So let a nigga pimp, and let a nigga mack
And later on tonight you can get hit up in ya back...and get ya money back
But when I make ya pussy skeet bitch you gon'buy me a 'Lac

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 4 - Juvenile]
I ain't tryna talk a hole in yo head
But I can tell you didn't excel what them hoes done said
Starrin at my neck and my wrist 'cause my shit is frozen red
And I look like a easy hustler so go ahead
Ya leavin the same way ya met me
You gon'be grievin if you sex me, while I'm schemin on the next piece
I'll poke ya cookie I don't give a fuck who know this
Who up in the area that aknowledge what a hoe is
All my warriors is lovin my rep
How I took it to the world from the project steps
Playin touch with my broad like my children
And it ain't like back in the days when we ducked behind buildings
I be a threat to tell a broad what I'm feeling
Especially if she poor and she need to be gettin no bullshittin
She ever fix her mouth for some money it's good with me
I ain't the one what you need is a stool pigeon

Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 5 - Petey Pablo]
If you think I'm a treat a bitch with high price drawls
Any differance then the way I treat the grandma's on
How many ways is there to say that you terribly wrong
Would you understand me better if I just said ""naw""
Fuck what another motherfucker told y'all
That's tipical talk when they dick hard
They just wanna little pussy mama that's all
It's like fourth down, two yards fuck it they goin for it
How am I payin'for it?, and how much you charge for it?
It ain't about being a whore that's what it's made for
Get ya paper baby fuck what the world say
Get ya bills paid....okay!

Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke

Lil' Red, way back in the motherfucking cut man
Nigga was like shit nigga, I was like what come on man

[Scarface]
Street lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle
And moving slowly in silence, steady making sho' my hustle
Is air tight, these city streets is hectic gotta get it here
Tomorrow ain't a promise to me, so I don't live in fear
I work until I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, re-up and that's when I bleed it
The soldier could never see me, as being some'ing that's lesser
A nigga straight out the gutter, murdered without a question
Product of my surroundings, click it clack it and and down him
All they know is he missing, but niggaz ain't never found him
I'm sorry but still in yet, I don't live it on regrets
I'm a motherfucking killer, for realer this ain't a threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets, and my advice to you is live your life
And never when niggaz might, hit you under city lights
So get it right (never know)
You never know when niggaz might, hit you under city lights get it right

[Hook - 2x]
Lord forgive me, cause I know I ain't living right
Still I gotta make some'ing happen, under them street lights
But pay attention, let me show you what my life like
You can get your days cut short, under them street lights

[Yung Redd]
Them folks got me under the scope, cause I ain't living right
Still I ain't the one to provoke, dog you get it right
20 inch shoes when I cruise, under them city lights
Careful with the road I choose, cause you can lose your life
I'm praying and hoping, I never get caught in the moment
Shot from a glock, that's smoking from not scoping
When a nigga told me, you don't work you don't eat
So I'm slanging thangs for cheap, where the streets lights meet
And my pop, was a rolling stone
15 I was grown, 16 I was holding my own
Is it wrong to sell you a dream, or sell you a zone
A long way from home, on this road I roam
Still I'm po'ing the liquor, for niggaz who ain't with us
Ery'body ain't a gangsta, every nigga ain't a killa
Naw but them laws, couldn't tell ya the difference
So pay attention, or find yourself locked in prison this ain't living man

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil Ron]
Years have passed, and shit in the hood getting drastic
Two days ago, my homegirl got blasted
That's tragic, happened right on my block
I'm feeling paranoid, laws might run in my spot
So I'm living low key, and them folks don't know me
Slowly I ride through the city, stack mo' cheese
Then I slide out, to the hideout and smoke on
Haters watching, my chest is froze like a snow-cone
But hold on, trash talking ain't my game
Rather pimp me a dame, or switch lanes in a Range
Peep this it ain't a secret, them laws ain't right
They like to catch a late night, living the life
That's why I'm on top of my game, always thinking twice
Don't get it twisted, I still got a mean right
But most of the time, my nigga I'm on chill
It's real in the field, it's easy to get killed

Scarface,"[Scarface ad libs..]

...""let me spit some game to ya""...

[Verse 1]
You gotta war on drugs
Well every other day a nigga dies
You showed yours, now let me show you mine
Bring the six o'clock news
And let me walk 'em in my shoes
Through what you call the inner city
And what I call the blues
I'm broke here, and I ain't wainting on a call
From a resturaunt to bust tables
When Petie's got a job
Making 35 a week and all he do is run the streets
This nigga always caked up
Chromed out and draped up
Constantly telling me we need to get this paper
I'm getting skinny and it's he who get my weight up
Straight up
And plus I'm tired of missing meals
So I paid the man a visit...

[Petie] ""What's the goddamn deal?
It's good to see you dog
I thought you might've choked up
Respect and money, well I can get you both of 'em""

[Face] ...I went inside, watching him break it down
When he was finished he handed a nigga nine
A nine milimeter, nine zips
Said if I sold each one for nine, I'd have grip
I hesitated, I ain't never sold a stone
I done seen it fuck the hood up
Plus all my niggaz gone
And they ain't never coming out
So with that in consideration
I took the package and bounced
I'm headed home, dazing out in a zone
Eyes on my luggage, I'm abouts to get it on
Get to the house, spread it all on the couch
Getting this bank what it's about

[Hook]
That's how a nigga made
They got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave

Get money everyday
It ain't no other way
That's how it is until they put me in a grave

[Verse 2]
I'm in the living room looking at the news
Got a razor and some zipper baggies
About to do the fool
Cutting hundred dollar slabs
Wholesaling niggaz halves
Getting money like a muthafucka
Serivng niggaz bags
Got the blocks all blowed up
The whole hood smoking
Got a pistol I ain't shot yet
So dude's wide open for it
I'm just a youngster, I ain't done it, but I will
'cause I was taught you got to get it
So I get it how I live
Finna get my ma a crib, she ain't working
So I'm forced to win the bread for the household
'cause dad was no support
Often in and out of court, caught a case out of town
Got a body on his conscience, but nobody made a sound
He was going through the motions
He gonna probably beat the case
Still I get down on my knees
And beg the Lord to let him raise
Get up and get my workers out
Supply 'em with the goods
Give instructions to the goons
To come up out the hood
I ain't gotta pay the fronters
So I'm finally finna raise
'cause the bottom line is this homie
You gotta get paid

[Hook]
That's how a nigga made
They got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave

Get money everyday
It ain't no other way
That's how it is until they put me in a grave
I never learned a trade
I fuck with chess and spades
The only other game a nigga learned to play was
Working hopping yay
'cause kissing ass was gay
I'm on my business, I want money like I'm jade

[Verse 3]
I'm the nigga in the hood
These little homies wanna be like
I got when shit was good
But now-a-days off in this street life
These niggaz switch it on you
Quick to put you in the crosses
Now he standing in your crib
And got a pistol in your mouth
That's your muthafuckin' boy
He popped you and popped your broad
Now he headed to the closet
And he about to take it all
So watch your muthafuckin' friends
'cause them the ones that sell you out
Ain't no future in being loyal
When niggaz see you want the top
Jealous hearted muthafuckas
Always quick to say you hating
I don't want another homie dog
He swallowed that and chased it
You can make it like I made it
I think it's best you do it dolo (solo)
That way niggaz can't say shit about you
When talking to the po-po
Oh yo, you know that dude that fronted me my come up
I caught him coming out the neighborhood
And had him done up
That's why I'm skeptic
When it comes to different faces
'cause I know I got it coming
But 'til then, I'll get my bank, shit

[more ad libs]

...""fuck you think this is?""...

...""more food for thought""...

...""that's how this shit go
Muthafucka been foolin' you, fuckin' with you
All your muthafucking life
And he the muthafucka talking to the people
You know...get that nigga ass outta here""...

...""I ride by my muthafucking self""...

Scarface,"Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

Our Taj Mahal, our monument

24 wasn't trippin' on what I came up in 
I was focusin' how to be like j's back then
Money power and respect was the life I choose
Being famous wasn't nothin' I just like my doe
I was livin' in the fast lane mayne fo' sho'

Seeing the nigga had a weak spot and she was right
I just call it how I see it, she in love with him
And he in love too, and still be fucking all of them
Can you imagine you in lock with one breeze for life?
Waking up in the morning and laying down the night
With the same face looking at you all the time
Realizing now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus she's always mad, and her sex ain't great
And she don't suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into trying to find him something new
And on the real, I done seen it when it went like this
But girl there's one thing happening that you can't forget

But you can never be my main boo, we can remain cool
But we can't be seen and for this I can blame you
Because you got more miles than a F-350
You been ran through, and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met, I've been hearing your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Coming out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite
You make a man out of your clit, that's how you handle the dick
It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover
Make me look fucked up, because unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you can't get mad because I am not your man
Your under-standing was bad, it was not my plan
For you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that

[Chorus]

[Scarface Verse 3]
For me to say that, ""I do, "" would be a lie because I don't
Believe no woman is right for me so I won't
Try to talk myself into thinking she is
And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch
And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman, there's a man, home man
Saying, ""Damn, I done spent six years in this shit
The first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped""
And then that's it, had to make some new plans
'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
And you're hurt all along, steady hitting her phone
But a bigger dick and longer bank roll, she gone
And if I ever say, ""Maybe, "" and you thought that I might
You consider, just imagine what my wife was like
And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone

[Chorus]",Girl You Know
Scarface,"Man, take another hit breathe out
In a zone blowing smoke out a glass teapot
I?m chillin at home on some solo shit
I love piece and when its quiet, I don?t want no bitch
I don?t want to look at lifetime, I?m fine with fuse
Fuck entertainment weekly bitch, find some news
I like Keyshia but I need some blues
Steady hollering about some time
Bitch I need some Room
Don?t get me wrong ya?ll I love females
That come around but after while, I need some self
I know I?m selfish at times but bottom line, move around if that ain?t how you get down
Plus my album coming out real soon, I?m in the studio daily tryna write these tunes
And for you to stress a nigga like I?m running these hoes is outta line
Goodbye to your life, pack up your clothes and go

[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I?ve given all of me so unselfishly
And now he?s at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go

I?m about to hit some spots with my guys from outta town
And there you go making those mean old eyes
Feel like I?m in prison sometimes
Like my freedom is gone like I?ve committed a crime and that?s some bullshit
You watch a nigga like I?m 6 years old, how the fuck you think this shit gon? grow
I?ma tell you how this shit gon? go
I?ma hop off in this clean ass triple silver Porsche Turbo and hit the road and Go
You run a nigga blood pressure up from that spite shit 
And normally I don?t fuck with that type bitch
But she got a nigga feeling her though
Text messaging my phone I feel like killing this ho
But before I let her get on my row
I?ma hand the bitch her walking papers letting her go and hit the door
But yo, I ain?t never seen a UFO 
And I ain?t never seen a ho that?s more important that dough 
So Go

All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need

And now he?s at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go

I?m rolling late night with my buzz on
Leaving out a strip club and wanting my fuck on
I?m strolling through a list of my missed calls
And right up out the blue man this bitch calls
You coming over here (woman?s voice)
I?m like shit naw
So to question that decision she eats up a dick raw
But man, I?d rather go to bed with a hard dick 
Than to have to spend the whole night fucking and arguing
This bitch a lunatic, fuck a nigga high off
I wish it was I way I could hit and just drive off
But that?s not happening
So I?ma lay my ass down, watching girl?s gone wild penis in my hand
Hardest times and I don?t wanna sell out
Still I?m putting on my flip-flops to bail out
I grab my keys off the table and coat
It?s an open invitation for a nigga to score, so I go!

[Hook sung by Nina]

Scarface,"I would, never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could, never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin' for they scratch
Forever pourin' out liquor for 'em, God send me back
And I'll, never shed tears, my heart is like a stone now
Never thought I'd live to see 21 look I'm grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means it's forever, but it's never crossed my mine
And I'll, never go broke, I promise I'm a shine
Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be past it, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want it, every motherfuckin' dime
No I, never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could, never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
Take that first breath and from then, I knew I had to mash
And it could, never be said I went out like a hoe
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level hoe, or get a shovel hoe
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared
It's in my bloodline, the realest nigga ever bred
And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, cause I believe a
Man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God I'd stay the same
And when I finally got my paper, I was on my game
I'll never talk a nigga down, do yo' thang dawg!
Never hate a dude for tryin, that's insane dawg
Get yo' motherfuckin' money, that's the thang dawg

You was playin when you was sayin you was ready,
I'm knowin' you ain't mean it when you told me you was tired of life
And just wanted to leave it you were drinkin,
So I ain't really pay it no attention,
Took you back to your crib and dropped you off
With the intention of gettin with this Asian chick
I've been offerin (this chick) somethin exquisite,
I had to spit that game 'cause she was vicious,
I'm hoppin back on 6-10 punchin the drop
On my way out to her house I started noticing cops,
Somethin tellin me to turn around and follow these dudes,
Normally I wouldn't consider but out of the blue I'm bustin a you
I get off where they get off at
Well-familiar with these streets, this where I came up at
Roadblocks, yellow tape, ""a crime scene"" they say,
What the fuck just happened? I just left this place...
I get out and started walkin askin Frog, ""What's up?""
Lookin at me dazed like, ""Face, it's all fucked up...""
I move a little closer tryin to see who it is
And I saw his baby mama in tears holdin his kids...

[CHORUS]
[incomprehensible]

[VERSE 2]
And it was then it finally hit me
I'm standing here nervous as I can be
It was nothing that can prepare me for what I'm finna see
I'm praying this is a dream and I'm bout to awake
But the closer I got the more I realize fate
Wasn't fair to change for me
And why would I think so
My homie had a date with death
He had to make though
I'm feelin eerie, I'm liftin up the yellow tape
By the time I get to the scene
They rollin this away
I wonder what's under this sheet, my knees get weak
To the point I had to take me a seat
This shits deep
When they put a nigga down that you was raised around
What was once a minor statement's turnin' major now
Never woulda thought in years that my homie was suicidal
Had it all money and kids and a wife that read the bible
They say its life and death in the slum
He had his reasons I shoulda believed him
Anotha soul no longer breathin'
Hate to say it but this one been heavy on my conscience
My nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
And everybody thinkin' its murder, but homicide sayin self-inflicted
By the way the body was sitting, brains in the kitchen
Who coulda predicted
But the detectives who was fishin'
Fucked up that the family had to see dad in his position
All I remember was us doin what we did
To survive in these streets where we lived
We was kids growin up in this environment
Nothing but trouble
You either struggled or you hustled
Folded the bubble
Grade school til we dropped out, we had a plan
We was either finna be rich or die like a man
We did it all for the love of the hood, every journey
Imagine seein' your dawg lifeless across a gurney
I wonder what was goin on
You shoulda said that you was feelin' mad
I coulda talked you outta that
But never will I see you again
Nor will your kids
Nor will your family or your friends
Its the end
Not even words I write in this song
Can right that wrong
My nigga is gone and life goes on

Dyin' over dumb shit,
Fast money for your soul,
Now your done with.
You hear the gun click. 
Blood stains on the walls and carpet,
Pain and the hardships
Of a father identifyin' his child
From a photo of the plan,
With his brains blown out now.

Started off in math class early that day.
Hey! it's high school,

Somebody got shot
Oh,
But I'm still here.

Chillin' gettin' smoked out.

It's just not my turn.

'Cause she ain't knowin' what I'm fin' to be facin'
Is nothin' short of a racially motivated killin' 'cause them boys
See a nigga as only a third of a human [Incomprehensible]

'Cause I'm knowin' how he feel and I'm just bein' real

Need to get up and get out and cut that bullshit out
Nigga get yo' own, you strugglin' at this bitch house
The lack of makin' money make a motherfucker bend
If you'd rather me than you die in the end again and again

I made it over to dry land but still wound up sinkin' in quicksand
I'm tryin' Lord, I just can't get right
Paid my bills on Monday, even went to church on Sunday
But I, but I, but I just can't get right

I lay in bed lookin' up at the ceiling
As the fan turns in a circle thinkin' 'bout my evil
Seein' end on my TV, bombs in the skies
Over Baghdad they fight but they don't know why

What they said about Hussein was a goddamn lie
Raised a war against a religion for oil, don't lie
I seen kids from the hood livin' like they gon' die
With the mindset of be broke or let's go get high

If the cost of livin' so crazy how we gon' get by
Gasoline five dollars, how the fuck we gon' drive?
Can't afford to fill our prescriptions so we all gon' die
CVS is slangin' dope on every block worldwide

Since, spies up and had the dope game on fine
Then it's only right for one nigga to go get mine
If they injured then how they gon' survive?
If they stuck at the bottom how the fuck they gon' ride?

I made it over to dry land but still wound up sinkin' in quicksand
I'm tryin' Lord, I just can't get right
Paid my bills on Monday, even went to church on Sunday
But I, but I, but I just can't get right

Ain't life a muthafucker, first you think you got it
Then it all falls apart in front your eyes, try to stop it
But it's part of the plan that was written by the man
Got me down on my knees and my hands prayin'

Forgive me Lord, thank the Lord I'm alive
'Cause I'm knowin' deep down I coulda died
I shed so many tears, lost so many peers
In the grave or the penitentiary facin' twenty years

Pourin' beers on the corner 'cause Frankie told me look a killer
Told me I was high, livin' blind to the fact that they sold us out
America the beautiful, there's a funeral on every day of the month
Tryin' to get our knees broken, huh

It's another chance under these circumstances
My people ain't advancin' but if we pray
Maybe we'll get to live our life in the sun
Instead of livin' on the blocks dyin' young, here I come

Ooh, made it, made it, made it

She steady tellin? me her dude ain?t the type she like
And the reason she ain?t leavin? is ?cause ?he?s so nice?
On Due to special occasions like birthday shit
That?s election just in need for some birthday dick
You can spend it with your man y?all can walk them malls
Tear that motherfucker down I just want your draws
That?s why I?m laughing everytime you call
?cause I know that you?re in love with how I broke it off
The nigga strokes too soft and she a beast in bed
And when she fucks she talks pussy is deep and wet
And I don?t need the taxes I don?t sweat the bitch
And sworn and damn and that?s some texas shit
And I won?t fuck?s em on the first day, I peeps they mind
So they know that what they havin more important than mine
And when I?m deep inside with speed devine 
I?m movin grown she screamin hard, which means that I?m...

From doing daily at the movies going out the broads
Make you look like you?re a couple when it?s not at all
How it is in actualities you close your mouth
We do better gettin? tracin? down important talk
Understands that you got a man is probably not
In the end is something both is something seasons out
And even if we are just friends that don?t justify
You being seeing with a boy like him
?cause boy that?s bad and they know before it?s over
You be bend over my sofá while I bust that ass
And while that nigga takin? pictures of you behind your clothes
Sendin? roses to your office while he?s crying and soars
Stuck wonder while you leavin mouth in the cloth
She?s floppin? with your business what somebody been told
She was probably a hoe, probably somebody you know
On your cell phone dial while you hittin? that note
Now we squeezin it for...

If she a hoe in the beginning she?s a hoe for life
And I can?t understand how niggaz make these hoes they wife
You got hoes that?s filipino you got hoes that?s white
You got hoes from Puerto Rico that?s just cold as ice
And it is what it is ain?t no changin? the facts
It was a shame when you only thought they came in black
Now how insane is that, had a change of heart
Though you have a worth then it came a pork
Then she hangs with boys you need to tell your broad
Said until she met him she never came this hard
And the shamest part while you at home relax

On the balcony bend over lookin bad as hell
Finger fuckin her and slappin on that ass as well

[Verse 2:]
Deal with it, don?t talk he be about it, cause he a G about it.

I cooped the Chrome 45 under pressure.
And then address ya, now ya froze on the streture.
You wanted trouble, and I wouldn?t settle lesser.
I am the devil in the flesh, my pistol is my protector.
See my reflection as it fades in the black,
When I reappear on a nigga. It?s a ragging attack yeah.
And soloulome swear, any problem I here.

[Verse 3:]
Bitch nigga you catch a dead man walking.
One foot is inside of a grave.
The other one is in a closed top coffin.
You still talking, like you the old G,
When you was locked down thou you was low key.
The niggas told me they had you in Sig, in the Locust.
You were working with those boys and them,
And even had the nerve to try and talk to the streets.
Thinking that they bring some mark ass police.
And then he tried to sue a nigga,
But it got back to a nigga.
And when I see him, I am do the nigga.
So skip that funky ass deposition fools.
If you want it, crank it up.
That?s what I am about to do, to High Powered
",High Powered
Scarface,"I'm too hard to kill, I refuse to die
Sweat tears and blood, paid dues alive
In these streets I roam, I've been blessed to live
Could've easily got caught up in my yesteryears
But I'm here~! My story remains the same
I ain't changed a bit, I speak words of pain
From a frozen heart, lost what's left to lose
I'm alone and what I promise is death to you
And it's true my only fear is I have none
My conscience makes me keep me to myself cause I blast one
And I can fall asleep right next to a dead man
I'm cold, I put bullet holes all off in your headband
So, bring me death cause I've been itchin to see
If it's an afterlife, aim it at me, cock it and squeeze

Please... back to back to back to back to back to back, nigga
From my first fuckin album nigga
And I still can't be fucked with, trust me

I'm the truth in here, I give up what's real
Not afraid to die, not afraid to kill
But afraid to lie, and too scared to steal
Cause what's mine is mine, and what's his is his
In these streets it's clear, punishment's severe
If that line is crossed that's when them guys appear
It's like nothin you've seen, so fuck what you've heard
It ain't what you believe, cause it's deeper than words
If that silence is broke then somebody's comin to blow
Holes in yo' upper body, leavin a bloody coat
To be viewed by these dues who feel like this
When it's enough said it's bloodshed, believe that shit nigga
Cause we that sick nigga, you see that bitch - get her!
Cause he that snitch nigga, so squeeze that's it figure
That you watch what you say, you say it and die
What you cherish is close to me so don't testify

Straight up hood nigga, made it rappin
Yeah, caught a break huh
My life put down in words homey
That's some real shit, yo

A rapper - you hated to love, respected and feared
What I'm capable of there's nothin they say in our ears
I'm a soldier for fortune, I've got murderous plots
Plus I'm suicidal, walkin this parking lot
With my dangerous thoughts, I'm a dangerous dude
When I up it and cock the hammer I'm aimin dude
I came in to do, I'm a killing machine
And with life comes a price so I triple the fee
When it's trippin with me, either you win or you lose
In the end he who wins is he who finishes fools
I'm sentencin you, to a home in the sea
With the lint in your pockets, you rolled with weed
Exposin the weak, you hoes fin' to sleep
With the fishes bitches and y'all should know the demeanor

Yeah, everything that I say I am nigga I am
Know the rest of you motherfuckers wish you could be that real
I tell you what my nigga, be real with your motherfuckin self
I am Facemob nigga~! I am the best nigga
I am the back to back to back to back nigga

Scarface,"[Young Malice]
Where I'm from?
Killers go dumb
Usually deatch is the outcome
Welcome to the jungle
Where kidnappers hunt you
The streets they really want you
Serious
No smile on this block gives answers gets per curious
Good times disappears quickly back into a mist
Shoot I hardly ever miss
That means I'm accurate
Crack the pitch
Then pretty soon I have to switch
Scratching the itch with paper cuts on my index
The real riders shoot up blocks and screams ""who next?""
Like my nigga 2-Tech he totes 2-techs.
It been a beef before in Houston they called it ""plex""
They got to know the protocol 
I'm warning y'all
It gets deep
So deep the prison guards will put you to sleep
Rest eternally
No coming back
You OD'd
Overdose
This neighborhood got me comatose
Back up against the wall another statistic I know

[Chorus Z-Ro]
The streets always been my daddy
And mommy is the colleges
I'm a soldier and I'm about my mail
If I get busted I'm not about to tell
Because I'm a gangster
The streets always been my daddy
And mommy is the colleges
I'm a solider and I'm about my mail
I ain't trying to do right because I'm already living in hell
Because I'm a gangster

[Will Hen]
The gas prices are too high
Pay raises too low
I'm better off in the game flippin kicks like Judo
Or out somewhere pimpin getting money by the two hoes
That's why I'm in the lab with The Product spittin new flows
Feds watchin my hood entirely too much gunplay
Neighborhood basketball star slained last Monday
Raided the neighborhood kingpin last Tuesday
If this was going on in your neighborhood what would you say?
Given the opportunity to tell it to the masses
Low and middles class still carrying bus passes
Young girls giving birth before they hit the 9th grade
About to be a mom and can't even make cool-Aid
Who made this crack anyway?
Told this about this herron 
Sold us to alcohol and the guns that we care-on

[Chorus Z-Ro]

[Scarface]
It's like the ghetto got a heart and a soul
A mind of it's own
A hunger for a young cat die before he grown
A lust for a young girl sliding down the pole
She's always falling short on her goals
The street life is cold
It's either when you lose or you fold
Money is the root of all evil is what I was told
And everything that you thought you would leave there is a hoax
You put your faith in front of those demons and when the smoke clear
The truth appear
The fight for your life
The struggles of the wrong versuses right
And wrong won
The song sung
In the keys of reality 
When death crosses your path bloodshed tragically
So automatically you come to a close
And realize no matter what the key to the codes
I seen the hood swallow motherfuckers whole
Then shit them out in the system ain't never make it home
I know

[Chorus Z-Ro]
",Soldier Story
Scarface,"Verse 1 (Scarface)

Up early in the morning,
Waken by the sound of my cell phone,
Donny hathaway singing on the ringtone.
Was a homie that I went to school with,
Tellin me life wasn't shit to fool with.
These young niggas steady dyin' over dumb shit,
Fast money for your soul,
Now your done with.
You hear the gun click.
(gunshot).
Blood stains on the walls and carpet,
Pain and the hardships
Of a father identifyin' his child
From a photo of the plan,
With his brains blown out now.
Lets rewind to where it all took place,
Started off in math class early that day.
Hey! Its high school,
And everybodys tryin to earn a rep
And he gone gun shot a homie to death.
The impossible is happenin,
Children are left to make decisions.
Do ya let 'em die or kill them urself?

Choruse (Shateish)

As I look at my life..
Remembering where I've been.
I may not have been here.
Cuda been in the gutter,
Drowning in my tears.

I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeahhhh)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot..

Oooooh,
But I'm still here.
I'm still here.

Verse 2:

Another homie got murdered in the dope house,
Ass pocket full of money, 
Chillin' gettin' smoked out.
Two shots hit him in his face when he blast it,
Frame pictured,
And its closed casket.
This is so tragic.
I see death on every block I turn,
Its just not my turn.
Live the same lifestyle,
Cash money to burn.
Weed blowin' steady slippin' in the darkest term.
When it feels like real life,
Knowin' is next.
Rep to take it, 
Be the last left,
Humble yourself.
In slow-mo you see your wholse life flashin'
That second from the beginning,
Back to the end and that lesson
Is nothin short of what a nigga expect.
Livin' life like this,
This is duly respect.
And I refuse to give debt.

As I look at my life..
Remembering where I've been.
I may not have been here.

Oooooh,
But I'm still here.

Verse 3:

Yeah I remember,
We tatted are names on our arms for fun.
Writin rest in piece for the dead and gone.
That's just me, 
And I ain't the one to stunt,
But seems like I'm losing somebody every other month.
That's why I walk through the hood
Tryin' talk to the hood,
But some niggas is lost in the hood. 
And we blind to that fact,
That we actin' like they wanted us to act.
White man versus black.
Reason I ain't vote for my iraqs 'cause I love 'em.
They gonna want him hanged after that.
In god we trust,
What? (what?)
Money or the life of a soldier
Sent to die in the war in a fight,
That never should took place.

You can try to make bond, but I'ma stick to the script
Hit you with the pistol grip and make your L-dog flip
Youse a punk, youse a bitch, I'll say it to your face
Youse a punk youse a bitch that testified for the state

I couldn't agree with you more
Jealous hearted motherfucker
Never been able to fuck with me nigga, ever
Super solid from day one
Never put myself in a compromised position, I'm a chess player
And if I did I'd just shoot my way out

First born to my momma
I come from the place where you're promised
To die before your 21st
You'll be surprised what's underneath the earth
Dug dirt, I put bones there
All my enemies is gone now
I can't sleep through the cold sweats
Flashbacks, I'm a known threat
God fearing yet I'm evil though
I think deep, I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body?
Then you know why I took my gun and head-shot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
It's either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU!

Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
[?] is like ""fuck you!""
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'mma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

I live like I spit it
Raised by the war so my mentality is ""get it""
A life on the streets takes commitment
The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches
A real nigga played the game like it's business
A weak nigga facing time, go to snitching
Plotting on his whole team cause he ain't wanna listen
If it was all good just a week ago
Take your motherfucking charge, there's your key of dope
We all wanna eat, gotta feed folks
To get [?] on the streets, call the G code
That's what we live by, die for it
I got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have 5K1 [?] killers [??]
We gon bust that nigga, fuck that nigga!

Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long

Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

They jealous of me cause I shine bright
Grind strong plus my mind right
My gun loaded up in both clips
Jump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth
No shit, this is music you can drive-by
G's the only code we abide by
Blunt burning in the ashtray
Playing faggot games and now your ass chafe
Niggas wearing tight pants and high heels
Claiming another nigga's hood that is not real
I am still the hardest nigga being heard
Fuck he claiming he real when he ain't keep his word?
He ain't fooling me, my nigga, he is just a nerd
Nothing but a rap tune, he ain't seen a bird, word
I talk that shit that I can back, though
Cause that's in my boxing game, I'm in the back, hoe
Talk that big six but pack a double [?]

Can't make me believe it
You a nice girl, but I'm a hood nigga on some street shit
And yeah, you know my weakness
Sucker for some love type
I come from the slums girl, you come from a good life
I wonder what you see in me
I love weed and Hennessy
You barely doing happy hour, I ain't never seen you drink
And now that's leaving me to think, how I got so close to you? 
This was just a hit and split, that's what I supposed to do
One thing let up to the next, I'm addicted to your sex
You addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect
That's what I get I guess, I can't commit that's killing this
You gave me an ultimatum, I'm numb I ain't feeling shit
Must not know who she dealing with
Puddles on her pillow case, tears running, eyeline, lipstick smeared
Hey are you ok? 
You disobey, you pay for that
Well, the love is gone, and she ain't made it back, pray for that

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'

I'm just sayin', a relationship should be 100-100 not 50-50, right? 
Right
Oh what you gon' think about that? 
Yeah I'm gon' think about that
Look, you want me here or not? 

Think before you answer that, it's hard enough we breaking up
But after this no turning back, brought this on myself with her
Mistakes I'm forced to live with that, I'm knowing more mistakes to come
I'm human, that's my best excuse, in fact my only one
Tears fall, my kids call, 'this ain't me, it's his fault'
Oh shit no, we did this
A partnership with no room for forgiveness
I take the blame, take your aim
Shoot that shot, can't wait to claim
All of this, in Jesus name
Pray in church, they give you change
I feel your pain
Songs sung in the key of life, with no meaning right
Hopefully one day might come I'd see the light
Can't sleep at night
And I'm wondering who's fooling who? 
I'm sure you know who's fucking me, cause I know who's been fucking you
We used to be inseparable, never thought that that day would come
Where I'd take that shit so serious
And you get so good at playing dumb, you got away with one

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'

You had me I'll admit that, fell into the trap you set
Lookin' me in my eyes, lyin', killing me with that soaking wet
Wouldn't let me meet your connect
Scratching me all across my face
Says she loves the way it feels when I'm in it all the way
60 calls a day, wondering where the fuck I'm at
Wondering where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that
Now let's be honest, you got him with whom you made your promise
And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered, enjoying moments after
Plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives, are husbands reckless why? 
Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry? 
Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line
Better step aside, gotta tell me why? 
I was everything, you was all I had
Now this is change, and then this change is bad
Make a note of that

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'",Keep It Movin'
Scarface,"Sunday morning I'm off at church
Sinnin' throughout the week, hustlin' every day
Gettin' it as we speak, listen to preacher preach
Choir singing the song, auntie clapping her hands
Momma singing along, I'm impatient I wanna leave
Can't let my Momma see I ain't listening to The Word
Not like I don't believe, but I'm trippin', nobody perfect
To speak it wouldn't worth it for a person to be so Christlike
But I swear, I've heard him cursin'
Let him without no sins cast the first stone
But I am so not him so let me go on home
Get home and he will find his hat on
Who's family when this all went on?
Come on, let's see, some laughs, then we
Can do the same damn thing again next week
I love it when it happens like that
I smile because it's not all bad

You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way

Keep your head above water

Monday mornin' it's back to business
Cash, the motivation, cops steadily watchin'
Plottin' and waiting patient
Yeah I been thinkin' lately
Prayin' on even maybe
Probably best if I left it
The stress will drive you crazy if you let it
The penitentiary is where we headed
Designed for downfalls and some still don't get it
And yeah, I might have said it way back
And got sweated by the same ones admittin' it now
But no credit came to me
If you can see the things I see
Then you can point your fingers at the blame, not me
Ashamed how we can't stand one another
We hate the idea of a unified young brother so we suffer
But I adapt 'cause I'm a hustler
I still stay strapped with the muffler
I'm ten toes trapped in the struggle 'cause
I'm what the hood made, mothafucka what?

As solid these niggas come, real as they ever say
Money is not important, it's livin' it how you say
Picture back in the day, me moving a brick a week
Murdered you if I had to, nigga I'm from the streets
And out here were playing for keeps, speak and you getting froze
Neck gettin' wrapped in sheets, sneakers will be exposed
This bullet here for your soul
Bitches is just for sex, that said I could jack my dick
She don't deserve respect, I'm knowin' my niggas feel it
Nothin' is fabricated authentic as I can say it
The only way I play it, this is for Curtis Davis
Mothers of fallen soldiers, children of murdered fathers
Fathers out on the corners
Corners I'm standing on and I love 'em without a reason
Sealed-in, they either bleedin'
They made me, I'm never leavin' though the looks can look deceiving
Believe me y'all, it might sound sad
But trust me dog, it's not all bad

Step up to the plate, where your money at?
Bobby Brown on cake with a hundred packs
New editions, Lisa Lisa
We were secret lovers, had to get a beeper
My Atlantic star, not a Notre Dame
Not a student loan, tried to motivate
Continental, my Bentley, this shit should be illegal
Selassie eye in the ghost, thousand bales of that diesel
Lord, go toe to toe with any pussy boy
Fuck, one time for facin' all the Boobie boys
26 inch plates on a 68
Where I'm from a half a key'll set a nigga straight

Time sure flies, look how many years went by
My young niggas already need hair dye
Alcoholic faces, women bad as a mug
Gettin' fat as fuck
Fried food be addin' up, the system thrives off its victims
They ask how this economic collapse

Nietas on the east coast, shouts to Puerto Rico
Dominican Republic people, rep I
Brown and black, we must get it together

Scarface,"'Cause I ain't ever change on you motherfuckers
And OG's spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

These youngsters think that I'm so cool
They wanna learn the game from an old school
I give em strategies to sleep on
So when they put me in the grave they could keep on
Now first on your check list
Be your own man cos your friends ain't shit
They only come around when they need to
Use that home boy shit to deceive you
Remember you don't owe nobody, niggas
Niggas put the bite to the hand that feeds, that’s your body
And they forgetting how they got there
This is life, it's a game, but it's not fair
It's hard enough trynna get by
Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
And staying drunk on the regular
Talking dope talk on your cellular
But in this game that's a no-no
The streets ain't the only ones watching, taking photos
And life ain't bitches and money
This life's bout getting this money
Because that bitch is a problem
Can't live with and can't live without her
My advice to you is stay on your grind
Keep that bitch on her back and your faith on your mind, nigga

'Cause I ain't ever change on you motherfuckers
And OG's spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

And we don't talk to police
That's the number one rule on the streets
'Cause if you can't do the time, then you don't do the crime
Nigga keep the streets quiet
You don't upstrap unless you have to
Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
You gon' revenge somebody?
Dig two graves, just in case it's two bodies
And never bring a stick to a gunfight
One shot, one kill, you get one life
And shitting where you sleep ain't an option
People knowing where you sleep, that's a problem
You got to watch these niggas
They ain't your home boys, not these niggas
First chance you call sleep, they could murk you
So don't put squares in your circle
'Cause these streets don't love nobody
You gotta pay attention to the signs, Johnny
If you a weak nigga, don't try to play hard
Better keep your punk ass out the yard

'Cause I ain't ever change on you motherfuckers
And OG's spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

And don't get fronted, just avoid that
But if you have to, pay them boys back
'Cause niggas ain't playing, it's a drought
The border is closed, the cash running out
And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks
Every nigga in the way getting shook
You got to play the game by the book
I fuck around and your life getting took
And last but not least, when you make that money
Keep it low-pro, don't say shit, dummy
And don't say shit to your girlfriend
Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen
Take notes to the game I'm providing
Stop using momma names trynna hide shit
Nigga them feds ain't stupid
You ain't the only nigga trynna do this
Riding round the hood in a four-door
Flying spur ol' rims, trynna show off
You drawing too much attention
And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
But once you in it, it's hard to get out of
Grief will kill a nigga like a gun do
So when you get the chance to make a break for it, run fool",Exit Plan [BBY Exclusive] [*]
Scarface,"If I had to play God for a day
I would open up the gates let the world see my face
Remove all doubt from the ones without the faith
And put them on the path of the straight
A safe place, for the young to come outside they want to play
I let their mommas know that they ok
And when y'all pray, I'll respond so you can all see a sign
And answer every pray one at a time
If I'm God huh
All the stabbings all the war would come to cease
My whole entire hood would be at peace
No more beef
And you could sleep without the fears of being woke
By the sounds of sirens, screams of people being smoked
No more dope you don't need it
You'll be cured of all diseases
Your whole entire life would be deleted
Please forgive me I've been dreaming
And rudely interrupted by the demons
Laughed at the picture I was seeing on the ceiling

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face

Just imagine if the devil had a day
And God had took a break and walked away
Would you feel safe?
If everything you loved turned into hate
Will the dark angel's evil show you grace
Only to be eaten by a snake
One life one mistake
Be careful of the choices that you make
'Cause one day you'll be standing on your feet and then the next
You're underneath the sheet greeting death
I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest, stealing breath
Shortening my days even less
Lost souls never rest
A killer walks the streets seeking flesh
A adolescent hangs she depressed
A priest who confessed
A judged typing a nigga in a text
Your honor what the fuck did you expect
A father kills his son look at life it's a mess
Just imagine what would happen if the lord up and left

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face

When all that you believed in was a lie
Are you willing to accept it when you find out
Or try to reason with yourself that's what it is when it's not
And all the whole while it's been a plot
To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
That they keep us in the dark know they act
We react all surprised and not realize that
This shit a trap
Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasn't that
The church and these politics they all full of crap
It's a shame but that's how were blaming it's for the scratch
So I don't knock I'm tryna to put a black card in my wallet
But some dollars in my pocket ain't the topic
Y'all need to stop it
This is just crazy these little babies ticking time bombs
Walking around the lunchroom pulling guns
If momma and daddy took the time to raise their son
Then the sister wouldn't be the mom before she twenty-one huh

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has face",God

Scarlet Rivera,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Scarlet Rivera,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear [With On-Screen Lyrics][Multimedia Track]
Scarlett Johansson,"I have come 500 miles
Just to see a halo
Come from St. Petersburg
Scarlett and me
Well I open my eyes
I was blind as can be
When you give a man luck
He must fall in the sea
And she wants you
To steal and get caught
For she loves you
For all that you are not

[Chorus]
When you're
Falling down, falling down
When you're falling down
Falling down, falling down

You forget all the roses
Don't come around on Sunday
She's not gonna choose you
For standing so tall
Go on and take a swig
Of that poison and like it
And don't ask
For silverware
Don't ask for nothing
Go on and put your ear
To the ground
You know you will be
Hearing that sound

[Chorus]
Falling down
You're falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down
When you're falling down
Falling down, falling down

Go on down and see
That wrecking ball
Come swinging on along
Everyone knew
That hotel was a goner
They broke all the windows
They took all the door knobs
And they hauled it away
In a couple of days
Now someone yell timber
And take off your hat
It's a lot smaller down
Here on the ground

[Chorus]
You're falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down

Scarlett Johansson,"There's a crooked street
In Houston town
It's a well born path
I've traveled down
Now there's ruin in my name
I wish I never got off the train
I wished I'd listened
To the words you said

Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
You'll be lost and never found
You can never turn around
Don't go down to Fannin Street

Once I held you in my arms
I was sure
But I took that silent stare
Through the guilded door
The desire to have much more
All the glitter and the roar
I know this is where
The sidewalk ends

Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
You'll be lost and never found
You can never turn around
Don't go down to Fannin Street

When I was young
I thought only of getting out
I said goodbye to my street
Goodbye to my house
Give a man gin, give a man cards
Give an inch he takes a yard
And I rue the day
That I stepped off this train

Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street

I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't wanna grow up

Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb
On Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get me a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float a broom

How we've fallen asleep on the bathroom floor
Wasn't always pretty, on the white tiles
Cold as the sound as your daddies house

Smoke out the window flows from your daddies house
You're enlightening
Small hands of a women, with an animal barn

Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S.P.; the only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

Matter fact I, smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did; add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the, M-5 pedal, when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

I'mma smoke 'til my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious, and I, know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta, ride for a livin'
With my, real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)

But lately you've been acting so uncertain and displeased
Constantly expecting me to honor and obey this
Lifetime of dealing with the women that you play, stop it

And some are better then others
While others see others as monstrosities
Your dream is my nightmare
How did you figure you'd be the boss of me
Trying to make me move at the velocity that you choose
Order me to move expeditionary an hour freeze, froze
Now I've never been the one to be like these hoes
But these hoes expecting to brown nose
Not all women just those who suppose that the world revolves around them
And until they wake up I will forever clown them
If you can't compromise I can't corroborate
If you spit lies I won't walk away
Never was one to operate like that
I'm as stubborn as you are bitchey
You can't get through my abuse me up until I'm all gone
Then ditch me and glide to the next
But I see what you mistook me for
See how you figured you could break me into your advantage
And order me to the door until it's outworn then get torn to shreds
Keep your seductive jargon, I can't hear you, how dare you
Chuckling to myself will I wait by through my rearview
Your such a shadow girl
Such a shadow girl, such a shadow girl
Such a shadow girl, such a shadow girl

While he was speaking I kept thinking all prejudges story cause you bore me

Open condoms scattered on your dresser

I can smell the silencing from what your calling poetry
Your eyes are manly focused on anatomy
Instead of me experiencing several different immature Peter pan
Never growing up you'll be a free man

CHORUS

I used to know this girl as fly as Saturdays
And every time she smiled my way like honey to me
I would hold my heart as well as my hopes back
For fear of how she would have reacted
If I was to express how I was attracted
To her spectacular bosoms and vacular(?) amenities
And every time I would see her ever-so-beautiful figure walking the earth
It would just confuse me
Making me woozy
But I kept my mouth shut
I figured putting myself in such a position of vulnerability
Would just give her the power to either lose me or abuse me
So in the dark I stood
Skylarking I would ponder on what if
But the what-ifs would have been solved
If I wasn't so chicken-shit to get involved
In these matters of the heart
But that's all in the past and
She's gone leaving me gasping while asking
I wonder if I'll ever have another chance
Wonder if I'll have another dance
A change in my circumstance
To romance from wishful thinking

It was a day like this when we met in 1993
She came up to me whispering something like sunshine
While I was in line
At the festival which couldn't compare
To the festivities of her beauty
I moved our conversation from
Name into hobby
Hobby into visions
Visions to envisioning the two of us meeting up again
If she would just pick the time and place
The way our eyes embraced
Sublime troubles bits and based in an ideal song
I looked into her face and saw my future was less than perfect placement
Our worries were kept in the basement
Either that or the attic
There would be no static
In our living room
My mind mapped out the blueprints
Consuming each other's thoughts in the dining room
Romance would be placed in the bedroom
Illuminated with joy and perfume
Tribulations would be hung in the kid's room
Furnished with laughter after our lives were situated
And financially elevated
Our house would be decorated in colours and feelings I've only seen in
dreams
But was never able to describe
I felt all of this
But didn't know how to subscribe
To her interests
You know how first impressions are
Catalogues that come with no index, appendix, or bibliographies
Just a table of contents for us to guess at
Choose a chapter and hopefully it works for you
We agreed that our time shared was pleasurable
And that we should rendez-vous
I attached the idea of exchanging numbers
So again I could see her
She smiled, sunbeam so warm
I was blinded by her glare
Meanwhile mesmerized by the magnificent mana she seemed to bear
Then said she would be back at the festival tomorrow
And to meet right here
(Like, right here in this particular spot?)

CHORUS

Now I had expected a no-show
Kept on checking the time on my wrist-match
Then felt a elbow nudge me from the back
When I turned around and she was top-notch
Smelling like butterscoth
When trying to speak
I was too shocked
All blocked up in my voice-box
I just stood there and smiled
She took my hand, manoeuvred me through the crowd
I hung on like a child
That's a security blanket for dear life
We rounded the bin where
She took me into her booth
She was a vendor, visual artist, a poet
Who loved to work with the youth
Said what attracted her to me was my aura
Seemed to bear truthfulness
In a world full of filthiness
And hearts swallowed up into emptiness
Not in the exact words but I said the same
We sat there all day in the shade talking
Boredom never came
I told her about my music
I said I wanted to use it to touch
Use it to travel around the world sharing my views on such and such
And finally to clutch a point in time where I could say that I was happy
Own a business, have a wife and some children to call me pappy
Nodding her head she smirked and said she knew our ideas would work and
again
Not in the exact words but I said the same
Evening quickly arrived and I had to go
It was the last day of the festival
Smiling she said she was glad I came
A pen was pulled
I supplied the paper
Numbers were exchanged
We both stood up and showed love in the form of a hug
And went our separate ways
I remember them vividly in my memory
Those yesterdays

CHORUS

She held delightful conversations over the phone
With a mouthful of words that
When were said made you feel like you were
Worth something more than just flesh and bone
Taking up space and time
Our discussions raced the mind
Forever building, healing, exchanging ideas
Drilling to the core of what we were here for
How to communicate with ancestors and
Why we as people deserved more
From equal rights, revolutionary fights to spiritual insight
She even shot over to the house and gave me a cooking lesson one night
It was nothing fancy
Rice and beans seasoned with a side order of plantainels
The table was lit with candles
We sat juxtaposed and stood out the windows
To gaze at the stars
I said let's make a wish on that reddish one
She was like ""Fool, that's Mars!""
Then mapped out all the celestial bodies from the little dipper up to the
quasars
And finally picked one
We closed our eyes and made a wish
But I substituted my wish for hope
And it still wasn't enough to anchor us down
You see hope holds just a little bit more weight than a wish
And my wish turned hope then swish
And my time was too short on the rebound
The clock countdown was to my disadvantage
And I'm not the type to come with full-court pressure
So my game's ?
In her eyes I was tucked away and forgotten
And all my plottin' to win this girl
Too small to be measured
And so now all I have to treasure is my wishful thinking",Wishful Thinking

I've got patent leather shoes and I never pay my booze
And I don't sing the blues or take a wife

An open mind and sense of humour is our only hope
I want to say just one more thing before I move along
I betcha really glad we're near the end on the song

I leave you now,take a bow

That the nightmare isn't a s bad as it seems

You try your best to hide yourself beneath your turned up collar
And a plastic bag is all you've got to show
And your books inside your shopping cart
Is probably the best education you're ever gonna know (Hmm)

Better grab it 'cause the signal's turnin' green
And while you're at it put the jug behind the picket fence

That the look inside your eye is very strange
Ain't nothing left to hide

Doesn't care what you say what you do
If you're young or you're grey.
Hey you!
You can take it from me.
I was talking that talk 'til I was 43.
I was walking in a web that was to thick
To shed, and it was only by degrees that I
Was brought to my knees.
Justification was my mode of operation,
Looking good number one on my list.
Trapped in a circle of a merry-go-round,
I couldn't get up getting down.

I didn't know that I was driven by delusion to the
Bone.

Your fault and I know it seems bleak,
And you're only in this u-turn 'til you meet defeat.

Hey You!
You can take it from me, there's more going down
Than you and I can ever see.
There's a tale being told and the water's all
Around, there's a brand new day. Get the heck out of
Your way.

I never let you tell me that I wanted to hear,
When you said it like it was, it never got to
My ears.

Kept playing those games with a saturated brain.

I had to leave home and abandon a kid.

Where neither of us had the need to tell each other lies

We can change with the seasons, no matter what the weather
Where we could be in harmony, together every day

Both of us together through the sad and the good
Totally devoted as lovers and friends
And suddenly we realize that love never ends

Said, 'Won't you come and be my lover?'

Done kicked me off the team
For wearing hi-heel sneakers

Oh, I know just what I'm thinking and maybe you'll finally see

Oh, you are dismissed

Hell waren die Tage
Und friedlich die Nacht,
Bevor dieser Krieg
Uns die Not hat gebracht.

Besiegt word' der Herr,
Dem wir Treue geschworen
Wir haben teils Leben,
Teils Freiheit verloren.
Als Rechtloser diente ich,
Erlitt Höllenqual
Die heimliche Flucht war die einzige Wahl.

Und ich laufe und bin frei.

Denn ich bin frei
Von den Schatten dieser Welt,
Endlich frei
Von der Fessel, die mich hält
Und ich spür die große Kraft
Wenn der neue Tag erwacht...

Nun leb ich als Schatten,
Als Lufthauch I'm Nichts.
Mein Heim sind die Wälder,
Fernab jeden Lichts.
So ziehe ich weiter,
Einsam Tag für Tag
Zu sehen was das Schicksal
Mir bringen mag.

Bis Frieden ich find,
So laufe ich weiter,
Suche ich nach jenem Ort,
Wo ich verweil.

Von der Fessel, die mich hält

No sign of tears to fall.
As long as you will call miles and miles.
I search where love can grow, 
And watch where bitter flow
I am not afraid to know miles and miles ...

Scholomance,"I will hand you your heart
Which I will so gracelessly rip from your heaving chest.
I pondered in candlelit lethargy. I grieved as the wax melted,
Knowing
""Tomorrow I must hurt you, who I hold dear
As an ancient myth held true to its people.
You, who I knew but a moment. But what a moment!
As though touching the darkening hue of the night sky
And forsaken stars for the first time.
Together and alone,
We came to swim in each other's minds.
Independent, still one.
Now I must be rid of you.
Forever is a choice made by both.
Father Time is dreaming of fog rising and moonsets.
These we cannot see again through a reflective cyclopean gaze.
Nothing good.
For me
Nothing is good. But for you?
One day there will be no one at all
With whom to talk, speak or boast.
By no fault, with no blame, but with one hundred points of pain.
Don't forget. Cannot forget. Nothing was good.
No future. Smile politely at the blind.""
Have I known hate? Indifference in a skincloak of anger
Or Love in purity. Goddess, the torment! The weak talk of strength.
The strong speak with sympathy. The wise thus said nothing.
For none know the real truth the strong need and the wise know it.
When stabbed endless times all vessels are cut
And the heart will lumber with Death.
The mind becomes stricken with sickly pallor
And will usher in Hate.
Will the blade sayeth,
""Please, I wish not to dive into your flesh!""
When all are gone?
Infinite dirge, a life in Inferno's anguish.
My tears ever stream
And will they run separately from my blood?
Will it be this and Now?",End

With the big big heart
Only one thing on our minds
Staying up late
Working hard all night
It happens all the time

Uh Oh Uh Oh Oh Ohhhh

I've always had a one track night
That never lets things go
'Cause weeks are better flying
We've been waiting and you know
Tell me you want too
Live life like I do

You have to fight for
What you believe in
You have to wait for
The dream go and get it now
You have to fix things up
Where you left off
And don't look back

20 dollar drive from the NYC
We're always breaking down
Sleeping on the bus
Couldn't get the heat
So we're freezing all night long

We do what we have to
I'm still making up
What I lost that job
Wasting all my time
Living with the boys
On the road all year
I'll always say that's fine

My wallet's getting light
So I'll just sleep on my friends floor
My cars been sold for about three months
I couldn't ask for more
So tell me you want to
Live life like I do

You have to fight for
What you believe in
You have to wait for
The dream go and get it now
You have to fix things up
Where you left off
And don't look back

I still believe in living my chance
I know they could never take that
This is a song for all our bad luck
Maybe you'll never come back

Only one thing on our minds

Working hard all night

School Boy Humor,"To be honest I've been having trouble
Dealing with myself 
When I make the same mistakes
Over and over again
Honestly it sickens me
To think this might be who I am when I die
I need some advice

Boy you know jealousy is a killer
If that's the case then I'm ready to die
I said oh you don't mean that
You'll lose her for life
And girl you know that he is a liar
He's a cheating heartbreaker always leaving you crying
Oh you don't mean that
You'll lose him for Life

She's dressed to kill so you better stop staring
She's sitting alone in her hotel room
To go outside is to take a chance
Take a chance she might end up regretting
And the TV's on and the radio is blaring
Good looks are what you need to have
To make it somewhere in this world
To lead a life you won't end up regretting

It's sad to think that her self worth
Is based on opinions that others had about her
She's the perfect picture of misdirection
She won't look me in the eye cause she hates her reflection

Boy you know that she isn't like you she's a little insecure 
And she's packing an attitude
Boy you know that she gets a little upset
She ends up running to her room cause she knows she can't handle it
Disappointed you, retreat.
But I wish you could see all the things you did to me.

She's dressed to kill so you better stop staring
She's sitting alone in her hotel room
To go outside is to take a chance
Take a chance she might end up regretting
And the TV's on and the radio is blaring
Good looks are what you need to have
To make it somewhere in this world
To lead a life you won't end up regretting

Her bags are packed and she's ready to go
But she turns around before she gets to the door
And she tells herself
That she won't cry
She turns to him
She puts her hand on his face and
She gives a little smile as she turns and walks away and says
All we are, is what we intend to be

She's dressed to kill so you better stop staring

Turn me on but don't you forget.
I'll only sing your favorite lines,
Enough to keep you here satisfied.

Your words are cold and my thoughts are alone...
I'm cutting to the chase and I want you to know.
Time does not always make things better.
Maybe if she saw my name upon the silver screen,
On the tv, the sterio, the magazines.
She can make a smile that screams she wants me.

I may be a liar, I swear your my desire.
Don't you dare hang up the phone.

Baby you know that I'm priceless.

Your hands are hot.
What you touch gets you spired
I'm putting out the flames
In the sweat we perspire.
Weeks ago on your cell I'm screaming.
On those words that you say
When you know your alone.
I'm a secret from your past
Your just begging to let go.
And I know you won't find anyone better.

[Chorus]
Twelve days ain't enough
For us to fall in love
I'm dreaming of you day and night
Tell me baby what we didn't do right
'Cause we were kissing under the mistletoe (oh)
But lonely when we had to go
Baby twelve days, (twelve days), twelve days
Ain't enough, ain't enough to fall in love

On the first day of Christmas
I was by myself, it was only me
On the second day of Christmas
I met you downtown by the Christmas tree
On the third and fourth day of Christmas
You were on my mind
By day six I gotta admit

I wanted to give us a try (oh right)

On the seventh day of Christmas boy

We were both skating on ice

You would soon be gone.",Deck the Halls

Not a single one with him
Tell me how am I
Supposed to have fun with him

Once I was a good girl
Now I've gone bad

In the middle of the class

Fighting back the smile
When she ave me that slip
Money in the bank
That I'll need on my trip- trip-trip

When mom and dad find out their gonna flip
Don't they know I just can't leave him alone

Du-rags and flatlines, drive-by's at bedtime
Get down, I earn mine, so one loss they can't sign
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan

Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school, this life gon' catch up soon

Livin' out his backpack every night needin' a new place to sleep

Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished

Load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time steppin' in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today

Thinkin' of some bullshit to tell him, like
""It'll be okay. You'll be straight, it'll be aight""
Well, fuck that shit, whatever you need, yo, I got it! 
Whether it's money or some weed or puttin' in work, fuck it, then I'm ridin'! 
You know wassup, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved that I'd be a fuckin' fool
To be livin' by the street rules
Fuck police tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith, stay strong brah, uh
Remain' solid brah
Keep playin' ball cause it's the only way up out it brah

On your record in a stolen expedition, play it safe
As the record spinnin' you was hearin' angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, comin' from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had moved you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read again
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't (blessed my nigga)

Take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet

Had strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the pot
Got fiends at the do' so I turned that to a rock

I'm a drug dealin' nigga, cause them grades ain't get me paid
My agenda for today is to make bread or get laid
See my daughter need some shoes and my mom work overtime
So I'm standin' by that stop sign with nickels and them dimes
Keep that work, got that Oxy, need that kilo, call that papi
Know my steelo, shrimp with sake, sold that hero'n, look like toffee
Keep my nina, just might off him, no them boys on Figg don't play
Most my life on 51st, went to school on 52nd
Used to fight on 49th, Grandma said be home by night
But her old ass sixty something, so three hours late aiight
Still I love her, R.I.P., when she died, I took her place
And became a fucking G, moved my crack across the street

Just a year after Pac died we all bump Suga Free
Didn't know what he was sayin' til them years done jumped to three
Learned the game, slangin' hoes and every car door need a key
Charge them smokers day through night, sellin' pies who need a slice
Life is craps so shoot the dice, get the cheese but cut the mice
Enemies be left to right, we don't call our shit the trap
Bitch we call our shit the set, unless we OD with Reynold's Wrap
After crack it’s Oxy next, but thank God the yay was yay
Off the yee like it’s the bay, rock a chain I’m Kunta K
Out in Texas what’s the word, keep them packs and that’s for sure
Slang to him and slang to her, ask a fiend they will concur

Onion in the pocket like a booty on a midget
Diamond on my rollie, teach a nigga how to fridge it

Where them niggas say ''show you what it be like, nigga''

Lord please forgive me for all my sins
Yeah, nigga wake up to the same shit everyday, homie
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
No rules, right

Washing my sins off in hell's water
Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em
Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

Uh, four corners, cat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch
High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more
Trapping trying to make it out this obstacle
Life on the edge, hell a block away
Pretty Snow White turned eight today
Selling that base, no Dr. Dre
Uh, guess who in the building?
Bucket hat with a strap like the pilgrim uh
Kneeling down with some questions to address like
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
The 10 commandments, I can mark five checks
But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats
Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex
Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests from the cop raid
All can relate, from the streets to the wall from niggas to compadres
When the sun go down, I'm predictin' a heatwave, forecast your whole body
Heat on, room full of homi's, I just pray that the Lord got me

Uh but if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

Aim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance
Kill mine, kill yours, make it even
Soul need saving, Mr. Preacher
I know I only come around when it's Easter
Funerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time
When I'm in jail or when my card declined
Uh, will you answer me?
Take me out of Hell and make plans for me?
Misery loves company, ain't a surprise
It was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive
But we would never make it out alive
Shit we living to die, oxymoron
Hope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive
Running through the ally, hope the bullet don't collide
Car window shattered, glass on my right side
Dogs bark in the backyard, rootin' for me
Out of shape belly, courtesy of 40
Spoiled only child, baby boy Jody
Same jacket on from back in the day
Praying that the Lord come and take me away

Uh but if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances
Yeah, money is the issue, I diss you
It's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol
'Cause I'm a suit case king
Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin
No wage bet, we stay winning, play it again, yo
Put the bone in your jaw, now say it again
Round knife, fork, under the tents, coming to rents

Hope no cops arresting, girl, I told you them narcs be pressing
Better act you a pedestrian and don't mention my name
My pimping is game, cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain
Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling
On 51st and Figg, grew up about ten minutes from the real Ricky
Where the shoelaces is orange with H hats like we from Houston
Condoms in hoes' purses with baby wipes for they coochie
You's a ho that's selling booty, no need to be acting bougie
Bitch, I give your ass a noogie and a chicken nugget

And don't let your Shark Week mouth override your Green Goldfish ass
So for every ho you clown, I'mma crown two
And anything good hurts and I cried
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my mothafuckin' face
Or I choose to not do this around you
See ho you like a brain aneurysm
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom
Yeah, P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play
And the hard head that make a soft ass played out
Will forgive and forget yesterday
Now get 'em, Q, a pimp on foot, go to sleep, call us, wake up to a Cadillac
Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid
So you know what? Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world
P, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing
But Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too
Cause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane
Pimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid
Red to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier
To put a watermelon through the eye of a needle

ScHoolboy Q,"I got that work, fuck Labor Day, just bought a gun
Fuck punching in, throwing rocks, no hopscotch
Bet my 9 milli hit the right spot
Bang, last night it was a dream
This morning a fantasy
Back when the only fan I had was a fiend
Meet me by the Acura cause the cops like
To get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea
But it's cool I've been catching on to they formula
See I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'
Then rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo
The bad guy never once been a hoes hero
He get zero, I said nada
Bitch pass the cama (Uh, yeah)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga? (I'm a product of a real nigga)
La-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)
Fuck with one of my real niggas
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga (My whole life I've been a real nigga)

How'd it feel to be a real nigga?

I done jumped off my ass
Hit the lick and barely pass but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him

But, every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But, click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But, meet Glock clock familia (Boom)

Find a nigga realer than me, my socks stink
Eat so much pussy that my mustache pink
Strapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt
Gangsta lean help, hoodie on backwards with the eyes cut out
My hate felt, my .45 elder, poetry's deep
I never fail ya, Schoolboy bust flame
Orange-yellow, higher than Margiela's
Since a young nigga I admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal
From his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout
Think about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday he still get a hit
Whether jacking radio's or sucking dick
Sell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips
'Cause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much
To get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work
Unless we rewind and answer my church
Times getting harder than my dick on a growth spurt
Around the same time all you niggas was on purp
My sober ass was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck freeze
Give me the keys, extra Frito's, chili and cheese
Thew some Baby Lucas in his eyes before I leave
The cops'll never get the leak, grandma taught me well
And my uncle gun was the accessories, 211 sipping plus a robbery
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome

I done jumped off my ass
Hit the lick and barely pass but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning

But, every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But, click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But, meet Glock clock familia (Boom)

Grandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more
She always got me things that we couldn't afford
The new J's and Tommy Hill in my drawers
Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war
We wasn't thinking of getting money then
Nor did I wonder why my uncle done sold his Benz
'Cause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down
I also notice moms be locking doors when he around
But anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us
My bike is missing, grandma light a hotter chick every month
My uncle's nuts, he used to give me Whisky to piss in cups
Knocking on the door telling me to hurry up, he in a rush
I gave it to him then got my ass whipped for doing it
Moms used to tell me like ""Nigga, know who you dealing with""
Them was the good days 'til I was raised the older ways
Rat-Tone my niggas' brother showed me my first K
I was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back, he called us over like ""Hey""
Yak, yak, yak, yak! We like ""Damn, nigga""
Then again, yak, yak! We like ""Damn, nigga""
Hearing him say 'cause turned us to a fan, nigga
Later on he got locked so know we're taking his fades
Continue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page
Gangbanging was a ritual and grandma would help
She should've never left her gun on the shelf
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome

Pull me out the car to give me black thought
But fuck it, this shit's all kinda player
This shit my mama flavor
This that raised by your granny, pistols and Now & Laters
Your pops was way too busy, missin' your mom's labor
Grew up just like your daddy
To baggin' baggies in alleys
To where the streets is your family
Gettin' blurred by the same cop
Go to jail for a year and come home
Two of your niggas dropped
You know how that feelin' feel
What to feel when it's gettin' real
More bullets to go around
Come jump in this water, nigga
You still with your mama livin'
30 with no ambition
Your kid got no pot to piss in
You sayin' some nigga fake
You're selfish and sad, nigga
You're lame
And go
You hatin' on another man's success
Because the nigga blessed and wouldn't let you finesse
You got the game all twisted
You're leechin' worse than these ladies
Your inner nigga ain't aging
Reason the hood stay shady

I really sold pills
Smokin' weed for my ills
Breakin' weed in my whip
Just got an ounce on a bitch
Still our motive be commas
And still my life isn't promised
Still nervous as drivers
You see them lights get behind us
They pull me out for my priors
Won't let me freeze 'fore they fire
You say that footage a liar
They want my flow in the dryer
I'm at the top aimin' higher
My lawyers stay on retainer
When white folks point the finger
Place my neck on that hanger
Shit, no wonder we riot
Niggas still killin' niggas
Child support killin' niggas
Cops enslavin' us niggas
Little girls killin' mothers
They treat their kid like a brotha
Fathers stuck with them lifers
Kept it real with his niggas
But left his kid for the sucks
Shit no wonder we bang
Damn shame, mane, some things will never change

Schoolly D,"It was Saturday night and I'm feelin kinda sporty
Went to a bar and caught me a 40
Got kinda a high and a...kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came dressed, she said, ""Who the hell?""
Wait momma, wait, it's me ya little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
""I know who you are, but who the hell is that?""
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know, she got into the car
I musta picked her up when I left the bar
Ya know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, ""Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I want to be your lover
Just one thing:  I forgot to buy a rubber""
Wait a little while then we snuk upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in with a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please!
Put back your gun, put down your brew
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, ""Ya come a little closer and ya will get shot,
I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock.""

Oh yeah, them wild Saturday Nights

It was Saturday Night and I was feelin kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man who did I see?
But the super bad bitch lookin back at me
I said, ""Fly lady man, you got a big butt""
Bitch turned around, all she said was, ""What?""
I said, ""My name is Schoolly baby, I'm down with the Shores""
Before I knew it up came my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Sayin, ""Yo Schoolly Schooll, what time is it?""
Looked a little closer and I knew it was gag
What I thought was a girl was nothin but a fag


Everybody rappin but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rappin to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke
The cow got high and the boy got by
Just don't come in my face and ask me why

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah it's that cheeba cheeba makin 'em feel like that
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need

Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Smokin a J and scratchin' the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, ""Yo, what's up with that, bitch?""
But then down the road came Mary and her lambs
Smokin' a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They were 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Let me tell ya a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucka MCed, tried to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man tryin to stick up a bar
The judge said, ""Boy, what was on your mind?""
He said, ""I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine.""
The judge said, ""Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doin shit for the next ten years.""

Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah, it's that Cheeba Cheeba

Schon seit Anbeginn der Zeit
Menschen suchen das Vergessen
In deiner weiten Einsamkeit

Du hast den Goldrausch überstanden 
Der Ölboom hat dich aufgewühlt
Gletscher und Vulkane beben 
Sofern du dich danach fühlst

Du bist da wo Meere stranden
Das ist ziemlich weit von hier
Wildnis am Rand der Welt
Welcome to the last Frontier

Ein Aleut auf einem Fahrrad
Ein Eskimo grüßt einen Wal
Ein Geograph weint für Aurora

So wie ich und das war ’85
Du feierst den Bestand ihrer Ideen
In einem Clubstrand-Eiscafe

Und in den Kugeln ist Hass drin, früher wie heute
Und die Kurtaxe von Morgen
Zahlen mit Sicherheit die gleichen Leute

Das sind wir hochschwanger und frisch verschwägert

Und glotzen
Glasierte Straßenzüge
Verwachsen

Und dann alle Goldrapper mit meiner Uzi

Ich brauch’s nicht, ich will nur das ihr mittrauert

Hau auf der Straße Hobbyboxer zu Mädels
Putz' meine Zähne mit Johnny Walker-Blue Label
Nehm' von jedem Gras- und Pieceraucher sein Geld

Vor Polizei tanzend mit Karabiner
Mache ich Breakdance auf drei Kilo Santa Maria

Schwesta Ewa,"Du Artist, du, und du machst auf Liebe mit mir
Du Schauspieler, und ich hab dir alles geglaubt

War nicht nur deine Schwesta Ewa, eova
Ich bin eh wach, es fließt voller Tränen ein Bach
Und du bist meine Hand am Halten
Doch willst nicht um meine Hand anhalten
Hängst im Funpark, mit den anderen Alten
Czesc, denkst weil ich Prosti war
Ist mein Herz kalt wie Frosta
Und für dich nicht kostbar
Du hörst auf so viele Jungs
Schämst dich, das du mich liebst
Lan, du hast mich nicht verdient, ich mach Dua für uns
Wenn sogar Gott verzeiht, wer bist du
Das du meine Vergangenheit in deinem Kopf verteilst
Hoffentlich weißt du was du verpasst
Heute kriegst du Ficker von der Ex-Kahba aus Knast

Du liebst mich nicht, weil du zu feige bist
Die Meinung anderer dir wichtiger als deine ist
Oh, du liebst mich nicht, also scheiß auf dich
Eine zweite Chance für uns, nein, die gibt es nicht

Du liebst mich nicht, weil du zu feige bist
Die Meinung anderer dir wichtiger als deine ist
Oh, du liebst mich nicht, jetzt verbiegst du dich
Ich glaub, du weißt nicht einmal mehr was Liebe ist

Ein Blick in die Augen der Schwesta verrät die Wahrheit nicht
Lächel für die Welt, tu so, als wenn gar nichts ist, doch die Fassade bricht
Aus Stolz ertrage ich diesen Schmerz ob bei Mond- oder Tageslicht
Kurwa, mich verfolgt das Milieu wie die Rolle des Obelix Gerard Depardieu
Du küsst mein Mund aber nicht mein Herz
Was bin ich dir Wert, wenn du dich entfernst, ah
Esse seit Tagen nichts und frage mich
Kühlschrank voll, doch mein Magen nicht
Du checkst die Lage nicht, denn bei der Kahba steck Herz
Das Rotlichtviertel belastet mich sehr

Du liebst mich nicht, weil du zu feige bist
Die Meinung anderer dir wichtiger als deine ist
Oh, du liebst mich nicht, also scheiß auf dich
Eine zweite Chance für uns, nein, die gibt es nicht

Du liebst mich nicht, weil du zu feige bist
Die Meinung anderer dir wichtiger als deine ist
Oh, du liebst mich nicht, jetzt verbiegst du dich
Ich glaub, du weißt nicht einmal mehr was Liebe ist

Du rufst mich täglich an, doch ich geh nicht ran
Du fickst mein Kopf und schreibst mir, ich sei kein Ehrenmann
Ob ich noch mit dir leben kann, ehrlich, ich weiß es nicht
Die Jungs sagen, ich verliere deinetwegen mein Gesicht
Doch ich mach reinen Tisch, Ewa, ich wollt Danke sagen
Du warst die Medizin für mich an all den kranken Tagen
Doch du weißt selber, dass die Straße Ohren hat
Sie fragen mich, was ich bei einer Frau wie dir verloren hab
Und ich muss dir gestehen, dafür bin ich nicht stark genug
Weißt du noch, das Rotlicht und dein Panikbuch
Mir war das egal, ich hab's mit dir immer nur ernst gemeint
Es ist ne schwere Zeit, doch ich will mit dir ehrlich sein
Sie sagen, Fard, lass von ihr lieber die Hände weg
Heute ist sie noch bei dir und morgen in nem fremden Bett
Mein Kopf ist so gefickt und ich vermisse dich
Leb wohl, Ewa
Ich liebe dich

Kurwa, läuft, keine Zeit mehr für Hass
Jede meiner Chicks hat heute fünf Scheine gemacht
Also ab auf die Zeil, Shopping vom feinsten
Läufer machen Rekordumsatz mit Weißem
Zudem hat die Single die Mio geknackt
Klicks Klicks, die mir Para bring'n in einer Nacht
Keine Schlägerei, FFM glänzt jetzt
Manolo Blahnik, wenn ich mich in den Benz setz
Keiner schiebt Depri, Junkies in der Taunus
Setzen Spritze aus und verzichten auf Braunes
Es scheint die Sonne über meiner Stadt
Kriminalität sinkt über Nacht
Heut musst ich mein Elektroschocker nicht gebrauchen
Ein guter Tag, gar nix könnt besser laufen

Ein guter Tag, es ist der beste seit X Jahr'n
Wo picos statt ziehen BMX fahr'n
Ein guter Tag, der beste denn je
An dem sich um das Rotlicht kein Blaulicht mehr dreht

An dem sich um das Rotlicht kein Blaulicht mehr dreht

Das Leben ist zwar nicht grade fair
Doch grade jetzt scheint es Lichtjahre her
Lange hieß es für mich immer nur: Wie? Jetzt bin ich grade wer?
Und ich hätt es nie erzielt, wenn ich nicht grade wär
Yo, Riesenfeeling heut morgen, schon als noch viele schliefen
Wurd zwar wach durch dieses Piepen aber easy peasen
Für heute gibt es wieder Frieden in den Kriegsgebieten
Alle verschieden, Krisen geh'n Musik genießen
Seh alte Leute mit ihren Lieben auf Liegewiesen
Wie sie ziehen und dann liegend fliegen
Vitalisiert vom Vitamindrink, Energie ist fließend
Sogar die Zivis sind heut friedlich, laufen weiter, auch wenn sie es riechen
Heute kann meine Laune keiner von ihn' vermiesen
Fühlt sich gut an, der Familie Perspektiven bieten
Heute ist das Glück kein Buch mit sieben Siegeln
Steht hier wie geschrieben, Schwesta, dekodier es ihnen

Ein guter Tag, es ist der beste seit X Jahr'n
Wo picos statt ziehen BMX fahr'n
Ein guter Tag, der beste denn je
An dem sich um das Rotlicht kein Blaulicht mehr dreht

Ein guter Tag, es ist der beste seit X Jahr'n
Wo picos statt ziehen BMX fahr'n
Ein guter Tag, der beste denn je
An dem sich um das Rotlicht kein Blaulicht mehr dreht

Hör mir zu, als wär die Strophe nur für dich
Alles Negative gibt dir eine positive Sicht
Mach nicht so 'n komisches Gesicht, heute ist ein guter Tag
Sei einfach froh, dass es dich gibt, was hat Ice Cube gesagt?
Heute ist ein guter Tag, keine Idioten im Visier
Muss mein Messer nicht benutzen, denn das Brot ist schon geschmiert
Keine Lügen, keine Kritik, keine Lästerei'n
Heute bleiben wir clean, denn wir sind noch von gestern high
Mit 'nem Kater durch die Straßen und 'nem ?
Das heutige Datum eingraviert in meinem Zippo
Mein Handy hat noch Akku und vollen Empfang
Ich sag zu Roxanne, mach das rote Licht nie wieder an

Und nun da Schwesta nicht im Laufhaus sitzt
Haten Freier im Netz, Schnauze, pic!
Üff, gedacht war dieser Part
Für meine Nutten und Bratkos, die kacken im Knast
Zu viele Namen, um sie hier aufzuzählen

Brazzers Abos für die Bratans, Zwillen für den Anwalt
Frische iPhones und Dildos für die Kahbas

Erst versucht du jahrelang einen richtigen Baba zu klären
Und dann schaffst du's
Bist endlich mit einem richtigen Pezo zusammen
Kosten tragen, damit die Felgen glänzen
Und dann wo du merkst, dass es doch nichts für dich ist
Denkst du, dass der einzige Ausweg für dich 
Die Eins-Eins-Null ist du verfluchte Fotze?

Schwesta dies, Schwesta das, Schwesta Ewa ist da
Rotlicht, Para, bevor ich Rapper war
Vom Rotlicht zum Blauchlicht, vom Blaulicht zu Scheinwerfern
Früher Lapdance, damit sie mit Scheinen werfen
Scheiß drauf, das war mal, ich heiz jetzt im Hummer
Von Freiburg nach Warszawa, wo ich Lines spuck für Para
Aber immernoch fick ich mein Kopf
Weil das Rotlicht nicht loslässt, check die Story
Warum man in weiter Stadt Zeit abmacht
Liegt daran, dass die Chayas hier Scheiß labern
Leyla sorgt für Hunni ohne Gummi
Ist begehrt bei Pezos, verkehrt in Ghettos
Klar wird mein Kollege Emo aktiv
Er posiert sie durch Moneten und Parties
Verkauft ihr Träume und redet vom Buis-
Zukunft, Liebe, der übliche Mist
Touchdown, Leyla beißt an und geht ackern
Tauris am Tag und die Scheine am flattern
Doch die Scheine flattern in Emo sein Tasche
Wenn Emo bock hat, kauft ihr Emo 'ne Tasche
Ah, kein Problem für Leyla
Wär nicht nur die Eifersucht, wenn Emo Weiber sucht
Von Weibern genug, kriegt Emo rieden
Er klebt an vielen Ärschen wie Hämorriden

Es geht schnell aus Nonne wird Nutte
Durch bisschen Schwanz bisschen labern mit Zunge
Pezos, passt auf, Schwesta macht schlau
Heutzutage wird das rote Licht schnell blau

Es geht schnell aus Nonne wird Nutte
Durch bisschen Schwanz bisschen labern mit Zunge
Pezos, passt auf, Schwesta macht schlau
Heutzutage wird das rote Licht schnell blau

Wie gesagt, Leyla kommt gar nicht klar
Sie will Emo für sich oder Emo kriegt nix
Also sagt sie, sie will noch mehr ackern
Strich, Puff, FKK, noch mehr Para
Sodass Emo keine brauch außer Leyla
Darum tickt sie jetzt im Puff auch noch Beyda
Para läuft und Emo verspricht Leyla
Nur mit ihr zusammen zu bleiben und sonst mit keiner
Leyla ist naiv, denkt, sie ist am Ziel
Doch nach drei Wochen guckt sie in sein Handy
SMS und Fotos von anderen Schlampen
Videos, wie er sie bumst und er zieht Grimassen
Das ist der Moment, an dem der Traum platzt
Plötzlich wird aus der Liebe nur reiner Hass
Sodass sie anfängt, bei Amcas zu singen
Er wird sie vergewaltigen und zum ackern zwingen
So ist das Leben

Warum reden die Frauen nicht?
Wovor haben sie Angst
Und wie funktioniert der Menschenhandel und wer profitiert?

Es geht schnell aus Nonne wird Nutte
Durch bisschen Schwanz bisschen labern mit Zunge
Pezos, passt auf, Schwesta macht schlau
Heutzutage wird das rote Licht schnell blau

Dazu hol ich für zwei Mille fünfzig Flex
Mach Null-Acht-Packs wo Null-Sieben drin steckt
Das macht hundertdreiundvierzig Packs je Fuffi

Mach ich locker Drei Gewinn, Kurwa, Hattrick

Die die Tür aufreißt, nen kleinen Kanack kickt
Und schreit, du Bastard-Kind, bring echtes Para mit

Will achtzig Packs, kocht es zu Crack
Gib mir schnell die Millen, der nächste Kunde kommt jetzt

Du willst aufhören zu ackern und rappen? 
Hast du dir das gut überlegt? Schwesta, tu mir das nicht an! 
Du weißt, neun Scheine am Tag. Garantie! 
Und das alles soll jetzt vorbei sein? 
Schwesta, wie soll ich leben? 
Du weißt, mein CL Brabus kostet sieben Scheine im Monat, Ratenzahlung. 
Was soll ich machen, Schwesta? 
Du bist mein bestes Pferdchen im Stall. 
Schwesta, und jetzt willst du einfach rappen? 
Verdient man da überhaupt richtig Geld, Schwesta?
Tu mir das nicht an! Nicht rappen, Schwesta. Bleib Nutte

Schwesta Ewa,"Das Rotlicht, dass im Mondlicht brennt
Keiner kennt es so, wie ich's kenn
Wenn ihr einschlaft, beginnen für uns die Tage
Mädchen warten vor der Tür auf der Straße
Sie war 17, von zu Hause abgehauen
Denn Mama schlug ihre Augen blau
Sieh, der Zuhälter, er hat Duldung seit 20 Jahren
Vater Staat sagt, dass er nicht arbeiten darf
Guck, der Häftling, er hat jemand umgebracht
Den, der sein Kind ohne Grund vergewaltigt hat
Und der Straßenmusikant im Rollstuhl, der im Milieu spielt
Was soll er tun?
Damals in der Jugend noch bei Eintracht gespielt
Heute querschnittsgelähmt, das ist teil dieses Spiels
Schicksale, zich male
So verbringt man hier seine Jahre

Unter all den Narben hört man es schlagen
Wir leben und es tut was es kann
Wir können alles haben, 
Nur die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehen, die Schatten nicht begraben
Können nur weitergehen

So ist das Leben, Nachtleben
Man will auf uns verabreden
Schwesta, wir befinden uns im ältesten Gewerbe
Ich weiß, ich bin Zeugin dieser Welten bis ich sterbe
Guck mal, dieser Kiffer, für den Geld einfach nichts ist
Horizontal, Schwesta, welch ein Business auf dem Schore
Junkie, er war mal ein Arzt
Auf den Tod seiner Frau kommt er aber nicht klar
Oder den Mafiosi der die menschen hier schützt, zur Polizei können sie nicht, Rotlicht
Schau mal, dieser Dealer
Ihm kamen ein paar Packs abhanden
Ruft sein Bruder aus Syrien durch Schlepperbanden
Denn sie fliehen vor dem Krieg, wie jeder vor uns
Einer stirbt, es ist Thema nur kurz, 
Denn es muss weitergehen
Brauchen essen auf dem Tisch, bis morgen Nacht
Wir treffen uns am Strich

Unter all den Narben hört man es schlagen
Wir leben und es tut was es kann
Wir können alles haben, 
Nur die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehen, die Schatten nicht begraben
Können nur weitergehen

An das Milieu, wo du eine Mille löst
Nichts ist echt, doch die Bilder sind schön
Alles Illusion, guck, der Freier bringt'n Blumenstrauß
Er denkt, ihn liebt diese Hure auch
Er kommt nicht drauf klar, dass seine Ex einen Neuen hat
Mitten in der Nacht und er läuft durch die Stadt
Guck, die Go-Go-Tänzerin, die ihr Studium finanziert
Mit ihrem Kopf war sie nie ganz hier
Und die Nutte, die ihr Para macht
Und schaut weil ihr kleiner Sohn eine Krankenkasse braucht
An alle, dies dazu zu sehen einfach leben wollen
Wir hatten lang genug nur die Nebenrollen
Was bedeutet ein Bildungsstand
Dass man nicht ne Mille haben will, auf der Bank
Der Rand der Gesellschaft, wo man anders sein Geld macht
Der Staatsanwaltschaft gefällt das

Unter all den Narben hört man es schlagen
Wir leben und es tut was es kann
Wir können alles haben, 
Nur die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehen, die Schatten nicht begraben
Können nur weitergehen",Spiegelreflex

Erst wenn ich dir MCM Tasche kauf

Neues Handy kriegst du auch, kein Thema
'Ne verschwenderische Frau, weiß jeder
Doch ist mir egal, sie gibt mir Anal
Wenn ich noch 'ne Woche lang, den Shit hier bezahl
Auch wenn 'ne Kurwa so viele Kerle hätte
Hol ich ihr die Uhr da und hol ihr die Perlenkette
Ich hab den Tunnelblick, ja, man, ich tunnel dich
Und wenn nicht, lass uns wenigstens was fummeln, Bitch
Die Caya ist schick, die Eier sind dick
Ich reib ihre Clit, alter, gleich wird gefickt

I know you're not a travelin' girl

Mary, you shouldn't let 'em make you mad
You hold the best you can
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man.

Cause I'd give everything i have
Forget all the things that bring me joy
If you could have one day
Pure and simply happiness
Until that moment comes
I'll be here where I've always been
I'm gonna be your friend
Until the day i die

Mary, you shouldn't let 'em make you mad
You hold the best you can
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man.

Scissor Sisters,"I left my heart in San Fransisco 
It's at some motherfucking disco 
The people there where dancin' on it 
And that's including Ms. Matronic 

Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
Of lovin' and a cheatin', the snake gon' bite 
I beg and I scream and I cuss and I cry 
If music is the victim then some am I 

Of your bad fun 
Money's all gone but you need some 
Lover's on the phone but the got none 
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 

I left my bag in Pasadena 
Where all them girls was doin' Tina 
Them bitches sure where crunked up on it 
I said I'd rather smoke some chronic 

Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gon' bite 
I beg and I scream and I cuss and I cry 
If music is the victim then so am I 

Of your bad fun 
Money's all gone but you need some 
Lover's on the phone but the got none 
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 

I left my man in Houston Texas 
Just before he finished breakfast 
He said; oh baby fry some more eggs 
But I was runnin' on my own two legs 

Hell if Jesus had the power than so do I 
To rise up from the dead and take up to the sky 
I'm bustin' for the money so I get by 
If music is the victim then so am I",Music Is the Victim
